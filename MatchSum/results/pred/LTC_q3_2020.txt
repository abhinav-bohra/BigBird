And we know they will valiantly face several months to come as some areas experience resurgence of cases and we enter the winter and flu season.
I would also like to quickly update you on the story we told you last quarter about Mary Daniel, the wife of an Alzheimer's patient at one of our communities.
Mary took a part-time dishwashing job so that she could spend time with her husband amid visitation restrictions.
Because the Governor of Florida recently eased COVID-related restrictions for senior housing and care visitation, Mary completed her professional dishwashing career and can now visit her husband at will, adhering to all proper safety protocols, of course.
The community Rosecastle at Deerwood, which is operated for us by ALG Senior, has maintained close ties with Mary.
We wish Mary and Steve nothing but the best.
