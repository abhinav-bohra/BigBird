These results will help drive our returns focused growth as we continue to expand our scale, while generating a higher return on equity.
Before I get into the highlights for the quarter and there are many, I want to address our shortfall in deliveries and revenues.
Disruptions to our supply chain intensified as the quarter progressed and along with municipal delays resulted in our build times extending by about two weeks sequentially.
This pushed many deliveries into our fourth quarter and will similarly delayed some fourth quarter deliveries into our 2022 first quarter.
We produced total revenues of $1.47 billion, up nearly 50% as compared to the prior year period and diluted earnings per share of $1.60.
We achieved an operating income margin of 12.1% excluding inventory related charges, which grew 250 basis points year-over-year, driving a 40% expansion in our profitability per unit to nearly 52,000.
In addition to these investments, we returned a significant amount of cash to stockholders through both our regular quarterly cash dividend and the repurchase of $188 million of our stock.
These repurchases will further enhance our return on equity in 2022 beyond this year's expected 20% level, especially when combined with our projected increase in scale to over $7 billion in revenue and higher operating and gross margins.
