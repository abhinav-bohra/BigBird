We hope you and your families are all well.
Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy.
Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations.
And John Rielly will then review our financial performance.
By investing only in high return low cost opportunities, we've built a differentiated portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets.
With Guyana as our growth engine and The Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as our cash engines.
More than 80% of this year's capital spend is allocated to Guyana, where our three sanctioned oil developments have breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel.
And to The Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI.
