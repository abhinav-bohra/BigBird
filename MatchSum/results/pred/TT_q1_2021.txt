While the pandemic continues to present significant challenges around the world, our strategy as a global climate innovator remains steadfast.
Our aggressive goals and bold actions can dramatically reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the world's progress.
We are committed to making a difference consistently, relentlessly and over the long term, our unwavering focus on innovation has been fundamental to our ability to drive market outgrowth and share gains in recent year and it continues to be a path forward for long term value creation.
At Trane Technologies, weve never built strategies around episodic investments which may increase for a year or two to driver growth and then slow in favor of margin or cash or any changing new priority.
Our approach is markedly different.
We remain confident in our ability to lead precisely because our investments are continuous and ongoing.
We delivered broad-based market outgrowth and share gains in each of our segments and business units, with total enterprise organic revenues up 11%, while at the same time delivering more than 400 basis points of margin expansion in every segment and for the enterprise as a whole.
We delivered double-digit bookings growth in all segments, growing our backlog over 30% sequentially versus December 2020 and up more than 30% versus our already strong backlog at the end of 2019 heading into 2020.
