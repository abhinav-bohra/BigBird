All of our plants around the world are operating and we are continuing to meet our customers' needs.
Despite the challenging conditions caused by COVID as well as the current year global supply chain pressures that have impacted raw material availability.
Our results for the second quarter were stronger than we expected.
This was primarily being driven by continued strong sales.
While sales volumes were down 3% from the first quarter, the first quarter was unusually strong as we believe some of our customers were replenishing their inventories.
If we compare our second quarter sales to the fourth quarter of 2020, which was another strong quarter for us, our current quarter sales volumes were up 4%.
I also want to point out that our ability to gain new pieces of the business and take market share also contributed to the strong performance as our analysis shows, we had total organic sales growth due to net share gains of approximately 4% in the second quarter of 2021 versus the second quarter of 2020.
So we continue to feel good about our ability to deliver on our historical performance of consistently growing 2% to 4% points above the market due to our share gains.
