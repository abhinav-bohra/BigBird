I'm joined today by Harp Rana, our chief financial officer.
Following our strong performance in the second half of last year, we carried forward the momentum into 2021.
In the first quarter, we generated record bottom-line results of 25.5 million of net income and $2.31 of diluted EPS.
Our growth initiatives helped to reduce our typical first-quarter seasonal liquidation and the impact of new stimulus payments, which in turn drove strong revenue performance.
Despite pressure from a combination of tax refunds and two stimulus payments in the quarter, our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $18 million, or 2%, over the prior-year period, and was down only $28 million, or 2.5%, quarter over quarter.
We originated $231 million of loans in the quarter, up 1% year over year and up 5% from the first quarter of 2019, with 29 million [Inaudible] originated loans derived from new growth initiatives.
However, we saw demand start to pick up in the latter part of April, and we expect demand to continue to rebound in May and June, which should enable us to generate modest loan growth in the second quarter.
We continue to believe that loan demand in the second half of the year will be strong as the economy more fully reopens.
