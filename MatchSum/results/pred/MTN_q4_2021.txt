Today's remarks also include certain non-GAAP financial measures.
So with that said, let's turn to our fiscal 2021 and fourth-quarter results.
Given the continued challenges associated with COVID-19, we are pleased with our operating results for the year.
Excluding Peak Resorts, total skier visitation at our U.S. destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas for fiscal 2021 was down only 6% compared to fiscal 2019.
and the resort closing earlier than expected on March 30, 2021, following a provincial health order issued by the government of British Columbia.
Whistler Blackcomb's total skier visitation for fiscal 2021 declined 51% compared to fiscal 2019.
Fourth-quarter results were also negatively impacted relative to our June 7, 2021, guidance by a one-time $13.2 million charge for a contingent obligation with respect to certain litigation matters.
I am pleased to be joining our earnings call today and look forward to speaking more regularly with our investors and analysts as we move toward the CEO transition on November 1.
