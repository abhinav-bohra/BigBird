On behalf of WESCO, I hope that all of you have been staying healthy and safe in these challenging times.
We prepared a very thorough update for you today.
So first for an update on our business in the second quarter.
Results exceeded our expectations across the board; that is for sales, operating margin, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow.
Business momentum improved through the quarter as we outperformed the market and built an all-time record backlog for the legacy WESCO business.
Importantly, sales improved sequentially each month, and we saw continued growth in our utility business.
Anixter also delivered a strong performance to close out the second quarter.
Now turning to Anixter.
