Our revenues are running well above the prior year and then the pandemic hit impacting our business overnight.
We quickly transitioned the majority of our employees to working from home and still closed over a million real estate transactions in 2020.
This accomplishment testifies to the dedication of our people and their commitment to our customers.
I'd now like to shift my comments to the fourth quarter results.
We generated earnings per share of $2.49.
Refinance revenue continued to benefit from low mortgage rates with revenue rising 79% over the prior year.
This decision required us to reverse this accrual and our Property and Casualty business is currently carried at tangible book value.
The ultimate proceeds we'll earn in the book transfer will be immaterial.
