Provident's third quarter results were strong, and we believe the business climate is promising as we look into Q4.
Earnings of $0.49 in the quarter exceeded last year's results by 32%.
The quarter was marked by growth in net interest income and a strong return on average assets of 1.11% and return on average tangible equity of 12.04%.
Based on their confidence in our earnings outlook, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.24 per share, representing an increase of 4.3%.
And during the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 630,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $22.04 per share.
Our capital position is strong and comfortably exceeds well capitalized levels.
In terms of pricing, the weighted average rate on our loan pipeline has increased, reflecting movement in the treasury curve.
The market remains aggressive and our lenders face competition on rates from banks and on structure from nonbanks.
