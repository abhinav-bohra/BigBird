Before I hand the call over to Kenneth, I will briefly review our financial results for the first quarter of 2021.
In the first quarter, we reported consolidated adjusted net income of 11 million, or $0.11 per share, up from 3 million, or $0.03 per share in the prior quarter.
We also generated total adjusted EBITDA of 202 million, up slightly from the previous quarter.
Compared to Q4, we recorded higher results in each of our entities, supported by our large portfolio of long-term contracts in our gas shipping business, higher spot tanker rates in our oil shipping business, and higher revenues from our marine services business in Australia.
All of this despite the continued weakness in the spot conventional tanker market.
Looking ahead, we are expecting the second quarter to be lower than the first quarter, mainly due to a heavy dry dock schedule in both our gas and tanker fleets, certain non-recurring items in the first quarter and the recent expiration of fixed rate charters in our tanker fleet that were locked in last year at higher rates.
Since reporting earnings in February, we have made significant positive progress toward the strategic objective of winding down our FPSO segment, which we expect will result in a material reduction in our total asset retirement obligations in the second quarter.
With respect to the recycling of the Banff, our Q1 cost came in lower than expected as the repositioning of the unit to its recycling yard was delayed while awaiting regulatory approvals.
