Florida seemed to be in -- caught up in it more than probably any other state.
I'm happy to report three months into it now, Delta seems fairly in the rearview mirror.
I think they have come down to even lower than they were three months back.
So we're happy about that.
But what we were most happy about is also that does not actually have the same kind of impact that previous surges have had on the economy.
I think the economy is learning to deliver these surges at when they happen.
Net charge-offs annualized was 19 basis points.
Last year, I think we were at about 26 basis points.
