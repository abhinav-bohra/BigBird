Volumes on our system and our outlook for the year continues to improve, supporting the increase to our financial guidance which we announced yesterday.
Even without the weather-related earnings impact in the first quarter, our base business earnings increased compared with the fourth quarter.
But while the quarter's results were positive, Winter Storm Uri did provide us with significant operational challenges that I want to highlight.
Our employees' preparation before the extreme weather event and hard work during it enabled us to operate with very few interruptions.
Operations teams ensured our assets were weatherized for extreme conditions, and that our employees were on-site and prepared to make the necessary adjustments to keep our assets running.
Many of our employees were faced with challenges of their own, including limited or no heat, running water or electricity at their own homes, but still worked to help ONEOK provide essential natural gas and NGLs when needed most.
The opportunities available to us are from a robust drilled but uncompleted well inventory, increased natural gas capture and rising gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin and increasing ethane demand.
The opportunity for earnings growth without the need for significant investment is unique to ONEOK and our strategic assets in key operating areas.
