Joining us for today's call are Jerry Grisko, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ware Grove, Chief Financial Officer.
We experienced growth in total revenue, same unit revenue, earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2021.
These results provide important momentum for the remainder of the year.
Our results demonstrate the fundamental attributes of our business model that I've emphasized throughout the past year.
These characteristics continue to enable our positive performance during both favorable and less favorable business conditions.
These attributes include the proportion, representing approximately 70% of our revenue that comes from essential and recurring services, including our tax services, insurance services, payroll services and a host of others that our clients rely on us to provide regardless of business conditions.
Within our Financial Services group, we continue to experience very strong demand for our core services, including many of the compliance-related services that are weighted more heavily toward the first quarter of each year.
This year, the IRS tax filing deadline was extended to May 15, so a portion of our tax compliance revenue work will extend beyond the traditional mid-April time frame.
