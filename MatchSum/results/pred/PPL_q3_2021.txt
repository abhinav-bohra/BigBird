I'll also share some current initiatives underway to advance PPL's clean energy strategy and provide a brief operational and regulatory update.
Joe will then provide a financial update, including a detailed review of third quarter financial results.
Turning to Slide 4.
We continue to make excellent progress on our key initiatives to strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth and success.
In September, we received FERC approval for our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric.
With FERC's approval, we now have four of the five approvals necessary to close on the transaction.
We continue to make progress on securing the final approval from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers.
And all three labor unions have ratified their new contracts that will be effective under PPL's ownership.
