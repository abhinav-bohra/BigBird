Our ARR growth accelerated to 131% year over year in the third quarter, our third consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth.
The demand environment remains incredibly strong.
Before digging deeper into the details of our quarterly performance and results, I'd like to share some perspectives on the cybersecurity landscape.
I'd encourage you all to also look at our shareholder letter we have on our Investor Relations website, which provides a lot more detail.
We further strengthened our leadership team with the appointment of Rob Salvagno to lead Corporate Development.
As we consider acquisitions, we evaluate prospects that align with our product, customer, and strategic market opportunities.
We've grown rapidly in the past year, and our number of employees has gone from 600 to about 1,100.
