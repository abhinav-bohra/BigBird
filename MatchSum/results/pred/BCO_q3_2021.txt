Today we reported third quarter results above the guidance we provided in September with double-digit increases in revenue, profits, and earnings per share.
Importantly, despite slower-than-expected revenue recovery from the pandemic lows, third quarter revenue versus pre-COVID levels did grow sequentially over the second quarter.
And despite other operational issues that impacted the quarter including labor shortages and wage inflation in the US that is not yet been offset by price increases that have been enacted, operating profit margin improved by 50 basis points to 10.8%.
With continued revenue and margin improvement, this position is as well for 2022 and the future.
We are affirming our four-year 2021 guidance, which includes revenue in the range between $4.1 billion and $4.2 billion, with a bias to the higher end of the range due to the strong third quarter results.
Operating profit of approximately $465 million, which reflects a margin increase of close to 100 basis points versus prior year.
As a reference point, at 100% of the adjusted pre-COVID revenue level, we would expect 2022 adjusted EBITDA to be about $755 million.
And we'd expect continued margin and growth and margin leverage as revenue grows above this pre-COVID levels, which would support our initial 2022 targets as we've provided.
