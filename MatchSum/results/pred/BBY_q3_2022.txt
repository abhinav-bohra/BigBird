Today, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to two years ago.
We continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook, and connect at home.
And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year.
From a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater, and mobile phones.
Product availability continued to improve throughout quarter.
We have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming, and mobile phones.
In addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process.
We have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different.
