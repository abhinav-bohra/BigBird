With both businesses outperforming, we delivered robust earnings and cash flow and expect continued strong performance moving forward.
Regarding the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, even with continuing COVID challenges, we posted consolidated revenues of 681 million with CooperVision revenues of 507 million, up 1%, and CooperSurgical revenues of 174 million, up 7%.
Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.17.
By geography, the Americas grew 6% led by strength in Biofinity and daily silicones, including nice growth from both Clariti and MyDay.
EMEA was down 4% as several countries continued managing through stringent COVID-related restrictions.
We did see growth in our daily silicones and Biofinity, though, so that bodes well for the future.
Overall, dailies silicones are leading the market right now as health and wellness trends drive adoption, and we believe that will continue as there's still 2.4 billion in annual global sales of older hydrogels that need to be traded up.
Moving to our FRP portfolio.
