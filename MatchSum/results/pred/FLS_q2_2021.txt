We are pleased with the performance and solid results in the second quarter, including adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, which represents a 32% sequential improvement and reflects our continued transformation progress.
We were encouraged by our bookings of $953 million, which is nearly an 18% year-over-year improvement.
At this level, Q2 was a momentum-building quarter for Flowserve, as our bookings inflected upward and we now have clear line of sight to earnings growth.
Our revised adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $1.45 to $1.65 for 2021.
Since the start of the pandemic, we indicated that recovery in our end markets was expected to be directly correlated with the progress being made with COVID-19.
Each country and geography are at different stages in fighting the pandemic.
But on a global basis, a clear pattern has emerged as countries roll out vaccines, COVID cases decline dramatically and then mobility and consumption begin to improve.
Additionally, our distribution partners are just now beginning to replenish their inventory levels.
