With those cautions, I will hand the call over to Mike.
For the quarter, constant currency organic revenue increased 12%, with growth across all segments.
Growth was driven by organic volume as well as 130 basis points of price.
To assist you with your modeling, I will share some color on the acquisition revenue contribution within the Healthcare segment.
Of the approximately $220 million in acquired revenue, about 65% is consumable revenue from both Key and Cantel Medical, about 20% of the balance is capital equipment revenue, with the last 15% being service revenue.
Gross margin for the quarter increased 120 basis points compared to the prior year to 46.2%, as favorable productivity, pricing and acquisitions were somewhat offset by higher material and labor costs.
Net income in the quarter increased to $200.3 million and earnings per share were $1.99.
Our balance sheet continues to be a source of strength for the company.
