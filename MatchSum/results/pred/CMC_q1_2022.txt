I'm pleased to report that CMC's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings were the best in our company's 106-year history.
Earnings from continuing operations were 232.9 million or $1.90 per diluted share on net sales of 2 billion.
Excluding the impact of a tax benefit related to an international reorganization, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 199.2 million or $1.62 per diluted share.
CMC generated core EBITDA of 326.8 million, an increase of 109% from the year-ago period and an improvement of 28% from the prior quarter.
This was the third consecutive quarter in which our company has reported record bottom-line earnings, core EBITDA, and segment-level EBITDA.
These achievements are a result of the execution of our strategic plans presented to shareholders during our virtual investor day in August of 2020.
We are certainly proud of CMC's record financial results delivered by strong execution of our strategic initiatives, as well as solid market fundamentals.
