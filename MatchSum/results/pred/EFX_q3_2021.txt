Also, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings per share attributable to Equifax, and adjusted EBITDA, which will be adjusted for certain items that affect the comparability of our underlying operational performance.
We had a very strong third quarter and first nine months of 2021, a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of $1.223 billion, which was up over 14% with core non-mortgage market and non-UC ERC claims revenue growth of 20%.
We are executing extremely well against the critical priorities of our EFX2023 strategy, as we highlighted on Slide 4.
Our focus on leveraging the new Equifax cloud for innovation, new products and growth is clearly driving our strong financial results.
Our revenue growth has accelerated from 3% in 2019 as we were recovering from the 2017 cyber event and investing heavily in our EFX cloud transformation to 17% last year.
We are on track to deliver 19% core growth this year at the midpoint of our revised 2021 guidance.
Revenue at $1.22 billion was up 14.5% with organic constant currency growth of a strong 12%.
