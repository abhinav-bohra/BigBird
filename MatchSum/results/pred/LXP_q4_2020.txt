Executive Vice Presidents Lara Johnson and James Dudley will be available during the Q&A portion of our call.
2020 was an outstanding year for Lexington and our fourth quarter results were excellent across all our business lines.
In the fourth quarter, we generated adjusted company funds from operations of $0.19 per diluted common share to end the year at $0.76 per diluted common share, the high end of our guidance range.
Following a robust quarter of $182 million of industrial purchases and $292 million of sales, our industrial exposure increased to 91% of our gross real estate assets excluding held for sale assets.
Also during the quarter, leasing volume was healthy at 1.7 million square feet, consolidated same-store NOI was up 1.6% and industrial cash renewal rents increased 3.4% with overall fourth quarter cash renewal rents down roughly 2.5%, due to office lease renewal roll downs.
We recently announced a dividend increase of 2.4%, supported by our positive results throughout the year, which equates to an annualized dividend of $0.43 per common share.
Our plan is to continue growing our dividend annually.
While we expect to be active in the purchase market, we intend to allocate more capital to development opportunities in 2021 relative to 2020.
