Comparing to a non-COVID impact quarter our second quarter FFO per share was 53% greater than the second quarter of 2019.
This outperformance, along with a positive outlook for the third and fourth quarters once again led us to raise our core 2021 FFO guidance range by $0.31 at the midpoint to $6.25 to $6.37 per share.
Complementing our operational performance was Sun's well received inaugural unsecured bond issuance, following our investment grade rating from S&P and Moody's.
We issued $600 million of senior notes in an oversubscribed offering in mid June.
Sun' access to the bond market provides us with enhanced financial flexibility to most efficiently match fund our investment activities.
With a healthy pipeline of internal and external growth opportunities we believe this was the right time for the step and we'll look to continue enhancing our credit metrics over time for improved ratings.
For the quarter, same community NOI grew 21.6% over last year, reflecting the continued demand in each of our segments and our favorable strategic positioning to capture that demand.
This brings year-to-date acquisition volume to over $853 million across 28 properties.
