On a consolidated basis, the company reported net sales for the third quarter of $457 million and adjusted EBITDA of $77 million, which represents growth of approximately 3% and 145% respectively over the third quarter of last year.
Our tissue business drove results with both higher sales and production volumes, to meet elevated demand.
Lower input costs, particularly in pulp were also a tailwind on a year-over-year basis.
Our service levels in tissue started to recover to pre-COVID levels, as we continued to work with customers to fulfill orders and replenish inventory levels.
Our paperboard business continue to deliver stable performance, managing through uneven end-market segments with solid execution.
Our current backlogs are in line with previous years and we successfully launched ReMagine folding carton brand, offering recycled content in SBS Board.
In the third quarter, we used the free cash flows generated to reduce our net debt by an additional $40 million and we refinanced our 2023 notes with a new 2028 notes.
I will now share what we saw from both the tissue and paperboard businesses in the third quarter.
