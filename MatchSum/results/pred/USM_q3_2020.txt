In terms of our upcoming IR schedule, Slide 3, we will be virtually attending the Raymond James SMID Cap Company Showcase virtually on November 12th and 13th, and we are attending the UBS Global TMT Conference virtually on December 8th and our open-door policy is now more of an open phone or open video policy, so please reach out to us if we can arrange something.
Before turning the call over, I do want to remind everyone that due to the FCC's Anti-Collusion Rules related to the RDOF Auction and Auction 107, we will not be responding to any questions related to FCC Auctions.
I'm going to make some brief comments about the balance sheet and our liquidity position.
Over the years, we have worked to retain relatively low leverage levels, long-dated debt maturities, sufficient undrawn revolving credit facilities and significant cash balances, while at the same time making sure that we have the financial resources we need to fund our businesses.
As you can see on Slide 4, on September 30 TDS continued to have a strong financial position including $2.2 billion in immediately available funding sources consisting of cash and cash equivalents, available credit facilities, undrawn term loans and undrawn portions of our EIP securitization facility.
In the quarter, UScellular took advantage of favorable market conditions and issued $500 million of 6.25% retail senior notes due in 2069.
In sum, we are in a very strong position to invest in the growth opportunities identified by both of our businesses.
It's kind of hard to believe but I've been on the job for four months already and I'm really looking forward to providing all of you with a brief update on the progress we've made over that time.
