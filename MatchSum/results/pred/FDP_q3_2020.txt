These challenges continued to hamper our ability to achieve our financial targets for the third quarter.
Net sales for the quarter were $990 million compared with $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2019.
We reported adjusted gross profit of $69 million compared with $76 million in the third quarter of 2019, with gross profit margin improvements in our fresh and value-added products segments.
Due to the early actions we took by adjusting our business in response to these challenges, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.35 compared with adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 in the third quarter of 2019.

This important sustainability initiative reduces our carbon footprint and brings us closer to our 2025 commitment to reduce emissions by 10%.
Also during the quarter, we continued our efforts to diversify our product line and the channels we market our products in with the launch of our newest product, the pink glow Del Monte pineapple.
