Management's statements may include non-GAAP financial measures.
The U.S. drilling rig count in the third quarter was down over 70% from the previous year and 35% from the second quarter 2020 to the lowest levels on record.
Despite this collapse, Forum was able to limit our revenue decline to just 9% sequentially as our revenue from outside North America was up 14%.
Also, we were able to improve our EBITDA through further cost cuts and efficiencies and generate positive free cash flow.
It is important to note that Forum's operating results are directly related to the level of oil service drilling and completion activity.
We believe the third quarter was clearly the bottom in oil service activity and drilling and completions activity are now rebounding.
Our cash costs, excluding our materials costs, are down almost 50% over this period as we have significantly reduced our overhead expense.
I am also pleased with the progress on our debt structure and our liquidity position.
