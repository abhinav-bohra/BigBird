I'm going to start off by sharing a few thoughts about the overall business before Jason takes us through our results and our outlook.
First, Q3 results highlight the continued strong demand we're seeing across the business.
We grew revenue 13%, earnings per share 21% and expanded operating margins by 150 basis Additionally, we ended the quarter with a record Q3 backlog of $11.4 billion, up 7% from last year.
Second, we saw strong growth in all three technologies during the quarter.
In LMR, revenue was up 11% while navigating a very challenging supply chain environment and video security and access control revenue was up 26%, driven by strong broad-based demand for both our fixed and mobile video offerings.
And in Command Center Software revenue was up 13% as we continue to expand within our existing installed base and win new customers.
The increase was primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margins and improved operating leverage as well as a loss related to the refinancing of long-term debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2020.
Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 compared to $1.95 last year, primarily due to higher sales, higher gross margin and improved operating leverage again in both segments.
