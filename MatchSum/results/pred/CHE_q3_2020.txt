Kevin McNamara, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed Corporation; Dave Williams, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Chemed; and Nick Westfall, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chemed's VITAS Healthcare Corporation subsidiary.
I will begin with highlights for the quarter, and Dave and Nick will follow-up with additional operating detail.
When we reported our second quarter 2020 operating results, I noted that the pandemic and related economic lockdown severely impacted our April 2020 operating results.
Since April, both VITAS and Roto-Rooter have reengineered their operating procedures to safely care for our patients and customers during the pandemic.
These operational changes have allowed Chemed to generate sequential operational improvement starting in May 2020, and this improvement has continued and has, in fact, accelerated throughout the third quarter and continued into October.
David will provide updated earning guidance later in the call.
Fortunately, the federal government, specifically HHS and CMS have been exceptionally supportive in terms of relaxing regulations, allowing the use of telehealth where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our 19,000 patient census.
We anticipate admissions to normalize when these types of facilities return to their pre-COVID occupancy levels.
