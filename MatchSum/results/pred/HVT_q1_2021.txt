We're very pleased with the results of the first quarter and I'm encouraged with the continuing momentum that we're seeing with increased written sales, higher traffic and higher closing rates and average tickets.
Even though our undelivered backlog is up almost 4 times last year, our current incoming orders are continuing at the elevated pace we have seen since January.
We have not seen a slowing of orders or significantly higher cancellation rates even with the longer wait times for furniture.
While we do not know how long we will see these dramatic increases in incoming orders, we believe that the importance and the value of the home has risen dramatically in the past year.
We believe this trend will continue for 2021 because of the large backlog of orders, the very strong housing market, the government cash subsidies and the increased demand for furniture and other home related products.
We also believe that the elevated importance of home is a longer-term sustainable trend in America.
Our supply merchandising and distribution teams have been tirelessly working with our suppliers and shippers to bring in the product to fill orders and reduce our record backlog.
We'll be sharing more on the campaign early next month.
