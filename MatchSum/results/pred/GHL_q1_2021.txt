Or a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.
We reported first quarter revenue of $68.9 million, operating profit of $7.2 million and net income per share of $0.09.
Our quarterly revenue was 3% higher than last year and our operating profit and earnings per share compared to a loss last year.
Given that this quarter followed one where we had our best quarterly revenue ever, we see these as respectable results that mark a solid start to the year.
We are also pleased that after quarter end, we further accelerated the pay down of our debt and that we have made good progress toward our recruiting goals.
I will now comment very briefly on our operations as we continue through the pandemic, then on the state of each of our businesses, then speak on each of our key financial metrics.
As I've said in each recent quarterly call, our firm has operated well throughout the pandemic.
Turning to our businesses.
