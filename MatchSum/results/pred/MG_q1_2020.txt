They are continuing to deliver outstanding services which is helping our clients best manage through these unprecedented times, all the while positioning Mistras to emerge from this global pandemic stronger and better prepared to further our industry leadership.
In the first quarter, we posted solid operating results with revenues better than forecasted and our asset-light business model has continued to generate positive cash flow for which we have become well-known.
We have achieved this despite a quarter that experienced the dual impacts of a weak energy market continuing from late last year and the global pandemic that began to take root toward the end of the first quarter.
As it became clear that we were entering a period of incredible uncertainty, we took immediate action to adjust to these new realities.
So we doubled down our efforts to provide our customers with the high quality of service in which they have come to rely upon from Mistras.
We found innovative new uses for our technology.
I and other members of the executive team along with nearly all salaried employees have taken pay cuts and our Board has also forgone some of their compensation.
Additionally, we have made adjustments to our variable headcount and broadly rationalize our assets to align with anticipated future levels of activity.
