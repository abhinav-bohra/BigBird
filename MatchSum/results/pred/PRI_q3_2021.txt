Our strong results continue to reflect our ability to adapt to the changing business environment.
These last 18 months are a perfect example of the balance and resilience of our business model.
I'm proud how quickly our sales force is adapted to a combination of virtual and in-person client interactions to continue serving middle-income families when they need us most.
Over the same 18 months, we've delivered on our strategic goal of expanding our product offerings.
We moved from pilot to full rollout of the new mortgage business, which continues to grow as we gain experience.
We also launched our senior health referral program during the third quarter, further rounding out a balanced product platform to help clients through every financial step of their life journey.
Starting on Slide 3, adjusted operating revenues of $692 million increased 22% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and diluted adjusted operating income per share of $2.98 increased 7%.
These results include an adjusted net operating loss of $4.6 million or $0.12 per diluted adjusted operating earnings per share for our newly acquired interest in e-TeleQuote.
