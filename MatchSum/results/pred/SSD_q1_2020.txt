I'm pleased to discuss our results with you today.
We delivered a solid first quarter, operationally and financially.
Sales of $283.7 million increased 9.4% over the first quarter of 2019 and were driven by higher sales volume in North America.
Sales volumes increased primarily due to milder weather conditions in our key markets compared to a year ago which was an unusually cold and wet winter.
Sales were partially offset by weaker conditions in Europe, which was impacted by the COVID-19 beginning in mid-March.
Our gross profit margin was strong at 45.7%, an improvement of 320 basis points year-over-year.
This was largely due to sales mix and decreased material costs.
However, two of our larger European operation in the United Kingdom and France were ordered to cease nearly all operations in late March, forcing us to temporarily furlough many of those affected employees.
