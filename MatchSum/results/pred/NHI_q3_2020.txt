To date, our operators have held up relatively well, as occupancy declines generally slowed in the third quarter aided by a pickup in move-ins and the leveling-off of COVID-related expenses.
We collected nearly 97% of rents in the quarter and nearly 98% in October.
In the third quarter and for the year to date, we reported AFFO per share growth of 1.5% and 4.5% respectively.
It should also be noted that we were tracking on the lower end of the range for the first nine months of 2020 in terms of our numbers, formerly known as guidance.
Depending on the timing and effectiveness of the vaccine, we expect the impact of the pandemic to be more uneven across our property types, as winter approaches.
Thus far, our entrance fee communities and skilled nursing properties, which together generate over 50% of our revenue, have been quite resilient.
We are also continuing to work with prospective lenders and Bickford on the previously disclosed sale of nine properties, which we estimate will improve Bickford's annual cash flow by approximately $3 million.
Bickford has applied for grants under Phase 2 and 3 of the Provider Relief Fund, which we expect that they will receive before year-end, which will also improve their financial position.
