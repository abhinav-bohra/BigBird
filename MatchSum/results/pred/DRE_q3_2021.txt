We now have had three successive quarters of demand at or near all-time records, and projected market level rent growth has risen from the 10% range to the mid-teens percent nationally and in some submarkets as high as 35%.
During the quarter, we began roughly $350 million of new developments with expected strong value creation and IRRs, and we raised our full year guidance on starts once again.
Cap rate compression and rent growth continued to outpace material cost increases, allowing us to drive improved margins.
The margins on our development pipeline are now over 60%, and our core portfolio achieved record rent growth of 22% on a cash basis from second-generation leasing activity.
These quarterly results and our improved outlook for the balance of the year resulted in our raising key components of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to be at 13.8% and growth in AFFO per share of 11.6%.
Based on these results and our optimism about the balance of the year, we have raised the dividend by almost 10%.
CBRE now projects demand for the full year in the mid-300 million-square-foot range and likely to break the all-time 2016 record of 327 million square feet.
