During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives.
These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories.
During the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a non-cash impairment of $582 million that reflected our expectation for reduced profitability from our Houston refinery.
I'm pleased to join for my 28th and last earnings call as CEO of LyondellBasell.
Per our usual practice, we will review our results from the quarter.
As I prepare to leave the company at the end of the year, I've taken some time to reflect on the strong company we have built and our outlook for the future.
LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from robust global demand and tight market conditions.
In the third quarter, our company delivered $5.25 per share of earnings, more than 4 times higher than the same quarter last year.
