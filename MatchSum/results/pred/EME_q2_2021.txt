We reported our second quarter 2020 numbers, we were in the throes of a pandemic with no clear end in sight.
We had a very strong operating quarter with revenues of $2.44 billion, operating income of $133 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.78.
We maintained strong operating income margins of 5.5% and had revenue growth of 21% overall with 18% organic revenue growth.
It is important to remember that in second quarter 2020, we had several of our key geographic markets either shut down or partially shut down.
This revenue growth resulted in a sizable investment in working capital this quarter, leading to a more typical cash flow pattern for us than the prior year, during which we were liquidating our balance sheet due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns and customer site restrictions.
Regardless of the unusual factors impacting our comparison against last year, we had a very strong quarter.
We had broad-based growth across our trade offerings end market sectors and across our geographic footprint.
We had especially strong growth within the commercial, and that's really across commercial but data centers and logistical infrastructure drove that and healthcare market sectors.
