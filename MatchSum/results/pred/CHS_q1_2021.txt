The strong Q1 performance across all three brands was fueled by our significant improvement in product and marketing.
Our momentum started in Q4 2019, temporarily stalled by the pandemic, is now back on track to deliver meaningful growth in the years to come.
Total first-quarter sales grew 38% over last year, spurred by Soma's extraordinary sales growth of 65%, as well as fantastic customer response to Chico's and White House Black Market, which drove 31% growth in our apparel brand.
We delivered meaningful year-over-year gross margin and SG&A rates improvement, and our balance sheet is strong with ample cash and liquidity and strategically lean inventories.
We drove a much higher gross margin by dramatically reducing the number of promotional days.
Not only did Soma post a 65% sales growth over last year's first quarter, but comparable sales also grew a remarkable 39% over the first quarter of 2019.
This year, we meaningfully expanded our margin rate as a result of disciplined inventory control, strategically reduced promotions, and more full-price selling.
SG&A expenses for the first quarter total $134 million, just a modest uptick from the first quarter last year but our stores were closed for approximately half of the quarter.
