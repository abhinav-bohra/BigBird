Today the 737 MAX is certified in the U.S., U.K., Europe and many other parts of the world.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant global impact.
The aviation industry saw more than 19,000 aircraft grounded and air traffic down more than 95% at the worst point last April.
We continue to see encouraging news on the return to commercial air travel with domestic routes, primarily flown by narrow-body aircraft leading the way.
In the U.S., the TSA checkpoint travel numbers have been consistently staying above the 1 million mark since early March and more recently, we have seen many days above 1.5 million travelers, including 1.6 million travelers last Sunday.
International air traffic demand still remains at relatively low levels versus pre-pandemic times and is expected to take longer to recover.
The revenue decrease was primarily due to lower body rates which have been under pressure due to the reduced international air traffic resulting from the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In addition, our A320 production rate was lower in the first quarter of this year compared to last year.
