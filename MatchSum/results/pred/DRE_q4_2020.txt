Let me start by saying that 2020 was another outstanding year for Duke Realty.
Even amid the global pandemic and a major US recession, we exceeded all of our 2020 goals, including our original pre-pandemic operating and financial guidance metrics.
We also capped off the year with fourth quarter leasing volume being the strongest quarter of the year, and just after quarter end, executed a significant debt transaction to bolster our balance sheet, which sets us up for a great start to 2021.
Let me recap the highlights of our outstanding year.
We signed nearly 21 million square feet of leases, we maintained the occupancy of our stabilized portfolio between 97% and 98% throughout the year, and our total portfolio which includes our under development pipeline ended the year at 96% leased, the highest level we've ever achieved.
We renewed 70% of our leases for 83% when including immediate backfills and attained 29% GAAP rent growth and 14% cash rent growth on second generation leases throughout the year.
We increased our annual common dividend by 9.1%.
And finally, we've continued to run our Company in the most responsible manner with our ESG culture and numerous ESG achievements.
