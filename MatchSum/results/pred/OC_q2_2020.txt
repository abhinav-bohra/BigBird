I will start with safety and our second quarter results.
An unconditional commitment to safety has long been our guiding principle at Owens Corning, and this has served us well to address the challenges of COVID-19.
In the quarter, our recordable incident rate was 0.69, a slight improvement compared with the second quarter of 2019.
Over the past several months, our executive team and dedicated COVID-19 response team have worked with our global enterprise to ensure our operations remain safe and effective for our employees, their families and other key stakeholders.
We remain vigilant in our use of personal protective equipment, health screenings, robust cleaning procedures, restrictions on business travel and work-from-home options as we actively monitor local health conditions and update our operating protocols as risk levels change.
I would like to now move to our financial performance in the quarter.
Through the strength of our market-leading businesses, innovative product and process technologies and unique enterprise capabilities, the company delivered financial results better than what we outlined during our last earnings call as we capitalize on a faster recovery in residential end markets, particularly in the U.S., improved manufacturing leverage and strong cost controls.
I remain confident that by managing these four priorities well, we will continue to deliver strong performance for the remainder of this year and position the company well for 2021.
