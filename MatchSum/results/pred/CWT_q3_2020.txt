So, a pretty exciting quarter here for us at California Water Service Group.
We get to talk quite a bit about our California General Rate Case and some of the other things that are going on in the quarter.
And I'm going to begin on Slide 6, which is a slide about the recognition of the 2018 California General Rate Case.
So, as most everyone knows at this point, on October 14, the California Public Utilities Commission published a proposed decision in our California GRC, that's a delayed GRC that should have been effective on January 1, 2020 and the proposed decision approved the settlement that we had announced back in October of 2019.
And for the first two quarters of the year, we had been reluctant to record regulatory assets for some of our continuing balancing account mechanisms, such as the WRAM and the MCBA decoupling mechanism, as well as our pension and medical cost balancing accounts, because those accounts we did not know whether they were probable for recovery.
We have concluded, based upon the proposed decision and a couple of things subsequent to that, that the GRC decision is very probable to award us those accounts on a continuing basis.
And that is, that on Tuesday, among other things that happened on Tuesday in the United States, the the Cal PA, the Public Advocates Office issued their comments on the proposed decision.
And while they gave extensive comments on a variety of areas, they did not comment on the three major areas that we're recovering here.
