Today, we reported our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results and issued our final guidance for 2021.
During the fourth quarter, our operating divisions continue to face challenges associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Over the course of the pandemic, we experienced a decline in overall occupancy levels at several of our federal facilities.
Due to the decline in the overall federal population, we have previously announced that the Federal Bureau of Prisons had decided not to renew three of our BOP contracts that are scheduled to expire during the first quarter of 2021.
More recently, the president issued an executive order directing the attorney general to not renew DOJ contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities.
While we continue to monitor the scope and implementation timeline for this order, we have assumed that it could result in additional nonrenewals of our BOP contracts in 2021 and coming years and we have incorporated this assumption into our guidance.
Marshals Service, which is also under the U.S. Department of Justice, does not own and operate its facilities.
Our frontline employees remain focused on providing high quality services inhumane care for all those entrusted to us.
