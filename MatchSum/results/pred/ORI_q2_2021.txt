So I'll kick things off here.
Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total net premium and fees increased to just under $2 billion, up almost 30%, pre-tax operating income increased to $275 million, and that's up 80% and the consolidated combined ratio improved to 90.6%, a 5.5 percentage point improvement.
Again, comparing to the second quarter of '20, General Insurance saw growth return with net written premium increasing by 13% and in Title Insurance we grew net premiums and fees earned by 57%.
So with that introduction, I'll now turn the discussion over to Frank, to discuss some of the per share figures along with our investment portfolio, and then he'll turn things back to me to cover General Insurance, and that'll be followed by Carolyn, who will discuss Title Insurance, and then of course, we'll open it up to Q&A after that.
So Frank, I hand it over to you.
For the first six months of this year net operating income was $427 million, which was up 61%.
The fair value of the equity portfolio improved by another $120 million during the quarter and ended with an unrealized gain of nearly $1.3 billion.
Net investment income decreased slightly for the quarter and almost 5% year-to-date, as the impact of lower yield on new investment purchases more than offset a modest increase in the average investment base.
