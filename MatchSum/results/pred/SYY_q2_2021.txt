I will provide an update on our business transformation and I'll share some highlights of our preparation for the pending business environment recovery.
As we have discussed during prior calls, Sysco has taken swift and decisive action throughout the pandemic to help our customers succeed during a time of disruption.
We have carefully managed our associate productivity, inventory productivity, and business investments.
To that end, we initiated a bold business transformation to strategically transform our company for long-term success.
I am pleased to confirm that our business transformation remains on track and we are confident that the strategic initiatives will enable profitable future growth and will differentiate Sysco from our competitors.
The COVID environment has placed substantial restrictions upon the customers we serve in the food-away-from-home sector and has disrupted our marketplace.
I am pleased to report that during the second quarter Sysco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the early progress of our transformation and the success we're having in winning new business, We continue to win meaningful business in the national account space and signed an incremental $200 million of net new business in the quarter, which totals more than $1.5 billion of net new contracted business since the start of the pandemic.
Additionally, throughout the second quarter, we began making investments in preparation for the business recovery that we believe will begin in calendar year 2021.
