A great deal has changed in the world with the COVID-19 pandemic since our last quarter's conference call.
All of our 34 plants around the world are operating and we are meeting our customers' needs.
In our last conference call, we knew China was being impacted by COVID-19, which really started impacting us in February.
But in the second half of March, we began experiencing impacts everywhere around the world.
And toward the end of March, many of our customers had significantly reduced production or shut down altogether, especially in the automotive sector.
Concerning gross margins, you may recall from our comments in the past that the combined gross margins of Quaker Houghton were expected to be about 1% lower than stand-alone Quaker.
In the first quarter comparison, you can see this difference is only 0.5 percentage point.
