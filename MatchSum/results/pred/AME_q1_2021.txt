We returned to organic sales growth earlier than expected.
And as the economy continues its recovery, we are experiencing strong orders growth resulting in a record backlog.
Operationally, our businesses are performing at a high level, delivering impressive margin expansion and strong cash flows.
Additionally, we started the year with a notable level of acquisition activity, deploying a record $1.85 billion on five acquisitions thus far in 2021.
These acquisitions combined with our strong first quarter results and solid orders momentum led us to substantially increase our full year sales and earnings guidance.
We are encouraged by the strong orders as many of our businesses are seeing improved demand conditions across our markets, while some of our longer cycle businesses have yet to return to growth.
Operating income in the quarter was $293 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2020.
