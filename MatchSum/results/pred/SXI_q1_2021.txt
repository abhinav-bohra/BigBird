Finally, I will conclude with comments on our outlook and key takeaways.
Consolidated revenue increased 8.5% sequentially.
This is ahead of the outlook we provided previously of fiscal first quarter 2021 revenue being flat to slightly above the fourth quarter of 2020.
At the Electronics segment, revenue increased 23% sequentially and 18.6% year-on-year, reflecting positive trends in magnetics as well as contribution from the recent Renco acquisition.
Sequentially, Engraving operating margin increased 800 basis points to 16.1% due to cost efficiency and productivity initiatives on 15.1% revenue growth compared to fiscal fourth quarter 2020.
Finally, the Scientific segment reported its highest quarterly sales ever at $16.7 million.
We are on track to deliver over $7 million in savings in fiscal 2021 from the actions we announced in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.
We also began to implement tax savings initiatives in the quarter, including optimizing our foreign tax credits.
