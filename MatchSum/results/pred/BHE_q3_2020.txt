We hope you are all staying safe and healthy during these unprecedented times.
In Q3, we delivered revenue of $526 million, which was up 7% sequentially from Q2, supported by strong demand in our defense, semi-cap and telco sectors and improved manufacturing productivity.
With improving operational efficiency, non-GAAP gross margins rebounded 170 basis points to 8.7% for the quarter.
Improved profits and focused expense management resulted in non-GAAP earnings of $0.32 per share, which includes $1.3 million or $0.04 per share of COVID-related costs.
We believe COVID costs are a part of the new operating normal.
And while we believe they will decline to some degree from current levels, they will likely not completely go away.
The guidance provided does exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets and estimated restructuring and other costs.
We expect to incur restructuring and other nonrecurring costs in Q4 of approximately $2.8 to $3.2 million.
