For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019, driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales of hip, knee and spine due to the resurgence of COVID-19.
A slowdown in deferrable procedures primarily impacted the US and worsened through the quarter.
While our implant businesses were challenged, we saw strong results for our Mako product technology and capital products across our MedSurg portfolio.
Our year-to-date organic growth is 7.6%.
And with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery as well as healthcare staffing shortages, we are updating our full year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019.
Our capital equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery.
We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals.
We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18th.
