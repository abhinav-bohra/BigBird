On Slide 4, you will see today's agenda.
Mark will share his overall thoughts on our fourth quarter and full year performance, as well as end market performance by division.
Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter and the year in more detail and then provide our guidance for the full year fiscal 2022.
In fiscal 2021, the pandemic continued to present challenges across North America.
But I am so proud of how our teams, particularly our front-line and supply chain teams adapted and rallied to keep each other safe and meet the sustained demand for our products.
As difficult and complex as this time has been, it has also been an extraordinary period for Campbell, and we've made clear meaningful progress advancing our strategic plan.
Turning to Slide 7, full-year organic net sales were comparable to prior year, which included a positive fourth quarter finish to fiscal 2021 in light of last year's remarkably strong performance.
If you recall, our first half fiscal 2021 was driven by strong elevated end market performance as we continue to gain share and made steady progress on supply to restore the shelf.
