As indicated in our announcement, we've also posted materials to the Investor Relations page of our website that will be referenced in today's call.
References may also be made today to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Joining me for our call today are Leroy Ball, President and CEO of Koppers; and Mike Zugay, Chief Financial Officer.
I'll now turn over this discussion to Leroy.
As the pandemic continues, I hope that you and those you care about remain safe and healthy.
And I'd also like to wish all of you a happy healthy and prosperous 2021.
Our next call will be on February 24th, to report final 2020 results and provide our view into 2021 at that time.
So let's move to Slide 6.
