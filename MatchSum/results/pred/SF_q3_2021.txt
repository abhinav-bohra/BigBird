I'll start the call with some highlights from our quarter and first nine months.
Then Jim Marischen will review our balance sheet and expenses, and I'll wrap up with some concluding thoughts.
Our third quarter represented our second-highest net revenue and earnings per share, as both operating segments, Global Wealth and Institutional, generated strong results.

Revenue in the quarter totaled nearly $1.15 billion, an increase of 30%.
Turning to the next slide.
Our third quarter net revenue was driven by record Global Wealth Management revenue and robust Institutional revenue.
