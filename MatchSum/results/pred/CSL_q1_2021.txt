I hope all of you, your families, co-workers and friends are staying safe and healthy as we collectively manage through what is hopefully the beginning of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Reflecting on the last 12 months of uncertainty, I take great pride in how roughly one year ago the Carlisle team handled the immediate threats born out of the pandemic.
We ensured that our team members had access to healthcare, continue to be paid, and had company support for the difficult situations many were facing.
We enacted strict health and safety protocols based on the CDC, World Health Organization and best-in-class peer actions and recommendations, which contributed to a low infection rate at Carlisle across the globe.
This compelling strategic framework gave us clear direction and consistency emission during the tumultuous past year and will continue to guide our efforts as we accelerate into the recovery in 2021.
During the past 12 months Carlisle again proved its ability to navigate varying economic cycles with steadiness and focus, while delivering strong financial performance reconfirming our conviction in Vision 2025 and it's key strategies.
