We assume no obligation to update our statements or the other information we provide.
Our call will begin with remarks by Peter Baccile, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Musil, our Chief Financial Officer.
Similar to our fourth quarter call, we continue to see exceptionally strong fundamentals in the industrial market.
For the recent CBRE flash report, U.S. industrial net absorption totaled 100 million square feet in the first quarter.
This marks the first time ever that demand has exceeded 100 million square feet in consecutive quarters.
Net absorption also significantly exceeded first quarter completions of 57 million square feet.
We will miss Dave's enthusiasm, tenacity, and energy, and wish him well in his retirement.
With David's departure, we will consolidate our regional structure into two regions with Jojo Yap and Peter Schultz each assuming responsibility, proportions of David's region.
