Accordingly, our comments today will focus primarily on non-GAAP results.
Today we reported strong second quarter results that clearly demonstrate the resiliency of our business and the continued strength of cash usage around the world.
Reported revenue was up 27%, including organic growth of 15% on a comparable basis in local currency revenue as recovered to 97% of 2019 pre-COVID levels, supporting a strong recovery from the pandemic lows, even with the unanticipated continued shutdown of many economies, especially in Europe, Latin America and parts of Asia during the first half of this year.
Operating profit grew 51% with a margin rate increase of 160 basis points to 10.5%, which is 80 basis points above the pre-pandemic second quarter 2019 rate of 9.7%.
This suggests that our focus on sustainable cost reductions is having the desired impact on increased margins even with the revenues not yet back to pre-pandemic levels.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 39% with a margin rate increase of 130 basis points to 15.8% which is a 120 basis points above the pre-pandemic second quarter 2019 EBITDA rate.
And earnings came in at $1.18 per share, up 62% over 2020 and up 40% over the second quarter of 2019.
We're looking forward to Investor Day in early December when we will provide detailed review of our core and digital growth strategies as well as financial projections for 2022.
