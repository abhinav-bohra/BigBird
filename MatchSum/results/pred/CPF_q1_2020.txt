Overall, the state of Hawaii is doing a good job at managing and containing the pandemic.
Hawaii was early to put in place stay-at-home orders and mandatory curfew then quarantine.
Due to our geographic isolation, Hawaii was able to effectively lock down and protect the state from outside visitors with potential COVID-19 infections.
We believe these measures will slow and contain the spread of COVID-19 in the state and result in a faster recovery.
However, with a complete tourism shut down in Hawaii, we are seeing a dramatic impact on the state's economy.
We are hopeful that we will start to see visitors returning to the island in the late summer to early fall of this year, particularly from Asia as they are closer to recovery from the pandemic.
I personally led companies through prior crisis, including the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, tsunami and radiation after-effects while I was in Tokyo leading IBM, Japan and the SARs outbreak in 2002 to 2004 while I was leading BEARINGPOINT ASIA PACIFIC.
