During today's call, we will discuss ITW's second quarter financial results and update our guidance for the full year 2021.
In the second quarter, we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results.
Earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143%, 108% if you exclude the onetime tax benefit of $0.35 that we recorded in the quarter.
In this strong demand environment and in the face of very challenging supply conditions, our teams around the world leveraged our long-held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach, and the benefits of staying fully staffed and invested through our winter recovery positioning, to continue providing world-class service levels to our customers while also continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.
We're certainly encouraged by our organic growth momentum as order intake rates remained pretty much strong across the board.
And during the second quarter, we saw multiple examples of how our ability to sustain our differentiated delivery capabilities by remaining fully invested through the pandemic resulted in incremental share gain opportunities for our businesses.
While there's no doubt that the raw material supply environment is as challenging as we have experienced in a long time, maybe ever in my 38 years at ITW, we are as well positioned as we can be to continue to set ourselves apart through our ability to respond for our customers.
GAAP earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.35 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there.
