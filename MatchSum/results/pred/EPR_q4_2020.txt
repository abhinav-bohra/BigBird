For the overview, clearly, 2020 was a year unlike any other we've experienced since the company was founded in 1997.
Early in the onset of the pandemic, we recognized the need to fortify the company's balance sheet to maintain sufficient liquidity for the long term.
Key among early actions was to defer an anticipated gaming venue investment of approximately 1 billion, along with deferring other uncommitted investment spending of approximately 600 million.
Additionally, we accessed our unsecured credit facility as a precautionary measure and suspended our monthly dividend to common shareholders.
As we speak today, our liquidity remains in a strong position with cash on hand in excess of 500 million.
This large reserve of cash reflects the fact that we are to return to normalcy.
However, as we announced in our quarterly disclosure on January 7, we generated positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and anticipate this trend to continue.
Overall, we are pleased with both the progress and trajectory of our recovery as it is reflected in a continued increase in cash collections as we entered 2021.
