Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, how we continue to execute on Project Summit and the resulting transformation across the organization, how we have accelerated momentum in our data center business, and how we are increasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion and other sustainability initiatives.
In addition, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results.
We have included the reconciliation to these measures as required by Reg G in our supplemental financial information.
As we close out a year, which has been marked by a first quarter, delivering near record growth growth to a remaining year where we had to manage headwinds from COVID, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on where we've been and where we're also going.
Whilst we are optimistic of the positive impact the rollout of vaccines will have, we continue to believe that 2021 will look similar to 2020, albeit in reverse in terms of the macroeconomic landscape.
However, 2020 was also a year where there was much to celebrate now, which came out of the creativity and resiliency demonstrated by our teams.
We continued our investment in new products and innovation with a focus on supporting our customers' remote workforces.
These services led to growth in some of our digital solutions year on year of 8%, excluding FX.
