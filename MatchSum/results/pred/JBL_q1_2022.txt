An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021 and other filings.
With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our strong quarter and outstanding results.
First off, the team delivered $400 million of core operating income on roughly $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%.
These results were primarily driven by broad-based strength in several key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and of course, mobility, as customary for our first fiscal quarter.
And finally, it's worth noting that our team was able to accomplish all of this in spite of the chaotic global supply chain environment.
In a few moments, both Mike and Mark will provide more details on the quarter, while also addressing our improved outlook for the year.
We do expect some relief toward the back half of the fiscal year, but the general consensus is that demand will remain ahead of supply for the next six months.
As Adam just highlighted, Q1 was an exceptional quarter.
