I am pleased that occupancy began to grow by the end of the first quarter and continued in April.
For the last year, we have been in the toughest battle in the company's history.
We have been fighting for the health and well-being of our residents, patients and associates.
So our residents, patients and associates could receive the lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines.
And I am proud of Brookdale's unique and vital role during this crisis.
Let's review our journey.
Even so, we are pleased with the strengthening move-ins during the first quarter and into April.
With the benefit of our communities completing 100% of first vaccine clinics in February, our occupancy decline rapidly moderated.
