Bob will cover our third quarter results in greater detail as well as our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year.
I will then come back to provide an update on our land spending and balance sheet, followed by a wrap up by Allan.
We generated very strong financial results in the third quarter with increases in both home closings and gross margins leading to nearly 40% growth in adjusted EBITDA.
We also reported our highest third quarter net income in over 10 years.
From a sales perspective, after weathering a very difficult environment in April, we experienced improved demand in May, which accelerated in June, leading to the best June sales pace we have generated in a decade.
Together, these results have positioned us for a strong finish to our fiscal year.
Second, we paused land spending to apply new COVID-related risk criteria to our underwriting.
Temporarily slowing land spending contributed to an increase in liquidity during the quarter.
