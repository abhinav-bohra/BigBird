We're obviously very pleased to see that so many people now have access, full access to the COVID-19 vaccinations, and that adoption has been pretty strong so far.
Now of course, we'd like to see this even more broadly on a worldwide basis, but it certainly feels like we're making really important progress toward moving forward -- and ultimately, as a result of that moving, hopefully, on from the pandemic.
I think all of us realize that.
But I, for one, feel more optimistic than ever that we're coming out, I think, on the other side of COVID-19 and with that, much better days ahead and I guess with that, probably it's a good lead into our Q1 call.
Q1 was a stronger quarter than we initially expected and I'm pretty excited to discuss it with you.
Whenever you have a good quarter, obviously, earnings calls are a lot more fun.
So clearly, we're excited about this one and I'm going to try to keep my remarks relatively brief this way.
COVID clearly is not over, just as I stated a minute ago and I'm very confident we're going to continue to have surprises ahead and disruptions ahead, but based on what we saw at the end of Q1 and what we're seeing in the beginning of Q2 and coupling that with just the pace of vaccine rollouts right now, we're clearly moving in the right direction.
