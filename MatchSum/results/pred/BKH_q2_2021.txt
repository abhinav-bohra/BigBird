Although we believe that our expectations and beliefs are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially.
Ill begin on slide four, which lists our key achievements during the second quarter.
Our team delivered strong financial results, with earnings up 21% compared to last year.
We also delivered solid operational performance with strong execution of our capital plan, and we made excellent progress on our regulatory initiatives, including Storm Uri expense recovery actions.
During the record-breaking heat in June across the Western United States, the Black Hills team and our electric systems and generating fleet performed exceptionally well.
And on June 30, we submitted our electric integrated resource plan for our South Dakota and Wyoming utilities in a moment, and then Rich will cover regulatory activity in more detail in his update.
Slide five lays out our financial outlook.
And we are on plan to mitigate the remaining $0.10 net storm year impact through O&M management and other opportunities.
