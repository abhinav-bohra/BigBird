You can find reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the earnings supplement.
These represent stable and recurring revenue streams that are growing very rapidly with big addressable markets that we are penetrating.
The increases in these digital categories in Q3 led to year-over-year same-store revenue growth and for the fourth consecutive quarter, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth.
Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $102.1 million with a margin of 12.8% for the quarter and that brings our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA to $467 million, up meaningfully from 2020.
We achieved positive net income in the quarter of $14.7 million and adjusted net income was a very strong $26.5 million in the quarter.
Further, I'm excited to report that our last 12 months digital revenues have now exceeded $1 billion and our overall digital revenues are growing at 15% to 20%.
We were able to post strong financial results this year along with multiple refinancings despite the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the inflationary pressures that have risen here in the US and impacted so many.
It's worth highlighting that we have repeatedly shown that even in a challenging environment the compounding growth in our digital revenue businesses and our ability to strategically modulate our cost structure continues to allow us to produce stable growing adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.
