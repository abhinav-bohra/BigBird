I want to begin by saying a few words about COVID-19 and our response to this global pandemic.
Our foremost concern at DHI is to ensure the health and safety of our DHI community.
As such when the pandemic began to unfold in mid-March, we at DHI jumped into action to aid our communities by launching COVID-19 resource centers on each of our brand sites to assist both clients and candidates alike with information relevant to their needs in these challenging times.
These sites provide information on virtual career fairs, open remote job posts, real-time hiring trends, industry insights, articles, and hiring resources.
We also launched a campaign to provide free recruitment services to U.S. hospitals to help them find technologists in fields like electronic medical records, healthcare administration and computer system processing.
Also, all of our employees have been working from home using the best possible remote communication and collaboration tools and our team members, including sales and support, marketing and product development continue to be highly effective.
In fact, our product development team actually gained efficiency working from home this quarter, delivering dozens of new product releases.
A recent report released by Microsoft in July predicts that the worldwide digital jobs will grow from 41 million in 2020 to 190 million in 2025.
