We have remained highly proficient and steadfast in that commitment.
We entered this critical time in a position of strength with a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 2%.
And currently accruing more reserves than at any point in the company's history and with a highly experienced rapid response disaster team.
We are off to a good start in 2020 with solid first quarter results, including an annualized return on average equity of 16.1% and progress on our reinsurance renewals for June 1.
In this dynamic environment, we continue to support our consumers whether they are shopping for new policies, submitting claims, refinancing or extending terms, while having substantially all of our employees in our rapid response virtual protocol.
On those last two points, I would like to highlight the following.
First, since March 15, we have extended favorable terms to consumers of all states upon request.
And for the claims that cannot be adjusted virtually, we recognize the increased hardship placed both on the consumer and our field staff.
