On an adjusted basis, net income increased to $9 million or $0.27 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2021, compared to $1.2 million or $0.04 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2020.
The adjustments being made to earnings per share are for restructuring charges, certain executive severance charges, loss on the sale of plant, accelerated D&A, foreign currency transaction impacts and transaction and advisory fees.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter increased by 55.4% to $24.3 million, compared to $15.7 million during the same period of last year.
The increase is largely due to operating leverage from higher volumes.
From a margin standpoint, this increase represents adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 260 basis points.
We will remain focused on managing working capital and generating cash as the year progresses.
We will also continue to be opportunistic with respect to repurchasing our stock.
