Our portfolio of 3,161 freestanding single-tenant retail properties continued to perform exceedingly well.
Occupancy was 98.3% at the end of the quarter, which remains above our long-term average of 98% and while our occupancy rate ticked down 20 basis points from December 31, we're seeing impressive activity in our leasing department including interest by a number of strong national tenants in some of our vacancies.
We also announced collection of 97% of rents due for the first quarter as well as collection of 98% of rents due for the month of April.
Our impressive collection results continue to compare very favorably to other retail real estate companies, including those with a significantly higher percentage of investment-grade tenants.
The majority of the remaining uncollected rent in the first quarter was simply deferred rent that we expect to collect when the tenant's repayment obligation kicks in later this year.
Notably, we only forgave 0.1% of our first quarter rents.
We also reported that during the first quarter, we sold 11 properties, raising $17.6 million of proceeds to be reinvested into new acquisitions and our balance sheet remains rock solid.
During the quarter, we issued $450 million of unsecured 30-year interest-only bonds at a rate of 3.5%.
