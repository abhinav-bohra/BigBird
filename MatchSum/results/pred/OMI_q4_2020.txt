Additionally, in our discussion today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures.
In addition, I am extremely pleased to be here today and report another strong quarter and close out of a record year.
The strong performance in the quarter as well as the full year was a result of the successful execution and implementation of the key initiatives discussed during the previous quarterly earnings calls, which included two major items: one, infrastructure investments, with a focus on current and long-term profitable growth; and two, operational improvements, with a focus on enhancing the customer experience and increasing operating efficiencies.
Starting with our Global Products segment, let me remind you of the infrastructure investments and operational improvements we shared previously during the past year.
At a high level, we expanded our manufacturing output to align with the volume commitments of our customers.
Here are just a few examples of these investments and operational improvements: one, the installation of new N95 production lines in our U.S.-based manufacturing facilities; two, we added nonwoven fabric manufacturing in our Lexington, North Carolina facility; three, we continued to expand our isolation and surgical gown production capacity; and four, we optimized the operational process to maximize output of the production lines.
One, we expanded our low-unit-of-measure warehouse infrastructure system.
Two, we improved our inventory planning processes and algorithms.
