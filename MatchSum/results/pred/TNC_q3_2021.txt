After their remarks, we will open the call to questions.
Additionally, on this conference call, we will discuss non-GAAP measures that include or exclude certain items.
Our third quarter results reflect the returns of pre-pandemic demand across the majority of our geographic markets and verticals.
Our comprehensive and innovative product offerings are resonating with customers during this broad-based market recovery, and we expect this demand environment to continue for the foreseeable future.
While we are certainly encouraged by these positive trends, our financial performance continued to be impacted by the unexpected and prolonged global supply disruptions, inflation and labor constraints that have affected virtually every industry and geographic markets.
The increased demand for our products combined with the effect of macro level constraints on our production capabilities contributed to a record order backlog that varies by product category or region and is now 3 to 5 times our historical averages.
As an example, we are making the necessary investments to add production of our T16 line to our China plants mid next year.
The T16 is a highly maneuverable battery-operated ride-on scrubber that has proven to be very popular with our customers within the APAC region.
