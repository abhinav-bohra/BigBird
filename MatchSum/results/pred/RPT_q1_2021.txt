Our rent collections continue to tick higher.
We continue to benefit from the multiyear mark-to-market opportunity and strong demand at our centers.
We recently closed on our new net lease platform and are now under contract on our first property in the Boston market that we expect to allocate between RPT's balance sheet and the new platform.
We believe we now have the capital and the platforms to generate strong external growth as well as the portfolio quality and leasing demand to drive above-trend internal growth as we move past the pandemic.
For instance, COVID-19 has had a negative impact on many tenant categories.
But unlike during the global financial crisis, it has also had a positive impact on many other tenant categories, like grocery, home improvement, electronics, wholesale clubs, general merchandise and medical use.
Given the relationship with RPT and our existing operating and development capabilities, the new platform gives access to proprietary deal flow from multi-tenant assets, larger-scale sale-leaseback transactions with national tenants, blended extends of shorter-term leases on strong real estate, remerchandising of expiring leases and build-to-suit opportunities.
The net lease platform and our R2G joint venture should allow us to grow AUM and expand in target markets faster than we could do on our own.
