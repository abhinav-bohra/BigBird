Our company began fiscal '22 with positive momentum following an incredibly challenging year battling the pandemic.
In each successive quarter, our people worked with great tenacity and success to improve top and bottom-line results to close the gap pre-pandemic levels, drive the recovery, and return to profitable growth.
We entered the pandemic year from a position of strength following 11 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth in our footwear businesses.
As a result, fiscal '22 is off to an incredibly strong start with the first quarter that meaningfully exceeded our expectations.
Our outperformance was driven by better-than-anticipated results at every division, led by record first-quarter revenue and profitability at Journeys.
Even as the pandemic continued to impact our businesses to varying degrees, the pace of our recovery accelerated each month and overall in Q1, reflecting stellar execution, combined with a temporary boost from U.S. government stimulus, and pent-up demand as the economy reopens faster than anticipated.
We were pleased that every business in every channel contributed to the beat versus expectations with the stores delivering the biggest gain.
We've always known our customers enjoy our differentiated store experience and the exceptional service they receive in person, and that has been so exciting to see the strength of our brands draw enthusiastic shoppers back in as economies reopen.
