Please also note this event is being recorded.
Today, I'll provide an update on the broader market, our capital allocation trends, including credit activity, and our outlook.
Ilker Ertas, our head of securitized products will follow-up with specific commentary on our agency and hedging activity, and Serena will review our financial results.
And as Sean noted, our other business heads are also present to provide additional context during Q&A.
The primary themes, the dominated markets in the fourth quarter are largely consistent with our third-quarter narrative.
The Fed's monetary policy accommodation provided considerable support for risk assets and contained interest rate volatility.
This backdrop, coupled with active portfolio management, drove our strong performance to close out the year as we delivered an economic return of 5.1% for the quarter, ensuring a positive return for our shareholders for 2020 which is particularly notable given the historic disruption we all faced in March.
Nonetheless, it remains prudent to hedge the tail risk of a spike in rates as we'll discuss shortly.
