Now I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Brian will then walk you through our financials and updated full year 2021 business outlook in greater detail.
We experienced strong business momentum in the second quarter, generating net sales of $410.3 million which grew 18% over the prior quarter and 25.8% over the prior year period.
Sales growth was primarily driven by the implementation of two product price increases during the quarter along with marginal increases in sales volume.
Throughout the quarter, we were very pleased to be able to continue meeting the needs of our customers by providing them with our trusted product solutions typically within 48 hours or less.
The recent price increases we implemented drove significantly higher gross margins for the second quarter, which increased to 47.9% from 46.7% in the prior quarter and 45.9% in the year ago period.
Consistent with our historical business practice, our customers received at least a 60-day advance notification for price increases along with a clause that reduces significant pre-buying.
This enables us to manage our inventory levels in this challenging market.
