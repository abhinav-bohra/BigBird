As we do each quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes upfront on our focused sustainability strategy, the engine that enables us to deliver differentiated shareholder returns over time.
Long-term sustainability megatrends continue to intensify, and our innovation leadership is transforming the climate industry as the world decarbonizes.
Our aggressive goals and bold actions can dramatically reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the world's progress.
That's why we are calling for businesses and governments to take stronger action at COP26 and why we continue to set aggressive science-based emission reduction targets to push our innovation further and faster.
That innovation also extends to emerging trends as we see heightened focus on indoor air quality and strong momentum in aging infrastructure in our schools.
We continue to make a difference consistently, relentlessly and over the long term.
In fact, Q3 ending backlog for the enterprise is up more than 70% or approximately $2 billion from year-end 2020 with all three of our business segments at record levels.
Americas and EMEA have backlog that are up over 90% and 65%, respectively, from year-end 2020.
