Turning to the business, we are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets, and especially in our urban sub-markets.
In real estate demand is the unsolvable problem, without it no other economic factor matters, and in our business both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it.
This positive trend in spite of a worsening pandemic, and renewed shutdowns in our markets gives us even more of a cause for optimism.
If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed, and cities reopen our business will really hum.
The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand, positions us especially well.
We also see declining forward concessions.
With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out.
The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year's pricing until mid-year or so and the amortization of 2020 and '21 concessions, creates considerable modeling complexity for us, and for our investors and analysts.
