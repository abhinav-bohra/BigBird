Our Q2 performance underscores the versatility of our business model and our leadership role and emergency response.
Responding to crisis is an integral part of the job here at Clean Harbors.
It's in our DNA and that ability enabled us to jump into action late in Q1 and into Q2 with a wide-ranging response plan.
Our adjusted EBITDA was $135.5 million for the quarter, which included a total of $23.4 million from the CARES Act here in the U.S. and the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy or CEWS.
These programs enabled us to employ more workers than we would have otherwise been able to, with the pandemic related shutdowns.
