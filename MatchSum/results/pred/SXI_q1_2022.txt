We continue to have a favorable outlook for fiscal 2022, and look forward to further successfully executing on our growth strategy.
Revenue and consolidated adjusted operating margin increased significantly year-on-year in fiscal first quarter 2022 as we leveraged positive demand trends and converted new business opportunities from our pipeline.
Consolidated organic revenue growth of approximately 17% year-on-year reflected strength at our Electronics and Scientific segment.
Electronics revenue increased approximately 37% year-on-year, primarily due to a broad-based geographical recovery with continued solid demand for relays in renewable energy and electric vehicle applications along with positive trends in transportation, appliance, test and measurement and distribution end-markets.
Consolidated adjusted operating margin of 13.4% was a 250 basis point year-on-year increase and represented our second consecutive quarter of delivering our highest consolidated margin in Standex's history.
Sequentially, total company backlog realizable in under one year increased approximately 12%, with strength, particularly at the Electronics, Specialty Solutions and Engraving segments.
In addition, our reed switch production and material substitution project at the Electronics segment continues to mitigate some of the material inflation we are seeing, and remains on-track to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2020.
We continue to have significant financial flexibility to pursue new organic and inorganic growth opportunities given our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and consistent cash flow generation.
