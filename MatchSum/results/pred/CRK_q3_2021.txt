I want to have a couple of clarified statements before we start the actual third quarter of 2021 results.
With our Bakken properties of a contract for that $154 million, which most of you are aware of, and closing expected in the coming weeks, we did preannounce that we would accelerate completion activity on the $9.4 net Haynesville wells this year to bring those volumes forward into our current strong pricing environment for natural gas.
The increased production from those wells really will appear in the first quarter of 2022.
The direction of Comstock is to continue to focus on capital efficiency in the Haynesville and generation of free cash flow, specifically over the next several quarters, we plan to use that free cash flow to pay off our credit facility and to retire the 7.5 bonds in May of 2022, then with our debt reduction goals a bit we want to establish a shareholder dividend.
With me is Roland Burns, our President and Chief Financial Officer; Dan Harrison, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ron Mills, our Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.
While we believe the expectations in such statements to be reasonable, there could be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
Our production increased 25% in the quarter to 1.424 Bcf a day and was 98% natural gas.
Revenues, including realized hedging losses, increased 86% to $394 million.
