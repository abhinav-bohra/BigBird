We significantly increased our growth investments and improved our market positions.
We had another strong quarter of achieving cost savings and returning cash to shareholders.
And finally, while earnings were down as expected, we are increasing our full-year outlook.
Now let's look at the details of our results, starting with sales.
Our third quarter net sales were $4.7 billion.
That's up 1% from year ago and includes a two-point drag from currency rates.
We're on track to grow or maintain share in approximately 60% of the 80 category/country combinations that we track.
This is a result of higher investment levels, innovations, and strong in-market executions.
