We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions.
During this global pandemic, caused by a novel coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease state it leads to, I hope that you, your family and your friends remain safe and healthy during these times.
Way back in early January, a ResMed employee, a ResMedian in Hubei province, China, put on a hazmat suit and helped set up ventilators to provide the gift of breath to many thousands of people that turned out in that city, while their immune systems fought against the first global cases of COVID-19 that ResMed saw in Wuhan.
Since that time, seven months ago, our global team has provided vital support globally to combat this coronavirus, not just across China, but across Asia, then across Europe, across North America.
And now we are just starting to -- preparing to -- actually, we're in the midst of continuing that battle in Latin America in, sub-Sahara and Africa and parts of the Middle East and Asia that still have that, what we call, the peak impact ahead of them in terms of hospitalizations and ventilator needs.
So I noted in our call 90 days ago, our Q3 call, that we would do more to support the global community and local healthcare systems with ventilators and ventilation mask systems across the 140 countries that we serve.
During Q4, during this June quarter, we produced around 100,000 invasive and noninvasive ventilators, including bilevel positive pressure ventilators.
So, looking forward, we have built a sophisticated set of analytic capabilities, including an epidemiology patient model that has helped us model the impacts of both the headwinds and the tailwinds that are part of this COVID-19 crisis, and we have detailed scenarios of the impacts by city, by region, by country and by ResMed business line.
