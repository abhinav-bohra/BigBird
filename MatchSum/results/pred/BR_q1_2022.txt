Next, I'll provide an update on execution against our growth strategy across our three franchises.
Our first quarter results marked a strong start to the fiscal year.
Recurring revenues rose 16% and adjusted earnings per share rose 9%.
Second, our top line growth continues to be propelled by a combination of our own actions and strong underlying market trends.
The biggest driver of our 7% organic growth across all three of our businesses was the onboarding of closed sales as we continue to convert our $385 million backlog into recurring revenue.
Generating those returns requires consistent execution.
Our governance business had a very strong first quarter.
It's being facilitated by the rapid adoption of next-generation technologies.
