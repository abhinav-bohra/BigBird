Furthermore, we achieved these GAAP results despite incurring $39 million or $0.79 per share of expenses related to the pending acquisition of FLIR.
Excluding these non-recurring charges, earnings increased 39.2% compared to last year.
Operating margin increased 426 basis points and free cash flow nearly doubled.
In addition, I'm very pleased with the breadth of our financial performance across Teledyne.
Year-over-year sales increased in nearly every major business category except commercial aerospace, which is now only 4% of our total sales.
Also in the first quarter, we received all time record orders with a book to bill of 1.15x resulting in quarter-end backlog of approximately $1.8 billion.
Given our strong first quarter, we now think a reasonable outlook for the total company organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 6% led by forecasted growth of about 10% in Digital Imaging excluding FLIR.
In our Instrumentation segment, overall, first quarter sales increased 0.5% versus last year.
