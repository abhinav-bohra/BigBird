The agenda for today's call is on Slide 3.
First, Ray will review highlights from the quarter and provide a business update.
Jason will then review our third quarter financial results and our full-year 2021 outlook.
Finally, Ray will offer some concluding remarks.
Now I'd like to invite Ray to begin.
Our financial results were negatively impacted not only by significant volume reductions versus last year but also by low visibility from our customers leading to short notice production shutdowns.
We won our third consecutive Automotive News PACE award and two PACEpilot awards, more than any other supplier.
With the momentum of new business wins, we expect our E-Systems business to continue to grow faster than market for the next several years.
