The third quarter marks an important milestone in Glatfelter's ongoing transformation with the successful acquisition of Jacob Holm.
We also completed the first full quarter with Mount Holly under Glatfelter's ownership, which contributed to record operating profit for the Airlaid segment.
Slide 3 of the investor deck provides the key highlights for the third quarter.
We reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.21 and adjusted EBITDA of $32 million.
Airlaid Materials performed well above expectations, driven by the higher than anticipated demand for our tabletop and wipes products.
This strong demand positively impacted segment profitability in the quarter.
This action was an addition to the 8% price increase announced earlier in the year.
