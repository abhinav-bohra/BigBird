I'm delighted to report that for the first time since the pandemic, I'm together with Doug, Mike, Sara and our Boston Team for this earnings call and all BXP employees returned to the office on July 6th.
So, the US economy awash with fiscal and monetary stimulus is roaring back as we exit the pandemic.
US GDP growth was 6.4% in the first quarter and predicted to be higher for the second quarter and for all of 2021.
Over 850,000 jobs were created in June and aggregate unemployment decreased to 5.9%.
Industries that use offices have been less impacted by the pandemic and the employment rate for their workers is lower.
Despite the annual inflation rate rising to 5.4% in June, the 10-year US treasury rate has dropped to around 1.3% and the Federal Reserve's rhetoric remains distinctly dovish given it believes the recent inflation is driven by transitory factors.
High economic growth and low interest rates create the ideal environment for strong real estate investment performance.
Moving to private equity market conditions, $15.7 billion of significant office assets were sold in the second quarter flat to last quarter of 77% from the second quarter a year ago and down approximately 44% from 2019 pre-pandemic levels, and it remains 23% of commercial real estate transaction activity.
