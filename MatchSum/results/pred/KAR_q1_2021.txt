Consistent with our announcement earlier this year, Peter Kelly has transitioned into the role of CEO of KAR Global beginning April 1.
It has been my pleasure getting to know so many of you and sharing KAR's story with you.
Peter has been an inspirational leader in our company for over a decade and is a true industry pioneer.
He has been the architect of our digital transformation and has a clear bold vision for KAR's future, which I know he will begin sharing with you today.
Despite operating in an environment of constrained supply across our industry, we achieved the following results.
We facilitated the sale of 753,000 vehicles, representing gross auction proceeds of $11.4 billion.
Benefits of our digital marketplace model include: for buyers, greater convenience, greater choice and selection and lower costs; for sellers, increased buyer participation with more buyers viewing and bidding on your vehicles, greater geographical reach, reduced days to sale, reduce time to cash and improve proceeds.
While off-premise sales are likely to continue to increase, and we are well positioned for this, there is still a role for bringing vehicles on-premise to our facilities and for providing related services.
