These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
I'll begin by discussing our operational highlights and our fourth quarter financial results.
The fourth quarter was a solid finish to a challenging year.
Strong capital project activity across all our operating segments and robust demand for our Parts & Consumables led to record bookings and cash flow in the fourth quarter.
I'll provide more details about this activity when I discuss the results of our operating segments.
Our balance sheet remains healthy and our liquidity position has strengthened throughout the year.
Total revenue was down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.
We were particularly pleased that our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 19.1%, and our free cash flow was up 7% to a record $38 million in the fourth quarter.
