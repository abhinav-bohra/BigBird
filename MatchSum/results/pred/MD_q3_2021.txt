Key metrics such as payer mix and rate of admissions continue to be favorable compared to last year.
Mark will give some details of our comparisons to pre-pandemic levels.
Our revenue for the quarter of $493 million was above our internal expectations as was our adjusted EBITDA of $73 million.
Based on our results, we now expect that our 2021 adjusted EBITDA will exceed our prior internal expectation of being above $240 million, and we now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA of at least $250 million.
We also fully expect adjusted EBITDA next year to exceed $270 million, absent any major external events.
This is still a preliminary view into 2022, and we'll be in a better position to provide a more specific outlook after we finish our budgeting process, but I believe we're building momentum in our business.
Acquisitions haven't been a major part of our activity so far this year, but they could play just as important role as organic growth when we do see them strategically.
The sum of these efforts is continuing to ramp up post-COVID.
