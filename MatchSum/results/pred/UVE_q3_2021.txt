We have now filed for more than 34% in primary rate increases in Florida over the past 18 months while simultaneously continuing to shape our underwriting risk with total policies in force relatively flat year-over-year.
As a reminder, discussions today on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude effects from unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments and any extraordinary reinstatement premiums and related commissions.
Adjusted operating income also excludes interest expense.
We ended the third quarter with total revenue down 7.8% to $287.3 million, driven primarily by the realized gain on investments of $53.8 million in the third quarter of the prior year versus a $4.3 million realized gain in the current quarter.
Direct premiums earned were up 15% for the quarter, led by primary rate increases in Florida and other states earning through the book as policies renew.
Both decreases are the result of the sale and subsequent reinvestment at lower yields of a majority of securities in the portfolio that were in an unrealized gain position in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 to recognize the fair value benefits in surplus.
In regards to capital deployment, during the quarter, the company repurchased approximately 101,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $1.4 million.
The company's current share repurchase authorization program has $17.8 million remaining as of September 30, 2021, and runs through November 3, 2022.
