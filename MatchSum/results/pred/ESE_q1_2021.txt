Our solid operating results in Q1 coupled with our strong liquidity position demonstrates that the measures we've taken will allow us to successfully navigate through this challenge.
Our actions will benefit as we're going forward as things continue to move toward a more normal state.
And I'm confident that our disciplined approach to operating the business will result in our continued success throughout the balance of fiscal 2021.
While Gary will provide financial details, I'll offer top level comment by noting that while our Q1 A&D sales were lower than prior year due to COVID's impacts on commercial aerospace.
Our portfolio diversity allowed us to overcome this headwind as we substantially increased our adjusted earnings per share from prior year, due to the strong performance from our other operating units.
Our Navy business remained strong and well-funded.
This makes it difficult for our solutions to be replaced by alternative sources.
The fundamentals of our portfolio remain strong and our goal remains the same, to create long-term shareholder value.
