Let me start by saying that we are pleased with the start of the 2020-2021 academic year.
While our business has not fully normalized at this time, we believe we are on the road to recovery as exemplified in many areas.
Our lease-up occupancy exceeded 90%, a level many believe to be a best-case scenario in the early days of this pandemic.
Our rent collection rate improved to 97% in September, the first full month of the new academic year in most of our markets, from approximately 94% in Q2.
This improvement taking place, while many other sectors continue to experience decreasing trends at this time.
We're also receiving significantly fewer resident hardship rent abatement request.
Several hundred currently versus several thousand per month in the prior academic year.
Even amid this black swan event, the resounding value of a college degree and abundant demand for higher education at Power five and Carnegie R1 research institutions continues underpinning the stability and consistent growth opportunity in our sector.
