First and foremost, we are deeply grateful to all the front-line heroes that are tirelessly combating COVID-19 every day, despite the great risk to themselves and their families.
At NHI, we have long admired the senior housing and skilled nursing organizations and their staff that go to great lengths to keep our senior population safe and smiling.
As a tribute, we have published some of our favorite caregiver and resident photos on the cover of our supplemental.
Reputations are made during a crisis and I see operators making good decisions and taking action based on the principles they value, selflessly caring for their residents, nurturing a company culture that appreciates employees, and providing leadership and comfort to the employees and families of their residents.
I believe that when history reflects back on our industry and its practices during this time, there will be operators that are hailed as heroes.
That said, the challenges posed to our operators and our business by this pandemic are very real and it is difficult to say with any degree of accuracy, when we will return to a more normal operating environment.
Kevin will give details on that later.
On the cost side of the equation, it should not surprise anyone that our operators are spending more, particularly for labor and PPE suppliers.
