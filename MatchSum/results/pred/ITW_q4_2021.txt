Six of our seven segments combined delivered 12% organic growth, while our Auto OEM segment continued to be impacted by near-term limitations on auto production due to component supply shortages and, as a result, was down 16% in the quarter.
At the enterprise level, we delivered organic growth of 5%, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, operating margin of 22.7%, and free cash flow of $695 million or 114% of net income.
Throughout the entirety of 2021, our teams around the world did an exceptional job of delivering for our customers while responding quickly and decisively to rapidly rising input costs and aggressively executing our Win the Recovery strategy to accelerate profitable market penetration and organic growth across our portfolio.
As a result, for the full year, we generated organic growth of 12%, with each of our seven segments delivering organic growth ranging from 6% to 18%.
And despite a seemingly constant barrage of input cost increases, we expanded operating margin by 120 basis points to 24.1%, with another 100-basis-point contribution from enterprise initiatives.
GAAP earnings per share was an all-time record at $8.51, an increase of 28% versus the prior year.
Most importantly, we delivered these results while continuing to drive meaningful progress on our path to ITW's full potential through the execution of our long-term enterprise strategy.
Sequentially, organic revenue accelerated by 6% from Q3 into Q4 on a sales per-day basis as compared to our historical sequential of plus 2%.
