Let me also mention that throughout this conference call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
I'll provide an update on the commercial seller volumes and what we expect to see between now and the end of next year.
I'll provide an update on our acquisition of Carwave and the solid performance of our finance business, AFC.
And I'll close out with some updates relating to our cost structure.
So, I'd like to start with the third quarter.
Within the ADESA segment, we facilitated the sale of 586,000 vehicles, representing over $9 billion in gross auction proceeds.
We also see an opportunity to continue to move up market and sell a larger number of higher value vehicles.
This in turn will help drive further increases in revenue per unit sold and stronger margins.
