Our employees are making good on our strategy to serve, grow and win together.
This compares to $1.1 billion or $1.67 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
While comparisons to the second quarter of last year are skewed by the COVID impact, a comparison to 2019 further demonstrates the impressive results we achieved during the quarter.
Our quarterly operating ratio of 55.1% is an all-time record.
In addition, we set quarterly records for operating income, net income and earnings per share.
The second quarter also marked an important milestone in our quest to reduce our carbon footprint, as we achieved a second quarter best fuel consumption rate.
To that end, we'll start with Eric and an update on our operations.
Forest products continue to be a bright spot, as second quarter volumes grew 28% year-over-year and 7% over the first quarter.
