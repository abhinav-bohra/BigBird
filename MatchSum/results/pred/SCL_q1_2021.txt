Scott has been a key leader at Stepan for the past 28 years.
The company had a good start to the year and delivered record quarterly income.
The best financial quarter our company has ever had.
Adjusted net income was $42.4 million or $1.82 per diluted share, up 75% from $24.2 million or $1.04 per diluted share last year when we had the power outage at our Millsdale facility.
For the quarter, surfactant operating income was up 47% primarily due to improved customer and product mix.
Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2021 was at a record $42.4 million or $1.82 per diluted share, a 75% increase versus $24.2 million or $1.04 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2020.
This project is the primary driver of our increased 2021 capital expenditure forecast of $150 million to $170 million.
We are working with our customers to ensure these product projects deliver our financial return targets.
