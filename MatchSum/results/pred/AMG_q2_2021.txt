Year to date, our affiliates excellent absolute and relative investment performance has resulted in higher asset levels, enhanced organic growth, and meaningful performance fees.
We began the quarter by announcing our new investment in OCP Asia, increasing our exposure to the region and its fast-growing private credit markets, and we ended the quarter with the announcement of our newest partnership in Parnassus, the largest independent ESG-dedicated fund manager in the industry.
Together with our recent investment in Boston Common, a long-term leader in impact investing, we expect that these new affiliates will contribute over 90 million in EBITDA in 2022 and contribute meaningfully to our organic growth over time.
And we are only halfway through 2021.
With the addition of Parnassus, our run-rate EBITDA is now over 1 billion, increasing our opportunity to invest in new affiliates and areas of secular growth and in resources to enhance the growth of our existing affiliates, including strategic growth capital and distribution.
As evidenced by our seven new partnerships, which we've established over the last two years, our model is resonating with the highest quality independent investment firms in the industry.
Looking ahead, we see an even greater opportunity to execute on our new investment opportunity set, given the favorable transaction environment, AMG's strong competitive position, and the increasing demand for our partnership solutions.
As I highlighted in prior quarters, throughout the pandemic, a number of client demand trends have remained intact, including the ongoing demand for illiquid alternatives, while other trends have accelerated, such as the appetite for responsible and impact investing, all against the backdrop of an improving environment for active management.
