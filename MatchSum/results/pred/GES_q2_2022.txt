We hope to see you there.
We are very proud of our team and our accomplishments.
But most importantly, I want to share with you where we are today and how we see the future, both short and long-term.
Let me start with our results.
For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings from operations of $89 million.
The star of this quarter was the North America Retail segment that reported an operating profit of $38 million versus $6 Million in the LLY period and almost 540% increase.
These projects should be complete by the end of next year.
Regarding customer centricity, let me start with our customer base.
