We are excited about our second quarter performance as our title business continues to produce record results, and F&G set records for its retail annuity sales, while expanding into new institutional channels, further validating our decision to acquire the company just over one year ago.
We are building a company designed to deliver more stable earnings and cash flow as market conditions change and interest rates eventually rise and pressure our title business, and we can already see the early signs of our success.
Their dedication has allowed us to continue to lead the title industry in revenue, earnings, margins and market share, and produce the best performance in the history of not only the company, but the entire industry.
In the second quarter, we generated record adjusted pre-tax title margins of $688 million compared to $378 million in the year ago quarter and a 22.7% adjusted pre-tax title margin compared with 18.4% in the second quarter of 2020.
Our margin for the quarter matches our record setting margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2020 and benefited from our investments in technology, operations and automation over the years as we have worked to improve our efficiency in our title business and maximize our profitability over market cycles.
Looking forward, we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy as we remain committed to long-term value creation for our shareholders, while also focusing on supporting the future growth of our business.
Given our strong earnings and cash flows through the first half of the year, yesterday we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share, an increase of 11% from our previous quarterly dividend and our Board authorized a 3-year share repurchase program of up to 25 million shares.
