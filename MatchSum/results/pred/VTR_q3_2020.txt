The Ventas team is dispersed but unified in spirit as we join you for today's call.
I'd like to provide an overview of our consistent strategy, discuss our third quarter results, highlight how we are driving our research and innovation business forward, describe our competitive advantage and managing institutional third-party capital and touch on the positive senior housing operating trends that continue into October.
Our enterprise continues to benefit significantly from our steady commitment over decades and various cycles to asset class operator and geographical diversification.
We aim to generate reliable growing cash flows from a high-quality diverse portfolio of assets on a strong balance sheet.
We've seen that staying disciplined about diversification has protected the downside and also provided myriad opportunities for our stakeholders.
First, our diversified portfolio is enabling the company to remain strong and stable, despite the disruption occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected our different asset classes and geographies in non-correlated way.
Our medical office, research and innovation business and our healthcare triple-net lease business now represents over half of our enterprise.
The South San Francisco market consistently ranks as one of the elite life science clusters.
