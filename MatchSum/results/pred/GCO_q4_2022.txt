A very strong holiday season concluded an outstanding year.
Throughout fiscal '22, we accelerated our recovery from the pandemic and delivered record results for our footwear companies even as we navigated a number of acute challenges.
Our exceptional results underscore the earnings power of our business model, the solid foundation for growth we built through the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, and the successful execution of our footwear-focused strategy.
We grew revenue more than 35% over last year and 10% over fiscal '20.
Gross margin expansion and meaningful expense leverage drove record operating income for our footwear businesses as we achieved an operating margin above 6%.
We generated $240 million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $80 million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to 9% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $7.62, an increase of more than 65% over fiscal '20.
Trend-driven teens who are looking for the most current assortment of fashion footwear that is always evolving, whether they want to make a statement to stand out or want to fit in and be just like their friends, come to Journeys and Schuh to buy multiple brands and seek advice from our knowledgeable fashion advisor salespeople in our youth-focused full-service environment.
The effects from the pandemic on how consumers shop rather than harming our business was instead the catalyst to reach new heights.
