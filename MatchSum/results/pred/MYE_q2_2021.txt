I am pleased to share that we had another quarter of strong sales growth and continue to make good progress in advancing our long-term vision.
On top of that, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of Trilogy Plastics, which marks our second acquisition in the last nine months and another proof point in the execution of Horizon one of our long-term strategy.
The acquisition of Trilogy continue to grow our rotational molding platform, and we have included a slide in the appendix of our slide deck today with more background for you.
And in some cases, were more than we anticipated.
And also note that Trilogy is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings per share in the current fiscal year.
Other key modeling assumptions include depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $23 million and capex of approximately $15 million to $18 million.
