And finally, a few admin items.
First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices.
Our consolidated same-store sales calculation include stores that we temporarily closed last year as a result of COVID-19.
Accordingly, our method of calculation might not be the same as other retailers.
Accordingly, we will compare 2021 sales and earnings results against both 2019 and 2020.
And lastly, for your future scheduling purposes, we are tentatively planning to publish our fourth quarter 2021 earnings results before the market opens on March 8, 2022, with our subsequent earnings call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
And our second Public Land store recently opened, focusing on the outdoor activities.
Looking ahead, I couldn't be more excited about the future of DICK's Sporting Goods.
