Bob will cover our fourth quarter results in greater depth, and then I will then come back to provide our expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and provide an update on how our balance sheet, liquidity and land spending will support our growth objectives for 2021 and beyond.
My comments will then be followed by a wrap-up by Allan.
In the beginning of our fiscal year, we laid out three strategic goals for 2020.
At that time, we had no idea the global economy would be turned upside down by a pandemic.
First, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by more than 10% as gross margins expanded to reflect the benefits of product simplification and the price improvements we achieved.
By historical standards, we've built far fewer new homes in the last decade than population growth, household formation or job growth would have predicted.
And those families have been living somewhere.
Fourth quarter land spending of $116 million, but our full year total spend of $441 million, it was about $100 million below the amount we generated from the land related to home closings, reflecting the deliberate pause in spending we undertook at the onset of the COVID pandemic.
