Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures.
I'd like to take some time today to discuss highlights from 2020 and our plans for 2021.
2020 was an incredible year for Dun & Bradstreet.
Returning to the public markets last July was a major milestone for our company and allowed us to raise approximately $2.4 billion.
The net IPO proceeds allowed us to pay down our entire preferred equity, and 40% of both are secured and unsecured notes.
This significantly improved our financial profile and is saving us more than $175 million of annual dividend and interest expense.
With our lower leverage and increased cash flow, we now have significantly more financial flexibility to accelerate our growth strategy, both organically and inorganically.
The business came with a combination of Dun & Bradstreet products along with some legacy disparate solutions.
