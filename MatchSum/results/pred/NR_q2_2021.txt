Second quarter EBITDA generation was $7 million.
As anticipated, coming off the exceptionally strong first quarter product sales, segment revenues declined 15% sequentially to $45 million in the second quarter as site access product sales pulled back to $10 million for the quarter.
Partially offsetting the product sales reduction, rental and service revenues improved 15% sequentially, contributing $33 million of revenue in the second quarter, including a record $25 million contribution from the power transmission and other industrial end markets, reflecting strong performance both in the United States and in the United Kingdom.
Industrial Blending revenues also pulled back to $2 million in the second quarter, reflecting the anticipated impact of product transition with our primary customer.
With the lower revenue, our Industrial Solutions operating margins declined modestly to 22% in the second quarter, generating $15 million of EBITDA.
Reflecting on our first half 2021 performance, it's worth highlighting that the power transmission and other industrial end markets contributed $75 million of our Site and Access Solutions revenues.
Despite the revenue growth and positive earnings contributions from our international businesses, the Fluids segment remained below EBITDA breakeven in the second quarter, impacted by elevated operating expenses, including employee severance and cost associated with our ongoing inventory rationalization efforts.
In addition, the quarter is impacted by an unfavorable sales mix on U.S. land, which we expect to normalize going forward.
