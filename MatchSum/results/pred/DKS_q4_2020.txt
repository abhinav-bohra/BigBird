And finally, a couple of admin items.
First, a note on our same-store sales reporting practices.
Our consolidated same-store sales calculation include stores that were temporarily closed as a result of COVID-19.
The method of calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry, including the treatment of temporary store closures as a result of COVID-19.
Accordingly, our method of calculation may not be the same as other retailers.
We've never had quite a year like 2020.
As we reopened our stores, the health and safety of our teammates and athletes was our highest priority, and we established protocols and procedures to provide a safe shopping experience.
Our frontline hourly associates and distribution center teammates went above and beyond in 2020, and we showed our appreciation to our premium pay program.
