As a reminder, during the call we will discuss non-GAAP metrics.
Before I hand the call over, I'd like to remind our investors and analysts about our upcoming virtual Investor Fireside Chat, taking place on November 17th from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM Central Time during the 2021 PROS Outperform conference.
We ended the quarter with significant outperformance on our guidance ranges for profitability and cash flow, and delivered revenue results in line with our expected ranges.
We did see impact from the Delta variant in our Q3 results and our Q4 outlook.
Our strategy is to accelerate market adoption of the PROS Platform, deliver an incredible experience and drive significant value for our customers.
Despite the challenges we faced because of COVID-19, our team continues to execute well against our strategy.
This demonstrates the pent-up demand for travel, both leisure and business, and energizes us for the pace of recovery heading into 2022, as more borders open.
Historically, this market segment didn't have access to the best-of-breed, AI-powered revenue management solutions.
