As I reflected on the past year, it's hard to contextualize what our country has been through in the opening weeks of 2021, let alone all of 2020.
With unprecedented turmoil in Washington, an economy still rocked by the coronavirus pandemic, now seemingly populist revolt under way on Wall Street, it's hard for any investor to navigate all the tumult and volatility.
So we feel all the more fortunate to have emerged from such an unprecedented year in a renewed position of strength.
It's motivated us to make 2021 the best year in our company's history.
We exited 2020 with momentum building across both of our platforms, including record lock volumes in residential lending and very strong originations and contribution from business purpose lending.
