The U.S. air travel recovery has been strong and has come back faster than some expected.
TSA traveler throughput has exceeded two million passengers on multiple days during the past two months and some days in July where passenger screenings exceeded the 2019 levels.
A recent International Air Transport Association report indicates domestic passenger market show improvement, but with demand still down 22% versus June 2019 levels.

We are pleased to see the rebound of demand for the MAX and the news of large orders from United, Southwest, Alaska Air and Ryanair.
We expect store units will decrease to about 100 shipsets by the end of the year.
Additionally, the increase in other income is primarily related to Belfast pension plan and the absence of voluntary retirement expenses recognized in the second quarter of 2020.
I do want to mention that there was a revaluation of deferred tax assets during the second quarter of 2021 due to a future increase of the United Kingdom's corporate tax rate.
