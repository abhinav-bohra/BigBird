The efforts of our team resulted in several highlights in our performance, which I'll go into shortly.
As many of you are also aware, we held our annual Analyst Day meeting on November 10, 2021.
During this virtual event, we described our portfolio and go-to-market plans for SolarWinds, our expanding market opportunity, which we believe will amount to approximately $60 billion by 2025; and our goal to achieve at least $1 billion in ARR by 2025, with a compounded annual subscription ARR growth north of 30% over that time period; and then building to EBITDA margins in the mid-40s.
As I mentioned earlier, we had several highlights in the fourth quarter of 2021.
I'll touch on some of the highlights before turning it over to Bart for more color on the fourth quarter, as well as our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2022.
For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenues of $186.7 million, above the high end of the range we provided of $180 million to $184 million.
For the full year, we delivered $719 million of GAAP revenues, representing flat year-over-year performance relative to 2020; and adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, representing a 42% EBITDA margin while growing subscription revenue 19% year over year on a GAAP basis.
We anticipate both our license and subscription revenues to grow in 2022, reflecting a recovery in sales to new and existing customers and further expanding our recurring revenue base.
