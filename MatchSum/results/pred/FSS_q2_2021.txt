In addition, we will file our Form 10-Q later today.
In summary, we delivered another outstanding quarter with operating results exceeding our expectations despite dramatic increases in commodity costs and ongoing supply chain disruption, including factors linked to the global shortage in semiconductors.
As a reminder, in the prior year quarter, we also took several cost saving actions in response to the uncertainty created by the pandemic, which reduced our costs in Q2 last year by approximately $14 million.
While most of these savings were either temporary cost reductions or volume related, some were more permanent actions.
In Q2 this year, the return of many of these costs represented a year-over-year expense headwind of approximately $5 million.
Consolidated net sales for the quarter were $335 million, up $65 million or 24% compared to last year.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.50 per share, an improvement of 19% compared to $0.42 per share last year.
Order intake for the quarter was again outstanding with orders of $361 million representing an increase of $159 million or 79% compared to Q2 last year.
