During today's call, I want to leave you with three things.
First, we have fundamentally restructured our business to be more profitable.
In 2021, we delivered an all-time record adjusted earnings per share of $7.33, eclipsing our previous high of $5.60 in 2018.
And our operating margin of 8.6% exceeded our goal of 7% to 8% two years ahead of plan.
In addition, the board has authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program, and we plan to repurchase at least $1 billion this year, of which $500 million is expected to be repurchased through open market transactions or an accelerated share repurchase program executed in Q2 2022.
In addition, we are focused on running our business the right way.
We look to build on this momentum in 2022 by dedicating more space and expanding each of these brands.
Let me now turn to women's, which is an important business for Kohl's.
