First, let me take a moment to recognize all of our talented team members for their determination and commitment in 2020, which enabled Aaron's to accelerate our key strategic priorities in a very challenging year.
Our fantastic team members at our stores, distribution and service centers, Woodhaven manufacturing and store support center worked tirelessly to provide products and services to our customers, while accelerating our digital and real estate transformation.
We overcame the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, while continuing to meet the needs of our customers and safeguarding our team members.
At the same time, we delivered annual revenues that exceeded our expectations for the year and an adjusted EBITDA that was higher than we've generated in several years.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, same-store revenues rose 3.4% as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to strong customer payment activity, improving lease portfolio size and higher retail sales.
The fourth quarter was the sixth out of the last eight quarters with positive same-store comps, with 2020 representing the first annual positive same-store revenue growth since 2013.
