As we previously disclosed, Bruce Duncan has retired from our Board.
As many of you know, Bruce has taken on a new challenge as CEO of another REIT.
Bruce joined First Industrial as our CEO in 2009 during a difficult period and provided tremendous leadership to help stabilize and transform our business model and portfolio.
We wish Bruce well in his new role.
Our regional teams have done a fantastic job in the second quarter on collections.
As of yesterday, we have collected 98% of 2Q monthly rental billings and so far, we've collected 97% of July billings, which is ahead of the pace we experienced in the second quarter.
