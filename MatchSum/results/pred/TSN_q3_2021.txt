Today, on my first earnings call as CEO, I am incredibly proud to stand alongside our team members to continue that legacy.
Let's begin with the view of our overall performance this quarter.
First, our retail performance.
12 consecutive quarters of retail share gains in our core business lines is driven by strength of our brands, along with solid execution from our team.
Fourth, we continue to build financial strength.
This quarter, we used higher operating cash flow to reduce debt.
I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments.
The second imperative is to improve operational performance.
