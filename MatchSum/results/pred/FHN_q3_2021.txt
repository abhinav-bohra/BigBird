I'm pleased with the continued progress across our company this quarter and believe that our results demonstrate the benefit of our more diversified model.
We delivered earnings per share of $0.50 a share and a return on tangible common equity of over 18% on an adjusted basis, despite the near-term headwinds that the industry is facing with continued pressure on short-term rates and strong competition given growing levels of excess liquidity and muted loan demand.
Given the continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment as markets reopen, I'm increasingly confident that our client-focused value proposition with a broad product set positions us well to be nimble and focus on the key segments where we can differentiate.
Our net interest-bearing deposits declined 3 basis points -- our net interest deposit cost declined 3 basis points in the quarter.
The team is intensely focused on moving our costs toward peer median, and we think we are well positioned to hit the target sometime next year.
