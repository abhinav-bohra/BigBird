Before we speak about third-quarter results, I want to share with you about the progress made in each element of our AEL 2.0 strategy that was first unveiled around this time, last year.
We outlined the building blocks in order to execute the strategy, improve returns, and migrate to the capital-efficient business model we envisioned.
We introduced the virtuous flywheel of the due [Phonetic] AEL business model going forward.
The virtuous flywheel starts with an industry-leading, at-scale annuity origination platform.
We delivered a complete refresh of our general account product suite, regained relevance and growth in our IMO distribution channel, and built additional distribution with Eagle Life while adding talent to improve productivity and product economics.
Over the course of this year, we have established our investment management pillar capabilities necessary to be fully invested in core fixed-income assets managed by BlackRock and Corning, and private assets managed by American Equity or its strategically aligned investment managers.
The latter will be our focus with our AEL Bermuda Reinsurance entity that we expect to go live around the end of this year with plans progressing well for it.
On the Brookfield Reinsurance transaction, we executed both in-force and new business flow reinsurance, effective July 1.
