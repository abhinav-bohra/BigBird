We hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy.
Then I'll offer some commentary on our 2021 outlook, with the understanding that there remains substantial uncertainty surrounding these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could change guidance significantly.
However, before I begin, I would like to say a few words about this past year.
2020 has certainly been one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember.
I'm extremely proud of our entire SCI team for going above and beyond the call of duty in 2020.
The health, safety, and well-being of our SCI family was a top priority.
Virtual arrangements, live streaming of services, outdoor services, drive-through visitations, radio transmitted graveside services, and many more unique memorialization and celebration of life ideas are now a normal part of what we do.
The success and acceleration of these enhanced service offerings have highlighted the importance of innovation in our industry.
