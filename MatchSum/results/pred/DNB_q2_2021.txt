Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures.
The second quarter was another quarter of solid progress as revenues grew 24.4% and EBITDA grew 12.6%.
Organic revenue growth accelerated to 2.8%, fueled by low double-digit growth in international and low single-digit growth in North America.
The sequential improvement in organic growth was driven by new logo wins, increased cross-sell, continued strong retention, and the lessening of previously communicated headwinds.
We also saw strong sales in the building pipeline for our new solutions, both domestically and internationally, as businesses look to leverage more of our solutions to support their post-pandemic operating models.
We expect to see a continued ramp in the third and fourth quarters as we execute against our near-term growth strategy and have continued to strengthen the business for the long term with new talent, data assets, partnerships, and solutions that continue to bolster our offerings and provide our clients differentiated insights that help them grow revenues, lower operating costs, and improve the risk and compliance profile.
And finally, before I move on to the business update, I wanted to share a very special milestone here at Dun & Bradstreet.
On July 20, we celebrated our 180th year anniversary, which is a testament to the long-standing value D&B has and continues to provide to businesses throughout the world.
