With net sales for Q1 up by over 20% and net income up by a factor of six, I'm pleased with our overall results.
This is a good start to the year and stands in stark contrast to Q1 of 2020 when the global pandemic started.
The bright spot for us was herbicides for corn, soybeans, fruits and vegetables, which recorded an increase of 86% in net sales and 60% increase in gross profit.
We enjoyed sales increases among our corn soil insecticides, however, they were offset by decreased sales in Bidrin, our cotton insecticide, as our customers work through inventories carried over from last year when there was low pest pressure.
Further, our soil fumigants sales declined by about 10%, due largely to water allocation issues in California.
We expect the factory efficiency will improve over the course of current year.
In summary then, in the first quarter of 2021, we have increased sales by 21%, seen manufacturing output lower than the prior year and taken a higher level of under recovery factory costs as a consequence.
Overall margins have remained in the normal range for the company.
