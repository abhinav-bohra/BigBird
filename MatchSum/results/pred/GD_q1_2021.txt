Operating earnings are up $4 million, and net earnings are up $2 million.
To be a little more granular, revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year's first quarter by $444 million, and aerospace is up $196 million.
The operating earnings on the defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus.
I will have more to say about this a bit later.
The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter.
This was driven by a 250-basis-point lower margin rate at aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense.
That's down between 25% and 30% from the first quarter a year ago, but we're still expecting full-year capex to be roughly 2.5% of sales.
We also paid $315 million in dividends and increased the quarterly dividend by a little more than 8% to $1.19 per share.
