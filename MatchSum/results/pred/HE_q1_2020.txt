Hawaii is facing an unprecedented challenge from COVID-19 and we're especially mindful of the essential roles our companies play.
Through our utility we provide reliable electricity to keep our hospitals homes and essential businesses running.
And through our bank we help ensure money keeps flowing through our economy.
Continuing to provide these vital services while protecting the health of our customers as well as our employees has been a core focus.
In Hawaii we talk about our special culture of Aloha and of Kuleana our responsibility to others.
And it's a culture that has served us well in managing the public health impacts of COVID-19.
Post 9/11 and post the Great Recession tourism came back strongly.
Our bank has served our state for 95 years and has a conservative risk culture lending practices and loan portfolio.
