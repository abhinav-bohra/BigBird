I'm pleased to report our continued improvement in our profitability and cash flow generated for the first quarter.
First-quarter funds from operation was $934 million or $2.48 per share.
FFO increased approximately $150 million or $0.31 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.
And in fact, the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately $0.08 per share compared to our expectations given the closures that have occurred internationally.
We also recorded additional COVID impacts in the first quarter of approximately $0.07 per share from -- based upon basically domestic rent abatements and uncollectible rents.
We generated $875 million in cash from operations in the quarter, which was an increase of 18% compared to the prior-year period.
Pricing continues to improve with the average opening rate per square foot for the trailing 12 months of approximately $60 per foot.
And as you can see in the lease expiration schedule included in our supplemental, our expiring rents for the next few years are less than $60 per square foot.
