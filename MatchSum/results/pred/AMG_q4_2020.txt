Throughout this period, AMG remained committed to our fundamental principles.
That investment performance is about skill, not scale.
As a result, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy with excellence and discipline.
Our affiliates built on their strong long-term performance records, demonstrating their ability to distinguish themselves across market cycles, including during volatile periods like 2020.
Today, approximately three-quarters of our products are outperforming their long-term benchmarks on an EBITDA basis.
Overall, AMG emerged from the unprecedented events of 2020 in an even stronger position than we entered the year.
With our enhanced capital position and substantial free cash flow, we deployed more than $800 million across the combination of growth investments and share repurchases, including new partnerships with Comvest, Jackson Square and Boston Common while simultaneously repurchasing 10% of our shares over the course of the year.
AMG had a strong finish to 2020 but the results do not fully capture the magnitude of the earnings power heading into 2021, during which significant market, business performance and new investment tailwinds will further contribute to our earnings growth.
