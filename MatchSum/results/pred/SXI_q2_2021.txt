We're very pleased with our fiscal second quarter results.
We had solid revenue growth at Electronics and Scientific segments year-on-year, while our Engraving segment margin improved sequentially.
At Electronics nearly half of the 31% year-on-year revenue increase reflected organic growth with positive trends in electric vehicles, general automotive, appliances and semiconductor equipment.
Scientific revenue continued to grow at a double-digit rate with a 16% year-on-year increase driven by strong demand for COVID vaccine storage.
We now believe that COVID related storage demand is likely to be at the higher end of our previously indicated $10 million to $20 million range in fiscal 2021.
At the Engraving segment, margin improved approximately 100 basis points sequentially due to favorable geographic mix, productivity and cost actions.
Looking forward, our portfolio has never been in better condition and that's reflected in our outlook.
We are on track for over $7 million in annual savings in fiscal 2021 from cost actions and are implementing additional productivity and efficiency initiatives, which will provide further opportunity heading into fiscal 2022.
