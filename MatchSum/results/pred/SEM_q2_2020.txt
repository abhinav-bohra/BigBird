We continue to adapt, evolve and innovate as we navigate through the pandemic.
As I mentioned on our last earnings call, the effect of the pandemic began to impact our company in mid-March.
In our critical illness recovery hospitals, we have held steady during the second quarter on census and our occupancy in light of some of the challenges COVID presents, while our cost of care has increased, we have seen increased occupancy and revenues every month throughout the pandemic.
In our rehabilitation hospitals, we had to temporarily restricted missions in our New Jersey and Miami markets in April and early May due to COVID outbreaks in those regions.
This had the effect of reduced volume and higher cost in those markets.
We also incurred additional cost to care for our patients and other markets.
In June however we saw meaningful improvement as states began to ease restrictions in hospitals and surgery centers began performing elective surgeries again.
Volume and revenue shortfalls in June compared to prior year were 19.7% and 17.8% respectively which was a significant improvement from April and May and we experienced positive adjusted EBITDA in June.
