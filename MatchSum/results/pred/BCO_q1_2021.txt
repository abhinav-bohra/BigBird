Accordingly, our comments today focus primarily on the non-GAAP results.
Our strong first quarter results were driven by the ongoing successful integration of G4S acquisitions and our fixed cost reductions, which more than offset the impact of extended pandemic shutdowns, mostly in Europe.
On a reported basis, revenue was up 12%, operating profit grew 43%, reflecting a margin increase of 200 basis points to 99.2%.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 32%, with margin improvement of 210 basis points to 14%, and earnings per share grew 64% to $0.82 per share.
It's important to remember that we're comparing to a year ago quarter that was not materially affected by COVID-19.
In fact, until the last week or so of March we start seeing those impacts.
So we're quite encouraged by the fact that on an organic basis, this year's first quarter revenue was down only 6%, while operating profit increased 30%, reflecting an operating margin improvement, as we said earlier of 200 basis points and we expect this leverage and margin expansion to continue as revenues recover.
Together G4S and PAI are expected to add approximately $130 million in adjusted EBITDA this year and more next year as revenue growth returns and full run rate synergies are full -- are realized.
