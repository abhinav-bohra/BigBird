I will focus on some highlights and key metrics.
Vishay reported revenues for Q4 of 610 million.
EPS was $0.10 for the quarter.
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.13 for the quarter.
During the quarter, we recorded restructuring charges of $17 million related to the cost reduction program we announced in July.
EBITDA was 60 million or 9.9%.
Mathematically, this yields a normalized tax rate of 36% for Q4, impacted by the cumulative catch-up and low pre-tax earnings in Q4.
We expect our normalized effective tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 26% to 27%.
