We closed on the acquisition of Apple Leisure Group on November 1, and we are collectively even more thrilled about the prospects for the combined company today than we were when we first announced our plans back in August.
As I reflect over the past several months during which I've gotten to know the ALG team much better, met with hotel owners and toured a number of stunning AMR collection resorts.
I'm energized and really excited about the bright future for ALG as a part of Hyatt.
And the timing is proving to be very auspicious as leisure demand continues to be durable and a growing proportion of our segment mix.
We look forward to keeping you well informed on the progress of our integration efforts and performance of the ALG platform moving forward.
Turning to our results.
We are another quarter into the recovery and have again produced results that demonstrate the strength of our business and reinforce that we are emerging from this challenging period as a more agile and stronger company.
RevPAR in the third quarter continued to recover at a robust pace, accelerating nearly 30% compared to the second quarter and doubling RevPAR levels in the first quarter.
