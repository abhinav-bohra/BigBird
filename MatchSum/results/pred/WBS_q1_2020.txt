CFO, Glenn MacInnes and I will review business and financial performance for the quarter.
I will also provide some additional information on the line of business performance and COVID-19 related activities across the bank.
I hope that all of you and your loved ones are healthy and safe.
And I want to let those whose health has been impacted by the crisis know that the Webster Bank family has you in our thoughts.
I'm so proud of the entire Webster team.
Webster Bank and the entire banking industry has rallied to be part of the solution to this health crisis and the resulting economic fallout.
We established a no-interest loan program for our employees whose families had been financially impacted by the pandemic.
We've paid all of our employees at 100% of pay, including those who are home because of illness, quarantine, higher health risk or to take care of loved ones or kids home because of school closures.
