While National Fuel's expectations, beliefs and projections are made in good faith and are believed to have a reasonable basis, actual results may differ materially.
National Fuel's first quarter was a great start to our fiscal year, with operating results up 5% year-over-year.
Operationally, we had a really strong quarter, particularly at Seneca and NFG Midstream, where in spite of 4 Bcf of pricing-related curtailments, production and the associated gathering throughput was up 36% over last year.
Most of that growth was the result of last year's Tioga County acquisition, which continues to trend better than our initial expectations.
The team has been focused on high-grading our consolidated development program, optimizing our firm sales and transportation portfolio and driving down unit costs.
You can see our success in Seneca's updated guidance.
We increased the midpoint of our production range and lowered our forecasted unit costs, all while holding our capital range constant.
As our production grows in 2022 and 2023, we expect this level of free cash flow to similarly increase.
