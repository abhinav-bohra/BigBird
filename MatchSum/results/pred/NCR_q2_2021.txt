Tim will then review our financial performance and an outlook into the second half of 2021.
Let's begin on Slide 4 with some highlights from the second quarter.
NCR delivered strong performance that included accelerated revenue growth, significant margin expansion and strong cash flow production.
In the second quarter, we delivered 13% total revenue growth.
This includes 11% growth for NCR stand-alone and an incremental 2% growth for the 10 days following the close of the Cardtronics transaction.
NCR stand-alone recurring revenue growth grew 11% over second quarter of 2020.
I want to provide an update on the Cardtronics transaction.
And free cash flow during the first six months of 2021 is up more than 60% over 2020 results.
