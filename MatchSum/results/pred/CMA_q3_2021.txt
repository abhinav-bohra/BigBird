Our focus remains on managing expenses while supporting our revenue-generating activities.

Significant progress was made on PPP forgiveness, reducing these loans about $1.8 billion or 64% on a period-end basis.
And of course, the incremental income in year two compared to the year one increase would be yet higher.
Credit quality was excellent, as shown on slide nine.
