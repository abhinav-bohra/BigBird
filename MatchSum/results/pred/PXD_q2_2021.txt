Obviously, we're very excited after talking about it for 18 months to announce that we are both accelerating our first variable dividend payment into the third quarter this year as well as increasing the payment to reflect 75% of second quarter free cash flow.
In addition, we had two highly accretive transactions that also led us to making this decision and accelerating.
When combined with the base dividend, total dividend payments in the third quarter will be greater than $2 per share, or a total of approximately $490 million return to shareholders during the third quarter alone.
The initiation of our variable dividend payments marks a significant milestone in our investment framework as shareholders will begin receiving material cash return through eight dividend checks per year.
Pioneer's strong execution continued during the second quarter, with production near the top end of guidance, delivering over $600 million of free cash flow, driving estimated 2021 free cash flow up to about $3.2 billion.
Lastly, Pioneer is the largest producer in the Permian, with the largest inventory of Tier one locations, over 15,000, and the lowest breakeven price in the Lower 48.
Pioneer's execution remains strong as total production and oil production were in the upper half of our guidance ranges as we successfully integrated DoublePoint's operations into our program.
Horizontal lease operating expense dropped by nearly $0.25 per BOE when compared to the first quarter.
