And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%.
I think our performance over recent quarters has reached a new level of scale and it speaks to the resiliency and agility of our colleagues, as well as our operational excellence, amid a time of enormous transition and secular change.
Today, wherever and whenever strategy meets talent, Korn Ferry is at that cross section, enabling agility in a world that will undoubtedly be in transition for the next several years.
Our strategy in the New Year will be to continue to innovate, replicate, and scale, allowing people and organizations to exceed their potential in this rapidly changing world.
Elements of our strategy will include driving a top-down go-to-market strategy, through our Marquee and Regional Accounts, which represent about 36% of our portfolio and that not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships, but is also key to more scalable and durable revenues.
For example, in the quarter, about 30% of our revenue was driven by cross referrals within our firm, demonstrating the effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy.
Although our search businesses, both Pro Search and Executive Search combined represent about 45% of our revenue, we believe there is still substantial market opportunity ahead, given the acceleration of an increasingly nomadic labor market.
Looking ahead, I truly feel we have the strategy, the people, the diversity of solutions and expertise to help our clients drive performance in this new world and our results clearly reflect this reality.
