Compared to the prior year period, sales were up 14% from $401 million to 405 -- $455 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 206% from $0.17 per share to $0.52 per share.
Our sales to commercial customers increased 52% and our sales to government and defense customers decreased 17%.
We are particularly pleased that our sequential growth from Q4, Q1 was 4%, notwithstanding the fact that our first quarter typically declines from our fourth quarter as a result of seasonality in our business.
Sequential growth in our commercial activities was 17%.
Notably, the significant majority of our MRO volume has been on standard maintenance work as opposed to catch-up work.
Our operating margin was 5.5% for the quarter on an adjusted basis up from 2.5% last year and 5.2% in the fourth quarter.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced several new business wins.
First, we announced an exclusive agreement with Arkwin, a TransDigm company to distribute engine actuation and other commercial aviation product.
