At the Utility, our year-to-date results have benefited from our focus on cost management and efficiency and from timing items expected to reverse in the balance of the year.
We expect the Utility to remain within its full-year guidance range announced in February.
The improved Hawaii economy and strengthened credit quality of our Bank loan portfolio were key drivers of our results year-to-date and, in the second quarter, enabled the Bank to release a portion of its reserves for credit losses resulting in a negative provision for the quarter.
We are again increasing our full-year Bank and consolidated guidance, which Greg will cover shortly.
We've seen strengthening in Hawaii's economy with the reopening of our local economy and rebound of tourism.
For July, median prices of Oahu's single-family homes were up 22% and sales volume was up 12% over last year.
For condos, prices were up 8% and sales were up 58%.
