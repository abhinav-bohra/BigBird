Our CFO, Steve Cocchi, will then review our third quarter and year-to-date operational performance and financial outlook.
Mike will conclude by offering some closing remarks.
Through the first nine months, we have seen economic earnings increase by 12% or approximately $12 million, reflecting solid performance in both our utility and nonutility businesses.
Consistent with our strategy, our utilities, South Jersey Gas and Elizabethtown Gas represent the bulk of our earnings.
Utility margin growth remained strong, reflecting above-average customer growth, positive rate case outcomes, infrastructure modernization programs and effective O&M management.
Natural gas remains in strong demand across New Jersey with our utilities adding more than 12,000 new customers over the last 12 months.
As you know, the BPU has called utilities in New Jersey to evaluate preparedness for potential gas supply interruptions.
