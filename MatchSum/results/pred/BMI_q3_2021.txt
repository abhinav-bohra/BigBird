I'm not sure how often in the term supply chain challenges or inflation are going to be referenced during the quarterly earnings cycle over the next month, but I can only imagine it's going to be an all-time record.
These strategic and tactical actions by our world-class team allowed us to deliver record sales and earnings this quarter, while we added to our already record backlog.
Turning to Slide 4.
Our total sales for the third quarter were $128.7 million, an increase of 13.3% over the $113.6 million in the same period last year.
Total utility water product line sales increased 12.2%.
Excluding approximately $10 million of sales from the s::can and ATI acquisitions, core utility water revenues increased 1.7% year-over-year.
The flow instrumentation product line did not escape the impact of production limitations from component shortages, but delivered a strong 18.5% year-over-year increase in sales.
Improved demand trends across the majority of global end markets and applications as well as an easier comparison led to the increase year-over-year.
