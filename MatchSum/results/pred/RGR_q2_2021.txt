We do reference non-GAAP EBITDA.
For the second quarter of 2021, net sales were $200.1 million and diluted earnings were $2.50 per share.
For the comparable prior year period, net sales were $130.3 million and diluted earnings were $1.05 per share.
For the first six months of 2021, net sales were $384.4 million and diluted earnings were $4.66 per share.
For the corresponding period in 2020, net sales were $253.9 million and diluted earnings were $1.91 per share.
The substantial increase in profitability for the second quarter was attributable to the increase in sales and production, resulting in favorable leveraging of fixed costs including depreciation, engineering and other indirect labor expenses, a significant reduction in sales promotional activities and improved labor efficiencies.
Our balance sheet at July 3, 2021, remains rock solid.
Our cash and short-term investments, which are invested in UST bills, totaled $173.6 million.
