Many of these risks and uncertainties are and will be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result.
Last evening, we reported strong fourth quarter results with organic revenue up 5%, EBITDA up 9% and earnings per share up 21%.
These results exceeded our expectations and each of our segments delivered positive organic growth and strong margin performance in the quarter.
This performance is especially strong given its comparison against a pre-COVID environment and is a result of the work we've done to gain market share and reduce our cost structure.
During today's call, and in the months ahead, we will explain and demonstrate why you should continue to expect differentiated performance from H.B. Fuller.
We outperformed the market in meeting these needs.
Cash flow from operations increased 27% year-over-year, and enabled us to pay down a total of $205 million of debt for the year, above our original $200 million target.
Our results in the fourth quarter and throughout the year reinforced the resiliency of H.B. Fuller's strategy.
