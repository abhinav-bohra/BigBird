EBITDA grew 119% versus year ago this quarter -- this year and then up 62% versus two years ago, so both give us a strong start for fiscal 2022.
So Craig and Eddie will take you through those details in the next few minutes, but here are four trends that we're seeing coming out of the first quarter.
The first one is the diversity of our geographic portfolio, it is a strong positive for us, so this quarter, Brazil and Asia had a very strong Q1.
North America came in right above what we forecasted, but they could have done better.
The labor shortages in the U.S. kept us from producing to demand, and we expect that that headwinds probably going to persist through quarter two.
And then in the second half of the year, we expect to see some improvement in that trend.
Then, I think you can expect North America to start contributing more to our growth.
And the fourth trend is labor and labor in the U.S. is a challenge right now.
