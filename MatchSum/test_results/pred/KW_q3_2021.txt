I'm very pleased with our strong third quarter results, which saw EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA increased over 165% compared to Q3 of 2020 and the record results we have posted for the first nine months of the year.
Adjusted EBITDA totaled $741 million thus far in 2021, compared to $261 million for the first nine months of 2020.
We had a very active quarter, completing $1.8 billion of investment transactions, bringing our year-to-date total to $4.4 billion.
Our assets under management has grown by 17% in 2021 to a record $20.5 billion, from $17.6 billion at the end of 2020.
We have a strong pipeline of new transactions that we expect to close by the end of the year, which would further increase our AUM and result in a record year of capital deployment for KW.
Global transaction volumes remain healthy, with Q3 volumes in the U.S. increasing 150% from last year's levels, according to Real Capital Analytics.
We also saw significant improvements in our Pacific Northwest and California portfolio, as pandemic-related moratoriums began to burn off, and we expect meaningful rent growth in all of these areas over the next 15 months.
In Europe, we saw outstanding performance in our U.K. and Dublin properties.
