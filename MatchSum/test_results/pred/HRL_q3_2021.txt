Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results and commentary regarding the company's current and future financial condition.
It will be posted on our website and archived for one year.
Before we get started, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement.
It can be accessed on our website.
In the third quarter, our team delivered the highest quarterly sales in the company's 130-year history, while operating in an environment, which included inflationary pressures and industrywide supply chain challenges.
The proof is in our performance this quarter.
Sales increased 20% and segment profit increased 1%.
Brands, including SPAM, Hormel Complete and Wholly showed excellent growth in the quarter.
