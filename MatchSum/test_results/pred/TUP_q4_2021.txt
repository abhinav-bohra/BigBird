In 2020, our priority was to stabilize the company.
In 2021, our priority was to build a foundation for omnichannel growth.
And while we focus on building a strong foundation in 2021, we reported both top and bottom-line growth in 2020 and in 2021.
First, what has been accomplished.
We had to rightsize our cost structure to survive in 2020, carry that fiscal rigor into 2021, and successfully stabilize the company.
We reorganized and upgraded talent to help us fix and stabilize our direct selling business.
And we have been working with retailers around the world to take limited amount of products into new channels, and we closed the year ahead of our objective of $50 million in B2B revenue, which is product sales sold through retails in their loyalty programs.
We accomplished top and bottom-line growth in 2021, while continuing to execute on our turnaround plan.
