We're going to start with Slide 4, where you'll see there's four key messages that we're trying to communicate.
First, silver as fundamental to the transition to the lower carbon energy, with solar power being a key renewable to make it happen.
Silver demand for the use -- to be used for it, energy, has increased and is continuing to increase.
The United States Energy Information Agency projects that silver demand for solar will be half a billion ounces annually.
Realize the current silver market is only a little more than a billion ounces, so that's a huge increase in the demand for silver for energy use.
Second message, for the transition to solar power to happen, you really have to have a reliable supply chain.
And so to do that, you need silver mined in reliable countries.
Now we mined 86% of our tons last year with the UCB method, but we we didn't speak about this until almost the end of the year because we wanted to make sure we understood how the cycle worked, confirmed how it would improve our seismicity management, determine how we manage dilution, and consider the impacts on the workforce.
