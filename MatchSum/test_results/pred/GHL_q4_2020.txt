These statements are based on our current expectations regarding future events that, by their nature, are outside of the firm's control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
We reported fourth quarter revenue of $140.7 million, which was our best quarterly performance ever, an operating margin of 57% and net income of $2.71 per share.
For the year, we had revenue of $311.7 million, an operating margin of 18% and net income of $1.36 per share.
Our quarterly revenue was up 32% and earnings per share was up 158% from the same period last year.
For the full year, our revenue was up 4% and earnings per share was up 202% from the prior year.
In sum, we had a very strong finish to the year, resulting in very respectable pandemic year results on the top and bottom line, all consistent with our commentary on the past couple of quarterly investor calls.
Clearly, quarterly revenue, of the scale we achieved requires a lot of things to go right.
We benefited from particularly strong results from our European M&A business and our U.S. restructuring business.
