Second quarter earnings were impacted by COVID and CECL as the provision for loan losses and expenditures related to providing a safe environment for our customers, employees took priority as we phased our staff-back-to-office process and afforded our customers full branch access.
On a positive yet related note, we had expenses for the planned acquisition of SB One of $683,000 during the quarter and look to complete the closing tomorrow.
We remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength.
In view of our capital and pre-tax pre-provision earnings expectations, the Board approved a $0.23 cash dividend.
Net income for the quarter was $14.3 million or $0.22 per share.
Net interest margin decreased 23 basis points linked quarter to 2.97% as the impact of lower rates and higher cash balances was partially offset by lower deposit costs and above-average growth in noninterest-bearing deposits.
The impact on our net interest margin from the short end of the curve is now largely behind us, but historically low long-term rates will continue to put pressure on asset yields as our loan and investment portfolio is repriced at lower coupons.
The loan pipeline remains robust at $1.3 billion, and activity continues to provide us with growth potential as payoffs have added during COVID.
