I'm joined on the call today by Co-Presidents, Jim Zemlyak and Victor Nesi; as well as our CFO, Jim Marischen.
I'll then come back with my concluding thoughts.
The COVID pandemic has impacted millions of people worldwide and resulted in ever-changing challenges for both our healthcare system and our economy.
With that, let's look at our results.
Simply, we had another great quarter.
Stifel benefited from strong capital raising and trading activity as well as continued growth in fee-based assets.
For the first nine months of the year, we achieved record revenue and earnings per share.
Capital raising revenue achieved a quarterly record, trading volumes are up year-over-year and credit quality remains strong at Stifel Bank.
