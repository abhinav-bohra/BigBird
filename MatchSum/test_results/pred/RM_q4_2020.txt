I'm joined today by Harp Rana, our chief financial officer.
Our team executed extremely well and delivered strong results in the fourth quarter.
We generated $14.3 million net income or $1.28 of diluted earnings per share as a result of continued quality growth in our loan portfolio, a strong credit profile, disciplined expense management and low funding costs.
We originated $359 million of loans in the fourth quarter, which was comparable to the prior year and up nearly $51 million or 16% from the third quarter.
This drove sequential growth in our total portfolio of $77 million or 7%.
Our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $80 million or 8% quarter over quarter.
In addition, with $452 million of unused capacity on our credit facilities and $203 million of available liquidity as of February 5, we have access to more than enough capital to invest in our business and fund our ambitious growth plans.
Earlier today, we also amended our ABL facility to provide an additional $20 million of flexibility to return capital to our shareholders in the future, whether through dividends or share repurchases.
