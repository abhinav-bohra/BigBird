The fourth quarter of 2021 was a stark wake up call for the fixed income market.
After languishing in a 15 basis point to 25 basis point range for nearly 18 months since late March of 2020, 2-year treasuries rose 50 basis points from the end of September to the end of December, and the curve flattened significantly as 10 years ended the quarter, essentially unchanged from September 30.
The first six weeks of 2022 have been even more volatile, with 2s higher by 75 basis points, 5s by 55, and 10s by 40.
The rate environment had an inevitable negative impact on our fair value assets.
But MFA nevertheless turned in a respectable fourth quarter in a very strong 2021.
We added so for interest rate swaps in the fourth quarter and have continued to manage our duration exposure into this year.
We're still waiting for that vaccine, but between a relatively short duration assets or successful execution of $2.6 billion of securitizations last year, and our nimble hedging response to a dramatic rate moves more recently, we think we've weathered the storm reasonably well.
