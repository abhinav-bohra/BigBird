We will present our financial results for the second quarter 2021.
Let me start with the second quarter highlights.
Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.40, with adjusted net income of $199 million and premium revenue of $6.6 billion.
The 88.4% medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related medical cost challenges that increased the ratio by 110 basis points.
The net effect of COVID decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1.
We managed to a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio, reflecting continued discipline in cost management, which allowed us to harvest the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth.
We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continue to drive our growth strategy.
Let me provide some commentary highlighting our second quarter performance.
