Although we believe these statements to be reasonable, our actual results could differ materially.
With that, I'll now turn over the call to Melinda Whittington, La-Z-Boy's President and Chief Executive Officer.
Across the La-Z-Boy enterprise, we delivered all-time record high sales of $525 million, making and selling more furniture in the quarter than we ever have in modern history, even with production running only 12 weeks in the quarter, due to our annual one week maintenance shutdown in July, versus 13 weeks in most quarters.
Demand across all businesses also remained high and backlog remains at record levels.
Written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network increased 10% versus the prior year quarter, and has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 13% across the last two years since pre-pandemic, demonstrating the continued strength of demand for our La-Z-Boy branded products.
Written same-store sales for our Company-owned Retail segment increased 22% versus the prior year period, and at a compounded annual growth rate of 16% over the last two years.
And we are continuing to invest to increase flexible capacities due the remainder of this fiscal year in order to work through our backlog.
Also, as expected, we experienced significant short term margin compression on the wholesale business, primarily due to higher raw material and freight costs, which have risen at unprecedented rates and speed over an extended period.
