During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors.
We are now on Slide 4.
Today, Lloyd and I will share our third quarter results in the context of our fiscal year 2022 guidance and our multi-year investment thesis.
To set the context, let's go back to our October Investor Day, where we outlined our VoLT strategy and associated financial goals.
As a reminder, VoLT stands for velocity, leadership, and technology.
It is a strategic program Booz Allen has launched to capitalize on our first mover advantage in helping the federal government transform core missions through the use of new technologies.
Our expectations for fiscal year 2022 were consistent with these goals.
Gross revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.10 to $4.30.
