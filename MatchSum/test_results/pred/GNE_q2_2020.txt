Avi Goldin, our Chief Financial Officer will follow with a deep dive into the quarter's financial results.
Genie Energy generated the highest level of adjusted EBITDA of any second quarter in the Company's history and much improved financial results compared to the difficult year-ago quarter.
Globally, our retail energy provider businesses which generated 94% of our revenue added 64,000 RCEs year-over-year and 20,000 sequentially to reach 421,000 RCEs with solid growth in both our domestic and international markets.
Global meters served increased by 88,000 year-over-year and 4,000 sequentially to 536,000.
Here in the US, Genie Retail Energy added 25,000 RCEs year-over-year and 13,000 sequentially to reach 343,000 RCEs.
Domestic meters served declined by 4,000 year-over-year and 10,000 sequentially to 374,000.
On the other hand, like other retail providers, we suspended our face to face customer acquisition programs in March as public health measures were implemented to combat COVID-19.
As a result, gross meter adds decreased to 40,000 this quarter from 69,000 in the prior quarter and from 91,000 in the year-ago quarter.
