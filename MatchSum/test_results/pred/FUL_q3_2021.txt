In a world where there are unprecedented supply chain shortages and significant inflationary pressures impacting every portion of our business, H.B. Fuller delivered double-digit growth and met our bottom line commitments.
Last evening, we announced strong third quarter results led by 20% year-over-year revenue growth.
Organic revenue was up 16% versus 2020 and was up 13% versus the pre-COVID-19 environment in the third quarter of 2019.
This top line performance reflects broad-based double-digit organic revenue growth in all three global business units and includes significant contributions from both volume and pricing.
We also reported adjusted EBITDA of $111 million and adjusted earnings per share of $0.79.
These results were slightly ahead of our implied guidance.
At the same time, our team is managing the raw material supply chain exceptionally well, enabling us to meet high customer demand without impacting our sales volumes.
