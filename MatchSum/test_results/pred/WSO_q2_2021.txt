Now on to our report.
I am pleased to share that Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric.
Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income.
This was by far our most successful quarter ever.
Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter.
Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points.
They have a rich and successful history and we will help them any way we can.
Looking ahead, we are engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market.
