We further strengthened connections with customers with $156 million of new bookings with record results in both a zero to 1 megawatt and greater than a megawatt category and ended the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase over the prior year.
We also continue to enhance our global platform with the completion of organic development projects in multiple metros despite the continued challenges presented by the pandemic and the global supply chain in addition to strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider.
Financially, we had a solid quarter with full year results above the high end of the guidance range that we provided this time last year.
And finally, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the establishment of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers.
As a perpetual capital partner, Digital Realty and Digital Core REIT can continue to work together while providing our customers with a seamless experience.
And we made further progress on each front during the fourth quarter.
First, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-1 megawatt and greater than 1 megawatt categories.
In addition to providing investors a stable cash flow stream from a portfolio of high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic benefits to Digital Realty.
