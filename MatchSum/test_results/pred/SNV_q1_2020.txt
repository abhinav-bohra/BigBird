We have two main stories today and probably many more.
One is of our strong core operating performance for the first quarter pre and post coronavirus arrival.

Since the launch of P3 on April 3, our team has processed, approved and funded more than $2 billion in loans for 8,300 customers.
We're continuing to process submissions in our pipeline, preparing to find as many as possible with the additional appropriations made available this week.
