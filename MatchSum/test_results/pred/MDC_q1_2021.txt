These and other factors that could impact the company's actual performance are set forth in the company's first quarter 2021 Form 10-Q, which is expected to be filed with the SEC today.
MDC Holdings delivered another quarter of strong profitability in the first quarter of 2021 generating net income of $111 million or $1.51 per diluted share.
Our teams did an excellent job executing in their respective markets, leading to double-digit year-over-year increase in closings, orders and quarter-end backlog for our company.
We also expanded our home sales gross margins by 200 basis points and improved our SG&A leverage by 180 basis points.
These results are a testament to the favorable housing fundamentals that exist today as well as the strategic focus of our company, which targets the more affordable segment of the market and adheres to a build-to-order operational model.
We ended the quarter with 7,686 homes in backlog, a 65% increase over the first quarter of 2020.
We continue to see particular strength at our more affordably priced communities as homebuyers from all demographic segments look for alternatives to the lack of availability in the high cost of existing homes in most markets.
