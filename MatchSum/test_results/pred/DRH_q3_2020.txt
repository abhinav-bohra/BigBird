I'll highlight just four.
First, we increased our total liquidity and decreased our total debt through a successful preferred equity offering.
Second, we reduced our monthly burn rate, significantly beating our prior expectations.
Third, we reopened five additional hotels.
And fourth, we struck a sweeping deal with Marriott that not only increased the NAV of our portfolio by $50 million but distinguishes DiamondRock's portfolio as the least encumbered by long-term management agreements among all full service public lodging REITs.
In the third quarter, there were some encouraging early signs of a recovery in travel demand.
The relative bright spot has been in leisure travel, which of course is elective travel.
We currently have more than enough liquidity to carry the Company until such time as we are cash flow positive once again.
