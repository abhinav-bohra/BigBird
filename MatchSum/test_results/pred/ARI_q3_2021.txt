Ultimately, an improving economy should be positive for the commercial real estate industry and asset level metrics should continue to improve.
At presence -- at present, the pace of activity continues to accelerate, and regardless of the asset class, the combination of a low-interest rate environment and significant fund flows is supporting robust transaction volume and a well-funded high highly liquid financing market.
In the current highly competitive environment, the strength of the Apollo Commercial Real Estate Debt platform again has proven to be incredibly beneficial as we have completed approximately $1.5 billion of new transactions for ARI through the first three quarters of the year.
The pipeline continues to be a mix of both US and European transactions for well-positioned high-quality properties with institutional sponsorship in gateway markets.
We expect ARI loan origination totals for 2021 will approach pre-pandemic levels as we have already committed to an additional $340 million of transactions in the fourth quarter and we are working through a number of other transactions that should close by year-end.
It is worth highlighting that ARI's loan originations year-to-date continue to favor Europe, which is reflective of a combination of the strong reputation and market position our team has developed there, slightly less competition, and our team's ability to underwrite and structure large transactions.
Our repayments reflect encouraging signs from the general economy as transitional assets are achieving their business plans including construction projects achieving certificates of occupancy and for-sale residential units being sold.
As a result, ARI's construction exposure continues to decline, representing approximately only 14% of the portfolio at quarter-end.
