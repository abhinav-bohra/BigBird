Bryan started with us on January 1, and we couldn't be happier to have him with us.
Over the course of a couple of weeks, the region, including our service territory, experienced an unprecedented prolonged cold spell that disrupted natural gas supplies, resulting in extreme natural gas prices.
The cold spell also resulted in a record winter peak demand for electricity.
While our service territory experienced record snowfall and record temperatures, our customers experienced minimal disruptions.
Through the efforts of our employees, our generation fleet performed admirably over the course of the week.
We proposed to continue to carry the remaining balance on our books and defer the cost to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a 10-year period and collect it through our fuel adjustment clause beginning in January 2022.
We have a solid and compelling investment thesis backed by a track record of performance.
When you look over the last five or 10 years, we've delivered compounding annual growth rates between 5% and 6%, and we expect to keep true to our commitment to deliver on our earnings growth target of 5% by investing in lower-risk investments that improve our customers' experience.
