A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website.
To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up.
I'd now like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.
I'm pleased with our solid second quarter and overall first half results.
Our investments in content and technology are progressing at pace and we see market validation of our strategy with some key wins this quarter.
In our second quarter, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate accelerated to 5.5%.
This acceleration was led by our sales team effectively growing wallet share with existing clients as well as capturing a higher price increase in the Americas.
Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 16% compared to last year's rate of 14%, primarily due to lower tax benefits realized from stock option exercises this quarter.
