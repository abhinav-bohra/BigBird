After that, we'll open the call to questions.
Today, we reported record operating revenue for the second quarter and first half of 2021, driven by strong results across the firm.
Second quarter revenue was a record $821 million, up 51% from a year ago, and first half revenue was a record $1.5 billion, up 33% from a year ago.
Revenue for the last 12 months was a record $2.9 billion.
This high performance underscores the strength of our franchise and the breadth and depth of our business.
In financial advisory, record second quarter revenue of $471 million increased 61% from last year's period, reflecting broad based activity across sectors, market cap and regions.
Overall, our advisory business is experiencing unprecedented activity levels.
Assuming current macroeconomic conditions, as we said last quarter, we expect that our Financial Advisory revenue in the second half of 2021 will be higher than the first half.
