And as a result of our colleagues' hard work, dedication and perseverance, we've delivered outstanding results in Q3 and year-to-date.
We're also proud to report that our client feedback continues to be outstanding as net promoter scores are at a five-year high.
Additionally, Aon's colleague engagement is at the highest levels we've seen over the past decade, consistent with top quartile employers.
In deep appreciation for all that our colleagues do for our clients and our firm, we were excited to establish in Q3 the Aon United growth ownership plan.
This unique program rewards every colleague with a stock-based award to share in the current and future success of our firm, and we're thrilled to recognize and support our colleagues in this way.
Overall, as we reflect on Q3 and the first nine months of 2021, our momentum, defined by client delivery, colleague engagement and financial results, is exceptional, even more promising as what we see in the opportunity ahead.
Our Aon United strategy is delivering significant momentum in every solution line, with net new business generation and ongoing strong retention.
We also saw double-digit growth for the second consecutive quarter in the more discretionary portions of our business, such as transaction liability, human capital and project-related work within Commercial Risk Solutions and Health Solutions.
