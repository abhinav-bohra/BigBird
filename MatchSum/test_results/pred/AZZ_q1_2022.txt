In addition, AZZ's customers and its operations could potentially be adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Suffice it to say that we feel a lot better about this first quarter call than we did at this time last year.
Overall, sales improved 7.8% versus the prior year to $230 million, although up 14.6% when adjusted for the divestitures.
Metal Coatings turned in another excellent quarter with sales up 7.3% to $128 million and Infrastructure Solutions up 8.3% to $102 million and over 23% up when adjusted for the divestiture of SMS. The higher volumes resulted from strong operational performance and improved activity in most of our served markets.
I will get into the details of this as we go along.
We continue to generate strong cash flow during the first quarter, while also returning capital to our shareholders.
We generated net income of $22.3 million and earnings per share of $0.88 per diluted share, both representing over 300% improvement versus the prior year's first quarter.
Our Metal Coatings team continues to demonstrate their ability to perform and deliver great results.
