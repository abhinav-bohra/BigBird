We do not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise this information.
Before we begin, in November, we announced the retirement of Matt Lambiase.
Matt founded and led Chimera since 2007.
Under his leadership, Chimera grew to a $3.8 billion mortgage REIT and paid more than $5.2 billion in dividends to shareholders.
The Federal Reserve has been very supportive of agency mortgage-backed securities with open market purchases for its own portfolio.
This provides a source of product to meet strong investor demand.
And lastly, our company's leverage is low.
