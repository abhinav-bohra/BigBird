So, I think at the -- in the March forecast outlook, we gave the top six items as a outlook, and then in 2020 -- in May, we added that net income would grow at a faster rate than revenue.
So, with regards to revenue, we said that we would be in low double-digit increase, and at the half now, we're looking at a 25% increase in our revenue.
We said gross profit margins, we are forecasting to be similar to recent years, and at the half, we're right at the same 39%.
Operating expenses, some increases driven by our growth initiatives, and as a percent of sales, up -- for net as a percent of sales, we're down 1%.
Interest expense, we felt we'd be similar to 2020, but in fact our interest is down by 30%.
We're looking pretty strong and cotton right now as we hit our -- both our insecticide.
The main reason for the increase in the effective rate is the earn out expense on the Australian acquisition, which is not deductible for tax purposes.
All these factors came together in the bottom line.
