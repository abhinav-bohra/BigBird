Let's begin on Slide four and a review of our safety performance.
Our fiscal year-to-date total case incident rate, or TCIR, is 0.6.
We have now demonstrated three consecutive quarters of sub-1.0 TCIR performance as an organization, which is exceptional safety performance.
Our third quarter results were largely in line with our expectations as near-term volume headwinds related to COVID-19 continue to pressure our financial performance.
Both our SAO and PEP segments delivered results that were consistent with the guidance we provided on our second quarter earnings call.
We have maintained a focus on our key strategic priorities during this challenging period.
As evidenced, we completed several contract extensions, primarily in our medical, transportation and aerospace and defense end-use markets.
In the aerospace market, customers fully understand that capacity was limited prior to the pandemic and supply of aerospace materials will be constrained again when build rates return to normalized levels.
