A replay of this conference call will be available later today on our website.
We have continued our transformation journey, executing on our strategy as a cloud-first profitable growth company.
In Q3, we met expectations for revenue once again.
Importantly, our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased approximately five percentage points versus last year and is now approaching 80%.
This is meaningful because recurring revenue provides for predictable and durable streams of cash flow.
In addition, both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share were above expectations.
Claire will address our financial metrics and outlook in more detail.
Looking at Q3 in more depth, we had numerous proof points that our strategy is solid.
