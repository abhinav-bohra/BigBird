2020 was a year unlike any other and one which we would each like to put in our very distant memory.
Our portfolio performance was strong.
We maintained high occupancy levels, grew cash rents and collected over 99% of build rents, more on that in a moment.
We capped off 2020 with an excellent fourth quarter.
The positive fourth quarter leasing statistics nationally are consistent with our own experience as CBRE's preliminary figure for net absorption is 104 million square feet, the highest quarterly result in the last four years and exceeding the 69 million square feet of 4Q completions.
For the full year, net absorption was 224 million square feet, 15% higher than 2019.
