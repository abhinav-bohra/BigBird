I'm pleased to report that we had another strong performance in the third quarter.
Sales for the third quarter were $36.8 billion, up 9.8% from last year.
Comp sales were up 6.1% from last year with U.S. comps of positive 5.5%.
Diluted earnings per share were $3.92 in the third quarter, up from $3.18 in the third quarter last year.
During the fourth quarter, we intend to continue this momentum with our annual holiday, Black Friday and gift center events.
Like last year, we extended these events to cover a longer period and not just focus on one day.
