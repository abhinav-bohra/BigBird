This audio conference is being recorded and an archive will be made available on our website later today through November 2.
Today, I won't say a whole lot.
It's all about our company.
And I wanted to simply state that we do a lot of communications beneath the covers of what is reported to the public.
So this went out to every managing partner, every sales manager, every field support leader, directors of support, and every employee and leader in our Houston Support Center.
This went out about 5:24 p.m. yesterday with our quarterly nine month release.
And now they're hearing it, not just reading it.
And I often get many responses to these kinds of communications.
