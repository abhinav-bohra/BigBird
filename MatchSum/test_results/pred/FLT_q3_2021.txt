These statements reflect the best information we have as of today.
They are not guarantees of future performance, and you should not put undue reliance upon them.

So let me make the turn to our Q3 results.
We reported Q3 revenue of $755 million, up 29% and cash earnings per share of $3.52, up 25%, so both of those all-time record highs for the company.
Same-store sales strengthened plus 5% for the quarter, which further adds to the same-store sales rebound we saw in Q2.
And then I mentioned the acquisitions, particularly AFEX and ALE, together contributing probably about $0.50 of incremental accretion next year.
So look, taken together, the early 2022 set up is quite good.
