Now that people are starting to get vaccinated, we are optimistic and even hopeful eventually this pandemic will no longer be a threat, lives will return to some kind of normalcy and the economy will recover.
We have a strong view that post-pandemic, Waikiki will return to normal, pent up tourism returning and every night being like a Friday night.
While this pandemic still remains a threat that we believe we are well prepared to endure a prolonged pandemic with our irreplaceable portfolio, our best-in-class operating platform, our top-notch management team, our disciplined financial strength and a very strong balance sheet.
In such regard, I am extremely proud to announce that our inaugural public offering, which we closed on January 26, 2021, the offering consists of $500 million of 3.38% senior unsecured notes due 2031.
And by the way, it was oversubscribed 4 times.
Success and demand of this bond offering in the midst of a pandemic is truly a testament to our incredible properties, efficient operating portfolio, and our top-notch management team.
Yet, our collections of monthly recurring billings due continued to improve in Q4 over Q3 and Q3 over Q2.
The total collections to-date of approximately 92% in Q4 versus 90% in Q3 and 87% in Q2.
