It's a pleasure to speak with you today, and I hope you're all keeping safe and well.
Overall, considering the environment we are operating in, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as it reflected the expected improvement in trends across many of our global product categories, led by a faster-than-expected recovery within our Interventional Urology business, and continued strength within our vascular access product sales.
Quarter three revenues was $628.3 million, which was down 4.1% as compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis but far better than the 12% decline we experienced during the second quarter of the year.
The decline in year-over-year revenue is due to the impact of COVID-19, which we estimate caused a net negative impact of approximately $78 million, or approximately 12%.
If we were to normalize for the negative COVID impact, we estimate that our underlying business grew by approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our quarter two revenue performance.
We also saw a significant sequential improvement within our adjusted gross and operating margins from the levels achieved during the second quarter.
As I just mentioned, quarter three revenue declined 4.1% on a constant currency basis and 3.1% on an as-reported basis.
The decline in revenue was due to COVID-19, which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately $81 million across several global product categories.
