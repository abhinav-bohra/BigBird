I will discuss third quarter financial results and provide you with updated earnings guidance for 2021.
I'll start with some macroeconomic comments before getting into our leasing and capital allocation.
It's been just over 1.5 years since the pandemic began, and we are really starting to see the revitalization of cities across the West Coast.
City drillers are returning to their urban apartments and once again embracing city life.
After a tough 2020, residential net absorption is approaching 100,000 units in our five markets driven in large part by high density areas like Hollywood, South of Market, Downtown Seattle and Downtown Austin.
And in Austin, we're very encouraged with the market and our early stage lease negotiations.
That completes my remarks.
FFO was $0.98 per share in the third quarter.
