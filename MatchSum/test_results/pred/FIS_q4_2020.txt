Turning to slide three.
Also, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow.
These are important financial performance measures for the company, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP.
I'm pleased to announce our fourth quarter and full-year results starting on slide five.
Despite the extraordinary year, we leveraged our scale and resources to keep the global economy running, while delivering solid results.
We generated $12.6 billion in revenue as our balanced solution portfolio allowed us to offset weaker consumer spending trends with strong demand for our Banking and Capital Markets Solutions.
We also made great progress with the Worldpay integration, remaining well ahead of plan and exited the year generating more than $200 million in revenue synergies, and more than $750 million in cost synergies.
With this impressive momentum, we are excited to build on our strengths as we look ahead to accelerating organic revenue growth in 2021.
