Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.2 billion, 86% higher than the first quarter of 2020 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted OP growth.
Our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 9%, 375 basis points higher than our 2021 annual WACC and significantly higher than the 7.6% in the year ago period.
And our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $4.2 billion, 19% higher than the prior year period.
I'd like to take a moment now to highlight some of the trends, developments and accomplishments from the first quarter.
First, we are encouraged by many of the demand indicators we are seeing.
From a geographic perspective, China was one of the first countries to emerge from COVID-related restrictions, and we are continuing to see significant export demand driven by its economic recovery.
In the U.S. meat production is strong as exports and retail sales remain robust and restaurant dining expands.
Complete recovery will extend over multiple years, but we are seeing clear trends that are favorable for our broad portfolio.
