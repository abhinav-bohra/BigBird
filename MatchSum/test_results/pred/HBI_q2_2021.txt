These risks include those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by governmental or regulatory authorities to combat the pandemic on our business and our operations as well as the business and operations of the consumer, our customers, suppliers, business partners and labor force.
These risks also include those detailed in our various filings with the SEC, which may be found on our website as well as in our news releases.
Given the short-term volatility of comparisons due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused our comparisons to 2019.
Please note that unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are to 2019 results that have been rebased to reflect the move of our European innerwear business to discontinued operations as well as the exited C9 program at mass and the DKNY intimate apparel license.
I can't express enough how grateful and proud I am of their dedication, their focus on safety and commitment to serving our consumers and customers under extremely challenging circumstances.
To that end, over the past month, I've finally been able to get out, see parts of the business and interact with some of our amazing associates.
I also had the chance to tour our New York Design Center, spent time with that incredible team and see a wide range of innovative new products in our pipeline for both innerwear and activewear.
It's hard to believe it's been a year since my first day at HanesBrands.
