Let me also mention that throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.
So I'll start with the second quarter.
I was pleased with our second quarter performance particularly given the supply headwinds in our industry.
Despite operating in an environment of very constrained vehicle supply especially from commercial sellers we achieved the following results.
For KAR overall we generated $585 million in revenue an increase of 40% from Q2 of last year.
We sold 119000 vehicles on the TradeRev and BacklotCars platforms on a combined basis.
In just about every prior economic dislocation event our industry has experienced an increase in repossession volume.
However this did not happen during the COVID pandemic and I believe that the unprecedented level of government stimulus served to avert it.
