We also have several other executives available to join us for the Q&A session.
Before I get into our results, I wanted to kick off the call with a few words on a critical area of focus for FirstEnergy.
Taking appropriate actions to address our recent challenges and fostering a strong culture of compliance, ethics and integrity, we are deeply committed to creating a culture in which compliance is endemic in second nature and where our leaders prioritize and encourage open and transparent communications with all of our stakeholders.
We are working to ensure that every leader is actively engaged in setting the proper tone and creating an environment where not only our words, but our actions align with our core values and behaviors.
We're building a world-class compliance function to underpin this effort, including bringing on Hyun Park as our new Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer in January.
Hyun is the right person to step into this role at this time, and he will be instrumental in driving this cultural shift.
These efforts, together with enhanced policies and procedures, will help to bring additional clarity around appropriate behaviors at FirstEnergy.
And through enhanced communications, training, and most importantly, our actions, we are dedicated to reemphasizing that every employee at every level has the responsibility to consistently act in accordance with our core values and behaviors and to speak up if they see inappropriate behavior anywhere in the organization.
