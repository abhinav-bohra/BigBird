So now, let me turn to the results.
We achieved a new record in the second quarter for long-term net inflows totaling $31 billion.
This follows net inflows of $24.5 billion last quarter and up nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year.
Growth was led by net inflows into institutional ETFs, fixed income, and but as alternative capabilities.
And as you can see on Slide 3, the key capability areas where we have scale, investment readiness, competitive strength, drove growth again in the quarter.
These are areas where our investment performance is strong, we're highly competitive and well-positioned for growth.
We continue to innovate with strategies for retail investors through the launch of products such as INREIT and the partnership we announced with UBS, in which we will provide bespoke Global Property Investment Services for management clients of UBS in Switzerland, other parts of EMEA and Asia.
We also have $5 billion in direct real estate capital available for deployment.
