Growth was split fairly evenly, weighted a little bit more to favorable pricing than volume growth.
Demand remained strong at both ADS and in Infiltrator throughout our end markets and geographic footprint.
In addition, international sales increased 82% this quarter with growth in our Canadian, Mexican and exports businesses.
Our backlog and pace of orders remain favorable as well as our ability to capture price in the market, giving us confidence in the updated sales targets we issued today.
We have issued several price increases since late last year to cover inflationary cost pressure, and we'll continue to use our leading market position in that respect as well as ADS and Infiltrator's scale position in material procurement and recycling operations to procure material at the best possible cost and availability.
Our adjusted EBITDA increased 4% on a dollar basis given -- again, driven by the favorable pricing and strong volume growth.
The price increases we issued over the last 10 months largely covered the inflationary pressure on materials and diesel.
There are additional headwinds related to driver availability, an increase in the use of common carrier and an increase in common carrier rates that we are working to offset.
