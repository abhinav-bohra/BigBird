With that, let me pass the call to Jim Mastandrea.
We continue to hope and pray that all of you, your families and your businesses remain healthy, and are doing well as we navigate these most unusual times.
I am pleased to share with you our strong operating and financial results that have sustained the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our business has recovered quickly, and in doing so produced shopping center sector-leading results.
Dave Holeman, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed look at the drivers of our operating and financial performance.
We attribute these results to owning properties located in areas with high household income neighborhoods and the fastest-growing MSAs in business-friendly states.
Our strategic customer focus differentiates Whitestone from other real estate owners that leads to traditional hard and soft good retailers.
Since the end of the first quarter, we focused on improving our dividend payout ratio, increasing our cash on hand, paying down our debt and strengthening our balance sheet.
