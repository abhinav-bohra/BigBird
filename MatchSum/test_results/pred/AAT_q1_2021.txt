And our financial results will continue to improve into 2021.
Over the past year the COVID-19 pandemic severely affected most industries, commercial real estate being no exception.
We knew at the onset of the pandemic that American Assets Trust would not be impervious to this economic impact, but we were confident that the high quality, irreplaceable properties and asset class diversity of our portfolio combined with the strength of our balance sheet and ample liquidity would pull us through this.
As we've worked our way through these past 12 months, however, we realized that it is the resiliency of our properties and our company's employees that has enabled us to weather this storm.
We are proud of our response to the challenges presented to us in 2020 and our ability to successfully operate for our company, while keeping our employees and customers as safe as possible.
As we celebrate our 10th anniversary of being a New York Stock Exchange listed company, we are reminded that our commitment to our stockholders has always remained front and center.
Adam, Bob and Steve will go into more detail on our various asset segments, collections and financial results.
Now more than ever.
