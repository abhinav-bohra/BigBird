I'm pleased to report, we finished the year with a very strong quarter.
We delivered double-digit growth in all key financial metrics, and once again reported results above our financial targets.
This is all the more remarkable since last year's fourth quarter was so strong.
In such highly unusual circumstances, the default reaction would normally be to draw guidance and watch from the sidelines.
But as you know, we tried our best to share with you what we saw.
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.11 grew 21.3%.
Demand for field reps continues to be soft in the current environment.
As a result, business development activity has slowed but the businesses performed modestly better than we expected as the clients have largely retained existing field reps.
