The third quarter was another outstanding quarter for our company, as we achieved our fifth straight quarter of exceptional results since reopening our properties last spring, this sustained level of strong performance is a direct result of the fundamental changes we made to our operating philosophy last year.
Upon reopening, we sharpened our focus on driving play from our most loyal guests.
These exceptional results have significantly enhanced our free cash flow and strengthen our balance sheet with our leverage declining to 2.5 times at the end of the third quarter.
As a result of our strong financial position and our prospects for continued growth our Board of Directors has authorized a share repurchase program of $300 million allowing us to return a portion of our robust free cash flow to our shareholders.
So let's review the operating performance and helped to make this possible.
For the second straight quarter revenues exceeded both 2019 and 2020 levels setting a new third quarter record, strong flow through resulted in an adjusted EBITDAR of more than $340 million, also a third quarter record.
This is a substantial improvement over the EBITDAR loss we reported a year ago and is up double digits over our record third quarter 2019 results.
And in our Midwest and South segment, we set new third quarter records for both revenues and EBITDAR, as EBITDAR grew 22% over prior year and 42% from 2019.
