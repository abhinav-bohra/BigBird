We were impacted by Hurricane Sally, PCS, Zeta and Eta in 2020 and to a much lesser extent Hurricane delta.
In addition, we had exposure to a series of other 2020 PCS weather events and minimal exposure to the Midwest Derecho.
All told, we had a bit over 10,000 claims in the fourth quarter from named 2020 storms and other PCS events.
We did not have any exposure to hurricane Laura or any other weather in Texas or Louisiana including the recent winter storms.
Despite the weather in 2020, we continued our focus on underwriting increasing our primary rates in Florida, close to 20% for the full year, including 7% in the 4th quarter for 2020 reinsurance costs as well as increases in some of our other states.
We have continued to maintain a resilient balance sheet that has self funded our risk bearing entities capital requirements in addition to enhancing our reserves.
Adjusted operating income also excludes interest expense.
We ended 2020 with total revenue up 14.2% to $1.1 billion, driven primarily by growth in net premiums earned, realized gains on investments and increases in service revenue, partially offset by decreases in net investment income and increased reinsurance costs.
