These risk factors and uncertainties are detailed in Kennametal's SEC filings.
In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on the call today.
I'll start today's call with some general comments and a brief review of the quarter, and then discuss our expectations for Q3 and strategic initiatives.
These solid results were driven by improving sequential sales, reflecting both market improvement and growth from our strategic initiatives, as well as increasing benefits from simplification/modernization.
Sales this quarter increased sequentially by 10%, outpacing the 1% to 2% increase from Q1 to Q2 that we typically see.
Transportation and General Engineering end-markets, although still declining year-over-year, continued to show the highest levels of recovery.
The year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by lower raw material costs, increasing benefits from simplification/modernization, and effective cost control actions.
Operating expense as a percentage of sales increased year-over-year to 22% due to lower sales, however, in dollar terms, decreased 9%.
