Our demonstrated commitment to investing for growth across both existing and new affiliates while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders has resulted in significant business momentum and compounded earnings growth, which continues in 2022.
Through these initiatives, we have meaningfully increased our long-term earnings power, and more importantly, are reshaping our business in favor of fast-growing areas, including private markets, liquid alternatives, Asia, wealth management, and ESG.
All of which are well positioned to deliver strong growth over time.
More broadly, we believe that the investment environment has fundamentally changed.
Following a decade of globally coordinated monetary policy, ultra low rates, and highly correlated returns across asset classes.
Looking ahead, given the combination of elevated inflation, rising interest rates, and an increasing focus on climate change and sustainability, taking an active approach to investing is critical to achieving clients' goals and objectives.
Within private markets, our Affiliates manage $120 billion in assets under management across roughly 30 global and regional private equity, credit, direct lending, real estate, infrastructure, and private market solution strategies, offering investors diversification, income, and inflation protection across market cycles.
We have established three new partnerships in this segment over the last 24 months, in Comvest, OCP Asia, and Abacus, and have invested in distribution and product development at Pantheon, PFM, and Baring Asia to continue to address growing demand for both institutional and wealth investors globally.
