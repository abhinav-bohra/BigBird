I want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the Sorenson family and the thousands of Marriott associates around the world following the heartbreaking news of Arne's passing.
To say I'm deeply saddened by that loss, it would be an understatement.
As many of you know, had the opportunity to work with Arne in a number of capacities throughout my career, including earlier on at Host.
I think it's very fair to say he was an exceptional leader, but also an incredible person and a great friend.
Our industry is better because of him, and I am a better professional and a better person because of him.
As we all know, this past year has presented unique challenges, including a pandemic that devastated lives, communities, and businesses across the world, widespread economic declines and acts of social injustice.
Because of our amazing people, we've been able to lean on our award-winning culture, which earned the number one Best Place to Work in the United States for the second consecutive year and the number three World's Best Workplace to help get us through these trying times.
For the full year, systemwide RevPAR declined 57% with adjusted EBITDA down only modestly, more illustrating the resiliency of our fee-based model.
