Let's get things started by reviewing some of the key financial highlights from the quarter.
Net earnings reached a record $1.2 billion, or $2.12 per diluted share.
This reflected an increase of $2.06 over last year as we mark the anniversary of the pandemic's initial impact on our business and really, the world.
Net interest margin of 13.78% was 25 basis points higher than last year.
