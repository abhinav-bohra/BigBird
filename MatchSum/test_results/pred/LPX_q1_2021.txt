Rather than reading those statements, I will refer to you to those supplemental materials.
SmartSide net sales grew by nearly 50% versus Q1 of last year to $283 million and EBITDA more than doubled to $90 million.
Smooth and ExpertFinish volumes more than doubled, with those innovative products reaching 8% of total SmartSide volume.
OSB prices continued to climb throughout Q1, with the result that LP's OSB segment generated extraordinary cash flow.
LP's South American segment also had a very strong quarter, with 50% more sales and 3 times more EBITDA than the first quarter of last year.
As a result, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales, generated $461 million in EBITDA and $314 million in operating cash flow and earned $3.01 per share, all of which are quarterly records.
Last quarter, we announced a phased integrated capacity expansion plan that included converting our mill in Houlton, Maine from LSL and OSB to SmartSide, the restart of our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, and plans to convert our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan Society.
SmartSide has a long runway for growth ahead as we innovate, capture share, expand addressable markets and execute an aggressive capacity expansion strategy.
