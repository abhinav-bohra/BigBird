We appreciate you joining us.
I'll begin with some brief thoughts, and then Dave will follow to review our financial results in more detail.
Our second quarter was characterized by cost discipline, margin control and solid cash generation within a persistent soft end market backdrop.
Execution in these areas is providing a path to deliver our earnings and cash commitments for the year and should support accretive growth once demand rebounds as well as capital deployment opportunities going forward.
We also remain highly focused on accelerating our company-specific out growth potential regardless of the industrial cycle.
As highlighted in recent quarters, our leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control and now automation puts us in a unique position to capture greater share organically as our customers outsource their technical MRO and production infrastructure needs.
We also saw greater weakness across our international operations during the quarter within Canada and Mexico.
