We're really happy to be with you today and excited to talk about our first quarter, and we have a lot to share.
I'll begin by summarizing our results and providing thoughts on tax season '22.
Then I'll share perspective on the value we have created over the last several years and the levers we have to achieve our long-term revenue growth target of 3% to 6%.
Finally, Tony will review our financials, fiscal '22 outlook and provide his thoughts on the value of Block today.
Over the past several years, we've invested meaningfully in technology and digital capabilities and have made significant product and experience improvements via our Block Experience imperative.
We pivoted quickly and learned to operate more efficiently during the pandemic.
We're continuing to execute against our strategic imperatives and are gaining momentum.
I am more confident now than ever in our plans for Block Horizons 2025.
