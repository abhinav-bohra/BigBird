Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates, unless noted otherwise, are presented on a year-over-year basis and adjusted to exclude the impact of currency.
I am amazed by the resilience of our customers, partners, and team members.
We delivered a very impressive third quarter at HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins, and record free cash flow.
Based on the strength of our Q3 performance and our confidence about our momentum in the market, we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 earnings per share and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases.
Revenue in Q3 was $6.9 billion, in line with our outlook and normal sequential seasonality.
Our Q3 orders were up strong double digits year over year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our edge-to-cloud offerings.
We expect these trends to continue.
Digital transformation is no longer a priority but a strategic imperative.
