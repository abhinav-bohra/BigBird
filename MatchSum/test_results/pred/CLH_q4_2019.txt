Starting on Slide 3.
Before discussing our financial results, I wanted to speak to our safety performance.
I'm proud to report that 2019 was the best safety year in our history, with our total recordable incident rate and other key metrics at record lows.
Over the past five years, we've seen our focus on safety drive real positive results for us, and have helped us protect our workforce better and better each year.
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew by 10% on a 3% increase in revenue, and we generated record adjusted free cash flow of $208.5 million.
Credit for our results belongs to our entire team, who not only helped us set some financial records, but did so safely all year.
