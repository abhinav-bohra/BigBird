Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for the company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
So we'll get started with some highlights for the third quarter.
We delivered strong GAAP net income and adjusted pre-tax income, and our ROE exceeded guidance largely due to strong top-line performance.
This was our eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted pre-tax income.
We continue to make solid progress on our actions to expand our addressable market.
We're growing in higher-margin channels, services, and products giving us strong momentum, and the RMS platform acquisition gives us access to a potential $86 billion reverse mortgage subservicing market, which is an exciting new growth opportunity for us.
And what that means is about 7% of our borrowers on forbearance have exited without a reinstatement plan or a loss mitigation solution versus over 17% for the industry.
Based on the MBA data, we're delivering 20% more loss mitigation solutions for homeowners versus the industry average.
