As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP.
We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. the call agenda is shown on slide three.
Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance.
Before covering our results and outlook, I want to spend a minute addressing winter storm Uri and its impact on Cheniere.
As we described back in February, we were impacted by the widespread power outages in Texas, which resulted in our Corpus Christi facility being down for a few days.
I'm extremely proud of our operating personnel at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi for rising to yet another weather challenge and working so diligently to manage our operations smoothly throughout the freeze event.
From hurricanes to fog to now historic freezes, the Cheniere platform has withstood whatever mother nature throws our way and our focus on safe and reliable operations continues to benefit our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.
