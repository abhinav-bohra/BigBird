First, I want to say how proud I am of our employees, especially how they pulled together to deliver solid results during a challenging quarter while also staying safe.
Due to the focus and dedication of our teams, we were able to deliver sales and operating results that were better than we had originally expected.
As we noted in today's release, our businesses performed well during the quarter.
We continue to meet our customers' needs, we delivered higher than anticipated sales despite challenges the complexities resulting from the COVID-19 crisis.
As a result, of the gross margin expansion and SG&A cost reductions, our operating margin was flat during the quarter despite the 12% decline in sales.
We're also pleased that we generated positive free cash flow of $3.7 million during the quarter.
