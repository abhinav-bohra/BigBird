As a reminder, the company's results include an adjusted non-GAAP view that excludes certain costs in order to provide greater transparency into Curtiss-Wright's ongoing operating and financial performance.
Also note that both our adjusted results and full year guidance exclude our build-to-print actuation product line that supported the 737 MAX program as well as our German valves business, which was classified as held for sale in the fourth quarter of 2020.
I'll begin with the key highlights of our third quarter performance and an overview of our full year 2021 outlook.
We experienced a strong 12% increase in overall sales, of which 4% was organic.
Our A&D markets improved 15%, reflecting solid growth in commercial aerospace, naval defense and yet another quarter of strong performance from our PacStar acquisition.
Having just completed its first year under Curtiss-Wright's ownership, I'm pleased to report that PacStar is executing very well, and its integration remains on track.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.88 in the third quarter, which was slightly above our expectations due to the strong operational performance and the benefits of our consistent share repurchase activity.
Free cash flow was similarly strong, up 76% compared with the prior year, with strong free cash flow conversion that exceeded 125% and keeps us on track to achieve our long-term objectives.
