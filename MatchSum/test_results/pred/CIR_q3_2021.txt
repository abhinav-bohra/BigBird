CIRCOR delivered another strong quarter and executed well despite a challenging global supply chain environment.
We continue to see strong demand for our mission-critical products with year-to-date orders in backlog up 11% and 15%, respectively.
Notably, Industrial organic orders growth was 28% in the quarter and our Industrial backlog is up 30% year-to-date, well above pre-pandemic levels.
Revenue in the quarter was up 2% organically with operating margin up 80 basis points year over year and 240 basis points sequentially.
EPS was up 39% versus last year.
Our strategic priorities on people, growth acceleration, margin expansion and free cash flow continue to be our guiding principles.
Our short-cycle products are expected to be up 6% to 9% overall, primarily driven by aftermarket growth between 8% and 11%.
Our longer-cycle end markets are expected to be roughly in line with last year.
