Let's start on slide four and a review of our safety performance.
Through the first half of our fiscal year, our total case incident rate was 0.5.
During this time, we have achieved the lowest incident rate in Carpenter Technology's history and a 60% improvement year-over-year.
This marks another key step forward in our mission to achieve a zero injury workplace.
Our safety results to date are especially impressive given the challenges related to COVID-19.
If you look at the last three quarters, we have generated $214 million of free cash flow.
I'll start on slide nine, the income statement summary.
Net sales in the second quarter were $348.8 million.
