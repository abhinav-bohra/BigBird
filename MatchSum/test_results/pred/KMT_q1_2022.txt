Joining me on the call today are Chris Rossi, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Damon Audia, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Risk factors and uncertainties are detailed in Kennametal's SEC filings.
In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures on the call today.
I'll start today's call with some general comments on our strong results this quarter and some recent strategic wins as well as our expectations for Q2 and the full year.
We posted strong results this quarter by successfully executing our commercial and operational excellence initiatives as underlying demand continued to improve.
Our sales performance was in line with our expectations, increasing 19% organically year-over-year and outpacing our normal quarter-over-quarter seasonal trend.
Operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased year-over-year to 21% and sequentially was flat on lower sales.
Our target for operating expense remains at 20%.
