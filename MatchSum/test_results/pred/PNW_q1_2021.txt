2021 has started off in line with our financial expectations.
And I'll also touch on our progress toward achieving our 2021 goals.
Spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work.
To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, each year we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operation center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders.
We're also procuring an additional 450 megawatts of seasonal peaking capacity, including hydro power, and we expanded our contract up to 60 megawatts for demand response from our commercial and industrial customers to help ensure that we've got adequate resources through the 2021 summer season.
We expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon.
On the regulatory front, the Commission continues to evaluate the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year.
