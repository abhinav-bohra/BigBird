Today, I'll touch on our 2020 financial highlights, review last year's accomplishments, and wrap up with a discussion about our strategic objectives.
Looking at the fourth quarter, FNB reported operating earnings per share of $0.28, and operating return on tangible common equity increased to 15% building on the upper quartile returns relative to peers through the first nine months of 2020.
Turning to the income statement for fiscal year 2020, FNB reported record total revenue of $1.2 billion, operating net income of $314 million and operating earnings per share of $0.96, while building significant credit reserves to address economic risks associated with the pandemic.
These profitability levels resulted in strong internal capital generation driving our tangible common equity and the CET1 ratio to the highest levels in decades, and increasing tangible book value per share by 5% to $7.88.
Because of our performance in the prudent risk management culture, FNB continue to pay an attractive dividend.
Our portfolios continue to expand with full year average loan and deposit growth of 11% and 14%, respectively.
Sustaining this trajectory through execution of this strategy should increase our relative valuation over time compared to peers.
In tandem with delivering this financial performance in a challenging environment, we set out to protect our attractive dividend, while optimizing capital deployment.
