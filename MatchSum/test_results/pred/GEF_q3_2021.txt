Actual results could differ materially from those discussed.
Greif delivered robust third-quarter results.
We executed with discipline to deliver record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $238 million and adjusted class A earnings per share of $1.93, fueled by strong volumes and ongoing strategic pricing actions as we continue to experience strong demand across our global portfolio.
Our leverage ratio fell at 2.8 times, and our board approved a $0.02 and a $0.03 increase to our class A and class B quarterly dividend, respectively, payable on October 1.
Those attributes, along with his extensive manufacturing and industrial packaging experience, makes him the ideal leader to take Greif forward.
Ole, I'd like to ask you to say a few words.
