Tom, will you please begin?
The fourth quarter closed out a year of record-setting activity across our business.
Core FFO was $1.12 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.05.
For the full year, core FFO was $4.15 per share, with net promote earnings of $0.06.
Excluding promotes, core FFO grew 14% year over year.
Using this new definition consistently applied, our net effective lease mark-to-market at year-end jumped almost 800 basis points sequentially to 36%.
We will hit that target this year with more than $225 million from procurement and $75 million from Essentials.
