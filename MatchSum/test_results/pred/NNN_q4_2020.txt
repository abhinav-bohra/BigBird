As I've said before, perhaps the best word to describe National Retail Properties is consistent: consistent investment focus on single-tenant retail properties; consistency of people and culture; consistently raising the dividend for 31 consecutive years; consistent conservative balance sheet philosophy that maintains flexibility and dry powder; consistent long-term tenant relationships.
And although our long-term track record of consistent per-share growth was disrupted in 2020 due to the pandemic, we remain committed to our multiyear business plan.
Highlights for National Retail Properties in 2020 include: increasing the common stock dividend for the 31st consecutive year, a feat matched by only two other REITs and by less than 1% of all U.S. public companies; raising $700 million of well-priced debt capital early in the year, which put us in a strong liquidity position as the pandemic began to spread and enabled us to end 2020 with $267 million of cash in the bank and nothing drawn on our $900 million line of credit; reaching collaborative rent deferral agreements during the early stages of the pandemic with a number of our relationship tenants, which solidified our relationships and set us up for future acquisition business; collecting 95.7% of our rents due for the fourth quarter and 89.7% of our annual base rent for the year 2020; supporting our associates and our community with programs and activities to advance associate well-being, employee engagement and community involvement; and lastly, enhancing our executive leadership team with the appointment of Steve Horn, a 17-year veteran with the company, as our Chief Operating Officer.
Let me now turn to some details about our fourth quarter and 2020.
For the year 2020, we collected just under 90% of rents due for the year.
And for the month of January 2021, we have collected approximately 95% of the rents due for the month.
These collection numbers compare very favorably with other retail real estate companies and are similar to the reported rent collections by companies with a significantly higher percentage of investment-grade retail tenants.
A reminder that our tenants are typically large, well-capitalized, regional and national operators with the scale, financial wherewithal and management expertise to weather significant disruptions in the business environment.
