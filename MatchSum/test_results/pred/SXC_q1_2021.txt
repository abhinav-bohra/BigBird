Turning to our results.
Our coke making operations returned to running at full capacity and our logistics operations saw a significant uptick in volume.
We achieved record-setting first quarter results with adjusted EBITDA of $70.6 million, a 14% improvement over Q1 2020.
We are also pleased with our initial performance in the foundry and export coke markets.
Our products are well received and we are excited about the possibilities in these markets in the future.
We will continue to work on optimizing our production and growing our market participation for these products.
Turning to Slide 4.
Our first quarter net income attributable to SXC was $0.20 per share, up $0.14 versus the prior-year period, mainly driven by our Logistics segment performance.
