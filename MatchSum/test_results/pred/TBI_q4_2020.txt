Any comparisons made today are based on a comparison to the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated.
Before I dive into quarterly results, I wanted to take a moment to reflect back on 2020.
Many of our clients temporarily halted operations or reduced volumes and our revenue dropped precipitously.
By April, our year-over-year revenue decline had a level of 42%.
Management was prepared for this moment, and we reacted quickly.
Our revenue trends have been improving each quarter since Q2 2020, and we posted positive net income in the third and fourth quarters.
Second, we are expanding our presence in smaller markets we believe have been underserved.
These strategic initiatives are already paying off.
