I will start on slide four.
Now you should all be very familiar with those Zero Harm sustainability program by now under 10 pillars that fit within it across the ESG spectrum.
At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted that being a good corporate citizen was the floor and not the ceiling at KBR, and I wanted to prove on that side a little bit more today.
The symbiotic relationship between shareholder value and KBR helping our clients achieve their sustainability goals is an absolutely key differentiator for KBR.
And we wanted to build on that just a little on to slide five.
Our global retailer from Scandinavia came to a few years ago to help them solve a big problem.
So in other words, it's highly monetizable at lower investment and operating costs translating into a higher ROI for our clients and at the same time advancing their sustainability agenda altogether very compelling.
So staying on the right hand side of the slide, as you would expect the cadence of awards and our energy transition advisory business also increased and is a great early indicator of activity in that market.
