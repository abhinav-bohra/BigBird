The recovery we have seen over the past year continues to accelerate, led by strength in our leasing and capital markets businesses.
Our closely integrated One JLL philosophy and market-leading products and services are resonating with clients.
I would like to express my gratitude to all JLL employees for the outstanding service they provided to our clients in 2021.
During this time, we made several organizational design changes, orientating around business lines in set of geographies.
These realignments will enable JLL to reduce structural complexities and leverage best practices while accelerating growth.
Today, we are announcing the final phase of this transformation process, which will align our external reporting with how we internally manage our business.
Despite this uncertainty, we have not noticed a discernible impact in our leasing numbers as companies continue to take a longer-term view of the future office needs.
Channels research indicates that in the fourth quarter, all three global regions registered positive net absorption in the office market for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, creating a solid foundation for the ongoing recovery.
