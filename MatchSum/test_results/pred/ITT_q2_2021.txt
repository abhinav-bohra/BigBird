These adjusted results exclude certain non-operating and non-recurring items, including but not limited to asbestos-related charges, restructuring, asset impairment, acquisition-related items and certain tax items.
Before we begin, I'll provide a brief overview of our second quarter GAAP results.
Revenue increased 34% to $692 million.
Segment operating income increased 206% [Phonetic] to $114 million, which equates to segment operating margin of 16.5%.
Reported earnings per share decreased 15% to $0.45, driven primarily by a $28 million after-tax loss on the divestiture of InTelCo Management LLC, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets, as well as prior-year income tax benefits, and increased corporate and environmental costs.
We are all focused on ensuring ITT delivers on its commitments hour after hour, while taking care of each other, our families, and our customers.
This has been a pivotal quarter for ITT.
Before reviewing our results, let me talk a little bit about ITT's sustainability efforts.
