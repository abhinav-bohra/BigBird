Starting on Slide three, we entered the year with confidence that our second quarter will be a pivotal quarter moving beyond the going to grow revenue.
I'm pleased to announce that we achieved constant currency net sales growth of 7.8%, with increases in all key product categories.
Importantly, mobility and seating products rebounded strongly at constant currency net sales growth of nearly 18% in Europe and over 12% in North America.
As a result, in addition to strong sales in the second quarter, demand continues to support elevated order backlog.
We ended the second quarter with $15 million of higher backlog than normal, similar to the level at the end of the first quarter.
The continued higher backlog is expected to convert to sales over the next two quarters as we work to fulfill higher demand in the enrolling supply chain disruption.
Importantly, we expect gross margin to rebound through the remainder of the year.
[Indecipherable] cash flow to support sales growth during the quarter, usage increased due to higher accounts receivable balances and elevated inventory levels, which Kathie will expand on later.
