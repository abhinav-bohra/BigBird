Given the emergence of the delta variant, utilization across our portfolio did not increase as much in the third quarter as we anticipated, leveling off around 40%.
We now do not expect usage to meaningfully increase until the new year.
While the progression of the pandemic and the resulting impact on office utilization remain difficult to predict, customers and prospects fortunately continue to sign leases and our parking revenues continue to recover nicely.
We signed 672,000 square feet of second gen leases, including 245,000 square feet of new deals.
In total, we signed 96 leases during the quarter, including 46 new deals, consistent with our long-term average.
So far this year we've signed 140 new deals, which puts us on pace to eclipse our annual high watermark.
We don't track apples-to-apples net effective rent spreads.
However, if we look solely at the change in second gen net effective rents on signed deals from 2019 to 2021 year-to-date, the decline is roughly at the midpoint of the 5% to 10% average decline across our markets we've mentioned previously, which in our experience is also consistent with the typical recessionary patterns.
