All adjustments in the quarter and expected for the full year 2021 are detailed in the reconciliations in the appendix.
Q1 revenue increased 5.3% to $698 million.
Segment operating income increased 52.5% to $119 million, and reported earnings per share increased 4.2% to $0.99.
I continue to be extremely proud of the way our teams have responded to the crisis.
Today, we have nearly $1.5 billion of liquidity at our disposal.
Rounding out the story of the quarter with free cash flow, we saw a substantial improvement in Q1.
This was mainly driven by higher operating income generation in the segment and slightly lower capex.
This was mainly due to higher volumes and productivity benefits, partially offset by higher commodity costs.
