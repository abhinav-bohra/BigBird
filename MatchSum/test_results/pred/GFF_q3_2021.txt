We are pleased with our third quarter performance, which was slightly above our expectations.
Revenue increased 2% over the prior-year quarter of 4% excluding the impact of the SEG disposition.
Adjusted EBITDA was $76 million, excluding unallocated costs and adjusted earnings per share was $0.43.
We are executing well in a very complex operating environment.
I want to spend a minute discussing it before moving to the segments.
Demand remained very healthy across our product categories supported by a strong housing market, repair and remodel activity, and consumer spending.
We're currently carrying record levels of backlog in both the CPP and HBP segments due to transportation disruptions and tight labor availability, which limited our ability to catch up with demand.
We are closely monitoring the situation due to the spread of the COVID-19 delta variant and we'll make adjustments as needed to be responsive to government guidelines and to ensure the safety of our employees and customers.
