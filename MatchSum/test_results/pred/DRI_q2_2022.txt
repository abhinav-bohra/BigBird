This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the second quarter quarter of fiscal '21.
We plan to release fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 24 before the market opens followed by a conference call.
Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2022 financial outlook.
Sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter, as all our brands stayed laser focused on creating memorable guest experiences.
Despite the toughest inflationary environment we've seen in years, we achieved strong profitable sales growth.
People and product will continue to be our focus and Rick will share more details about that in a minute.
Finally, earlier today, we announced that effective May 30th, Rick will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and will join Darden's Board of Directors.
This is the right time for this transition and I look forward to continuing to serve as Darden's Chairman.
