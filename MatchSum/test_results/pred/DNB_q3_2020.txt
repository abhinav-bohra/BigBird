Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures.
Bryan will then take you through a review of the financials before we proceed to Q&A.
This was another solid quarter that finished in line with our expectations, putting us on track to meet the full year 2020 outlook provided on the second-quarter call.
Our continued focus on efficiency is reflected in our improved EBITDA margins and annualized run rate cost savings to date of $225 million which is up $5 million from the second quarter.
We continue to progress toward our revised target of $250 million, and we'll continue to update you on future calls.
Overall, our team continues to make great strides in executing on our strategy, and we are building significant momentum.
Now, turning to our sales and operations execution in the third quarter.
Our year-to-date retention rate remained strong at 96%, and 32% of our business was sold in multi-year deals.
