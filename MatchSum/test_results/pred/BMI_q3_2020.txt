As a matter of fact, we delivered a record quarter in terms of earnings per share and tied the record for quarterly sales.
We improved manufacturing output and experienced more consistent order demand after the trough in activity last quarter stemming from the rapid onset of widespread pandemic lockdowns.
As you can see on slide 4, total sales for the third quarter were $113.6 million compared to $108.6 million in the same period last year, an increase of 5%.
As we noted last quarter, activity levels began to improve as lockdown started to be lifted in mid-May and into June and this activity stabilization continued out throughout the third quarter.
In municipal water, overall sales increased 11%, a roughly equal combination of improved order rates and recovery of the backlog built in Q2, which as we noted last quarter was the result of lockdown induced manufacturing disruptions which limited our output.
Positive revenue mix trends continued with further adoption of smart metering solutions including ORION Cellular radios and BEACON software-as-a-service revenue along with ultrasonic meter penetration.
While copper prices, which serve as a proxy for Brass have been increasing.
Our average price cost in the third quarter was effectively neutral compared to the prior year due in part to the normal purchasing to production lag.
