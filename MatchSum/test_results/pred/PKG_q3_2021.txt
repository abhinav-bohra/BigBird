Excluding the special items, the $1.12 per share increase in third quarter 2021 earnings compared to the third quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by higher prices in mix of $1.58 and volume $0.62 in our Packaging segment.
Higher production volume of $0.06 in prices in mix of $0.05 in our Paper segment and lower non-operating pension expense $0.03 and lower interest expense $0.01.
The items were partially offset by operating costs, which were $0.84 per share higher, primarily due to inflation-related increases, particularly in the areas of labor and benefits expenses, recycled fiber costs, energy, repairs, materials and supplies, as well as several other indirect and fixed cost areas.
We also had inflation-related increases in our converting costs, which were $0.10 per share higher.
