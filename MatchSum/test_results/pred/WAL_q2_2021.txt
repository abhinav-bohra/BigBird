For the second quarter Western Alliance earned total net revenues of $506.5 million, net income before merger and restructuring charges of $236.5 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.29, an increase of 20.5% from the prior quarter.
These results benefited from a $14.5 million reversal of credit loss provision consistent with our excellent asset quality results.
Strong balance sheet growth continued with loans rising $2 billion excluding PPP loans or 29% on a linked quarter annualized basis and deposits by $3.5 billion or 37%.
Net interest income totaled $370.5 million up $53.2 million or 16.8% for the quarter as robust balance sheet growth rising NIM and access liquidity deployment significantly moves the earnings needle.
Additionally, after closing the AmeriHome acquisition on April 7, we added $4.5 billion in held-for-sale mortgages primarily GSE qualified or 12.4% of our average interest earning assets yielding approximately 3.21% as an alternative to cash or mortgage backed securities.
Optimizing our interest earning assets mix helped NIM expand from 3.37% to 3.51% in the second quarter.
Despite the evolving mortgage sector fundamentals AmeriHome continues to meet our expectations and contributed $0.39 to earnings per share in Q2.
We have optimized AmeriHome's balance sheet to Western Alliance capital levels with a servicing portfolio of $57.1 billion in unpaid balances.
