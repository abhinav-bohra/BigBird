I'll start with the third quarter highlights, then I'll provide an introduction to our three new strategic business units.
And I'll be emphasizing their strong positioning to deliver above-market sales, margin and profit growth.
Dave will then take you through our third quarter results.
So let's first start with an update on our business and third quarter results.
WESCO's new era is off to an absolutely exceptional start.
As our results exceeded our expectations across the board for sales, cost, margins, profit, EPS, free cash flow generation and reduced financial leverage.
Free cash flow generation was exceptional at over 300% of net income and demonstrates our resilient business model and strength through the cycle.
Notably, net debt was reduced by $280 million, consistent with our capital allocation priorities.
