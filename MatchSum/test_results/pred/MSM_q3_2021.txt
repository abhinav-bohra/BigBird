This is only the very beginning of our ESG journey, but we are committed to progress and continually striving for excellence.
These risk factors include our comments on the potential impact of COVID-19.
I hope you enjoyed your holiday weekend.
I'm excited to update you today on our progress this quarter.
With respect to revenues, we committed to achieve a minimum of 200 basis points of positive spread versus the IP by our fiscal fourth quarter.
Q3 is muted by PPE comps, but the non-safety and non-janitorial business grew about 21% year over year, and we expect our total company growth to meet or exceed our fiscal Q4 commitment.
I'll now turn things over to Kristen to cover the financials and our mission-critical progress.
I'll begin with a review of our fiscal third quarter and then update you on the progress of our mission-critical initiatives.
