With that, I am pleased to turn today's call over to Mohammad.
The message we want to deliver today is one of resiliency.
Even with the new challenge brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, our vertical integration and portfolio diversification strength helped to maintain our business continuity in the second quarter of 2020.
As a global business that operates in over 100 countries around the globe, each of our locations were impacted by COVID-19 in different ways to different degrees and at different times based on mandatory government shutdowns, including restaurants, schools, foodservice, and business closures.
While we did benefit during the quarter from gradual reopenings in certain regions globally, in North America we continued to experience reduced demand from our customers in the restaurant and foodservice industries, as well as ongoing shifts in demand at retail that suffered our quarterly financial performance.
Despite these challenges, our global firms, plants and distribution centers remained operational with minimal disruptions in our shipping and logistic operations.
This will offer us the unique advantage of processing fresh-cut fruit and fresh-cut vegetables in one facility in the Salinas Valley.
