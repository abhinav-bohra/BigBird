We look forward to see many of you at the American Gas Association Financial Forum in a few weeks.
Well, our year is off to a great start.
Our financial results are solid, and we continue to make progress on all key objectives.
We reported net income of $1.94 per share in the first quarter that compares to net income from continuing operations of $1.58 per share for the same period last year.
Our water utilities operating in the Pacific Northwest served customers through the February event without disruption.
Our vision forward is to be carbon-neutral energy provider by 2050.
