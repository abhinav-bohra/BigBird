We experienced the full impact of rising commodity and transportation costs this quarter, but healthy top-line growth and strong cost savings kept earnings per share growth nearly in line with the prior year.
Earnings growth should improve sequentially through the balance of the fiscal year as price increases go into effect and productivity programs ramp up.
So moving to first quarter results, organic sales grew 4%, volume contributed two points of sales growth, pricing and mix each added one point.
Growth was broad-based across business units with nine out of 10 product categories growing organic sales.
Personal Health Care up double-digits; Fabric Care grew high-singles; Baby Care, Feminine Care and Grooming up mid-singles; Home Care, Oral Care, Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care organic sales each up low-single-digits.
Family Care declined mid-singles comping very strong growth in the base period.
Organic sales were up 4% in the U.S. despite 16% growth in the base period.
Our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn share growth for P&G.
