Some of the comments made refer to non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance.
We delivered record third quarter results, despite the incremental challenges that emerged during the period from COVID-19.
We also surpassed $2 billion of quarterly adjusted net revenue for the first time in our history with record margins and produced all-time high quarterly adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow.
As we detailed at our investor conference just a short time ago on September 8th.
The trend toward accelerated digitization coming out of the pandemic has benefited our business by reinforcing that mode of competition, and this quarter provided further proof points of the wisdom of our approach to drive differentiated growth across the four pillars of our strategy.
First, we extended long-standing relationships with both CITI and CIBC, as a reflection of our promise as a top quartile software-as-a-service or SaaS technology company with unmatched worldwide payments expertise.
As we discussed in September, we also continue to build our pipelines with AWS to include additional fintechs, neobanks and embedded finance players spanning multiple geographies.
We now have 25 active prospects in our issuer pipeline with AWS, up from 20 last quarter and four at the end of 2020.
