During the third quarter of 2021 the company generated revenues of $141 million and adjusted consolidated EBITDA of $8.5 million.
We were on track through August for sequentially stronger results given the ongoing improvement in oil and gas industry fundamentals.
However, our results in the operations were negatively impacted by Hurricane Ida, following its landfall on August 30th, along the Louisiana Gulf Coast.
Our personnel remained safe through this devastating storm and our facilities did not sustain major damage.
We have also incurred delays in the production and shipment of goods to our customers and services in the Gulf of Mexico were suspended for approximately one month.
Reported results have not been adjusted for the estimated impacts of Hurricane Ida.
So as a company, we are very proud to have been recognized for our ESG efforts and practices.
Lloyd will now review our consolidated results of operations and financial position in more detail before I go into a discussion of each of our segments.
