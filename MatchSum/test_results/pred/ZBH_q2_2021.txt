As we're all aware, obviously, given the news recently, COVID is still very much with us, and we're watching it very closely, as you can imagine.
But given that even, we've seen some real progress since our last call, and I think that's obvious to everybody.
The world has not returned to normalcy yet, but travel is returning.
We have more team members in our offices, and I am personally looking forward to attending the AAOS meeting in about a month in San Diego.
We have a lot of great technology that we're going to be able to showcase there and just really happy it's going to be in person again, finally.
Also, I want to say that I hope in our investor community that you're continuing to stay safe and have been hopefully able to travel over the last few months to see family and friends.
And I think most importantly, our 2021 guidance view on a go-forward basis.
And then I'll come back to close out the call with some updates on our active portfolio management and product in pipeline highlights.
