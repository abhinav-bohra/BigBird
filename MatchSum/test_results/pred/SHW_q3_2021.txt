Let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers.
Starting with the top line.
Third quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 0.5% to $5.15 billion.
Raw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single-digit percentage, with about 75% of the impact in The Americas Group.
The remaining impact was largely in the Consumer Brands Group with an immaterial impact to Performance Coatings Group.
Excluding these items, third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 24.3% to $2.09 per share from $2.76 per share.
We would expect the combination of these pricing actions to result in a high single-digit percentage price realization in the fourth quarter, putting our full year price realization for TAG in the mid-single-digit range.
We will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed.
