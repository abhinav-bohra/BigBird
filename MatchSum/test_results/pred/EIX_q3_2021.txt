While I am going to miss my good friend very much, I am delighted with our deep bench: Steve Powell will succeed Kevin as President and CEO; and Jill Anderson, currently Senior Vice President of Customer Service, will succeed Steve as EVP of Operations.
Promoting Edison talent will ensure a seamless transition, and I believe that Steve and Jill both bring exceptional experience to their new roles.
We are also reiterating our longer-term earnings per share growth target of 5% to 7% through 2025.
