We appreciate how everyone is stepping up and embracing GameStop's new operating principles.
Since you last heard from us in June, our refreshed board of directors and new management team have settled in.
We now have unified leadership, fully focused on two long-term goals: delighting customers and delivering value for stockholders.
We are focused on positioning GameStop to scale while obsessing over competitive pricing, expansive selection, and fast shipping.
We also continued to expand our fulfillment network by adding a 530,000-square-foot facility in Reno, Nevada.
This new facility, which is expected to be operational next year, will position us to further expand selection and expedite shipping.
Net sales increased 25.6% to $1.183 billion, compared to $942 million during the same period in 2020.
We achieved this growth while overcoming a roughly 9% reduction in our global store fleet due to de-densification efforts and ongoing store closures across certain international markets due to the pandemic.
