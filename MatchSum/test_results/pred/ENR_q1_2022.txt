Before I go into detail on the quarter, there are three key points to take away from our call today.
First, our team delivered in the critical holiday season and our categories remain strong.
And third, as a result of our additional pricing actions and cost containment measures, we are reaffirming our outlook for net sales, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA for the full year.
As we look specifically at the results for the quarter, we maintained strength in our top line, delivering revenue of $846 million.
This was roughly flat to prior year on an organic basis.
Global price increases and expanded distribution in the battery business were offset by an expected decline in volumes as we comped elevated COVID demand from the prior year.
Specifically, the battery category benefited from two drivers: the increase in devices owned per household And an increase in usage of those devices, resulting in higher battery replacement frequency.
These trends have resulted in consumers using more batteries.
