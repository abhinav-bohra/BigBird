In addition, during the call, the company will present non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA.
Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation from the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Doron, the call is yours.
This was a productive quarter for Ormat.
We completed the expansion of the McGinness Complex in Nevada with higher generating capacity than originally planned, and made significant progress ramping up generation of the Puna plant in Hawaii.
Simultaneously, we closed a significant acquisition of two operating power plants and two other assets, which should contribute to our future growth.
Total revenue for the second quarter were $146.4 million, down 16% from the prior year.
The driver for the decrease were the product segment, which was impacted by low product backlog.
