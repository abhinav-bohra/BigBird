We had releasing spreads of 5% and occupancy at nearly 91%.
At the end of the third quarter, most of our town centers were open with only our three closed centers in Los Angeles remaining closed by government mandate.
So as of today, all of our centers are open and our tenants are eagerly planning for a busy holiday season.
Most of the results were better than the second quarter, but we were obviously adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID in general and specifically due to the protracted California and New York City closures.
I'm very appreciative of the entire Macerich team that did a tremendous job of getting our centers reopened safely in some cases for a second time.
Some of the self-health and safety measures we took went way beyond CDC recommendations that included significantly upgrading our air filtration systems to include hospital quality air filtration with [Inaudible] filters; engage the clinical head of Infectious Disease at UCLA Medical Center to review and advise us on our protocols and policies.
Given the continued improvement in rent collections of 80% in the third quarter and over 80% in October, liquidity continues to improve.
Cash on hand has increased from $573 million at June 30 to $630 million at September 30.
