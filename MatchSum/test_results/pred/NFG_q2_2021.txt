National Fuel had an excellent second quarter with operating results of $1.34 per share, up 38% year-over-year.
During the quarter, we saw the benefits of the ongoing expansion of our FERC-regulated interstate pipeline systems including significant incremental revenues from our Empire North project, which went into service last September.
In addition, last summer's Tioga County acquisition continues to exceed our expectations with gathering throughput and Appalachian production up over 45%.
Increased [Technical Issues] to $4.05 per share, at the midpoint an increase of 35% in the prior year.
Across all our operations, we continue to successfully execute on our near-term growth plans.
Our FM100 expansion and modernization project received its notice to proceed from FERC in late February and construction commenced in early March.
We finished the critical path tree clearing on schedule and construction is under way on both compressor stations.
To maximize the value of this new capacity, Seneca is operating two drilling rigs in Pennsylvania with first production from its recent rig addition in our Eastern Development Area scheduled to come online just ahead of the Leidy South in-service date.
