I'll now hand it over to our CEO, Ron Lombardi.
Let's start on slide five.
I'm pleased to report our long-term strategy and business positioning continued to deliver solid results as seen in Q2, where we experienced strong earnings growth and a stable revenue performance.
For starters, our long-term strategy of providing consumers with a wide range of brands they know and trust continues to work.
We have reduced leverage levels to the lowest point since 2014, which continues to increase our capital allocation optionality.
Our multiyear investments around e-commerce are delivering impressive results.
These investments have led us to achieve market shares above our brick-and-mortar share in many categories.
