For the third quarter of our fiscal 2022, RPM generated record consolidated EBIT and sales despite a difficult comparison to the prior year.
Our consolidated adjusted EBIT growth was driven by three of our four segments: construction products, performance coatings, and specialty products, which leveraged selling price adjustments and operational improvements to the bottom line.
Our consumer group is the outlier.
Mike will discuss this in more detail when he presents our segment results.
With our primary raw material costs up more than 40% on average versus a year ago, our consumer group will need to catch up with significant selling price increases, which will be instituted at the end of this month.
We have been fast to respond to supply chain challenges by quickly scaling up in-house resin production at a manufacturing facility we acquired in September.
In short, we are playing offense almost everywhere, investing in accelerating organic growth, significant increases in capital expansion, particularly in the areas of Nudura ICF, roof restoration coatings, and a number of our consumer product areas, all of which are building positive momentum as we go into the fourth quarter and we roll into fiscal 2023.
During the third quarter, we generated consolidated net sales of $1.43 billion, an increase of 13%, compared to the $1.27 billion reported during the same quarter of fiscal 2021.
