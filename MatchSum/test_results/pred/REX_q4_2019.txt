I have joining me on the call today, Stuart Rose, Executive Chairman of the Board; and Zafar Rizvi, Chief Executive Officer.
Sales for the quarter increased approximately 6.7%, primarily reflecting higher year-over-over ethanol pricing.
Sales were based upon 65.9 million gallons this year versus 72.6 million gallons in the prior year fourth quarter.
Sales for the full year were based upon 235.3 million gallons this year versus 285.8 million gallons in the prior year.
Gross profit for the ethanol and by-products segment increased for the fourth quarter from $5.4 million to $8.1 million, primarily due to improved crush spreads in the early part of the fourth quarter, which fell off as the quarter progressed.
The refined coal segment had a gross loss of $1.5 million for this year's fourth quarter versus $3.2 million for the prior year with the decrease reflecting lower demand at the facility.
SG&A expense increased for the fourth quarter from $4.5 million to $5.6 million, largely due to higher ethanol freight charges recorded in SG&A due to certain contract terms.
During the current quarter, ethanol, the whole operation is running at a loss, mostly caused by ethanol.
