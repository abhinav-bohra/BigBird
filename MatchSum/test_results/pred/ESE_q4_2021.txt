In spite of that, we continue to see great efforts and contributions from our body across the company and for that I'm very appreciative.
Since beginning of the pandemic, our primary goal has been the same to provide safe working environment and protect the health of our employees.
Overall, we're very happy with how we finished fiscal 2021.
The fourth quarter showed some stabilization in our overall business with sales growth of two of the three business platforms and good margin improvement compared to our third quarter results.
Cash generation was also strong, as we continue to see benefits from our ongoing focus on working capital improvement.
Sales of our commercial aerospace customers were still be down in fourth quarter, but the rate of decline was improved compared to what we saw in the first half of the year.
Overall, our navy and space businesses remain strong and well-funded, but sales there were a little weaker in the quarter, which is mostly a function of a very strong fourth quarter last year by our VACCO subsidiary.
We have a focus program with each subsidiary and will continue driving for long-term improvement of our returns on capital.
