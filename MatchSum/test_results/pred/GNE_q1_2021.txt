As we discussed when we reported last quarter's earnings, the first quarter was impacted by unusually severe weather events that led to massive spikes in wholesale electricity prices in Texas and Japan.
The severe winter storms in Texas and Japan had an aggregate negative impact on income from operations of approximately $15.5 million.
In Texas, where the impact of the storm this quarter was approximately $13 million, our industry has borne a disproportionate share of the financial burden.
Because of our ongoing commitment to financial strength and liquidity, while avoiding debt, our balance sheet remains in good shape.
Moreover, we have set ourselves the goal of finishing the year with a stronger balance sheet than we had at the start, despite the impact of the first quarter's weather events.
Our underlying business remain very strong.
On a consolidated basis, we achieved a record first quarter revenue and added to our meter and RCE counts, even though the first quarter is a historically slow quarter for customer acquisition.
Adjusted for the storms impact in Japan and gross margins increasing, and we expect that the growth capital requirements for these businesses will decline significantly during the year.
