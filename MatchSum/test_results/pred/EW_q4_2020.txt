Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, Management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures, otherwise they are referring to GAAP results.
Before we discuss fourth quarter's results and our expectations for 2021 and beyond, I want to spend a minute reflecting on 2020.
Despite unprecedented challenges throughout the year, I'm proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient-focused strategy.
Along those lines, we celebrated some exciting milestones in 2020 that directly impacted patients.
In TAVR, despite headwinds, more than 100,000 patients benefited from treatment with SAPIEN valves worldwide.
In Surgical Structural Heart, we launched our KONECT aortic valved conduit and Inspiris became the leading aortic surgical valve worldwide.
Looking into 2021, while we expect the pandemic to continue to impact the global healthcare system, we remain optimistic about the year ahead.
As we indicated at our investor conference, we expect full year sales between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion representing mid-teens underlying growth on a year-over-year basis.
