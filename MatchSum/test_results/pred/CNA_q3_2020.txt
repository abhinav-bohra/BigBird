We also had an improved underlying loss ratio and a lower expense ratio for the quarter.
As we have done in previous years, we completed our annual Life & Group review in the quarter, which importantly includes the long-term care gross premium valuation or GPV analysis of our active life reserves.
First, we have lowered our expectation for the normative 10-year treasury yield to 2.75%, a reduction of 100 basis points from last year.
Since long-term care reserves are discounted, these changes reflect our ongoing prudent approach to reserving and our steadfast resolve to protect our capital and earnings in an ongoing low interest rate environment.
Al will provide you with much more details associated with this year's GPV review.
Our underlying combined ratio of 92.6% for the quarter improved by 2 points from a year ago and is the lowest underlying combined ratio for CNA in the last 10 years.
As I have said on prior calls, our strategy has been to simultaneously make substantial investments in talent, technology and analytics to position us for sustained success while streamlining our operation in order to keep our overall underwriting expenses flat.
Then, by growing the Company in a disciplined and prudent fashion, we would steadily decrease the expense ratio, which you can clearly see in this quarter as more of the growth earned in.
