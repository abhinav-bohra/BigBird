We appreciate you joining us today and hope you and your families are all staying healthy and safe.
I want to begin by saying how honored I am that the board of directors has placed their trust in me to lead EnPro as interim president and CEO.
I also want to recognize Marvin for his contribution to EnPro over the last several years.
By the way of background for those who may be unfamiliar, I have been with EnPro for the better part of 12 years.
And over that time, have had the opportunity to work in a variety of leadership positions across our sealing technologies segment.
I most recently served as president of sealing technologies, a segment which I'm proud to say delivered an exceptional quarter.
My goal is to continue to work with our leadership team to encourage and position our employees to unleash their full potential as we continue the clear strategy articulated over the past year.
