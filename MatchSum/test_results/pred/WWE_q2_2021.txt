Actual results may differ materially and undue reliance should not be placed on them.
Additionally, the matters we will be discussing today may include non-GAAP financial measures.
You should know that all comparisons are versus the year ago quarter unless otherwise described.
We generated solid second quarter financial results as we focused on fan engagement and increasing efficiency in our content production.
We have positive trends in our OIBDA and the demand for our live event ticket sales as well as our television ratings and digital consumption.
Live events that have aired through July 26 have been at closure at full capacity.
Nice to speak with you all again.
Without a main event or even a card announced, we have sold over 40,000 of 45,000 tickets and we'll have a record gate for a non-WrestleMania event.
