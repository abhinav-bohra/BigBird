I'm pleased to report that our hardworking and dedicated team delivered strong financial results in the third quarter.
As I mentioned on our prior quarterly earnings calls this year, Arrow had faced adverse conditions many times in the past and has always emerged stronger than before.
Our business model is resilient and unique.
Our balance sheet is in great shape, and our liquidity position remains strong.
Current committed and undrawn liquidity stands at over $3.4 billion, including our $227 million cash balance.
It also reflects a continued recovery in enterprise computing solutions margins back to prior levels.
Lastly, please note that CFO commentary includes information on our fiscal calendar closing dates for 2021.
