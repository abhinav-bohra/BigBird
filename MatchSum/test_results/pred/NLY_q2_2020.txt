As a reminder, Annaly routinely posts important information for investors on the company's website at www.
Please note, today's event is being recorded.
Today, I'd like to highlight a number of current corporate initiatives, provide an update on the market and discuss portfolio activity across our core businesses during the quarter, and finally, provide our outlook for the balance of the year, and then I'll hand it off to Serena to discuss the financials.
Of note, while last quarter, each of our credit leaders providing an in-depth look at their respective markets and portfolios to be efficient.
I'll provide those updates today.
But as Purvi noted, each of our business heads are here as well to join in Q&A.
At quarter end, we closed our previously announced internalization transaction, which marks a significant step in the series of measures and only is implemented as an industry leader from a governance standpoint.
These initiatives are a testament to our focus on driving shareholder value ensuring that the firm as a whole, our structure, as well as our portfolio is positioned to continue outperforming as our second-quarter results demonstrate.
