There is no quit in this group.
And I think we made extraordinary progress in the second half of 2020 and particularly in the fourth quarter.

Interest rate volatility was again muted, and accommodative Fed monetary policy continued to provide support for risk assets with little indication that this will change materially in 2021.
Two-year rates inched into the high teens very briefly in mid-November, but are barely in double digits so far in 2021.
