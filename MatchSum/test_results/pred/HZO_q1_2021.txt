Today, I would like to start by reviewing a few of our first quarter highlights.
And finally, Mike will review the financial results in greater detail and provide some color on the balance of the year.
Let me start by reviewing the first quarter.
We are pleased that our first quarter results greatly exceeded the very impressive results last year.
A year ago, we had very strong growth in the December quarter and set a record for revenue and earnings.
The MarineMax team significantly outperformed those results and raised the bar yet again.
Importantly, our new unit growth was even stronger at 35%.
Furthermore in the quarter, we had meaningful growth across essentially all brand, categories and geographic region.
