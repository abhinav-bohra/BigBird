Before we discuss our business, I'll start with our disclaimer.
I will now pass it over to Jim for some introductory comments.
Our intent today is to provide some additional context around our third quarter earnings, discuss our views on trends, we see driving results at Boston Beer and in our industry and talk about how we see performance going forward.
After I discuss a few highlights from the third quarter, I'll hand it over to Dave who will provide an overview of our business.
Frank will then provide details of the third quarter financial results and how these results have been impacted by slower than anticipated hard seltzer growth, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2021 and 2022.
Then I will share with you our longer term view of the business.
But despite these ongoing strengths, we experienced very large unanticipated costs as the result anticipated costs as the result of the sudden unexpected slowing of growth in hard seltzer.
Based on our growth projections, we moved aggressively to build inventory to try to avoid the out of stocks that we experienced in 2019 and in 2020 and to secure capacity both short term and long term to be ready for growth through 2023.
