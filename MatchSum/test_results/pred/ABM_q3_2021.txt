Overall, demand for ABM's higher margin virus protection services remained elevated in the quarter, underscoring ongoing client concerns regarding cleaning and disinfection of their facilities.
As anticipated, demand for virus protection eased slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, but remain well above pre-pandemic levels.
The emergence of the Delta variant and rising COVID-19 cases nationally have gains heightened interest in the need for disinfection prevention measures, particularly in high traffic areas.
As we look forward to 2022 and beyond, we believe that virus protection services will remain a contributor to our overall revenue as disinfection becomes a standard service protocol and facility maintenance programs.
During the third quarter, we continued to benefit from efficient management of labor as office occupancy levels remain relatively low nationwide and began to trend downward slightly as the third quarter progressed due to the spread of the Delta variant.
In light of the current pause in the return to the office trend, we anticipate a more gradual ramp in office occupancy levels during 2022, providing an opportunity for a longer tailwind of rising from labor efficiencies.
Our strong performance in aviation reflected a seasonal improvement in air travel as well as our strategic shift toward securing high margin and more stable service contracts with airports and related facilities.
While revenue in our Aviation segment remains below pre-pandemic levels, we expect to see continued growth, driven in part by new airport transportation and janitorial contracts.
