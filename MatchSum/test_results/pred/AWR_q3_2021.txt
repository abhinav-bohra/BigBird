Excluding these gains from both periods, adjusted diluted earnings for the third quarter of 2021 were $0.76 per share, as compared to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per share for the third quarter of 2020, an increase of $0.06 per share or 8.6%.
The third quarter contributed to a strong 2021 year-to-date, where we've achieved 11.7% earnings-per-share growth over last year or 10.7% on an adjusted basis.
Regarding the pending general rate case covering rates for the years 2022 through 2024 at our water utility subsidiary Golden State Water Company, we're pleased to report that we have reached a settlement in principle with the public advocates office of the California Public Utilities Commission or CPUC for short, and nearly all of the items in the case.
I'll touch on this a little more after Eva's update.
On the electric side of the business, we were pleased that in September the CPUC approved Bear Valley Electric Services most recent wildfire mitigation plan, while also in September, the Office of Energy, Infrastructure Safety under the California Natural Resources Agency approved Bear Valley Electric Services latest Safety Certification filing.
We continue to invest in needed infrastructure that results in high water quality, reliable delivery, systems safety and a commitment to preserving the precious resources that are in our care.
This represents an increase of $0.06 per share or 8.6%, compared to the adjusted earnings last year.
Our Water segment's reported earnings were $0.62 per share, as compared to $0.57 per share last year.
