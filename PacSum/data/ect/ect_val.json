has improved sequentially from August to September and October.", "The macro drivers for market demand continued to be what we've experienced all of '21: limited housing supply, still extremely low interest rates and higher home buying activity from millennials and baby boomers who are experiencing life events associated with changes in housing needs.", "New and existing resale housing supply remained tight, especially for affordable entry-level homes.", "Mortgage interest rates are still very attractive as entry-level buyers are typically focused on monthly payment.", "The low interest rates continued to offset higher ASPS and we are seeing elevated demand persist.", "And lastly, we continued to see household formation for millennials and downsizing for baby boomers, both of which create demand for the type of housing that we build.", "We believe these underlying demographic factors will not fundamentally change in the near future, and although they may be bumpy if interest rates move materially within a short period of time.", "This quarter, we leaned on our deep vendor relations to navigate ongoing industrywide supply chain challenges.", "These strategic supply side partnerships and our operating model focus on spec homes and limited SKUs, allowed us to deliver 3,112 homes, which set the company record for the highest third quarter of home closings.", "We also set two additional quarterly company records: we generated the highest quarterly home closing gross margin of 29.7% in company history as a result of pricing power, more than offsetting the elevated lumber and other commodity costs; and our quarterly diluted earnings per share of $5.25 was the highest in our company's history.", "We grew community count sequentially again this quarter as well as year-over-year, overcoming municipal delays and supply shortages and land development as well.", "As of September 30, 2021, we had 236 ending communities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of 300 communities by mid-2022.", "On slide four, I want to touch on the latest milestones we achieved this quarter.", "The EPA recognized Meritage as a recipient of the 2021 Indoor airPLUS Leader Award.", "Our advanced air filtration, ventilation and HVAC as well as spray foam insulation helped minimize the indoor exposure to airborne pollutants and contaminants.", "So it's great to be recognized for these accomplishments nationally.", "In terms of innovation, we launched self-guided tours in select locations to address customers' changing preferences when it comes to the home buying process.", "Self-guided tours allow buyers to sign up for a no contact tour of our model homes on our website and then tour the home after-hours at their convenience.", "We expect to have this program rolled out throughout the country in the coming months.", "Additionally, we expanded our offering of digital financial services, so Meritage customers can now receive guaranteed on-demand homeowners' insurance quotes on their selected home on our website.", "From an ESG perspective, we memorialized our human rights policy, which can now be found on our Investor Relations website, and stay tuned as we will have more to share on ESG -- on the ESG front before year-end.", "Overall, it was another successful quarter, where our teams and supplier relationships helped Meritage deliver 3,112 homes.", "Affordability was one of the cornerstones of our strategic shift in 2016, and we continue to be focused on today.", "From land acquisition to operations, we look to maintain our entry-level products as an affordable home offering in the new home marketplace.", "That being said, the sustained favorable pricing environment stemming from the elevated demand for our products over the past few quarters and the tight housing supply conditions led to ASP increase on orders, backlog and closings that are masking our ongoing product mix shift toward entry level.", "Although order ASP grew 12% year-over-year, we experienced a deceleration in ASP growth sequentially this quarter, and the new product we'll be bringing on in 2022 and 2023 will allow us to continue repositioning our future communities down the ASP band.", "During the third quarter, we continued metering our orders pace to align with the current production environment and supply chain challenges.", "Even still, our average absorption pace remained elevated at 5.0 per month.", "We were still typically able to sell inventory shortly after releasing it, but we are only releasing homes once we have visibility into our cost structure and confidence about closing times, which is a bit late in the process today due to supply constraints.", "It is unclear when the current supply challenges will work themselves out.", "We currently have no insight to suggest that it's on the near term, and therefore, we are continuing to model elongated cycle times for the foreseeable future.", "Now turning to slide five.", "Our third quarter closings totaled 3,112 homes.", "They were up 4% over the prior year.", "Entry-level comprised 78% of closings, up from 63% in the prior year.", "For us, Q3 of last year was the quarterly peak of the surging housing demand since the start of COVID-19, resulting in our all-time highest third quarter absorption pace of 5.8 sales per month.", "In 2021, we have been metering orders due to the well-documented supply chain issues.", "As a result, the total orders of 3,441 for the quarter of 2021 reflected a decrease of 11% year-over-year, driven by a 15% decline in average absorption pace that was partially offset by a 5% increase in average communities.", "Despite metering, our third quarter 2021 absorption pace currently remained elevated at five sales per month.", "Entry-level comprised over 80% of quarterly orders, up from nearly 70% in the third quarter of last year.", "Entry-level also represented 77% of our average active communities compared to 60% a year ago.", "Moving to the regional level trends on slide six.", "Our central region, which is comprised of Texas, led in terms of average absorption pace with 5.4 sales per month this quarter, which was 14% lower than prior year.", "This decline was partially offset by a 5% greater average active communities, which together contributed to a 10% decline in order volume.", "Third quarter order ASP increased 20% year-over-year given solid market conditions in Texas.", "Our east region with the highest entry-level product mix with -- representing 80% of the average community was the only region to generate year-over-year growth in order volume of 3% despite metering as a result of an 8% increase in average active communities in the third quarter, which offset a 4% decrease in average absorption pace.", "South Carolina opened several new communities later in the third quarter, which resulted in a 3.7 average absorption pace in the third quarter.", "This was our lowest absorption pace in the company's quarter, despite South Carolina's orders increasing 11% over prior year.", "Given healthy demand in the state, we anticipate the order pace will increase in the near future.", "The west region's third quarter 2021 order volume had our largest decline at 24% year-over-year, mainly due to 25% lower average absorption pace to 4.9 per month.", "Specifically, Arizona reduced its absorption pace from 6.5 per month in Q3 of 2020 to 4.8 per month this quarter as a result of supply chain challenges.", "Colorado remained the lowest percentage of entry-level mix at 48% of its average active communities this quarter.", "During the third quarter, California had the highest average absorption pace of all our states at 5.6 per month.", "Given 100% of the average active communities are entry-level there, we continue to focus on affordability, particularly as it's our most expensive geography.", "The third quarter order ASP increased 15% year-over-year in the west region.", "Arizona and Colorado had the largest increase in order ASP in all our states at 26%.", "So we are monitoring these markets to ensure we wire ASP to local market condition and continue to introduce products that is more affordable.", "Overall, demand remained healthy in all of our markets.", "Turning to slide seven.", "Of our home closings this quarter, 74% came from previously started spec inventory, which increased from 71% a year ago.", "We ended the quarter with nearly 2,100 spec homes in inventory or an average of 11.7 homes per community as we push to get homes in the ground.", "This was an important improvement from approximately 2,300 specs or an average of 11.2 in the third quarter of 2020.", "At September 30, 2021, less than 5% of the total specs were completed versus our typical run rate of 1/3.", "Having available spec is crucial to our business model, but even as we started over 3,400 homes this quarter, maintaining our goal of a four to six-month supply of entry-level spec has been challenging.", "As we have been ramping up our new communities, we are working very hard to get enough spec started in all of them.", "We didn't accomplish all that we wanted in Q3, but we expect to accelerate our pace in Q4.", "We ended the quarter with a backlog of over 1,500 units as our conversion rate declined from 68% last year to 57% this year due to supply delays.", "Although we believe our spec strategy and entry-level focus will drive the conversion up in the long-term when the supply chain normalizes, we expect current supply issues and the resulting slower backlog conversions to persist at least for the next couple of quarters.", "During the third quarter, bottlenecks abound in various areas along supply chain, some on the front-end and others on the back-end, leading to an additional two weeks or so of construction cycle times sequentially from Q2 to Q3 this year.", "In particular, windows and truss delays impacted our operations throughout the country.", "As Steve mentioned, our operating structure and strong vendor partnerships have afforded us some advantage as we navigate these disruptions.", "We reengineered our product a few years ago which limit our SKU count and planned libraries, allowing us to order material in bulk in advance.", "We have also heavily invested in relationships with our vendors, which we have strengthened during the last couple of quarters.", "We are maintaining constant communication and remain flexible to substitute or upgrade our SKUs or find alternative supplies as necessary.", "We have been benefiting from our 100% spec building strategy for entry-level homes.", "Pre-starting homes enable us to maintain a steady cadence of homebuilding construction and makes us a preferred partner to our trades This transparency and scheduling visibility as well as no structural changes makes our products simpler to build.", "At times like these, we appreciate that we can leverage our spec building strategy and our operating model to continue to deliver our backlogs and get more homes started.", "The 10% year-over-year home closing revenue growth to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2021 was the result of the 4% increase in home closings and 7% higher closing ASP despite the mix shift to more entry-level products.", "The 820 bp improvement in third quarter 2021 home closing gross margin to 29.7% from 21.5% a year ago was driven by the price increases over the past several quarters as well as the leveraging of our fixed costs on greater home closing revenue.", "The pricing power more than offset the increased cost of lumber and other commodities.", "Today's more normal lumber cost will start to be reflected in our gross margin in early 2022, but will be partially offset by other increased commodity costs as well as the additional overhead burden in gross margin from our community count ramp up.", "Once we're fully selling and closing from all 300 communities in 2022, we will be able to leverage the higher fixed overhead costs across the corresponding higher revenue.", "We are also continuing to monitor the recent increases in lumber and the impact they may have on our 2022 gross margin.", "Our SG&A leverage of 9.3% remained better than our 10% expectation and continued to benefit from both greater closing volumes and higher ASPs.", "The 80 bps year-over-year improvement and SG&A leverage from 10.1% in the third quarter of 2020 also included lower brokerage commissions in 2021 and cost savings from technology innovations that particularly benefited our sales and marketing efforts.", "We will continue to find ways to incorporate technology into our operations and expect to be able to better leverage our total SG&A on higher closing volumes in 2022 as well.", "The third quarter 2021's effective income tax rate was 23.3% compared to 19.5% in the prior year.", "Both years reflect reduced rates primarily from eligible tax credit on qualifying energy-efficient homes closed under the 2019 Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act.", "Increased profit in states with higher tax rates and reduced benefit of the energy tax credit due to greater overall profitability for the company both contributed to the higher tax rate in 2021.", "Higher closing volume, pricing power, expanded gross margin and the improved overhead leverage that we achieved this quarter all led to the 85% year-over-year increase in third quarter diluted earnings per share of $5.25.", "To highlight a few year-to-date results through September 30, 2021, on a year-over-year basis, we generated an 85% increase in net earnings, orders decreased 1%, closing were up 15%, we had a 640 bp expansion of our home closing gross margin to 27.4%, and SG&A as a percentage of home closing revenue improved 90 bps to 9.4%.", "As seen on slide nine, our balance sheet reflects ample liquidity and flexibility for further growth.", "At September 30, 2021, our cash balance was $562 million compared to $746 million at December 30, 2020.", "It was down just $184 million despite an $815 million increase in real estate assets over the same time.", "Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 17.5% at September 30, 2021, remained low.", "We still target a maximum ceiling of net debt-to-cap in the high 20s, which is in line with the quick asset turn we expect from our entry-level and first move-up offerings.", "Our capital usage priority is still focused on growth.", "The bulk of our cash will be spent on land acquisition and development and to get specs in the ground in our new communities.", "We routinely repurchase shares to offset new grants and keep our dilution neutral.", "As demonstrated in the third quarter, we will also continue to opportunistically repurchase incremental shares.", "We repurchased over 95,000 shares during the quarter for $9.5 million.", "Since the end of the quarter, we repurchased an additional nearly 244,000 shares for another $24 million.", "Today, over $153 million remains in our share repurchase authorization program.", "We expect cash generation to accrete once our 300 communities are operating and delivering homes in the back half of 2022.", "On to slide 10.", "Our land book increased 46% from September 30, 2020.", "With nearly 70,000 lots under control at the end of this quarter, we had 5.4 years supply of lots based on trailing 12-month closings, which was higher than our target range of four to five-year supply of lots under control.", "However, looking forward to the closing volume that we would generate once our 300 communities are actively selling in the middle of next year, the ratio drops back to our four to five year objective.", "We secured about 9,800 net new lots this quarter compared to approximately 9,000 in the same quarter of 2020.", "These new lots will translate to an estimated 45 net new communities, of which 87% are entry-level with an average community size of 196 lots.", "Despite the additional demand for land from all builders today, we were able to meet our internal land acquisition goal while making sure our projects meet our underwriting hurdles, modeling a normalized absorption pace and a higher incentive environment.", "Our understanding of who we are has sharpened as has our confidence level in the type of projects we bid on.", "By knowing the cost of the home and increasing our land development expertise, we feel comfortable bidding on land parcels that others might not, from acquisition of larger lot sizes to those in secondary submarkets that best align with our entry-level products and projects with complexity in land development.", "In fact, our year-to-date finished lot cost for newly controlled lots is right around $75,000 a lot.", "During the third quarter of 2021, we continued to make excellent progress in our land development despite municipal delays and supply chain constraints, and we opened 40 new communities.", "We grew our community count by 10 net communities from 226 at the start of the quarter to 236 actively selling communities at the end of the quarter.", "On a year-over-year basis, we were also up 16% or 32 net communities from 204 at September 30, 2020.", "We spent $526 million on land acquisition and development this quarter, which was 76% higher than last year's Q3 spending of nearly $300 million.", "We continue to expect our annual land acquisition and development to be about $2 billion in 2021 and thereafter.", "To preserve liquidity, we use options for staggered purchasing terms where financially feasible.", "About 64% of our total lot inventory at September 30, 2021, was owned and 36% was optioned compared to 58% owned and 42% option at September 30, 2020.", "Finally, I'll direct you to slide 11.", "With limited visibility into when the supply chain will loosen, we continue to forecast supply chain delays and longer cycle times for the rest of 2021 and into 2022.", "With more than 5,800 units in backlog and another almost 2,800 specs in the ground today, we are projecting 12,600 to 12,900 home closings for the full year of 2021, which we anticipate will generate $5.05 billion to $5.15 billion in home closing revenue.", "We are lifting our full year 2021 guidance on home closing gross margin, which we now anticipate will be between 27.5% to 27.75%.", "With an increase to the projected effective tax rate to 23%, we expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $18.75 to $19.40 for 2021, a year-over-year increase of over 70%.", "For year-end 2021, we also anticipate around 250 active communities.", "We are reiterating our commitment to 300 communities by June 2022, with around $2 billion of land acquisition and development spend projected for next year as well.", "For 2022, we anticipate double-digit growth in unit and home closing revenue.", "As I previously noted, we expect gross margins in '22 to remain elevated, although supply chain issues, commodity costs and recent lumber cost increases may all cap further upside.", "With the higher volume of communities operating next year, we anticipate full year 2022 SG&A rate will drop below our current SG&A rate of the low 9s.", "To summarize on slide 12.", "We have capitalized on the ongoing favorable market conditions by having available supply of entry-level and first move-up homes that are attractive to both millennials and baby boomers, the largest home buying demographic today.", "The continued significant investment in land acquisition and development as well as the meaningful growth in community count over the past two quarters to 236 communities as of September 30 demonstrates our ability to attain our strategic goal of 300 communities by mid-2022.", "Our operating model, strong execution, growing community count and focus on the entry-level and first move-up markets have all led to the company hitting our closings, achieving an absorption pace of five per month while metering the order pace, growing community count again and obtaining industry-leading gross margins this quarter.", "Additionally, these attributes position us well to continue

understand that the agency that assists us with our filing has a large number of documents in the queue at this time.", "Everything I am covering here is included in more detail in that document.", "As we have noted in previous calls, the Company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries in which we operate.", "As a result, our customers and our suppliers have all operated more or less without disruption during the pandemic.", "This has continued through the third quarter.", "Having said that, the pandemic has impacted us in a few ways, including our ability to present new sales and marketing ideas such as new products face to face with customers in the field.", "We have also seen customer buying patterns that appear to have been moderated in the face of pandemic-related uncertainties.", "On the other hand, the same restrictions have caused us to spend less on operating expenses.", "These marketplace changes have been challenging to manage.", "However, we have succeeded in maintaining a profitable performance throughout this difficult period.", "With regard to our financial performance for the three months ended September 30th, 2020, the Company's net sales decreased by 6% to $117 million as compared to sales of $125 million this time last year.", "Within that overall decline, our US sales were down about $7.5 million and our international sales were flat.", "International sales accounted for 43% of net -- of total net sales as compared to 41% of net sales this time last year.", "The main factors driving our third quarter sales performance are as follows.", "In our US crop market, sales were affected by reduced cotton acres, which according to USDA statistics, are down about 11% or 1.5 million acres in 2020.", "Acres were impacted by cotton commodity prices that are down, driving growers to plant alternative crops.", "Our market performance has also been impacted by extreme drought conditions in West Texas and frequent hurricanes in the Southeast USA, both affecting grower ability to apply our products.", "On a plus note, we saw a stronger than expected demand for our fumigant products, which are sold into the potato markets.", "The better than expected performance is attributed to cautious reopening on schools and restaurants across the United States.", "In our domestic non-crop market, there were small quarter-over-quarter changes with some decline on our pest strip products which are used in bars and restaurants that were impacted by pandemic restrictions.", "With regard to international sales, which were overall flat, there were really three factors.", "First, we had a very strong performance in Mexico, Central America and Australia.", "By contrast, our Brazilian sales were down in real terms as a result of reduced insect pressure and challenges getting in front of customers because of pandemic restrictions.", "In addition sales translated from local currency to US dollars were further negatively impacted by a decline in local currency exchange rates quarter-over-quarter.", "Finally, whereas we saw Mocap and Nemacur sales lower in Europe, both products recorded significant sales increases in other parts of the world.", "As you can see from the table, the US crop market was where we recorded reduced sales.", "This is pretty much in line with other market participants that have reported Q3 results.", "Our international business increased as a percentage of consolidated net sales and our comparatively low exposure to foreign currency rate movements was a strength for the quarter.", "With regard to the nine-month performance, the various market dynamics described for the quarter are broadly the same.", "Our US crop business was impacted by reduced cotton acres and by growers making cautious decisions with regard to input as the pandemic gradually revealed its impacts.", "As an offset, we have done a bit better than expected with fumigants as schools and restaurants reopened.", "And in addition, we've had the benefit of sales of products acquired in the fall of 2019.", "Our non-crop business in mosquito control has been a little lower than we hoped given the storm intensity impacting our main markets, mainly due to vector control districts using existing inventory.", "Finally, our international sales have performed well, given the challenges with currency devaluation in some of our key markets.", "Moving now to cover our gross profit performance.", "For both the quarter and the year-to-date, the trends are fairly similar.", "In our US crop business the drop in gross profit was driven by our lower sales of cotton products and partially offset by strong fumigant sales.", "In non-crop, the impact of reduced sales of Dibrom and pest strips were negative for the quarter and was somewhat offset by strong sales in our horticultural business which has slightly lower margins.", "During the quarter, we also recorded higher royalty income on our Envance technology business.", "For the international business, the decline in foreign exchange rates was offset entirely in the three-month period and to a lesser degree in the nine-month period by strong performances in Central America, Australia and Mexico.", "As a result of these various dynamics, gross margin performance in the quarter reduced from 38% to 37% and for the nine-month period from 39% to 38%.", "For the quarter, our manufacturing performance was strong with factory operating cost well controlled and activity improved as compared to 2019.", "Generally speaking, over the long term our net factory costs amount to about 2.5% of net sales, reflecting some latent capacity in our plants should the need arise.", "This kind of available capacity is necessary to help manage our production planning effectively.", "In the third quarter our factories cost approximately 2.4% of sales as compared to 2% this time last year.", "The third quarter is typically a strong manufacturing period for the Company.", "For the first nine months, the net factory costs amounted to 1.6% as compared to 2.4% of net sales for the same period of 2019.", "For the three months ended September 30th, 2020, our operating expenses decreased as compared to the same period of the prior year.", "The underlying performance is greater than its parent from the published statements because in 2019 we benefited from an adjustment to earn out liabilities on past acquisition.", "That benefit did not recur this year.", "On the other hand, we did record a benefit of approximately $1 million during the third quarter because we completed an update to our environmental risk assessment related to the Brazilian business we acquired at the start of 2019 which led to a decrease in our liability in this regard.", "As we have reported for prior periods this year, our operating expenses were reduced because travel and entertainment costs were lower as a result of pandemic restrictions in all jurisdictions in which we operate.", "Our costs were also reduced because of the translation effect caused by devaluation of currencies that are important for the Company, including the Mexican, Brazilian and Australian currencies.", "With regard to the nine-month period ended September 30th, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, our overall expenses have reduced.", "The reported reduction actually understates the real improvement because in 2019 we benefited from adjustments to earn out liabilities related to past acquisitions in the amount of $3.5 million that did not recur this year.", "As a result, our underlying costs are down approximately $5.5 million or 5% for the nine months.", "The drivers of the reduced costs are similar to the quarter.", "We have spent less on travel and entertainment because of pandemic restrictions.", "Both short and long-term incentive compensation is tied to financial performance and has reduced in 2020 compared to 2019.",

rate movements in three key currencies for the from the Company's perspective.", "I want to put some color on that comment.", "If we had used the 2019 exchange rates for both the three and nine-month periods of 2020, our reported net sales would have increased for the three months by $3 million and for the nine months by $7 million.", "When looking at gross margin, we would have recorded additional gross margin of $700,000 in the three-month period and $1.7 million year-to-date.", "Notwithstanding these impacts we have been effective at putting in place some natural hedges.", "That is that the majority of our operating expenses for the businesses in territory are also in local currency.", "That mitigates the impact on sales and gross margin leaving relatively immaterial differences at the bottom line resulting from translation exposure.", "The Company experienced some significant transactional related exposures during the first quarter of the year.", "This has reduced as exchange rates have settled at new levels during the second and third quarters.", "During the third quarter, we recorded lower interest expense than this time last year.", "Our average debt was lower than the prior year and we got a benefit from reduced borrowing rates in the US.", "In the nine-month period, our average debt was a little higher than the prior year, but we gained the benefit for the lower federal base rate resulting in significantly lower interest expense.", "Finally, our effective tax rate continues to decline in comparison to the prior year as we are having a stronger international performance in jurisdictions with lower rates this year as compared to last year.", "In the three-month period, we earned $0.10 per share as compared to $0.11 per share in the same period of the prior year.", "For the nine-month period, we earned $0.25 per diluted share as compared to $0.34 per share last year.", "From my perspective, the operating and financial focus of the Company remains as follows.", "We continue to follow a disciplined approach in planning our factory activities balancing overhead recovery with demand forecasts and inventory levels.", "At the end of September 2020, our inventories were at $176 million as compared to $186 million this time last year.", "During the intervening periods we have made acquisitions and added inventory as a result.", "The underlying period-over-period improvement in our base inventory before the impact of recent acquisitions amounted to approximately $14 million or 7.5%.", "We are highly focused on our balance sheet as we navigate through this pandemic period and having lower inventories at this point of the year is pleasing to report.", "As we look at the final quarter of the year and our target for December 31st, 2020 inventory, Eric will comment in a moment about acquisitions that we closed in the first and second week of the final quarter of this year.", "As a consequence, our inventory forecast will now be amended to incorporate these new businesses.", "In previous conference calls, we expected to end in the region of $145 million.", "Given our latest operations planning assessment, we are expecting that our underlying inventory will increase a little from our prior forecast.", "In addition, the new acquisitions that Eric will mention in a moment are expected to add approximately $15 million at December 31st, 2020.", "Accordingly, our latest forecast is to end the year at approximately $160 million to $165 million, effectively flat with 2019, but including the addition of inventory from recent acquisitions.", "Our business has a distinct annual cycle and we continue to experience expansion -- and we routinely experience expansion in working capital in the first part of the year and a reversal in the second part.", "During 2020 we, like most businesses, have been highly focused on working capital and its impact on debt levels.", "During the period of the year when we typically expand working capital, we have contained the increase to only $5 million as compared to adding $49 million in the same period of 2019.", "This careful management of working capital is driving the improved cash generated from our operating activities.", "In the first nine months of 2020 we have generated $19 million from operations as compared to using $21 million in the first nine months of 2019.", "Comparatively that amounts to a positive change of $40 million period-over-period.", "At September 30th, 2020 net indebtedness ended at $149 million as compared to $165 million this time last year.", "During the last year, in addition to paying down $16 million in debt, we have funded more than $27 million in investments, including fixed assets, product acquisitions and technology investments from the cash generated from operations.", "These investments are focused on developing our consolidated business for the future.", "With regard to liquidity at the end of the third quarter, availability under our credit line was $45 million, which compares to $30 million at the same point in 2019.", "In summary, for the third quarter and for the nine-month period though our sales were down, selling prices and gross margins in each territory remained good.", "We are seeing a stronger international performance than this year and the mix of US sales, generally higher gross margin, and international sales, generally lower gross margin, is tending to bring the average down slightly.", "Our factory performance improved compared to 2019 and our expenses for operating costs, interest and tax are all lower in 2020 than in the comparable periods of the prior year.", "From a balance sheet and cash perspective, we are doing very well, managing working capital and our debt is lower than this time last year, notwithstanding our investments in long-term growth of our business.", "Finally, availability under our credit line has improved.", "With that I will hand over to Eric.", "Many of our investors have expressed an interest in our strategic direction and longer-term prospects, particularly in light of our increased emphasis on technology innovation.", "In that spirit then, rather than getting into the weeds on market conditions over the past reporting periods, I would like to look forward to where we hope to be in the next three to five years.", "We have three primary growth platforms within our business, our core business, our green product lines, and our precision application technology led by SIMPAS.", "There are synergies between these platforms.", "For example, SIMPAS is a market access tool for both core products and green solutions such as Agrinos biologicals.", "Also there is some overlap between these platforms.", "But for directional purposes, it is useful to take each platform in order.", "Our core business consists largely of our synthetic chemistries.", "Using 2019 numbers as a reference, let's build a model using a baseline of annual sales of $468 million.", "We have grown our core business in three ways; first, organically, that is through additional market penetration; second through our new product pipeline, that is making new formulations or getting new users for what we already have; and third, through acquisitions.", "If we were to grow at a rate of only 2% per year, we should be at $507 million by year three and $527 million by year five in organic growth.", "Let's add to that our new product pipeline.", "We regularly introduce several new products per year.", "For example, in 2020 alone, we launched five new formulations.", "As these new products get traction and we continue adding new introductions, we expect that we will add another $37 million by year three and $109 million by year five.", "The core business plus new pipeline products puts us at $544 million by year three and $636 million by year five.", "But now let's add acquisitions.", "It's hard to predict the acquisition market, but I can say that it is extremely active today.", "As you may have read, we just completed two acquisitions; Agrinos, a biologicals company that I will talk about further in a moment and AgNova, an Australian company that gives us greater critical mass and market access in Australia and the surrounding region.", "If out of conservatism, we cut that number in half to $20 million per year and extrapolate it forward, we find that our incremental acquisition growth that put us at $60 million by year three and $100 million by year five.", "The core business plus new product pipeline acquisitions puts us at a three-year top line target of $604 million and a five-year target of $736 million.", "Now let's turn to our green solutions platform.", "Before we get back to the model, I would like to bring you current on a recent acquisition.", "In early October, we acquired the shares of Agrinos, Inc. and its sister companies at a very favorable price as they were being sold in an auction by the Norwegian parent in a liquidation process.", "Agrinos makes and markets unique blends of biological products into many markets and operates three factories.", "The first located in Oregon ferments [Phonetic] a 22-species consortium of bacteria into an end-use product that enhances soil health and plant growth by, for example, increasing nitrogen update.", "The second located in Mexico produces a microbially enhanced tightened base product that tightens a calciferous substance comes from shells of shrimps that are locally grown that has similar applications.", "The third located in India producers biologicals for that region, including sales to the Government of India.", "With this investment, we have created a biologicals team to manage these green product offering globally.", "That effort will also include our management of the advanced TyraTech business.", "So, let's get back to the model.", "Now, admittedly some of the green solution businesses are already included in our core business.", "For purposes of this discussion, we will focus on the incremental addition.", "Through the end of the third quarter of 2020, we had already been on track to sell approximately $22 million in green products this year, including biologicals, bio-nutritional products through both our domestic and international businesses and essential oil products through Envance which are the active ingredients in Procter & Gamble's Zevo line of consumer products.", "Let's use that number as a baseline for our green products platform.", "And as mentioned, we are already in the consumer pest control space through the P&G's Zevo product line and we are expanding our essential oil product line into other areas, including lawn and garden, crop and public and animal health.", "We expect that with the addition of Agrinos, the growth of our other biologicals and the expansion of Envance/TyraTech we should see incremental revenues in year three of $48 million and in year five of $118 million.", "Let's take our prior graph of core, including product pipeline and acquisitions and now add green products.", "That would take us to about $70 million in year three and $140 million in year five.", "Now for the third platform, namely precision application.", "We have been reporting regularly about our SIMPAS technology which we believe is at leading edge of prescriptive application systems.", "We know of no other system that enables a grower to take an agronomist's prescription for multiple crop inputs based upon field conditions and prior-yield results and apply those products variably in multiple rose automatically in one path.", "Further with our Ultimus technology, we can trance product from factory to field and as important, we can measure precisely what was used in any given application.", "And now, we are enhancing this technology to permit seed treatment at time of plant.", "After seeing positive results from field trials by growers in many states, a number of our peers are performing their own tests with the goal of making their products available in smart cartridges through SIMPAS.", "That said, some investors are asking that we give them a better idea of where SIMPAS could be in three to five years.", "In order to answer the question, we will consider the following elements; first, revenues from our existing portfolio of products, and I'm talking about increased users which would be dramatically enhanced by applied prescriptively; second, revenues from the sale of active ingredients, licensed from other basic producers to be sold under RNA; third, royalties from third parties for marketing their products through our smart cartridges under their name; and fourth, a share in the growers' incremental yield benefit.", "Using conservative estimates of market penetration and domestic markets only, we are targeting top line contribution on the order of $35 million in year three and $131 million in year five.", "In addition, we are confident that SIMPAS will be well received outside the US and are already planning to host SIMPAS field trials in Brazil in 2021.", "Also, these figures do not include the potential for additional revenues from our seed treatment innovation.", "In other words, these are conservative, domestic, in-furrow SIMPAS targets only.", "Let's put all of the platforms together.", "If we add Core plus Green plus SIMPAS we are in the neighborhood of $687 million in year three and $985 million in year five at the top line which is roughly double where we are today.", "There are many moving parts of the equation.", "We will continue to control the things that are within our control.", "For example, exercising strict discipline on managing working capital and operating expenses.", "Further, we are committed to maximizing our consolidated profit margin.", "While our expansion into distribution within international markets has tended to lower our gross margin percentage, we expect that the introduction of newer technologies across these markets will create an updraft on profitability.", "In future calls,I will be updating you on how we are progressing against those targets.", "Finally, let me pull our focus to the present and the near term.", "2020 has been an unprecedented year for this industry.", "In spite of the pandemic, weather effects and farm economy as David mentioned, we have kept pace with Q3 of 2019 in terms of profitability, even with modestly lower sales.", "Looking forward into the fourth quarter, we are already seeing greater optimism in the domestic agricultural sector, hurt in part by rising crop commodity prices for corn and soybeans and cotton which would tend to contribute to improved grower profitability.", "In the Midwest with less crop rotation and more continuous corn over corn planting, we are beginning to see a resurgence of soil insect pressure.", "In addition, demand for our soil fumigant products continues to rise.", "Based upon these trends and current sales activity, we are encouraged by our prospects for the balance of this year and into the 2021 season.", "We'll now take

significant, up 56% versus the prior year.", "Higher segment earnings provided a $0.13 tailwind in the quarter versus the prior year, along with benefits this year with a lower base tax rate and reduced interest expense.", "Our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.4% was lower than forecasted as a result of a few discrete tax benefits in the quarter.", "Our tax rate in the quarter was

this year from higher and stock-based compensation.", "Purchase services and rents were collectively down $10 million or 2% as reduced freight car expenses more than offset higher spend associated with technology investments and increased intermodal volumes.", "When matched to a 3% volume increase, the 3% decline in opex provides another quarter of additional productivity, building in the work we've done over the past several quarters, as you'll see here on Slide 18.", "From the quarter that we launched our Top 21 operating plan, we have made meaningful progress on our workforce productivity with GTMs per employee up 16% since the third quarter of 2019 and a 340 basis point improvement in our operating ratio.", "We remain intensely focused and committed to drive further improvements.", "Turning to Slide 19 for the remainder of the P&L below operating income, you'll see that other income net of $7 million is $15 million of 68% unfavorable year-over-year due primarily to lower net returns on our company-owned life insurance investments.", "Our effective tax rate in the quarter was just over 22%, and recall last Q1 we had the 2012 tax refund that resulted in a lower effective tax rate.", "As a result, net income increased by 1% compared to pre-tax earnings growth of 5%.", "Earnings per share rose by 3%, supported by 2.3 million shares that we repurchased in the quarter at an average price of $254.", "Wrapping up now with our free cash flow on Slide 20, free cash flow at $750 million was buoyed by strong operating cash conversion and a relatively modest $265 million in property additions in the quarter, which was below our annual targeted run rate for the year due to timing issues, including weather related delays and capital spend.", "Our company is also

we first established our sustainability program.", "We've been reporting on our results ever since, delivering on the goals we set forth.", "Here we highlight a few key milestones and also show a few examples of external recognition, including recently being named by the Wall Street Journal as one of the 100 Most Sustainably Managed Companies.", "In summary, we have a track record of leadership on sustainability which is good for business and the right thing to do for all our stakeholders.", "Although we don't generally update guidance, given the unusual circumstances in the first quarter with February's extreme cold and a global supply chain disruption, let me wrap up restating our confidence in our ability to meet the market for full year 2021 with the expectation that strength in consumer-oriented and manufacturing markets will drive 9% revenue growth year-over-year.", "For the full year, we expect to achieve more than 300 basis points of OR improvement versus our adjusted

subdued pricing opportunities given the softer demand environment.", "That said, on a sequential basis, gross margins improved 13 basis points or 17 basis points when excluding LIFO expense, and we're slightly ahead of our expectations.", "While we expect some of the volume-driven year-over-year headwinds to persist near term, we remain focused on driving annual gross margin expansion as demand

asset inflows in the 4th quarter, we start the year with ever $1.3 trillion in AUM.", "Given the market improvement with more back-end weighted toward the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues excluding performance fees and the associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter.", "This reflects the follow through from the market and slow growth that occurred over the course of the 4th quarter, even if we assume no change in markets from year-end.", "On the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation from the seasonal increase in payroll taxes, partially offset by lower compensation related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the execution of our targeted cost savings.", "Turning to slide 13, adjusted operating

$160 million for the quarter, growing 26%.", "The continued strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of both Cytopoint and Apoquel benefiting from our direct-to-consumer campaign,

operations.", "Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter.", "We saw favorable conditions in Chile and Norway that resulted in vaccinations being accelerated into Q2.", "In addition, we continue to see an uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile.", "Overall, our international segment was again a positive contributor to revenue growth, with performance in swine, companion animal, fish and poultry more than offsetting decline in cattle resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.", "Now moving on to the rest of the P&L.", "Adjusted gross margin of 71.1% increased slightly on a

offset by reductions to T&E and compensation-related costs as a result of COVID-19.", "The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%.", "The increase versus prior year is driven by the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recorded in Q2 2019.", "Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 4% operationally, primarily driven by revenue growth, and

the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program.", "Diluted earnings per share were $0.66 as reported and $0.70 as adjusted before the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles.", "Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter.", "I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow.", "Turning to second quarter revenue on slide four.", "Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.27 billion, an increase of $416.2 million from a year ago.", "Compared to Q2 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 3.1% with the US dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets.", "Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points.", "Our organic net revenue increase was 19.8%, which brings us to 10.6% organic growth for the six months.", "At the bottom of this slide, we breakup segment revenue in the quarter.", "Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically.", "We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, McCann, FCBs with healthcare, a significant driver, MullenLowe, Huge and R/GA.", "At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 15.1%, which reflects some recovery of the events and sports marketing offerings within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic.", "Our public relations offerings also had solid growth in the quarter.", "Moving on to slide five, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region.", "In the US, which was 63% of net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 17.4%.", "Revenue decreased a year ago in the same period by 8%.", "Year-on-year performance was very strong across media, data and tech, FCB driven by healthcare, IPG DXTRA, McCann, MullenLowe and Huge.", "International markets were 37%

expenses excluding billable expenses, the amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges increased only 11% from a year ago and to 22.5% growth of net revenue.", "The result was second quarter margin expansion to 17.9% from 9.4% a year ago.", "We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had in this year's first quarter and these were both structural and variable.", "In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter of last year and continued to execute over the second half.", "As a reminder, these actions involve the elimination of certain positions, and resulting headcount reduction that will not return with revenue growth.", "We also reduced our real estate footprint by 15% last year.", "We are currently seeing the benefit of most of these actions and at a full run rate they will generate $160 million in annual cost savings.", "We've also had over the course of the pandemic a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses.", "I would call out specifically lower travel and related expenses, which was the case in the second quarter of 2020 and that's continued through Q2 2021.", "As you can see on this slide, a ratio of total salaries and related expense, as a percentage of net revenue was 65.4%, which has significantly improved from the second quarter of 2020 when revenue had decreased sharply.", "Underneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53% of net revenue in the quarter.", "That reflects the benefit of last year's restructuring and the fact that the pace of new hiring lags our significant revenue growth, as was in the case in past business cycles.", "Our severance expense ratio also decreased sharply to only 40 basis points of net revenue, compared to 3% in Q2 2020, which was at an elevated level due to the impact of the recession.", "Going the other way, our expense for performance-based incentive compensation increased to 6.4%, consistent with our very strong operating results.", "Expense for temporary labor also increased, as a percentage of net revenue to 4.5%, as a result of servicing the top line's quick acceleration.", "At quarter-end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 53,000, a 1.4% increase from a year ago and up 5.2% from the beginning of this year, with hiring to support our growth.", "Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 380 basis points to 13.3%.", "Our occupancy expense decreased to 5% of net revenue, mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate, as well as leverage on our revenue growth.", "We leveraged all other office and other direct expense by 220 basis points, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and acquisition costs and leverage as a result of our revenue growth.", "Our SG&A expense was 1.3% of net revenue, with the increase from a year ago due to the higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance expense, which was at a very low level a year ago.", "On slide seven, we present detail on adjustments to our reported second quarter results, in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance.", "This begins on the left-hand side with the reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS.", "Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million.", "The restructuring refinement in the quarter is a benefit of $200,000.", "To be clear, this is a small adjustment to estimate of the 2020 restructuring program.", "Below operating expenses in column four, we had a pre-tax loss in the quarter of $1.7 million in other expenses due to the disposition of small non-strategic businesses.", "At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.04 per share, which bridges our diluted earnings per share as reported at $0.66 to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per diluted share.", "On slide eight, we turn to cash flow in the quarter.", "Cash from operations was $468.2 million, compared with the use of $87.1 million a year ago.", "We generated $101.6 million from working capital compared to a use of $264.9

the current portion of long-term debt refers to our $500 million, 3.75% senior note which matures in October of this year.", "We plan to repay these notes from cash on hand.", "Slide 10 depicts the maturities of our outstanding debt.", "Again, we have the maturity in October of this year, and then only $250 million due in April 2024.", "Thereafter, our next maturity is not until 2028.", "In summary, on slide 11, our teams continue to execute at a high level in an unprecedented environment.", "I would like to reiterate our pride in and gratitude for the efforts of our people.", "The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity means that we remain well positioned, both financially and commercially.", "While we remain very pleased with our results, it's worth reiterating as Ellen just said that this is an unusual, in fact, unprecedented environment in which we're operating.", "Now importantly, it bears noting that when compared to our non-pandemic results in 2019, Q2 results show our company is performing at a very high level.", "We continue to feel this is the result of strategic decisions that we've taken over a number of years to position our company for the future, investments and actions that have created a sustainable advantage for our organization.", "Today's IPG delivers addressable and accountable digital marketing programs, combined with our world-class creative storytelling capabilities, these solutions make us higher value partners to our clients.", "One of our many priorities over the years has been the creation and implementation of open architecture solutions, where we bring the best of IPG together in collaborative teams that are customized to client-specific business needs and increasingly a key element of this approach, Open Architecture 2.0, as it were, is Acxiom whose data management expertise and data assets play a role in an increasingly broad range of our offerings.", "In addition, Kinesso powers many of our applications and services that provide clients with a deep understanding of audiences in order to provide insights and then form creative work, segments for media delivery and line of sight to the effectiveness of the work that we're doing together.", "We saw this model come to life in the quarter with a Cigna count win, which combined talent from McCann Worldgroup Initiative and R/GA powered by Kinesso and Acxiom.", "This is a continuation of several years of strong performance in integrated pitches, especially those that include creative and media, as well as media and data.", "Another another key decision that's contributed to our success has been our continued investment in strong agency brands, which helps us attract and retain top talent and deliver breakthrough creative ideas across a range of marketing disciplines.", "As a result of this strategy, IPG companies across our portfolio earned a number of important accolades during the quarter.", "Most notably, we had an impressive showing at the 2021 Cannes International Festival of Creativity.", "IPG agencies took home eight Grand Prix, the festival's highest honor.", "Wins across the network represented a broad

Health under a new global network, IPG Health, led by a dynamic and proven CEO and a skilled executive leadership team.", "In this new operating structure, the distinct agency brands within FCB Health and McCann Health will remain active and continue to go to market independently.", "They will also benefit from access to additional specialty services, knowledge sharing, proactive career management, shared investment in new capabilities and skill-sets, highly complimentary geographic coverage, as well as an even higher level of collaboration.", "Around the world, healthcare and well-being are areas of growing importance for our clients and society at large.", "As an industry sector, healthcare represents an increasingly vital part of the economy, and one where innovation is becoming an ever more important driver of success.", "So the alignment of IPG's fully dedicated healthcare networks under the banner of IPG Health strengthens our leadership position in this dynamic sector.",
