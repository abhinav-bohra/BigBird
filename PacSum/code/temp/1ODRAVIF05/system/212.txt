Now looking at total company quarter-over-quarter, revenue was down by about $105 million from Q2, roughly half of that was driven by timing of revenue under contracts, as well as lower recoveries, and roughly the other half of that was attributable to the impact from COVID-19, which includes lower royalties from unit shipments across a variety of devices, lower sales of cinema products and services and lower revenue from box office share at Dolby Cinemas.
Products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was minus $3.5 million in the third quarter for the same reasons as I just went over in the GAAP discussion, and there as a reminder, our guidance for non-GAAP product gross margin was minus $5 million to minus $8 million.
Now looking at total company year-over-year, revenue was down by about $55 million versus last year's Q3, and that was predominantly attributable to COVID-19, and similar to what I said a minute ago, lower unit shipments, lower products and services and lower Dolby Cinema revenue.
Broadcast revenues were down about 34% year-over-year, and that was driven by lower recoveries and lower unit volume due to the pandemic, despite the fact that adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos into TVs and set-top boxes is higher than last year.
I'm glad to report that Q3 revenues came in at the high-end of the scenario that we provided three months ago and our earnings were above the range as we had a large tax benefit in the quarter to go along with some lower than projected operating expenses.
And as a reminder, the guidance I gave at the beginning of the quarter was for GAAP gross product margin to range from minus $6 million to minus $9 million.
Products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $5.5 million in the third quarter, due to fixed cost not fully covered by the lower volume that we ran.
