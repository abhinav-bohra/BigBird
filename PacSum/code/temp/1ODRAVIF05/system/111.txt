Based on stronger-than-expected performance in the third quarter, we are again raising our full-year guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS.
Based on what we currently see, we think the most significant COVID impacts to our business are behind us and our outlook for 2021 indicates strong performance next year and a return to our growth trajectory.
Third quarter R&DS contracted backlog, including pass-throughs, grew 18.5% year-over-year to $21.7 billion as of September 30th, 2020.
Consequent on the robust booking activity that Ari talked about, our backlog grew 18.5% year-over-year to close at $21.7 billion and we expect $5.8 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which is an increase of over $400 million versus where we were at June 30th.
Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $604 million with a $22 million beat versus the high end of our guidance range.
Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.63 reflecting the EBITDA drop-through because the below the line items essentially netted out to zero.
The contracted net book-to-bill ratio, including pass-throughs, was 1.71 for the third quarter of 2020 and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs.
