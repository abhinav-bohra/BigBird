The company's focus continues to be supporting our growing community of independent OPTAVIA Coaches as they develop and focus on the four competencies that drive our business success, namely, attracting new clients, supporting clients on the Optimal Weight 5&1 Plan and supporting new coaches and developing coach leaders.
As such, we have combined the most powerful aspects of the direct selling model and direct-to-consumer offerings and created a model that puts the OPTAVIA Coach at the center of helping clients on their health transformation journey with the company providing the distribution infrastructure to supply products directly to the end consumer.
By focusing on building capabilities in the areas that matter most to our OPTAVIA Coaches and client-centered model, we will further enhance and solidify our competitive advantage in the health and wellness space in support of our long-term growth and profit vision.
