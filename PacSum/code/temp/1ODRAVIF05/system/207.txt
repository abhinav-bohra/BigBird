Vector Group's revenues were $652.6 million compared to $547.8 million in the 2020 period, the 104.8 million increase in revenues was a result of an increase of $125.7 million in the real estate segment, partially offset by a decline of $20.9 million in the tobacco segment.
We are doing this because we believe Douglas Elliman as a separate company will leverage its comprehensive suite of real estate solutions, industry leading brand name PropTech Investment Arms, New Valley Ventures LLC, and talented team of finding technology, marketing and communication employees to unleash its growth potential.
We will then discuss the exciting news of our intention to spin-off Vector Group's real estate brokerage business, including Douglas Elliman and its cutting edge PropTech investments into an independent publicly traded company.
