Within vision, our daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios continued posting strong results, leading to share gains around the world.
Regarding first quarter financial results, consolidated revenues were $787 million, with CooperVision at $561 million, up 11%, and CooperSurgical reaching a new all-time high of $226 million, up 30%.
