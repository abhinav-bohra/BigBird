Update a brand architecture to allow us to segment branding, products, channels and pricing to appeal to a broader consumer base; expand into new product categories and push consumer permission of our iconic brand; align product development efforts to address needs of all consumer social subsegment; expand distribution and access points to meet consumers where they shop.
We believe the execution of this new brand architecture will enable us to penetrate new channels of distribution, new product categories and new pricing structures, all of which have the potential to accelerate our growth, while minimizing any potential conflict with our current direct selling channel.
As such, we expect to divest all the non-Tupperware businesses this year and use the proceeds to continue to pay down our debt and continue to invest in the business.
Hector Lezama now leads our nondirect selling business, which include key markets, like China and Korea, along with all the important markets, and most importantly, our efforts to penetrate new channels of distribution.
