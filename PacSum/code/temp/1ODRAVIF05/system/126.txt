Corporate expenses of $26.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 were up from $10.6 million a year prior, driven primarily by acquisition-related expenses associated with the NxEdge transaction, as well as increased incentive compensation expenses, driven mainly by our fourth quarter share price performance.
Select product, select price actions, and the net benefit of strategic portfolio reshaping completed in both 2020 and 2021, partially offset by raw material inflation, as well as supply chain labor and logistics constraints.
We continue to successfully reshape our portfolio and shift toward our growth markets with products and services that command higher margins and cash flow returns.

We saw strong demand in the semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, aerospace, general industrial, and food and pharma markets, as well as contributions from the acquisitions of Alluxa and NxEdge, which were largely offset by the reduction in sales due to divestitures and weakness in the automotive market.
Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by inflationary pressures affecting raw materials, freight and labor costs, and higher SG&A, more than offsetting pricing initiatives and the benefit of the reshaping actions completed in 2020 and 2021.
