Supported by our decision early on as the pandemic unfolded, to refrain from initiating staffing reductions and to focus on positioning the company to fully participate in the recovery, our people around the world responded to a rapid acceleration in demand by leveraging the ITW business model to provide excellent service to our customers, while keeping themselves and their co-workers safe.
Overall, the pace of recovery in the third quarter exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter, as we delivered revenue of $3.3 billion, operating income of $789 million, free cash flow of $631 million, and GAAP earnings per share of $1.83.
On the flip side, demand levels in our Food Equipment and Welding segments continue to be materially impacted by the effects of the pandemic, although we did see good sequential improvement in both in Q3 versus Q2.
