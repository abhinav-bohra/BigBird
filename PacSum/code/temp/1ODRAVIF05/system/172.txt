During a time of significant retail disruption, they remain focused on safely serving our customers and continue to implement the key initiatives we outlined on our year-end earnings call in November.
Despite the external pressures of the macro environment, our teams also did an excellent job on margin and expense control, which resulted in first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.50, up 6% on a year-on-year basis.
Indeed, for much of the quarter, especially in the latter weeks, we were operating against the backdrop of temporary store closures, capacity restrictions, salon shutdowns and an acceleration in COVID rates that most certainly impacted traffic in our open locations.
This allowed us to deliver strong gross margins, profitability and cash flow despite top line headwinds caused by the pandemic.
In addition, vivid colors remained on trend and delivered another quarter of strong performance, up approximately 50% at Sally U.S. and Canada over the prior year.
