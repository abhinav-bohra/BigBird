Overall, our higher expected synergies, additional cost saving actions, improvement in our product margins and our cash flow management are expected to continue to help us during this period of time when our volumes are down versus pre-COVID levels.
The positive cash flow nature of our business during severe times is something we have discussed with investors in the past and we are now seeing the positive impacts again in these tough times.
Overall, our sales were down 27% from the second quarter last year on a pro forma basis and down 24% from the first quarter.
