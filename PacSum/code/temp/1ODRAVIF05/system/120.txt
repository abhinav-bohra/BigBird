We had an excellent second quarter with a 24% increase in adjusted earnings per share from the second quarter of 2020 and a record 1.8 gigawatts of renewables under long-term contracts added to our backlog bringing our total to 8.5 gigawatt.
During the second quarter we concluded key outstanding regulatory proceedings at both of our U.S. Utilities, clearing the path for investment in the latest technologies, which will enable us to deliver a higher level of service and reduce carbon emissions.
We remain on track to achieve 7% to 9% average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share and parent-free cash flow through 2025.
