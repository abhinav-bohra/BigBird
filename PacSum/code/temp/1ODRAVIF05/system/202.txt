Average segment income from continuing operations over the last four quarters, or last 12 months June 2021 is approximately $100 million per quarter higher than the average of the four preceding quarters or LTM June 2020, with approximately $60 million of that income growth found in the Americas Beverage segment, clearly a step change in our earnings outlook.
Segment income improved to $395 million in the quarter compared to $250 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales unit volumes including recovery in many locations affected by COVID in last year's second quarter.
Commercial shipments from the first line of the company's new beverage can plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky commenced in June with shipments from the second line scheduled to begin in September.
Demand remained strong across all product lines, and geographies, and importantly the company continues to convert this growth into record earnings.
