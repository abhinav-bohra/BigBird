Professional segment operating earnings for the second quarter decreased 29.2% to $106 million, reflecting a 460 basis point decline in segment operating earnings as a percent of sales, primarily due to manufacturing variance as a result of COVID-19 related facility closures and social distancing initiatives, incremental marketing, engineering and administrative costs as a result of the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions, higher warranty expense and unfavorable product mix.

Our results this quarter were net sales sales of $929 million, down 3.4% from the prior year, primarily due to reduced Professional segment retail demand as a result of COVID-19.
Offsetting the gains from acquisitions were declines in most of our Professional businesses as a result of soft retail demand due to COVID-19.
