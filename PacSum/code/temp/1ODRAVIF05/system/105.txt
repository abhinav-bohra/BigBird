We are seeing strong guest spending per capita and our active pass base has surpassed prior year first quarter levels placing us solidly on track toward recovery we have center decision making squarely on our guests extending privileges for season passes and memberships while also offering high tiered benefits to our members who continue their payments and they have rewarded us with their loyalty.
We expect these labor challenges to start to abate as we enter the core of our operating season at the same time, the overall operating environment remains challenging, as we balance the requirement to delivering a safe experience during the pandemic, while still delighting our guests, our safety protocols have reduced right throughput, which can result in longer the normal lines and less rides per guest.
We are pleased with the retention of our active pass base of 4.1 million pass holders, which included 1.7 million members and 2.4 million traditional season pass holders at the end of first quarter 2021.
Therefore our parks are naturally conducive to social distancing and all states are supportive of working with us to safely increase attendance levels our recent results in guest surveys indicate that there is extraordinary demand for outdoor entertainment options close to home and we believe that this widespread desire will help drive attendance in the coming quarters.
The increase in admissions spending per capita compared to 2019 was driven primarily by higher realized ticket deals for both single day tickets and the active pass base as our revenue management team focused on leveraging our pricing and product mix.
First, I will provide an overview of our recent operating performance and the strong demand trends we are seeing second Sandeep will go into more detail about our financial results and give an update on the progress of our transformation plan.
Through this past weekend our year-to-date attendance trends have accelerated at our open parks increasing to 79% of 2019 levels compared to 51% in the 4th quarter of 2020.
Beginning in October 2020 the company prospectively began allocating an incremental portion resulting in a reduction in admission spending per capita and an increase in in-park spending per capita with no change in total guest spending per capita.
Looking ahead, we expect the active pass base trends to continue to improve as we have begun selling new season passes and memberships.
