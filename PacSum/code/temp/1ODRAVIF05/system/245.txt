The biggest contributor to this quarter's growth were institutional asset management clients, as we continue to see strength in our workstation and accelerating growth in our analytics workflow solutions.
These teams continue to drive increased retention and expansion rates among our existing clients, while achieving a high number of new business wins.
As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 32 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 72 basis points lower on an adjusted basis.
