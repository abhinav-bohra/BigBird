Our Carter's brand wholesale sales were down about 25% in the quarter, driven by retailers cautiously planning for second half sales and our decision earlier this year to curtail fall and holiday inventory commitments.
With respect to product performance, we continue to see good demand for our baby apparel and sleepwear product offerings.
Our omni-channel customers, those who enjoy both the online and in-store experience, are our highest value customers with annual spending more than twice that of our single-channel customer.
We achieved a record gross profit margin in the quarter with improved price realization and fewer and better promotions.
Given the pandemic-related uncertainty in consumer demand, we believe operating with leaner inventories is a better strategy through the balance of this year, even if it comes at the expense of fewer sales.
Generally speaking, most of our wholesale customers are lean on inventories, seeing better sell-throughs, higher margins and in a chase mode, given better-than-expected demand for our brands.
Adjusted operating income grew 4% to $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 13.8%, driven by our strong gross margin performance and management of spending.
Our Labor Day holiday sales were the strongest in the past three years, with comparable retail sales up 15% during that shopping period.
