These results reflect outperformance in worksite employee growth and pricing relative to our expectations in this uncertain and challenging business environment and upside in our direct cost programs brought about by the dynamics of the pandemic and the structure and ongoing management of these programs.
Now this increase was driven by a few items: first, our outperformance in the level of paid worksite employees and earnings during the pandemic; second, the shift in the weighting to performance stock awards from the performance cash awards for 2020 to further align our employees' interest with shareholders during these challenging times; third, the acceleration of expense for employees meeting retirement eligibility requirements under recent modifications to our plan; and fourth, a comparison to prior year's quarter in which earnings and related performance-based compensation were adversely impacted by large healthcare claim activity.
Now turning to operating expenses, Q3 operating expenses included continued investment in our growth, including costs associated with a 10% increase in the average number of trained business performance advisors.
Now, let's discuss our third quarter results in which we achieved $0.91 in adjusted earnings per share, a 21% increase over Q3 of 2019 and adjusted EBITDA of $58 million, a 13% increase.
