This improvement is due to our strong service delivery and gives us the ability to sell up the enterprise technology stack from our GIS business to our GBS business.
Jim will detail out the financial results of all of these operational work that, simply put, this work is allowing us to improve margins from 8% in Q1 to 8.6% in Q2 and gives us the confidence to increase our margin and earnings per share guidance for FY '22.
Today's agenda will begin with an update on our Q2 performance, which shows hard evidence that we are delivering on our transformation journey and building the foundation to make DXC operationally efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow.
These efforts to better manage this form of financing allowed us to reduce our debt and ultimately our capital lease cash outflows from $245 million in Q1 FY '21 to $177 million this quarter.
Focus on the customers is the second step of our transformation journey and continues to be the primary driver of our success in improving our organic revenue growth.
This is the third straight quarter of both improving organic revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q3.
The second quarter was impacted by previously disclosed cash tax payments related to business disposals, accelerated interest payments due to our refinancing and a payment related to restructuring a vendor relationship to take greater control over our delivery.
Now let me remind you that the way we will get to grow is to deliver the GIS services that are critical for our customers and build trusted relationships.
This quarter, we made particularly strong progress on strengthening our balance sheet and solidifying our financial position, cash generation and reducing restructuring and TSI expense.
