For example, performance in two key elements of our growth strategy, accelerating the transition of patients to Optum-led value-based care and strong United Healthcare growth in serving Medicare Advantage consumers, are both tracking well with the expectations we shared with you at our recent investor conference.
When you look back at the prevailing themes for 2021, you see a story of accelerating growth, strong collaboration between Optum and UnitedHealthcare and with our many external partners helped us grow in serving both commercial and government markets, unlock new innovation, introduce integrated products and services to the marketplace and significantly increased the number of people benefiting from value-based models of care.
We can better use the significant breadth, volume, and value of our foundational pharmacy services and data capabilities and integrate our medical pharmacy and behavioral capabilities, all of this to provide whole person care, support the discovery of new drugs and treatments and support value-based models of care.
