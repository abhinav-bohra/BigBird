We delivered strong growth for the full fiscal year, including a 5.1% increase in organic net sales; adjusted operating profit of nearly $2 billion, up 7.4% versus fiscal '20; and operating margin of 17.5% for the year, an increase of more than 100 basis points versus fiscal '20; an adjusted EBITDA increase of 6.5%; and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15.8% for the year.
Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, our expectations for fiscal 2022, and our perspective on how the Conagra Way playbook positions us for continued success in this dynamic environment.
We expect many of our actions will start to flow through the P&L in Q2, setting up a second-half adjusted earnings per share in line with what was assumed for H2 within our prior guidance.
And as you can see, on a two-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased by more than 4% and our two-year adjusted earnings per share grew by more than 22%.
On a full-year basis, our organic net sales, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted earnings per share were all up materially versus fiscal 2020.
