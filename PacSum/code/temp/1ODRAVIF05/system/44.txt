This compares to the third quarter 2020 NAREIT FFO of $106.7 million or $0.25 per diluted share, which includes aggregate charges of $16.1 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to severance for our voluntary early retirement program and early redemption of $485 million of unsecured bonds.
With the finalization of the Weingarten merger, we've been able to execute on several accretive investments and new initiatives and with the addition of new joint venture partners inherited through Weingarten, we are excited about potential growth opportunities.
NAREIT FFO was $173.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share and includes $47 million or $0.08 per diluted share of merger-related expenses.
