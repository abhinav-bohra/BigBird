Today, we reported all-time record quarter results with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.79, an increase of 207% compared to last year.
These efforts allowed us to deliver adjusted SG&A as a percent of gross profit, a 62.7% in the first quarter of 2021 which represents a 1,120 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2020.
These outstanding results were driven by strong performance in new, used and customer financial services and disciplined expense management.
