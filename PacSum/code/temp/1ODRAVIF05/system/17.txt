We delivered solid performance in fee income again in the third quarter with relatively stable results on a linked quarter basis and a 23% year-over-year increase as the benefit of our counter-cyclical businesses in fixed income and mortgage banking helped to mitigate COVID related pressure in some of our more traditional banking fee income streams.
I feel like we're well positioned in terms of a strong balance sheet, strong while taking capacity, strong capital and also positioned with a tailwind in the sense that we have our non -- our counter-cyclical businesses and we also have the ability to realize a significant amount of cost savings over the next 18 months to 24 months.
