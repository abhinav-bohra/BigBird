Our Environmental Services segment, after a difficult February due to the deep freeze in the South, rebounded with an outstanding March, driven by greater volumes of high-value waste streams and the ongoing recovery in many of our service businesses.
Revenue for Safety-Kleen Sustainability Solutions was essentially flat with the prior year as higher base oil pricing and charge for oil rates were offset by slightly lower volumes, particularly on the waste oil collection side.
Even so, our margins were up 70 basis points and this was driven by a combination of pricing, cost savings, revenue mix and $4.5 million in government assistance.
Our newly formed SKSS segment delivered better-than-expected profitability due to ongoing base oil pricing gains driven by market conditions.
