This expansion and diversification of our customer base present many exciting opportunities to deliver solutions for underserved spaces and places, from B2B which brings an exciting new customer profile, to our global business which drives expansion across new geographies, to our cross-brand and marketplace opportunities which expands the reach of our current bank and to the expansion of Williams-Sonoma Home, which attends to an underserved, high-end luxury market and has massive future potential for scaling.
In an industry occupied by market players who have not yet made significant investment in their e-commerce capabilities and pure e-commerce players without the service element of our retail business, we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend as a digital first, but not digital-only company.
We're extremely proud to deliver yet another quarter of outperformance with comps of 16.9%, building to an accelerated two-year stack of 41.3% and operating margin expansion of 60 basis points.
Pottery Barn, we're excited to share that our B2B growth initiative continues to produce record performance with our largest quarter ever, generating over $200 million of sales, nearly double that of last year.
In short, the fragmented industry, the strong housing market, the shift of the consumer online, and the consumer demand for sustainability provide specific unique and sizable opportunities for our company to continue to grow.
Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter, with a comp of 15.9%, driven by strong growth in all product categories, including our seasonal decorating business.
