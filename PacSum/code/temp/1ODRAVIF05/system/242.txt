For the second quarter, I'll start at Slide 8, our net income decreased by $11.7 million to $5.3 million and that is a difference from a $0.35 gain in the second quarter of 2019 to an $0.11 gain in the second quarter of 2020, is that we had no rate relief from the California Commission.
Just as a preface, I think most of you who're on the call are aware that the major factor for the Company in this quarter is the -- really the same as it was in the first quarter and that is that we have not received either a proposed decision or a decision on our California General Rate Case, which was expected prior to January 1st of 2020.
We had $6.5 million of increased water production expenses, of which $5.7 million would have been offset by those regulatory mechanisms and we had $2.1 million of increased pension benefit expenses which also would have been offset by those regulatory mechanisms, had they have been in place.
