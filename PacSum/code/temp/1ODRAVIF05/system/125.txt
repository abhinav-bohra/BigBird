Milestones that helped support this goal included price increase for the majority of our US wood connector products in the third quarter of 2018, the signing of one of our largest US homebuilding companies onto our builder program resulting in 23 of the Top 25 US builders now engaged on our program, strong repair and remodel trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of Lowe's as the home center customer in mid-2020.
At the same time, we did experience certain tailwinds in our business as a result of the COVID-19 related macroeconomic conditions, namely we had favorable steel prices, temporary reduction in travel and related operating expenses, and an increase in repair and remodel activity.
Since the onset of the 2020 plan, we have returned over 83% of our cash generated by operations to our shareholders, far exceeding our target of 50% I'm extremely proud of all that we've accomplished in these past three years and by executing on the 2020 plan, we achieved solid organic growth, we've rationalized our cost structure to improve companywide profitability and we've improved our working capital management and balance sheet position, in turn creating value for all key Simpson stakeholders.
The increase in sales volume we experienced in the fourth quarter was primarily related to ongoing momentum in the home center distribution channel, which includes both our home centers and co-op customers.
Our solid gross margin combined with effective expense management and reduced costs from travel and other restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 drove a 7.8% year-over-year increase in our income from operations to $39.5 million and earnings of $0.68 per diluted share.
