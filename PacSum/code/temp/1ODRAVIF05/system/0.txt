We also set two additional quarterly company records: we generated the highest quarterly home closing gross margin of 29.7% in company history as a result of pricing power, more than offsetting the elevated lumber and other commodity costs; and our quarterly diluted earnings per share of $5.25 was the highest in our company's history.
Our east region with the highest entry-level product mix with -- representing 80% of the average community was the only region to generate year-over-year growth in order volume of 3% despite metering as a result of an 8% increase in average active communities in the third quarter, which offset a 4% decrease in average absorption pace.
That being said, the sustained favorable pricing environment stemming from the elevated demand for our products over the past few quarters and the tight housing supply conditions led to ASP increase on orders, backlog and closings that are masking our ongoing product mix shift toward entry level.
These strategic supply side partnerships and our operating model focus on spec homes and limited SKUs, allowed us to deliver 3,112 homes, which set the company record for the highest third quarter of home closings.
The macro drivers for market demand continued to be what we've experienced all of '21: limited housing supply, still extremely low interest rates and higher home buying activity from millennials and baby boomers who are experiencing life events associated with changes in housing needs.
