In the past three years, CCM has accelerated their world-class performance leveraging consistent organic growth focused on providing the ultimate customer service, the Carlisle Experience, and instituting greater price discipline, developing sophisticated sourcing and purchasing capabilities and maintaining a continuous improvement culture, all aiming to drive increased profitability and shareholder value.
Aided by the Carlisle experience and our market position, CCM should continue to capture placement of installed roofing systems and grow share with new energy-efficient, labor reducing and cost-effective product and solutions in the $6 billion and growing market.
As shown on Slide 5, CCM has continued to evolve from its roots, the early 1960s of a simple, single-ply roofing membrane division to today where we deliver innovative easy to install and energy-efficient solutions throughout -- through the Carlisle Experience for customers who are creating the sustainable building for the future.
While we expect this momentum to continue as vaccines help decrease risk, the construction industry is still contending with uneven regional disruptions due to COVID restrictions, severe weather in certain areas and tight labor dynamics, which is resulting in deferred demand continuing to build the backlog of work.
