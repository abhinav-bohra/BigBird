Synchrony's third quarter financial results reflected broad-based strength across our business, highlighted by a double-digit purchase volume increase and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our net interest margin, historically low losses and delinquencies, and continued cost discipline.
Of course, this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions, leading to a 2% increase in loans, including loans held for sale.
And so Synchrony has continuously evolved, adding new financing options, enhancing our technology platform and expanding our channels and distribution networks in order to reach and serve more partners and customers in sustainable ways that drive greater value for all.
Last week, we announced our expanded strategic partnership with Fiserv through which small businesses will now be able to access Synchrony products and services and accept private label credit card payments via the Clover point of sale and business management platform from Fiserv.
