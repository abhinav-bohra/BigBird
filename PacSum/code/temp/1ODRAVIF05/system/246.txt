This industry group, which was most impacted by the pandemic, generated 43% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter as air travel trends improved markedly over the prior year and we capitalized on new business opportunities, including the expansion of our parking operations at airports.
We continue to support our clients by providing high value services and solutions that have enabled them to navigate unprecedented challenges over the past couple of years and with the recent acquisition of Able, we significantly expanded our capabilities to comprehensively address our clients' evolving needs across the spectrum of facilities management and engineering solutions.
