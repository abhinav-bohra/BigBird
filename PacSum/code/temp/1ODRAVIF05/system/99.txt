For the fourth quarter of FY '20, Brinker reported consolidated net comp sales of negative 36.7%, although comp sales recorded material improvement as the quarter progressed with the June period consolidated results down 19%.
And in the 84% of our company-owned restaurants with open dining rooms were down just 3.8%, and 36% of our company-owned Chili's restaurants ran positive comp sales for the month.
Sales continue to build every week, and we clearly see the potential to exceed $150 million in the brand's first year, which would secure It's Just wings a spot in the top 200 restaurant brands.
And with our operators' disciplined margin management, we delivered positive cash flow for the quarter, which we used to pay down debt.
You'll hear some of the same themes from us, like progressive improvements throughout the quarter as dining rooms reopened, growth in off-premise and digital expansion.
And of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations.
