As soon as we start to see the surges stop, we see the impact of COVID end, and we're confident that the recovery's going to mean that the normal patient flow is going to start again and we're going to have the pull-through effect of a sizable patient backlog that's been created over the past number of quarters.
And then third, I want to make sure that we again touch upon our long-term growth strategy and how it positions us to drive growth, obviously as a company, but also value for you and value for us.
We truly do believe for both companies, we think about NewCo and we think it's going to thrive as an independent company with prioritized capital allocation to pursue strategies and growth opportunities and truly investments inside of Spine and Dental.
And it's our plan to drive long-term growth and ultimately as a result of that deliver increased value for you, and to do that, we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations.
And simply put, we expect that these two companies with their simplified operating models and just reduced complexity and increased focus will be able to grow revenue, margin and earnings per share faster than they would if we remain combined as one company.
