At the same time, our adjusted EBITDA increased to a record $122.6 million, driven by our mix of high-value waste streams and high utilization, augmented by projects and emergency response work.
We have reset our net CapEx spend plans for 2020, and we've lowered our expected spend by more than $50 million to preserve capital and support our free cash flow for the year.
The first quarter began with positive signs that IMO 2020 was going to enable us to expand our refining spread as high sulfur fuel oil values had fallen, and base oil prices were up in early January.
Adjusted EBITDA and margin improved on lower SK Oil transportation costs and higher rerefining production compared with a year ago when volumes were disrupted by frozen rivers and flooding.
In addition to limited driving and business activity across North America, Safety-Kleen also had been affected by the sharp downturn and the value of base oil.
As an essential services provider with teams on the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis, we have instituted rigorous safety protocols and work closely with suppliers to make certain we have the necessary equipment to protect our employees.
In addition, we've temporarily shutted half of our rerefining capacity to reflect the current demand for base oil as well as the likelihood of less available used motor oil in Q2 and beyond.
