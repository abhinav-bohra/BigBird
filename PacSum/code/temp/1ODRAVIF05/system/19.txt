In evaluating our results for the second quarter and first half, you should keep in mind the following: First, our non-GAAP results exclude non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions, including fair value adjustments to Topgolf's leases and debt; noncash depreciation expense from the fair value step-up of Topgolf assets; transaction and transition costs from the acquisitions; noncash amortization of the debt discount on the notes issued during the second quarter of 2020; the $174 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020 related to the Jack Wolfskin goodwill and trade name; a $253 million non-cash gain related to the write-up of our premerger Topgolf investment; a $33 million benefit in the second quarter of 2021 from the reversal of a portion of the noncash valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets and certain other nonrecurring items.
Still, given how lean inventories are already, the fact that nearly all our factories are running at 100% capacity, and that we'll need to shift production shortly toward next year's launches to protect that supply, these shutdowns will have an estimated $55 million negative impact on second-half revenues, primarily in our golf equipment segment and primarily in Q3.
We expect to deliver record performance for our golf equipment segment this year, and perhaps most importantly, we continue to believe the outlook for the golf equipment category is highly positive, with both a larger total market and a higher embedded growth rate.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes, among other things, the $174 million non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020, our total costs and expenses increased $503 million to $796 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared to $293 million in the second quarter of 2020.
