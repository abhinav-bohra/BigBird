The gas utility posted an increase of $0.19 per share related to new rates in Oregon beginning November 1, 2020, offset in part by higher depreciation and general tax expense and the impacts of COVID-19.
Our overall customer growth rate as a result was 1.5% for the same period, based on this strong single-family home construction, partially offset by the loss of some commercial customers due to the pandemic.
The remaining $3.8 million that cannot be recovered through rates are primarily due to lower natural gas utility margin from customers that stopped service and slightly lower usage from customers that are not decoupled.
