The High Performance Materials & Components segment, or HPMC, saw its margins improve by more than 200 basis points sequentially and nearly 300 basis points year-over-year.
We'll continue to drive these improvements utilizing new skills and tools to provide more flexibility to our employees and create better connections with our customers, and we'll capture the associated structural cost savings.
Due to the market recovery and our recent share gains, our Forgings revenue exceeded both the prior year and the prior quarter levels.
It should be noted that while we removed strike-related costs from segment earnings, segment revenues also declined nearly $140 million versus the first quarter due to plant outages and resulting production declines.
