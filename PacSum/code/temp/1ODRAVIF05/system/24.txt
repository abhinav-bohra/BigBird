Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 19.2%, driven mainly by increasing volume and associated absorption, incremental simplification/modernization benefits, partially offset by the reversal of temporary cost control actions taken in the prior year.
The additional simplification/modernization savings in fiscal year '21 bought the total savings achieved from the program to $186 million, in line with the target range we announced in our December 2017 Investor Day, despite lower volumes than we envisioned at that time.
The improved year-over-year performance was related to higher volumes and associated absorption, benefits from simplification/modernization and a slight positive from price and raw materials, partially offset by roughly $45 million of temporary cost actions taken last year and a modest mix headwind.
In fiscal year '21, despite the obvious COVID-19 challenges, we continue to operate safely to serve customers and invest in our commercial and operational excellence initiatives, including simplification/modernization.
These investments enable higher levels of customer service and new product innovations, some recent examples of which include the HARVI I TE endmill, which was a 2021 Golden Edge Award winner for Best Product Innovation at the China International Machine Tool Trade Show and is helping us gain share in aerospace and general engineering.
In fact, the structural cost savings for the program are already contributing to strong underlying operating leverage as volumes recover, which we saw in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year '21 and expect to continue in fiscal year '22 and beyond.
We ended the year on a particularly strong note, with positive momentum heading into fiscal year '22, enabled by continued market recovery and advancement of our strategic initiatives that are transforming the company.
