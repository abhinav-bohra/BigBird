Our unique Defense/IT portfolio, strong balance sheet and reliable low-risk development program continue to generate high-quality FFO per share and cash flow growth that are extremely durable because demand is driven by defense spending and national security requirements rather than traditional office fundamentals.
Third quarter FFO is adjusted for comparability of $0.57, outperformed the high end of guidance by $0.01, and represented the sixth time in the past seven quarters that we outperformed expectations.
Our growth strategy targets owning and developing specialized office and data center shells in mission-critical Defense/IT locations, and this strategy continues to deliver excellent results.
Including the impact of assets sold to fund development, for the nine-month period, NOI from real estate operations increased 7%, FFO per share as adjusted for comparability grew 10%, and AFFO is up 16% from one year ago.
