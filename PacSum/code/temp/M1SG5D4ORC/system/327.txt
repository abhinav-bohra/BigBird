I'd also spend a little bit of time working on the deposit portfolio, the work that Raj is talking about is, has been a daily level of kind of bruising work that's not that glamorous but we're working very hard on new account operating relationships, cross-selling within the book, ensuring the ECR rates are set at appropriate levels really working hard on kind of the building blocks of this and I think the two places that you see it, number one, are the continued NII DDA growth obviously in the $324 million, but also secondarily, if you look at service charges, deposit fees on accounts was up 33% for this quarter compared to the same period last year.
Before I hand this over to Tom, just let me say, sort of what are the top in my mind in terms of what we're trying to achieve in the short to medium term sales is basically loan growth but not reaching for loan growth as getting caught up in that and going outside of the risk, that's not acceptable but loan growth restarting the growth engine on the left of the balance sheet is a top priority, continue to improve deposits, while we've made a lot of progress on that.
