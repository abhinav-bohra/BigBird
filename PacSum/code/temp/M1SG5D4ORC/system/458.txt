In addition to adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, consumer mortgage fees were up 135% from the year-ago period.
Our first quarter was a strong start to the year as we executed our strategy and delivered positive operating leverage relative to the year-ago period.
We generated record first-quarter revenue, which reflected broad-based growth across our company, driven by our fee-based businesses.
As Chris said, it was a strong start to the year with net income from continuing operations of $0.61 per common share, up 9% from the prior quarter and over four times from the year-ago period.
Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road and as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business with $3 billion of consumer mortgage loans this quarter.
Total average loans were $101 billion, up 5% from the first quarter of last year, driven by growth in both commercial and consumer loans.
