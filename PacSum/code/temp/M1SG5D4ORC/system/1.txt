While we encountered a net loss for the year largely due to a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in the first quarter and workforce reduction charges in the second quarter, we were profitable on an adjusted net income basis for the year.
In addition to improving revenue trends with the fourth quarter down 12% versus 25% in the third quarter, we sustained our cost discipline to drive year-over-year growth of 25% in income from operations.
Our revenue trends have been improving each quarter since Q2 2020, and we posted positive net income in the third and fourth quarters.
