Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $733.3 million, or 7.65% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $292.8 million, or 262 basis points from the same period last year.
This improvement was driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 204 basis points and leverage on fixed occupancy cost of 114 basis points, partially offset by shipping expenses resulting from meaningfully higher eCommerce sales growth.
This merchandise margin expansion drove a significant improvement in gross margin, which on a non-GAAP basis increased 507 basis points.
SG&A dollars increased $178 million compared to last year's non-GAAP results, driven by $152 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs, as well as a $30 million donation we made to the DICK's Foundation to help jump-start youth sports program struggling to come back from the pandemic.
From a channel standpoint, our brick-and-mortar stores comped positively for a second straight quarter, increasing mid-single digits and our eCommerce sales increased 57%, representing nearly one-third of our total business.
SG&A expenses were $2.3 billion, or 23.98% of net sales on a non-GAAP basis, and leveraged 25 basis points from last year, primarily driven by the significant sales increase.
