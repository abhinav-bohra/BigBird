While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year, with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal-year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit, and all the while, fighting for recovery of patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts.
Importantly, we see a clear opportunity to increase our long-term sustainable market share as patients, physicians and providers experience our ResMed market-leading device and integrated cloud-based software solutions.
A few things that have become really clear during this pandemic is that every country in the world has: one, increased its adoption of digital health solutions; two, increased its focus on respiratory hygiene and respiratory health; and three, increased its investments in healthcare treatment outside the hospital and particularly in the home.
During the quarter, demand for ResMed's sleep and respiratory care devices surged dramatically after a competitor's recall announcement, putting additional pressure on an already challenging environment for our industry's supply chain.
