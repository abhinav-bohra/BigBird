Excluding among other things the effect of other product-related charges, which resulted in a $10.6 million gross profit impact related to inventory write-offs, which included donations of products to local communities, we delivered adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.54 compared with adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.72 in the second quarter of 2019.
In our pineapple product line, net sales were $114 million compared with $126 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to lower selling prices and sales volume in North America and Europe.
The decrease in net sales was primarily the result of lower net sales in our fresh-cut food and vegetables, avocado, pineapple and prepared food product line.
Despite continued disruption in foodservice sale and shifting demand at retail during the second quarter of 2020, we achieved a net income per diluted share of $0.38 per share versus net income per diluted share of $0.78 in the second quarter of 2019.
