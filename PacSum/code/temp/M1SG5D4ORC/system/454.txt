Highlights for National Retail Properties in 2020 include: increasing the common stock dividend for the 31st consecutive year, a feat matched by only two other REITs and by less than 1% of all U.S. public companies; raising $700 million of well-priced debt capital early in the year, which put us in a strong liquidity position as the pandemic began to spread and enabled us to end 2020 with $267 million of cash in the bank and nothing drawn on our $900 million line of credit; reaching collaborative rent deferral agreements during the early stages of the pandemic with a number of our relationship tenants, which solidified our relationships and set us up for future acquisition business; collecting 95.7% of our rents due for the fourth quarter and 89.7% of our annual base rent for the year 2020; supporting our associates and our community with programs and activities to advance associate well-being, employee engagement and community involvement; and lastly, enhancing our executive leadership team with the appointment of Steve Horn, a 17-year veteran with the company, as our Chief Operating Officer.
As I've said before, perhaps the best word to describe National Retail Properties is consistent: consistent investment focus on single-tenant retail properties; consistency of people and culture; consistently raising the dividend for 31 consecutive years; consistent conservative balance sheet philosophy that maintains flexibility and dry powder; consistent long-term tenant relationships.
Notwithstanding the impact of the pandemic, our broadly diversified portfolio of 3,143 single-tenant retail properties ended the year with an occupancy rate of 98.5%, which continues to exceed our long-term average of 98%.
During the fourth quarter, we invested $102 million in 42 new single-tenant retail properties at an initial cash yield of 6.2% and at an average lease duration of 20 years.
