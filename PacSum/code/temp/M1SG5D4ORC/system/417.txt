Now this compares to $201 million earned in 2019 and exceeds both our recent guidance range of $204 million to $210 million and even more incredibly exceeds our original pre-pandemic guidance for the year of $200 million to $210 million of EBITDA.
That's about $2.5 million shy of our original goal of $12 million, which was primarily due to our better-than-expected performance resulting in higher bonus accruals, and special bonuses paid out to our team members at year-end for their extraordinary efforts in extraordinary times.
