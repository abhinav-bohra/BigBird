Reported earnings per share decreased 15% to $0.45, driven primarily by a $28 million after-tax loss on the divestiture of InTelCo Management LLC, formerly a wholly owned subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets, as well as prior-year income tax benefits, and increased corporate and environmental costs.
From a profitability perspective, despite increasing pressure from commodity costs and supply chain disruptions, we delivered nearly 400 basis points of adjusted segment margin expansion, with triple-digit margin expansion in each segment.
The strong performance was a combination of higher sales volume, commercial actions and productivity, offset by raw material inflation and unfavorable mix, given the growth in pump projects and continued investments for growth, which are critical to sustain ITT's outperformance.
The increased sales volume and strong productivity expected in 2021 will generate adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 at the high end, which equates to 22% to 27% growth versus prior year.
