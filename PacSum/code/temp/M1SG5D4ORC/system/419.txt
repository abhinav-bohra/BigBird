Adjusted operating revenues of $654 million increased 25% compared to the second quarter of 2020, while diluted adjusted operating income per share of $3.25 rose 33%.
Segment results were very strong and operating revenues of $384 million increased 17% and pre-tax operating income of $117 million rose 23% year-over-year.
The higher persistency lowered DAC amortization by $14 million, which was partly offset by $6 million in higher benefit reserves for a net contribution of $8 million to pre-tax income for the quarter.
