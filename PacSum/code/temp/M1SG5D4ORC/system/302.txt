Our third quarter represented our second-highest net revenue and earnings per share, as both operating segments, Global Wealth and Institutional, generated strong results.
The growth in revenue and lower expense ratios resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, which is up 56% year-on-year, and $4.85 year-to-date, which is up 68%.
And based on our investment banking and recruiting pipelines, organic bank growth and expertise in acquisitions, Stifel remains well positioned to continue and build upon our decades-long growth.
