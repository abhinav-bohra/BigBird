These pricing actions, coupled with our strong organic volume growth which is up 13% year-to-date, is the basis for our confidence that H.B. Fuller's innovative solutions and global network will continue to drive share gains and significant margin improvement in the quarters ahead.
This top line performance reflects broad-based double-digit organic revenue growth in all three global business units and includes significant contributions from both volume and pricing.
As expected, HHC segment EBITDA margin of 12% was down versus last year's strong volume leverage and pricing gains were offset by higher raw material costs.
Our margins in the quarter were reduced as expected and we expect to see significant margin recovery in Q4 and 2022 as our price increases begin to outpace raw material increases and other inflation.
In a world where there are unprecedented supply chain shortages and significant inflationary pressures impacting every portion of our business, H.B. Fuller delivered double-digit growth and met our bottom line commitments.
Through the third quarter, we have implemented $225 million of price adjustments and we took the decisive step of announcing a September 1st increase and surcharge in order to offset further raw material cost increases.
