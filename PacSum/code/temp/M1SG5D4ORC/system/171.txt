We have collectively defined net effective lease mark-to-market of our operating portfolio as the growth rate from in-place rents to market rents.
UKLV's $1.7 billion of operating assets were contributed to our PELF and PELP Ventures, we earned net promote income of $0.05 in connection with the closeout of this venture and our percentage of infinite life vehicles has consequently grown to 95% of our $66 billion of third-party assets under management.
This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI of more than $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rent growth.
