As a result, today, we're announcing additional rent deferrals for Bickford, which together with other previously announced rent deferrals, will impact cash NOI growth by up to approximately $5.5 million over the next two quarters or approximately 3.5% of our trailing six-month cash NOI before deferrals.
While our triple-net strategy continues to mitigate the cash NOI effects from COVID, and more importantly, our operators continue to soundly execute on our infectious control protocols, as Eric just mentioned, a subset of our senior housing portfolio experienced more pronounced COVID occupancy declines in the third quarter than what we saw over the summer.
Our debt capital metrics for the quarter ending September 30 were our net debt to annualized EBITDA at 4.8 times, weighted average debt maturity at 2.9 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 6.3 times.
We are also continuing to work with prospective lenders and Bickford on the previously disclosed sale of nine properties, which we estimate will improve Bickford's annual cash flow by approximately $3 million.
