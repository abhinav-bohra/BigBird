We continue to build on our strong momentum in the fourth quarter, with the team delivering a contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.41, including pass-throughs and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs.
The revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3,298 million, which was $108 million above the high end of our guidance range.
The business is advanced in the use of secondary data, remote monitoring and virtual research approaches, which helped the team pivot quickly to working in the new remote world at the onset of the pandemic.
The $25 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance.
We delivered double-digit growth in all key financial metrics, and once again reported results above our financial targets.
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $735 million grew 14.5% reflecting our revenue growth and productivity measures.
Our contracted backlog, including pass-throughs grew 18.5% year-over-year to $22.6 billion at December 31, 2020.
Our net leverage ratio at December 31 improved to 4.5 times trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA and that compares to a peak of 4.8 times at the end of the second quarter and 4.7 times at the end of the third quarter.
