Today, we plan to share a number of key messages to help you better understand our performance, including how we have successfully navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, how we continue to execute on Project Summit and the resulting transformation across the organization, how we have accelerated momentum in our data center business, and how we are increasing our commitment to diversity and inclusion and other sustainability initiatives.
These are areas where we see great opportunities for growth as we position ourselves to unlock greater value for our customers and include data centers, fine arts and entertainment services, consumer storage, secure IT asset disposition or SITAD, small and medium business, content service platform, or CSP, think of this as electronic content management or ECM on steroids and to secure offline storage for a highly secure air gap data storage for cost-effective protection against ransom attacks.
This extra time with customers has allowed us to uncover new revenue opportunities, not just for additional physical storage and new data center customers, but for digital services, which provides both greater visibility for doc data as well as driving much more value from data both physically and digitally.
Our strategy is highlighted by an important balance between accelerating growth, driven by developing end-to-end solutions to help our customers unlock value from their content as well as sustaining growth in physical storage and data center.
