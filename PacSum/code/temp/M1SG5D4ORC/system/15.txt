Our consolidated adjusted EBIT growth was driven by three of our four segments: construction products, performance coatings, and specialty products, which leveraged selling price adjustments and operational improvements to the bottom line.
These results were driven by our associates worldwide who persevered despite an extremely challenging operating environment, including ongoing raw material and labor shortages, omicron-related disruptions that were particularly acute in the third quarter as well as material wage, and freight cost inflation.
For the third quarter of our fiscal 2022, RPM generated record consolidated EBIT and sales despite a difficult comparison to the prior year.
Additionally, due to our ongoing investments in the fastest growing areas of our business, our high-performance building, construction, and coating systems have generated accelerated growth.
