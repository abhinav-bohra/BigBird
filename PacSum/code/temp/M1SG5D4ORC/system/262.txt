In response to the recessionary environment caused by COVID-19, we implemented a comprehensive series of actions that included implementing a hiring, wage and travel freeze, temporarily closing nearly half our rerefining capacity, transitioning a majority of our non-field based employees to work-from-home, lowering our capital spending, reducing our overall cost structure to align with revenues, launching our COVID-19 emergency response service offering.
Looking at our segment results beginning on Slide 4, Environmental Services revenues declined 12% from a year ago due to the COVID related slowdown across multiple lines of business, partly offset by incineration and decontamination work.
Adjusted EBITDA declined 41% due to the lower revenue, pricing for our SK Oil products and costs associated with the temporary shuttering of our refineries, partly offset by cost reduction efforts and government assistance programs which totaled $8.3 million dollars for this segment in Q2.
Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% as a result of our cost reduction efforts, a strong performance in our facilities, emergency response revenue and the two government programs which accounted for $13.3 million in this segment.
Our landfill volumes were down 24%, due to the deferral of some remediation and waste projects, but our base business remained stable, which drove our average price per ton, up 15% from a year ago.
Our adjusted EBITDA was $135.5 million for the quarter, which included a total of $23.4 million from the CARES Act here in the U.S. and the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy or CEWS.
