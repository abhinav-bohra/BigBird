We reported net sales of $464.4 million; adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses of $85 million; adjusted EBITDA of $83.8 million; and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.41.
While sales were lower than March, April and May months of last year, net sales finished nicely ahead of pre-pandemic levels for the quarter, and we continue to track to the mid-single-digit increases over 2019 levels that we had been talking to for some time.
And specifically on spices & seasonings which is about 20% of our total company portfolio and aggregates to be the number two spices and seasonings business in the United States, net sales are up more than 20% from Q2 2019 and remains well positioned coming out of the pandemic as more consumers continue to cook more often at home.
We clearly aren't going to match 2020's net sales on our base business, but we are a larger business than we were in 2019, driven by continued growth and interest in cooking, baking and eating at home.
In fact, when we reported our second quarter results last year at this time, we were discussing net sales growth that was up nearly 40% and adjusted EBITDA growth that was up nearly 45% from the prior year.
