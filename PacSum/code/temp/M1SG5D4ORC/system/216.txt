We continue to deliver strong pop-up leasing activity, which serves several important functions: introducing new brands to the outlet channel that may convert to long-term permanent tenants, creating retail vibrancy in an otherwise dark store; providing variety to the center and more choice for our shoppers, delivering immediate NOI contributions; and, in certain cases, allowing us to maintain occupancy on a temporary basis as we defer long-term leases for market improvement.
During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G, including funds from operations, or FFO; core FFO, same-center net operating income, and adjusted EBITDA.
Blended average rental rates decreased 2.8% on a straight-line basis and 8.5% on a cash basis for all renewals and retenanted leases that commenced during the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2021.
