With respect to loan guidance, we are not including any impacts from our EnerBank acquisition, which closed on October 1 and resulted in the addition of $3.1 billion in loan balances that will benefit the fourth quarter and beyond.
Overall, we continue to expect full-year 2021 adjusted average loan balances to be down by low-single-digits compared to 2020, although we expect adjusted ending loans to grow by low-single-digits.
Although business loans continue to be impacted by low utilization rates and excess liquidity, pipelines have surpassed pre-pandemic levels.
