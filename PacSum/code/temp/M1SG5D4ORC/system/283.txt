At this volume level, we still have more than 100,000 barrels per day of NGL pipeline capacity from the region, allowing us to capture increasing volumes on our system including volume from a new 250 million cubic feet per day third-party plant that came online in early July and expansion of another third-party plant that is underway, and our Bear Creek plant expansion, which is expected to be complete in the first half of the fourth quarter this year.
Our second-quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first-quarter 2021 and driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas to oil ratios that continue to rise in the Williston Basin.
