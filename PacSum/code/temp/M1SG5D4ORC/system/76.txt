Despite this, our core operating margin performance in the quarter was quite strong coming in at 4.2%, approximately 10 basis points higher than expected, a testament to our team's execution in the quarter, solid cost optimization, and our ever more resilient end-market portfolio.
In fact, this focus has been further sharpened as we've embedded core margins, core earnings per share, and free cash flow within our short-term and long-term compensation programs as we believe this effectively aligns management and shareholders.
Core operating income during the quarter was $314 million, an increase of 23% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 70-basis-point improvement over the prior year.
Our healthcare business serves programs and products with long stable life cycles of 10 to 20 years with high cost of change, thus providing stable earnings and cash flows.
Our agility and global scale enable us to respond quickly and flexibly to meet customer needs in key end markets, like mobility, industrial and semi cap, automotive, and healthcare, just to name a few.
As Adam highlighted, our business model is fundamentally structured to deliver core margin expansion and strong predictable cash flows, and our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility.
In Q4, our interest and tax expense also came in better than expected, which when combined with the strong margin performance allowed us to deliver strong core diluted earnings per share in Q4, putting it all together on the next slide.
