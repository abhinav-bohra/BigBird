For example, PBR promotes cost control and affordability through the inflationary adjustment and customer dividend component of the annual revenue adjustment or ARA mechanism, advances customer equity through incentives to collaborate on low-to-moderate income or LMI energy efficiency initiatives, encourages innovation through a new pilot project process, incentivizes accelerated renewable energy additions through the RPS-A performance incentive mechanism or PIM and supports utility financial integrity by eliminating elements of structural regulatory lag, establishing new revenue opportunities through PIM, the new pilot process and the ability to earn on O&M-based as well as capital-based projects through the new EPRM mechanism, providing safeguards against extreme results.
