The company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful insight into the company's operational performance and cash flows, and provides these measures to investors to help facilitate comparisons of operating results with prior periods and to assist them in understanding the company's ongoing operational performance.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, same-store revenues rose 3.4% as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to strong customer payment activity, improving lease portfolio size and higher retail sales.
The larger portfolio size is a result of better collections, fewer product returns and lower write-offs, which was enabled by improvements in operational execution, the roll-out of centralized decisioning technology and enhancements to our customer payments platform.
