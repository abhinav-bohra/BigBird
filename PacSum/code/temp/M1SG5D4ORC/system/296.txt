This all-time record performance was led by an acceleration in our Foodservice business, sustained demand for our retail and deli products, continued growth from our international business and pricing actions taken across the portfolio.
In the third quarter, our team delivered the highest quarterly sales in the company's 130-year history, while operating in an environment, which included inflationary pressures and industrywide supply chain challenges.
Our ability to deliver this performance demonstrates the strength of our balanced business model and strong consumer demand, as we grew sales in all four segments and all four sales channels on an organic basis.
Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Wholly Guacamole, Fontanini authentic Italian sausages and Hormel Fire Braised meats are all excellent examples of products that are succeeding in today's environment.
Jim Snee will provide a review of the company's current and future operating conditions, commentary and each segment's performance for the quarter, and a perspective on the balance of fiscal 2021.
Excluding a partial quarter of the Planters business, organic sales increased 14% and volume declined 2%.
Whether it is cooking a meal at home, snacking at work, eating at a local restaurant, hosting a gathering with family and friends or ordering food online, a Hormel Foods branded product will likely be an option.
Nearly every category grew volume and sales compared to last year, with standout performances from products like Hormel Bacon 1, pizza toppings and sliced meats.
