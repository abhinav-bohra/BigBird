, primarily due to a reduction in expected recoveries on claims paid on the Zohar CLOs; net investment losses due to the impairment of a legacy remediation municipal security, which was subsequently sold in January; fair value VIE loss related to the accelerated $66 million payoff of the remaining COFINA trust certificates, which also eliminated our remaining COFINA exposure.
For the 12 months ended December 31, 2019, the company reported a consolidated GAAP net loss of $359 million or a negative $4.43 per share, compared to a consolidated GAAP net loss of $296 million or negative $3.33 per share for the year ended December 31, 2018.
