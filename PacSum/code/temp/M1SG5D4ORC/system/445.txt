I am pleased to share that Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric.
Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter.
Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points.
Also Watsco's industry-leading technologies continues to gain traction, and we believe they are helping us gain market share.
Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income.
