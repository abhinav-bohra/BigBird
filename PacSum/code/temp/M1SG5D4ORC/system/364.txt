These include information in constant currency as well as adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted income from unconsolidated operation and adjusted earnings per share that exclude the impact of special charges, transaction and integration expenses related to the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA and a gain realized on sale of our unconsolidated operation.
During last year's second quarter, the onset of the pandemic drove a surge in consumers' cooking and eating more at-home, at-home consumption, resulting in a substantial increase in our Consumer segment demand as well as increases with our packaged food customer -- food company customers in our Flavor Solutions segment.
Total second quarter sales grew 11% from the year ago period and constant currency sales grew 8% attributable to substantial growth in our Flavor Solutions segment, partially offset by a decline in our Consumer segment, both impacted by the factors I've mentioned a few moments ago.
Our broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio, the acceleration of consumer trends that our strategies capitalize on and the effective execution of those strategies as well as our recent acquisitions of two fantastic businesses, and importantly, the engagement of our employees have positioned us well to drive differentiated growth despite challenging comparisons as we lap very strong growth last year.
On a two year basis, compared to the second quarter of 2019, we drove double-digit consumption growth and market share gains in our core categories and markets, including total EMEA region spices and seasonings, Vahine homemade desserts, France, and both Schwartz recipe mixes and Frank's RedHot in the U.K. Since the beginning of the pandemic, our EMEA supply chain has been very well positioned to meet the elevated demand and has contributed to our ability to grow share across the region.
We delivered significant double-digit two year growth rates for sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share and expanded adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating margins.
