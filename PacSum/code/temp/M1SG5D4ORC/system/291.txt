The increase in raw material costs did put downward pressure on our gross margin in the second quarter and this increase in raw materials will continue into the 3rd quarter, just given the sheer magnitude and duration of the additional increases and the lag effect we experience between the time raw material cost increase and the time we have to fully implement price increases to offset them.
Overall sales were great for Asia Pacific continue to be strong, but did sequentially declined compared to the first quarter due to unusually strong demand in the first quarter in our China metalworking business, but this is largely due to certain customers replenishing their supply chain in the first quarter.
