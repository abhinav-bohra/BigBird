To be more specific, our path to 50% adjusted EBITDA growth includes financial expectations of 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment during the period.
As we have said since fiscal year 2022 begun, this year's growth pattern looks different from recent fiscal years with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration expected in the second half.
Broadly, we expect this increase to be driven by above market organic revenue growth, continued strong margins and capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions.
Lloyd and I, along with several of our Booz Allen colleagues were excited to be in New York City earlier this month to share our new investment thesis and our strategy for growth.
We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase by about 50% from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025.
