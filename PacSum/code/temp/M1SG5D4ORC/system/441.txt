In the second quarter, we generated record adjusted pre-tax title margins of $688 million compared to $378 million in the year ago quarter and a 22.7% adjusted pre-tax title margin compared with 18.4% in the second quarter of 2020.
We are excited about our second quarter performance as our title business continues to produce record results, and F&G set records for its retail annuity sales, while expanding into new institutional channels, further validating our decision to acquire the company just over one year ago.
We had a 17% increase in direct orders closed, driven by a 57% increase in daily purchase orders closed and a 65% increase in total commercial orders closed, partially offset by a 5% decrease in daily refinance orders closed.
Given our strong earnings and cash flows through the first half of the year, yesterday we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share, an increase of 11% from our previous quarterly dividend and our Board authorized a 3-year share repurchase program of up to 25 million shares.
