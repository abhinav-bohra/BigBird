AAM delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter of 2021 navigating industry production volatility stemming from the continuity of supply challenges.
We generated adjusted free cash flow of over $136 million compared to an outflow of approximately $162 million in the second quarter of 2020.
AAM sales for the second quarter 2021, were $1.28 billion, up approximately 149% compared to $515 million in the second quarter of 2020.
The increase in our revenues on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects the recovery from COVID-19 related industry shutdowns that we experienced last year.
In addition to benefiting from higher production levels, our intense focus on optimizing the business and flexing our cost structure over the past several quarters greatly contributed to our performance in the quarter.
