Compared to Q4, we recorded higher results in each of our entities, supported by our large portfolio of long-term contracts in our gas shipping business, higher spot tanker rates in our oil shipping business, and higher revenues from our marine services business in Australia.
Looking ahead, we are expecting the second quarter to be lower than the first quarter, mainly due to a heavy dry dock schedule in both our gas and tanker fleets, certain non-recurring items in the first quarter and the recent expiration of fixed rate charters in our tanker fleet that were locked in last year at higher rates.
