Globally, our retail energy provider businesses which generated 94% of our revenue added 64,000 RCEs year-over-year and 20,000 sequentially to reach 421,000 RCEs with solid growth in both our domestic and international markets.
The robust increase year-over-year in domestic RCEs relative to the decrease in meters served reflect our sustained focus on acquiring higher consumption meters, warmer than average weather in the second half of the quarter and the COVID-19 driven shift to work from home.
Genie Energy generated the highest level of adjusted EBITDA of any second quarter in the Company's history and much improved financial results compared to the difficult year-ago quarter.
