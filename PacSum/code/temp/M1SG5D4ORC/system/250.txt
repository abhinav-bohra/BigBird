We had revenue growth in our Electrical Construction segment of 19.3% and in our Mechanical segment, up 21.3%, which I believe reflects more than just the resumption of normal demand from the COVID-impacted results of the second quarter last year.
This revenue growth resulted in a sizable investment in working capital this quarter, leading to a more typical cash flow pattern for us than the prior year, during which we were liquidating our balance sheet due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns and customer site restrictions.
Revenue gains within each of the divisions due to the resumption of maintenance and project activity as compared to 2020's COVID-impacted quarter augmented by incremental projects aimed at improving customers indoor air quality as well as increased building automation and controls activity were the primary drivers of this quarter's strong revenue performance.
Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, second quarter revenues increased to nearly $370 million or 18.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding containment and mitigation measures mandated by certain of our customers as well as numerous governmental authorities.
With Mechanical Construction operating income margins of 8.3% and Electrical Construction operating income margins of 8.7%, we are executing with discipline and precision as we grow our business.
