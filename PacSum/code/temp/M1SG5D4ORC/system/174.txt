Regarding the pending general rate case covering rates for the years 2022 through 2024 at our water utility subsidiary Golden State Water Company, we're pleased to report that we have reached a settlement in principle with the public advocates office of the California Public Utilities Commission or CPUC for short, and nearly all of the items in the case.
On the electric side of the business, we were pleased that in September the CPUC approved Bear Valley Electric Services most recent wildfire mitigation plan, while also in September, the Office of Energy, Infrastructure Safety under the California Natural Resources Agency approved Bear Valley Electric Services latest Safety Certification filing.
