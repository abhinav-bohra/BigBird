For the full year, we delivered $719 million of GAAP revenues, representing flat year-over-year performance relative to 2020; and adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, representing a 42% EBITDA margin while growing subscription revenue 19% year over year on a GAAP basis.
During this virtual event, we described our portfolio and go-to-market plans for SolarWinds, our expanding market opportunity, which we believe will amount to approximately $60 billion by 2025; and our goal to achieve at least $1 billion in ARR by 2025, with a compounded annual subscription ARR growth north of 30% over that time period; and then building to EBITDA margins in the mid-40s.
Our continued focus on driving subscription-first resulted in an 18% year-over-year increase in subscription revenues in the fourth quarter, and we believe we are well-positioned to accelerate this level of growth moving forward.
Our focus on delivering simple, powerful and secure solutions, combined with our still very early efforts to build out our system integrator and enterprise go-to-market motions as a result -- has resulted in continued ASP expansion and an increasing number of large deals.
Adjusted EBITDA was $78.4 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, again, exceeding the high end of our outlook for the fourth quarter.
