Adjusted EBITDA of $57.2 million increased 52.5% over the prior-year period as a result of higher operating leverage from solid organic sales growth, the addition of Alluxa, and increased pricing, partially offset by increased raw material costs and higher incentive compensation accruals.
This strong performance reflects the sustainable benefits of our portfolio reshaping actions, operating leverage, and pricing strategies, partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and raw material inflation.
Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and divested businesses, sales increased 25.3%, driven by strong demand in the heavy-duty truck, general industrial, food and pharma, and petrochemical markets, offset partially by power generation and aerospace markets.
Our second-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $57.2 million increased 52.5% year over year, and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 400 basis points to 19.2%.
