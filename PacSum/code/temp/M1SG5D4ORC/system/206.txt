Last quarter, we announced a phased integrated capacity expansion plan that included converting our mill in Houlton, Maine from LSL and OSB to SmartSide, the restart of our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, and plans to convert our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan Society.
As a result, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales, generated $461 million in EBITDA and $314 million in operating cash flow and earned $3.01 per share, all of which are quarterly records.
SmartSide net sales grew by nearly 50% versus Q1 of last year to $283 million and EBITDA more than doubled to $90 million.
OSB prices continued to climb throughout Q1, with the result that LP's OSB segment generated extraordinary cash flow.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, net sales increased by 74% to just over $1 billion, driven by 49% growth in SmartSide and over $330 million of significantly higher OSB prices.
Robust customer demand for all of LP's products has continued, driven by ongoing strength in homebuilding and remodeling, resulting in an outstanding quarter for LP.
Slide six shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers.
