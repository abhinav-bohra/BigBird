Our operating margins in earnings per share in the quarter improved significantly versus the third quarter of last year but were lower than our prior expectations because of the revenue shortfall supply chain challenges impacting the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and inflationary cost pressures which we are only partially offset by our pricing actions.
With $43 million of positive free cash flow in the quarter we posted our sixth consecutive quarter of positive free cash.
Global end market demand remained very robust as demonstrated by our quarterly bookings and Q3 being double the prior year.
