In the second quarter, the favorable leveraging effect from significant sales volume improvement over the COVID-impacted prior year quarter as well as aggressive pricing actions helped us maintain percentage gross margins despite a dramatic rise in material costs, production inefficiencies resulting from supply chain and labor capacity constraints and a less favorable mix of service part sales.
During the quarter, our top line benefited from a continued rise in order rates and backlog as well as the effect of recent pricing actions, but inbound supply chain and labor capacity issues are still constraining our growth across all lines of business.
