Given the relationship with RPT and our existing operating and development capabilities, the new platform gives access to proprietary deal flow from multi-tenant assets, larger-scale sale-leaseback transactions with national tenants, blended extends of shorter-term leases on strong real estate, remerchandising of expiring leases and build-to-suit opportunities.
We recently closed on our new net lease platform and are now under contract on our first property in the Boston market that we expect to allocate between RPT's balance sheet and the new platform.
