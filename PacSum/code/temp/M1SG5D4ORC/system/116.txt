So we're underway now adding new SMB bill pay clients through digital channels and accounting channels, and have some early returns on cross-selling bill pay into our fuel card base.
So up-front here, I'd like to run through four subjects: first, I'll give you my take on our Q3 results along with the rest of your outlook; second, take you into a bit deeper dive into our sales results; third, give you an update on the three acquisitions that we've completed year-to-date; and then lastly, an early preview of 2022 and beyond.
So super early, but it looks like about 10% of our fuel card clients that pay their bills with our new Corpay One platform are choosing to pay a second non-fleet Cor bill with us, so effectively becoming bill pay customers.
We reported Q3 revenue of $755 million, up 29% and cash earnings per share of $3.52, up 25%, so both of those all-time record highs for the company.
