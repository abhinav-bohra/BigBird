The decrease was primarily due to lower net sales in our fresh-cut vegetable, avocado, fresh-cut fruit, vegetable and prepared product lines, partially offset by an increase in sales of our pineapple and nontropical product line.
Today, our three Mann Packing facilities and Fresno fresh-cut facility are now operating under one roof, which we anticipate will enable us to improve gross profit in our fresh and value-added products segment by approximately $10 million on an annual basis; a benefit which we expect to achieve over the next 12 months.
Excluding, among other things, the effect of other product-related charges, which resulted in a $2.3 million gross profit impact related to inventory write-offs, we delivered adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.35 compared with adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.38 in the third quarter of 2019.
We reported adjusted gross profit of $69 million compared with $76 million in the third quarter of 2019, with gross profit margin improvements in our fresh and value-added products segments.
In our pineapple product line, net sales were $116 million compared with $102 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher sales volume in all of our region, mainly as a result of lower production in the prior-year period due to adverse weather conditions in our growing regions.
