Structural heart patients were severely impacted beginning in March, experiencing significant difficulties entering the system, which also had a profound impact on second quarter procedures and even though healthcare systems adapted to the challenge, the resurgence of COVID that began late in the year continues to impact structural heart patients, who need care.
This expectation assumes that vaccines are effective and widely administered by mid-year 2021 and hospitals continue to improve their ability to treat non-COVID patients, who need care for conditions such as aortic stenosis and even though we expect the COVID impact on sales at the start of the year, we are continuing to invest now in our innovations that have the tremendous opportunity to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the healthcare system.
Now turning to our quarterly results, consistent with our guidance at our investor conference last month, fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion were in line with the year ago period when Edwards' grew nearly 20% on an underlying basis, reflecting the strength, even during the ongoing pandemic.
We continue to make strategic R&D investments that enabled us to fuel progress and despite this unique environment and extraordinary prior year growth, underlying sales grew 1% in 2020 to $4.4 billion, which is a reflection of the life-threatening needs of the patients that Edwards serves.
As we indicated at our investor conference, we expect full year sales between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion representing mid-teens underlying growth on a year-over-year basis.
In Surgical Structural Heart, we launched our KONECT aortic valved conduit and Inspiris became the leading aortic surgical valve worldwide.
