Additional highlights include capitalizing on the accelerated shift to online spending and holding on to last year's almost 75% gain to reach almost $0.5 billion of digital sales, growing our branded wholesale business by almost $90 million versus two years ago, while improving profitability, adding new licenses and strengthening retail partnerships, and increasing store revenues over 40% from last year and nearly achieving fiscal '20 levels despite having 55 fewer stores.
Fiscal '22 had headwinds I have discussed and also some unique tailwinds, namely: healthy consumer spending in the first half due to significant government stimulus; an unusually good environment for full price selling as a result of high demand and scarcity of supply; and we benefited from some onetime gains related to rent and government relief, mostly in the U.K. With respect to fiscal '23, sales have gotten off to a much stronger start versus last year, but a slower start versus pre-pandemic, driven largely by the lower inventory level and lagging tax refunds.
We generated $240 million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $80 million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to 9% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $7.62, an increase of more than 65% over fiscal '20.
With much more limited promotional activity, coupled with price increases, full-price selling was very strong, fueling a 300-plus basis point increase in gross margin versus last year, and a 200 basis point increase compared to two years ago, much stronger than expected.
Higher sales and this better-than-expected gross margin resulted in double-digit operating income expansion over pre-pandemic levels and record adjusted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of more than 25% compared to last year's holiday season and 13% compared to two years ago.
