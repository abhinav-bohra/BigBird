Although it's still early in the year and overall visibility remains limited, our strong quarter 1 performance, growing backlog, improving markets and asterism for improved vaccination rates gives us confidence to raise our full year 2021 guidance for both revenue and adjusted earnings per share above the high end of the prior ranges.
We delivered broad-based market outgrowth and share gains in each of our segments and business units, with total enterprise organic revenues up 11%, while at the same time delivering more than 400 basis points of margin expansion in every segment and for the enterprise as a whole.
