But we also continue to leverage the momentum of our strategic investments to further enhance the interconnected shopping experience in support of our goals to drive growth faster than the market in any environment, further strengthen our position as a low-cost provider and home improvement with a relentless focus on productivity and efficiency and deliver exceptional shareholder value.
We had positive comps every week despite unprecedented comparison last year and grew sales by $3.3 billion in the third quarter, bringing total sales growth year to date to more than $15.5 billion through the third quarter.
It will not only enhance the customer experience from a delivery standpoint, but also expand the opportunity to capture wallet share gains with both new and existing customers, drive efficiency end to end and leverage our scale to further extend our low-cost position in home improvement.
As we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see customers taking on larger home improvement projects as evidenced by the continued strength with our Pro customer, which once again outpaced the DIY customer.
