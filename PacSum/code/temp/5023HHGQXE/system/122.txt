For the third quarter, Teleflex generated double-digit constant currency revenue and 27% adjusted earnings-per-share growth on a year-over-year basis despite a greater-than-expected headwind from increased COVID-19 infections due to the Delta variant.
Although we encountered a change in macro trends versus expectations at the time of the second quarter, the solid performance for Teleflex during the third quarter of 2021 reflects the diversified nature of our business and the benefits of the company's broad portfolio of medically necessary products and category leadership.
Despite higher-than-anticipated headwinds from COVID-19 on our adjusted earnings per share results in the third quarter, the year-over-year performance reflects growth in our diversified product portfolio, modest price increases, gross margin expansion and better-than-expected operating expense management.
However, given strength in our operating margin performance and improvements in our balance sheet, we are increasing earnings per share guidance to a range of $13.15 to $13.35 versus our previous range of $12.90 to $13.10, implying growth of 23% to 25% year-over-year.
However, as we have seen since the pandemic began, our broad-based portfolio provides a hedge in periods of increased COVID activity with more than 60% of our business, either benefiting from increased COVID-related treatments or remaining relatively insulated from disruptions due to the pandemic.
