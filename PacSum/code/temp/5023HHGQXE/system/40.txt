Compared to prior year and excluding COVID-related work, our core businesses, meaning R&DS and TAS, grew mid-teens at constant currency on an organic basis.
Finally, our overall R&DS business continues to build on its strong momentum with over $2.4 billion of net new business, including pass-throughs, and it set a record for quarterly service bookings, achieving over $1.9 billion of service bookings for the first time ever.
There are now over 3,000 clients who have adopted one or more of our technology platforms, including human data science cloud, orchestrated analytics, E360, Omnichannel Navigator, Engage, and of course, Orchestrated Customer Engagement, or OCE.
This resulted in a fourth-quarter contracted net book-to-bill ratio of 1.36 excluding pass-throughs and 1.24, including pass-throughs.
Another highlight in our TAS business has been the success of DMD Marketing Solutions, a leading provider of data and digital marketing solutions that help brands deliver personalized digital content to healthcare professionals.
The $62 million beat above the midpoint of our guidance range was driven by stronger operational performance across all three segments, as well as higher pass-throughs partially offset by FX headwinds.
In our base business, that is excluding all COVID-related work from both 2021 and 2020, organic growth at constant currency was mid-teens.
Revenue for the fourth quarter grew 10.2% on a reported basis and 11.6% at constant currency.
Excluding all COVID-related work, organic growth at constant currency in TAS was high single digits.
