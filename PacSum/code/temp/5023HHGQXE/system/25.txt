We continued a strong operational execution where the commercial effectiveness of our team, driven by our IRX process, yielded a backlog at the end of the fourth quarter that was our largest ever and positions us very well for continued strong results in 2022 as demand for our products and services continue to grow.
We solidified our compounding growth story as we reshaped our portfolio to focus on mission-critical, flow creation technologies and high-growth, sustainable end markets while establishing a new capital allocation strategy designed to enable us to consistently compound earnings over time.
