For the first quarter of fiscal '22, three of our four operating segments are the Construction Products Group, Performance Coatings Group, and Specialty Products Group generated solid sales and adjusted EBIT growth.
Sales and earnings for our consumer group decreased during the quarter as a result of these factors, as well as a difficult comparison to the prior-year period when sales increased on an organic basis by 34% and adjusted EBIT was up 122%.
