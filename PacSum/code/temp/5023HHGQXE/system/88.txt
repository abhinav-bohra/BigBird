Strong order intake continuing sequential revenue growth now for the third consecutive quarter and better than expected earnings performance add confidence to our view that the second half of the year will show meaningful recovery progress.
However, our Industrial segment generated high single-digit organic growth, which was better than our February expectation given solid orders and sales in March.
As a result of this issue, we estimate a first quarter impact of approximately $1 million, with the second quarter impact likely to be in the range of $4 million to $5 million before recovering in the second half.
There is definitely a lot to like about the activity of Molding Solutions and the business has been recently adding more talent to the sales and marketing team with a clear focus on driving long-term growth and margin expansion.
Organic sales were up mid-single digits, while sequential sales were up low single digits.
