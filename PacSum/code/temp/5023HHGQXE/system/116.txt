Starting with our financial results for the third quarter of 2021, we had net income, on a GAAP basis, of $198 million or $5 per diluted share during the quarter as compared to a loss of $61 million or $1.57 per share for the previous quarter.
Our company's production on a barrels of oil equivalent remained relatively flat quarter over quarter, averaging 92,100 boe compared to second quarter production of 92,600 boe.
Most of the wells turned in line during the quarter were in our Sanish field, which typically come on with lower initial production rates, but experienced a shallow overall decline, particularly in the first year.
