Overall, our results were shaped by two key dynamics: first, sustained and powerful consumer demand drove higher unit sales compared to the prior year; and second, Winnebago Industries' successful execution of pricing actions to offset higher material and component costs.
Winnebago Industries is built on our strong momentum and delivered robust results in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, capitalizing on sustained and elevated demand for our portfolio of premium products.
The positive demand environment and the unique strength of our brands positioned Winnebago Industries well to take continued pricing actions to offset component and material cost inflation and preserve margin performance across our segments.
Also, the Barletta pontoon boat business recently acquired this past August, contributed nine percentage points of growth, and continues to exceed our expectations and gain market share in the pontoon boat market.
