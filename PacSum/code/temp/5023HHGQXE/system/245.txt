The biggest contributor to this quarter's growth were institutional asset management clients, as we continue to see strength in our workstation and accelerating growth in our analytics workflow solutions.
These teams continue to drive increased retention and expansion rates among our existing clients, while achieving a high number of new business wins.
Our investments in content and technology including deep sector, wealth and analytics solutions continue to support client retention rates and renewals across the board.
