Furthermore, the execution of our Enterprise Strategy yielded improvements in our operating performance with third quarter EBITDA growth, despite a year-over-year COVID-19 related decline in organic sales.
As Andy will speak to in a few moments, we are reinitiating our full year guidance for 2020 which not only reflects our revenue and profitability expectations, but also our commitment to investing in our business to support our long-term enterprise strategy.
For the third quarter, we reported net earnings of $11.7 million or $0.63 per share, down from $14.6 million or $0.79 per share in the year ago period.
When the pandemic started, we were quick to respond and established three guiding principles; to keep our employees and customer's safe, to manage our costs and cash flow, and to stay in a position to ramp up quickly when markets recover.
Our global teams have worked hard in overcoming the unprecedented sales and operational challenges resulting from the pandemic, and we work closely with our customers, supply chain partners, and carriers to avoid operational disruptions.
Lastly, given the improving demand trends that we've seen since May and our confidence in the improved trajectory of our business, we recognize the need for strategic investments to support the continued execution of our strategy, to backfill key leadership roles, and to recognize and retain our best talent.
Overall, for the third quarter of 2020, Tennant reported net sales of $261.9 million, down 6.7% year-over-year.
While the pandemic continues to pose considerable macro level uncertainty, especially as some markets see spikes in COVID 19 cases, we have a high level of confidence in our near-term business outlook.
