Revenue per unit excluding fuel improved in each of our individual business units this quarter, reflecting our commitment to grow yield as part of our long-term strategy, though total revenue per unit and revenue per unit excluding fuel were down slightly due to the mix of intermodal volume growth with declines in merchandise volume.
Our team delivered all-time records for operating ratio and free cash flow and achieved first quarter records for earnings per share and operating income.
By absorbing additional volumes within our existing train network, despite how those volumes varied during the quarter, we were able to realize substantial gains in train length and train weight and improve fuel efficiency.
