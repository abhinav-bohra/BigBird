Third-quarter volumes were exceptionally strong in North America and Europe, and the ability of our commercial operational logistics and support teams to respond to the rise in customer demand generated our strong financial performance.
Both our North America and Europe segments contributed significantly to year-over-year earnings growth, while core EBITDA per ton of finished steel reached a record level of $144 per ton.
Excluding the impact of a gain on the sale of a small rail reclamation business, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $127.1 million or $1.04 per diluted share.
