During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as total segment operating income, adjusted EBITDA, total adjusted segment EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow.
The difference between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share in 2Q '21 reflects $3.1 million in a fair value remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, which increased GAAP earnings per share by $0.09, and a $2.4 million of noncash interest expense related to our convertible notes, which reduced GAAP earnings per share by $0.06.
The year-over-year increase was primarily due to high operating profits in our Forensic and Litigation Consulting or FLC segment, as well as our technology and economic consulting segments, which was only partially offset by lower operating profits in our Corporate Finance & Restructuring segment compared to the prior-year quarter.
Earnings per share were further boosted by lower weighted average shares outstanding, or WASO, and from a lower tax rate, resulting in a 39.4% increase in GAAP earnings per share and a 31.8% increase in adjusted EPS.
The dollar increase in SG&A was primarily due to an unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation, or FX, increased compensation primarily related to nonbillable head count growth, and the higher rent, which was partially offset by lower bad debt and the previously mentioned fair value remeasurement.
Adjusted segment EBITDA was negatively impacted by the continued downturn in restructuring activity compared to the record demand that saw in 2Q '20 in the initial wake of COVID as well as higher compensation, primarily related to a 19.8% increase in billable head count.
