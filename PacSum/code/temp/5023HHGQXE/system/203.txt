In terms of other accomplishments, our alternative asset strategies, an important area of focus for us, generated positive net flows in each quarter during the year and grew by 19% from the prior year to $145 billion in AUM with contributions from a diverse group of strategies, including real estate infrastructure, private debt and hedge funds.
The results that we announced today represent the first full fiscal year since we closed the Legg Mason acquisition, a transformational transaction that created a more balanced business across asset classes, client mix and geographies.
In terms of notable organic growth, we saw positive net flows in our core growth areas, including alternatives, SMAs, wealth management and ESG-specific strategies.
