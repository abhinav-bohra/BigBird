Our unique Defense/IT portfolio, strong balance sheet and reliable low-risk development program continue to generate high-quality FFO per share and cash flow growth that are extremely durable because demand is driven by defense spending and national security requirements rather than traditional office fundamentals.
Third quarter FFO is adjusted for comparability of $0.57, outperformed the high end of guidance by $0.01, and represented the sixth time in the past seven quarters that we outperformed expectations.
Our growth strategy targets owning and developing specialized office and data center shells in mission-critical Defense/IT locations, and this strategy continues to deliver excellent results.
In the quarter, we achieved a total of one million square foot of leasing, which included extremely strong vacancy leasing of 215,000 square feet.
