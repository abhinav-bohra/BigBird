Highlights of achievements reached thus far through 2021 include the announcement of our cargo emission tags, the climate scenario analysis we published, our first carbon-neutral LNG cargo we announced last quarter, our participation in the first-ever study to measure methane emissions on an LNG carrier, and our collaboration with leading academic institutions and several of our upstream natural gas suppliers to implement QMRV or greenhouse gas emissions performance at natural gas production sites across several bases.
