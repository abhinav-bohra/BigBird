In our Real Estate segment, we generated record adjusted EBITDA of $64 million, up from $22 million in the prior year period, as we closed on a $38 million Unimproved Development sale in Kingston, Washington, and a $25 million improved development transaction in our Belfast Commerce Park project south of Savannah, Georgia.
As Dave touched on, third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million was considerably above the prior year period, as an exceptionally strong contribution from our Real Estate segment, and year-over-year improvements in the contributions from our Pacific Northwest and New Zealand Timber segments more than offset a modestly lower contribution from our Southern Timber segment.
We continue to capitalize on healthy domestic timber demand in the U.S., favorable log export pricing in New Zealand, and robust real estate market trends in the third quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the prior year quarter by 71%, fueled by solid contributions across our timber segments as well as an outsized contribution from our Real Estate segment due to the closing of two significant development transactions.
