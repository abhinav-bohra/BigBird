With regard to our financial performance for the three months ended September 30th, 2020, the Company's net sales decreased by 6% to $117 million as compared to sales of $125 million this time last year.

In addition sales translated from local currency to US dollars were further negatively impacted by a decline in local currency exchange rates quarter-over-quarter.
