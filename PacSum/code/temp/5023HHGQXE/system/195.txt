During this year's fourth quarter, we recorded $23 million in pre-tax special charges, largely related to restructuring activities on industrial and Textron Aviation or $0.07 per share after tax.
Our business has closed out the year with a strong operating performance in the fourth quarter, as we saw margin improvement in Systems, Industrial, and Bell that drove an increase in Textron's manufacturing margin to 8.8% on lower revenues.
At Bell, margins of 12.6% were up 30 basis points, as compared to the prior year despite lower military revenues and commercial volume.
Segment profit of $110 million was down $8 million, largely on the lower volume, partially offset by a favorable impact from performance, primarily reflecting higher favorable program adjustments.
Excluding special charges and the one-time favorable benefit, adjusted net income was $1.06 per share compared to $1.11 in last year's fourth quarter.
