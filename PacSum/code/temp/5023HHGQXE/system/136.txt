The robust sales growth that we experienced during the third quarter was driven by 40% growth in our full price direct-to-consumer business, with growth in each of our brands compared to fiscal 2019, including a 13% increase in full-price retail and a 100% gain in full-price e-commerce.
But I will mention that they drove record third quarter earnings of $1.19 per share on an adjusted basis compared to an adjusted loss of $0.44 per share last year and adjusted earnings per share, up $0.10 during the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
These brands are 100% focused on the consumer and making that consumer happy with powerful clear brand messages, exceptional differentiated product, superior customer experiences, including our e-commerce websites, our stores and restaurants and strategic wholesale accounts.
These outstanding results are directly attributable to the power of our brand portfolio, the strength of our product offerings and our ability to connect with and serve customers across channels, combined with the great work our teams have done to fortify these foundational cornerstones during the pandemic.
Restaurant sales also contributed to our top-line improvement, growing 14% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019 fueled by strong increases at existing locations, as well as the addition of five new Marlin Bar locations.
Excluding Lanier Apparel, where operations were effectively exited during the third quarter of fiscal 2021, net sales increased 15% over the same period of fiscal 2019.
