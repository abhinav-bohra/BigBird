2020 is 1-2 punch of an oil supply price war, followed closely by an oil demand crushing global pandemic led to a sharp decline in demand for oilfield equipment and consumables through the year.
North American oilfield activity continued its recovery during the quarter, with March revenues up sharply from January for certain of our earlier cycle domestic businesses, while international results began to point to early signs of a recovery as well.
And despite continuing day rate pressure on drilling contractors, Grant Prideco posted a book-to-bill greater than 100% as operators are requiring larger 5.5-inch drill pipe to accommodate better hydraulic performance, leading drilling contractors to purchase this pipe with our proprietary Delta premium connections.
Despite these, the final quarterly results, slightly exceeded our March forecast due to better progress on cost reductions overall as well as, and this is important, more and more green shoots emerging in the oil field, particularly in Wellbore Technologies and particularly in North America.
By fall, every stacked rig had become an incremental source of drill pipe, shaker screens, handling tools, etc at same dynamic applies across all categories of oilfield equipment when utilization collapses and service companies fight to keep the lights on.
In this environment, our oilfield service customers are sticking to the tried and true survivor playbook of cannibalizing equipment, spares and consumables, deferring maintenance, reducing spending to bear substance levels and hoarding precious cash.
