Third quarter pre-tax core operating earnings and AFG's Property and Casualty Insurance segment were 60% higher than the comparable prior year period, and each of our Specialty Property and Casualty groups reported healthy growth and excellent underwriting margins.
The increase was primarily the result of substantially higher underwriting profit in our Specialty P&C insurance operations and significantly higher P&C net investment income due to the continued strong performance of AFG's $1.7 billion and alternative investments.
Specialty Property and Casualty Insurance operations generated an underwriting profit of $169 million in the 2021 third quarter, an impressive 63% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by higher year-over-year underwriting profit in our Specialty Casualty Group and to a lesser extent our Specialty Financial Group.
