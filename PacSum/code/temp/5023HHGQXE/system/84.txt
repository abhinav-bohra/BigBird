During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS.
We'll first look at Q2 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and earnings per share growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and contract manufacturing.
Driven by our mission, we experienced another solid quarter reinforced by the right market-led strategy to continuously deliver value for our customers and the patients we jointly serve.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $106 million recorded this quarter, compared to $81.9 million in the same period last year for a 29.4% increase.
