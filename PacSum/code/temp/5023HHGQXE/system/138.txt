With respect to cash, we generated $28 million from operating activities from continuing operations and also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by nearly $7 million, further improving our already strong balance sheet position and putting our net leverage below 1 times EBITDA.
With that, turning to the quarter, our sales decreased 28% year-over-year from $561 million to $404 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 52% from $0.64 per share to $0.31 per share.
Regarding the business, as we indicated last quarter, overall, we have seen our commercial volumes stabilize and continued strong performance out of our government business.
While we remain in a difficult and uncertain environment, we are encouraged by the stabilization, as well as the positive developments regarding the vaccines, which not only will protect our people, but should also ultimately lead to more travel and a recovery in our commercial markets.
