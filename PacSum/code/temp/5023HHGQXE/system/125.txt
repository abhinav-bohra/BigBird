Milestones that helped support this goal included price increase for the majority of our US wood connector products in the third quarter of 2018, the signing of one of our largest US homebuilding companies onto our builder program resulting in 23 of the Top 25 US builders now engaged on our program, strong repair and remodel trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of Lowe's as the home center customer in mid-2020.
At the same time, we did experience certain tailwinds in our business as a result of the COVID-19 related macroeconomic conditions, namely we had favorable steel prices, temporary reduction in travel and related operating expenses, and an increase in repair and remodel activity.
While we elected to withdraw these financial targets in April 2020 due to the significant level of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we continued to execute based on the same underlying principles, focusing on operating efficiencies and cost savings to guide us through the COVID-19 pandemic.
The increase in sales volume we experienced in the fourth quarter was primarily related to ongoing momentum in the home center distribution channel, which includes both our home centers and co-op customers.
In addition, specifically in 2020, we experienced solid cost savings from our expense management practices as well as one-time benefits from the reduced travel and trade show costs as a result of the COVID-19 restriction.
