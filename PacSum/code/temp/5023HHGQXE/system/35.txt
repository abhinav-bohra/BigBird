Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.87 compared to $1.49 last year, primarily due to higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments, higher pension income and a lower diluted share count, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate.
Non-GAAP operating earnings of $411 million, up $64 million or 18%, and non-GAAP operating margins of 23.2% of sales, up from 21%, driven by higher sales and improved operating leverage in both segments.
The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, improved operating leverage and lower legal fees, partially offset by the gain from the sale of a manufacturing facility recognized in the prior year.
Second, our Software and Services segment had another outstanding quarter and continues to drive revenue growth and operating margin expansion.
Q1 Products and Systems Integration sales were $1 billion, up 2%, primarily driven by growth in video security and professional and commercial radio, partially offset by lower sales of public safety LMR, which were impacted by supply constraints.
Sales for the quarter were up 15%, driven by growth across our LMR, video security and command center software technologies.
And finally, based on the increased demand we're seeing across our business and our strong backlog position, we're raising our full year guidance for both sales and earnings per share for the full year.
We expanded operating margins by 220 basis points and ended the quarter with backlog of $11.3 billion, up 8% versus last year.
