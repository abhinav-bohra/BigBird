The substantial increase in profitability for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and production, resulting in favorable leveraging of fixed costs including depreciation, engineering and other indirect labor expenses.
Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profitability declined principally due to three factors: First, all of our firearms facilities took a very well-deserved shutdown week in July, which reduced the number of workdays in the quarter to 59 compared to 64 workdays in Q2.
For the comparable prior year period, net sales were $145.7 million and diluted earnings were $1.39 per share.
For the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $178.2 million and diluted earnings were $1.98 per share.
