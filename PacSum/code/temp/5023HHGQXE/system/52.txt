Strong performance in our beef segment, earlier-than-expected recovery in prepared foods, and improvement in chicken and pork all supported strong earning results.
Our first-quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives, that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins, and driving strong returns for our shareholders.
Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park maintain their volume share position even as we work through price increases to address inflationary pressure.
We achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth, both of which were driven by ongoing demand strength, productivity savings, and improving execution across our segments.
This performance was broad-based across segments where continued strong consumer demand and effective pricing to mitigate the impact of inflation drove higher earnings.
This meant earnings per share growth of high single digits relative to a 2019 baseline and volume growth ahead of the market.
The program aims to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline and has three critical focus areas, which are operational and functional excellence, digital solutions, and automation.
Importantly, and despite the continued impact of COVID-19, our volumes improved slightly across the company relative to the same quarter last year.
Chicken remains a top priority and we continue to execute against our road map to achieve an operating income margin of 5% to 7% on a run-rate basis by mid-fiscal '22.
As a result, our average sales price for the quarter increased 19.6% relative to the same period last year.
We are seeing higher costs across our supply chain, including higher input costs, such as feed and ingredients.
