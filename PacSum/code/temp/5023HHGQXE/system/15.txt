They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.
Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.
Total company third quarter operational sales grew 10% versus 2020, while organic sales grew 11% versus '20 and 4% versus 2019, just below our guidance of 12% to 14% versus 2020 as Delta impacted procedure volume globally.
Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively, as well as Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively.
We continue to be pleased with our cash flow with third quarter free cash flow generation of $360 million and adjusted free cash flow of $525 million.
This 4.1% growth excludes $35 million in 2019 sales of divested intrauterine health, embolic beads and BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals businesses as well as $117 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, which consists of half a quarter of BTG Interventional Medicines, a full quarter of Preventice and post-close revenue from Farapulse and Lumenis.
