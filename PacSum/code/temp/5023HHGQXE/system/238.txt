This sharp increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by a 30% increase in delivered saw timber prices stemming from favorable domestic lumber markets and increased log export demand as well as higher volumes following the merger with Pope Resources.
The year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA was due to both significantly higher harvest volumes as the second quarter of 2020 was severely impacted by COVID 19 related headwinds and weighted average log prices and increased 51% as a result of robust export and domestic log demand.
On the bottom of Page 5, we provide an overview of our capital resources and liquidity at quarter-end as well as a comparison to year-end, our cash available for distribution or CAD for the first half of the year was $111 million versus $80 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher cash taxes, interest expense and capital expenditures.
Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the prior-year quarter by 21%, as favorable results in each of our timber segments more than offset lower adjusted EBITDA in the real estate segment.
