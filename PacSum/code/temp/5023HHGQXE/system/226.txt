While the current environment is certainly challenging the way that we all live and work, DHI's business model gives us some level of protection and stability in these uncertain times, as 90% of our revenues are generated through annual subscription-based contracts.
In the past several weeks, DHI has jumped into action to aid our community by launching COVID-19 Resource Centers on each of our brand sites, assisting both clients and candidates alike with information relevant to their needs in these challenging times.
The complete makeover of the Dice client experience over the past year, including IntelliSearch, Candidate Match, Job Management, Job Search, Job Alerts, Multi Location Search, and now our new Dice Home Page and Private E-mail, are delivering more value every day.
Additionally, over the past several weeks, we've seen a stable number of tech job postings as enterprises look to accelerate the use of technology in their business.
