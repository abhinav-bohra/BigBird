Our seaborne thermal margins benefited from price increases of 66% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and the segment is on target to deliver higher export volumes in the fourth quarter as compared to prior quarters in 2021.
For 2022, with two million tons of incremental production expected at our met coal mines and thermal export production in line with 2021, we are well positioned and are looking forward to taking advantage of this demand and the margins that we anticipate will come with it.
In the U.S., thermal coal market indicators are also favorable with increased electricity demand and high natural gas prices leading to gas to coal switching and robust growth in coal generation as compared to prior year.
We continue to advance actions to position the company to be resilient in all market cycles by expanding our margins, reducing our debt levels and removing obstacles to increase production.
