First, we accelerated our 2021 gross debt-reduction objective of $500 million, fully retiring our next significant maturity and we're now targeting at least another $500 million of gross debt reduction, bringing our total 2021 debt-reduction target to $1 billion.
The proof point for this sustainability is our five-year benchmark maintenance scenario that can deliver around $5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $50 per barrel WTI price environment or closer to $7 billion of free cash flow at the current forward curve, along with a corporate free cash flow breakeven of less than $35 per barrel throughout the period.
When considering our updated debt-reduction target on recent base dividend increase, we're actually on track to return well over 40% of our cash flow back to investors this year.
We are hard at work to achieve our GHG intensity-reduction target of 30% in 2021, a metric hardwired into our compensation scorecard, as well as our goal for a 50% reduction by 2025, both relative to our 2019 baseline.
