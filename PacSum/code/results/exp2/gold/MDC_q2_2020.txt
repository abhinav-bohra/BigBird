Both our homebuilding and financial services businesses contributed to these year-over-year improvements as pre-tax income from our homebuilding operations increased $23.3 million or 38%, and our financial services pre-tax income increased $14 million or 110%.
Our homebuilding gross margin in the quarter increased to 20%, reflecting this pricing discipline.
Gross margins increased on both build-to-order and speculative home deliveries, driven by price increases implemented across the majority of our communities over the past 12 months.
The average selling price of our net orders increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by price increases implemented over the past 12 months as well as a shift in mix to California, which has our highest average price.
The increase in homebuilding pre-tax income was the result of a 21% increase in home sale revenues and a 160 basis point improvement to our homebuilding operating margins.
The increase in units delivered was slightly offset by a 4% decrease in our average selling price to about $467,000.
For the quarter, net orders were up 5%, given the uncertainties and sales obstacles we faced at the end of the first quarter.
In addition to maintaining price discipline, with respect to our homes, we also exercised cost discipline across our organization during the quarter, leading to a 90 basis points year-over-year improvement in our SG&A ratio.
