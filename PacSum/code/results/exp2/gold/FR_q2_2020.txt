As of yesterday, we have collected 98% of 2Q monthly rental billings and so far, we've collected 97% of July billings, which is ahead of the pace we experienced in the second quarter.
For the full year, we expect our cash rental rate change on new and renewal leasing to be approximately 10%.
In its second quarter preliminary flash report, CBRE reported 19 million square feet of net absorption versus 56 million square feet of completion.
During the COVID-19 crisis to-date, we have established rent deferment agreements with 14 tenants totaling $750,000 or about 18 basis points of annualized billings.
