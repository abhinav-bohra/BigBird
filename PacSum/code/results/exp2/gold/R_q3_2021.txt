We generated strong year to date free cash flow of over $800 million and have increased our full year free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our prior forecast of $650 million to $750 million.
Our full year forecast reflects an estimated cash flow benefit of $400 million from deferred capital expenditures due to OEM delivery delays as well as record proceeds from the sale of our used vehicles.
In addition, we've continued to increase lease pricing resulting in improved portfolio returns and a 4% increase in revenue per average active lease vehicle.
Operating revenue of $2 billion in the third quarter increased 11% from the prior year, reflecting revenue growth across all three of our business segments.
