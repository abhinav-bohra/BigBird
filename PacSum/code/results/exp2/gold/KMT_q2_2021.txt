The improved year-over-year performance in our margin was primarily due to the positive effect of raw materials as expected, which contributed approximately 590 basis points, incremental simplification/modernization benefits, and temporary cost control actions, partially offset by lower volumes and associated under-absorption.
Sequentially, despite rolling back many temporary cost control actions in the quarter, which should amounted to close to $10 million, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 170 basis points due to the improving market conditions and continued simplification/modernization savings.
Total cumulative savings from inception of the program are expected to be $180 million by the end of this fiscal year, which is within the original target range we laid out in December 2017 and will be achieved despite much lower volume levels than originally planned.
