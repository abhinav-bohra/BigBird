China representing approximately half of our business in Asia, showed early signs of stabilization posting an 11% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, an improvement compared to a 36% decline in Q1.
As a result of our first half performance and our solid order backlog, we are reinstating our annual adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.00 to $5.25 per share.
We generated $78 million more in free cash flow than the comparable quarter last year.
The US, our largest market declined 10% organically, with four segments posting organic declines, partially offset by growth in retail fueling.
After profitability gains in Q1 on lower revenue, we targeted 25% to 30% decremental margin for the full year.
In the quarter, we delivered on the $50 million annual cost reduction program, which focuses on IT footprint and back office efficiency, and took additional restructuring charges that add to the expected benefits.
