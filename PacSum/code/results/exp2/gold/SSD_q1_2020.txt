Our gross margin coupled with the relatively flat operating expenses, help generate operating income of $49.4 million, up 64.4% year-over-year and strong earnings of $0.83 per diluted share, up 66% year-over-year.
Our gross profit margin was strong at 45.7%, an improvement of 320 basis points year-over-year.
We've been able to operate more efficiently, as evidenced by our 250 basis point improvement in our total operating expenses as a percent of sales for the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019.
Gross margin increased by 320 basis points, primarily due to lower material and factory and overhead costs as a percent of sales on increased production, offset partially by higher labor, warehouse and shipping costs.
Within the North American segment, sales increased 12.5% to $249.1 million due to higher sales volume supported by stronger housing starts compared to the wet winter, weather conditions we experienced a year ago.
