Adjusted EBIT for the second quarter of 2020 was $167 million, down $64 million compared to the prior year, largely driven by a $61 million decline in Composites.
For the second quarter, revenues were $1.6 billion, down 15%, 14% on a constant currency basis compared with the same period last year, and adjusted EBIT was $167 million.
While our financial position at the beginning of the quarter was strong, in May, we took advantage of favorable capital markets and successfully completed a 10-year $300 million bond issuance.
Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $96 million or $0.88 per diluted share compared to $141 million or $1.29 per diluted share in Q2 2019.
This, along with our working capital management and opex and capex controls, led to an increase in our available liquidity to approximately $1.5 billion, including almost $600 million in cash.
