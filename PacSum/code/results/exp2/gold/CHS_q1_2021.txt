Total first-quarter sales grew 38% over last year, spurred by Soma's extraordinary sales growth of 65%, as well as fantastic customer response to Chico's and White House Black Market, which drove 31% growth in our apparel brand.
In addition, our balance sheet reflects a federal income tax receivable of approximately $55 million that we expect to realize in the summer of fiscal '21.
On-hand inventory levels, which were down 29% versus last year's first quarter and down 21% compared to the first quarter of 2019, drove more full-price sales and generated a solid gross margin in the first quarter.
Not only did Soma post a 65% sales growth over last year's first quarter, but comparable sales also grew a remarkable 39% over the first quarter of 2019.
