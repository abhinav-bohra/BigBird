The growth in revenue and lower expense ratios resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, which is up 56% year-on-year, and $4.85 year-to-date, which is up 68%.
I am pleased with both our loan growth and improvement in both net interest income, which increased 21% over last year, and a 10-basis point sequential improvement in our net interest margin.
Our firmwide net interest margin increased to 210 basis points, primarily due to increases in leverage finance fee income and our stock loan business, while our bank NIM remained at 240 basis points.
