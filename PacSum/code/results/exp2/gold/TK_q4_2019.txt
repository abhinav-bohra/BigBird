The fourth quarter of 2019 marked a return to profitability for Teekay, as we recorded consolidated adjusted net income of $31 million or $0.31 per share compared to an adjusted net loss of $2 million or $0.02 per share in the same period of the prior year.
Our results were up compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, mainly as a result of lower interest expense due to bond repurchases over the past year and our bond refinancing completed in May 2019, higher contributions from the Banff and Hummingbird Spirit FPSO units, a 36% increase in TGP's quarterly cash distribution and lower G&A expenses.
