As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies.
Our strong top line growth resulted in year-over-year Q2 non-GAAP adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 24% to $2.60 per share.
By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 31% in constant currency; industrial grew 28%; and academia and government grew 7%.
Sales for this quarter represent a 6% compounded average yearly growth versus our 2019 results on a constant currency basis.
Gross margin for the quarter was 58.9%, down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2020, driven by 80 basis points foreign exchange headwinds.
As you will see on Slide 9, Waters already has a strong foundation in large and growing end markets with a leading position of science and innovation in a roughly $65 billion market, a high exposure to end markets that grow around mid-single digits with a deep rooted presence in regulated end markets like QA/QC, a large installed base of instruments with over 50% recurring revenues, a diversified geographic base with over -- almost 40% sales in Asia and industry-leading margins with a strong financial flexibility.
In the second quarter, LC instruments grew across all major geographies with more than 40% growth, driven by our instrument replacement initiatives and new products, especially Arc HPLC and a strong uptake of our Premier instruments, both Arc and ACQUITY lines.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 24% to $2.60 in comparison to $2.10 last year.
