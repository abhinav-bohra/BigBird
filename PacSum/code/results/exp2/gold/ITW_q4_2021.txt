Free cash flow was $2.3 billion with a conversion rate of 84% of net income which is below our 100% plus long-term target for free cash flow due to higher working capital investments to support the company's 15% revenue growth and the strategic decision that we have made to increase inventory levels on select key raw materials, components and finished goods to help mitigate supply chain risk and sustain service levels to our key customers.
At the enterprise level, we delivered organic growth of 5%, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, operating margin of 22.7%, and free cash flow of $695 million or 114% of net income.
Six of our seven segments combined delivered 12% organic growth, while our Auto OEM segment continued to be impacted by near-term limitations on auto production due to component supply shortages and, as a result, was down 16% in the quarter.
And despite a seemingly constant barrage of input cost increases, we expanded operating margin by 120 basis points to 24.1%, with another 100-basis-point contribution from enterprise initiatives.
