The 80 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin as compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the normal operating leverage on higher sales volumes as well as the lower negative cost impacts resulting from the pandemic, and these benefits were partially offset by the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment experienced in 2021 as well as the current margin dilutive effect of the acquisitions we made during the year.
GAAP and adjusted operating income was $593 million and $608 million, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2021, and GAAP operating margin was 19.6%, which decreased by 50 basis points compared to the Q4 of 2020 and by 70 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2021.
GAAP diluted earnings per share was a record $0.72 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 26%, compared to $0.57 in the prior-year period, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was also a record $0.70, an increase of 23%, compared to $0.57 in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Fourth-quarter 2021 GAAP operating income includes $15 million of acquisition-related costs related to the Halo acquisition, which closed during the fourth quarter.
