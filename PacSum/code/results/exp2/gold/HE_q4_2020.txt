The utility's higher net income was primarily driven by the following items, $17 million in revenues under the annual rate adjustment mechanism or RAM, which funds investments in resilience, reliability and the integration of renewable energy; $6 million from lower O&M expenses primarily due to fewer generating facility overhauls, efficiency improvements in planning and execution of work and reduced staffing levels offset in part by higher environmental reserves; $3 million from lower interest expense due to debt refinancings; and $2 million from the recovery of West Loch PV and grid modernization projects under the MPIR mechanism, partially offset by lower Schofield MPIR revenues.
