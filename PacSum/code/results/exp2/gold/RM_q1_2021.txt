Despite pressure from a combination of tax refunds and two stimulus payments in the quarter, our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $18 million, or 2%, over the prior-year period, and was down only $28 million, or 2.5%, quarter over quarter.
And we ended the quarter with a record-low, 30-plus day delinquency rate of 4.3%, a 230 basis points improvement from the end of March of 2020.
