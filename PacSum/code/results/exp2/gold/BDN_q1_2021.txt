Our first quarter net income totaled $6.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share and FFO totaled 60.2 million or $0.35 per diluted share and in line with consensus estimates.
Our first quarter annualized net debt-EBITDA increased to 6.5 and is above our current 6.1to 6.3 range, and the increase is due to lower NOI, sequential NOI from the fourth quarter.
Land gain and tax provision totaled about $2 million or $1.5 million above our fourth quarter guidance.
