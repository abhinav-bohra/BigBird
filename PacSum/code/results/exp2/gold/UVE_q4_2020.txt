We ended 2020 with total revenue up 14.2% to $1.1 billion, driven primarily by growth in net premiums earned, realized gains on investments and increases in service revenue, partially offset by decreases in net investment income and increased reinsurance costs.
Our direct premiums written grew by 21.9% in Q4 compared to the prior year's quarter led by the impact of rate increases in Florida and other states taking effect as well as strong direct premium growth in Q4 of 18.9% in states outside of Florida.
EPS for the quarter was a loss of $0.57 on a GAAP basis and a loss of $0.84 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.
