We expect this increase to be accomplished through 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by a higher effective tax rate following the release of an income tax reserve of $10.2 million in the prior-year period related to the Aquilent acquisition, as well as higher interest expense partially offset by a lower share count due to our share repurchase program.
On the positive side, we continue to win the right kind of work and hire the right people, as reflected in our backlog growth and headcount increases over the last 12 months.
Gross revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.10 to $4.30.
Net bookings for the third quarter were approximately $797 million, up 29% over the prior-year period, translating to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.39 times and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.28 times.
Our investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA dollars from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025.
