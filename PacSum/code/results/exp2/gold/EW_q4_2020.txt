Now turning to our quarterly results, consistent with our guidance at our investor conference last month, fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion were in line with the year ago period when Edwards' grew nearly 20% on an underlying basis, reflecting the strength, even during the ongoing pandemic.
We continue to make strategic R&D investments that enabled us to fuel progress and despite this unique environment and extraordinary prior year growth, underlying sales grew 1% in 2020 to $4.4 billion, which is a reflection of the life-threatening needs of the patients that Edwards serves.
As we indicated at our investor conference, we expect full year sales between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion representing mid-teens underlying growth on a year-over-year basis.
For the full year 2020, sales increased 1% on an underlying basis to $4.4 billion, adjusted earnings per share was flat at $1.86 and we generated over $700 million of adjusted free cash flow.
In Surgical Structural Heart, full-year 2020 global sales of $762 million decreased 10% on an underlying basis over the prior year, in line of our guidance, with our guidance of 5% to 15% decline.
Full-year 2020 global sales -- global TAVR sales of 2.9 billion increased 4% on an underlying basis over the prior year.
We continue to expect full year 2021 SG&A as a percentage of sales, excluding special items to be 28% to 29%, which is similar to pre-COVID levels.
