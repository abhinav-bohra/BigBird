COVID-19 expense impacted earnings at both the utility and the bank including $2.5 million higher utility bad debt expense pre-tax than Q1 of last year and additional provisioning for COVID-19 of over $4 million at the bank.
The most significant drivers of the variance were: $3 million revenue increase from higher rate adjustment mechanism revenues $1 million revenue increase from the recovery of West Loch and Grid Modernization projects under the major project interim recovery mechanism; and $1 million lower interest expense due to debt refinancings at lower rates.
These items were offset by $7 million higher O&M expenses compared to Q1 2019 primarily due to increased bad debt expense due to COVID-19 the absence of onetime of a onetime benefit in Q1 2019 due to deferral treatment for certain previously incurred expenses and an increase in vegetation management work and higher outside service costs.
