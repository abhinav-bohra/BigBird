Results for the quarter included one month of Attain operations from the acquisition date of March 1st, which added approximately $20 million of revenue and $3 million of operating income after the expense related to amortization of intangible assets.
The segment operating income margin was 18.5% and reflects better-than-expected operating results for the COVID response programs that offset the significant revenue and profit headwinds to some core programs related to the pandemic.
Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 for the U.S. Federal Services segment decreased to $330 million due to the conclusion of the census contract, which contributed $133 million less revenue this quarter as compared to the prior year period.
