Last year, we also successfully executed our plan to invest $3 billion in our distribution and transmission systems as we continued our reliability in grid mod program to benefit customers.
Today, we reported 2020 GAAP earnings of $1.99 per share and operating earnings of $2.39 per share.
Our expectations for the year include capital investments of up to $3 billion, with 100% of the $1.2 billion in transmission investment and approximately 40% of the $1.7 billion in distribution investment being recovered in a formula rate.
