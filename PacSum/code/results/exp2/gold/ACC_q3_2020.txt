As we are not currently holding any discussions for on-campus rental refunds beyond one university partner, which we expect to total only $1 million -- approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter versus the $15 million we contributed in the second quarter of the prior academic year.
As expected, our third quarter other income was impacted by $8.4 million due to the loss of summer camp conference business, the continued waiver of online transaction fees and late payment fees, and higher levels of bad debt.
