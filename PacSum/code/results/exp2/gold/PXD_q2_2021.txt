When combined with the base dividend, total dividend payments in the third quarter will be greater than $2 per share, or a total of approximately $490 million return to shareholders during the third quarter alone.
Obviously, we're very excited after talking about it for 18 months to announce that we are both accelerating our first variable dividend payment into the third quarter this year as well as increasing the payment to reflect 75% of second quarter free cash flow.
Going to slide eight, positioning a leading dividend yield across all sectors, the combination of Pioneer's expected free cash flow and return on capital framework creates a compelling investment opportunity with a total dividend yield that will exceed all S&P 500 sectors as well as companies and the average yield of the major oil companies and all other energy companies in the S&P 500.
On slide six, we remain committed to our core investment thesis, predicated on low leverage, strong corporate returns to average over the next five years in the mid-teens, low investment rate, around 50% over the next five years and generating significant free cash flow.
