Turning to slide eight and first quarter results, operating income of $77.2 million or 10% of sales was similar in quality of earnings to last year, driven by higher volumes in irrigation in utility, favorable pricing, which helped offset the impact of rapid raw material cost inflation and improved operational efficiencies.
First quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.57, grew 29.1% compared to last year, driven by higher operating income and a more favorable tax rate of 21.9%, which was primarily due to a one-time incremental tax benefit associated with employee stock option exercises.
Net sales of $774.9 million, increased $100.7 million or 14.9% compared to last year, due to significantly higher sales in the Irrigation and Utility Support Structure segments.
Sales of $93.3 million, grew $5.1 million or 5.9% compared to last year, and improved sequentially from last quarter, primarily from more favorable pricing and improving end market demand.
