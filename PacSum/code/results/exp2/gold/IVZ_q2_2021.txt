We had net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion into active fixed income and within the active global equities, our $52 billion [Phonetic] developing markets fund, a key capability that came with the Oppenheimer combination, continued to see net inflows of nearly $1 billion dollars during the quarter.
In addition, our solutions enable institutional pipeline accounts for 35% of the pipeline at quarter-end, this following the funding of a large passive mandate from Australia in the second quarter which was enabled by our Solutions team.
