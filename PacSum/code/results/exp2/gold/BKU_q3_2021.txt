I'd also spend a little bit of time working on the deposit portfolio, the work that Raj is talking about is, has been a daily level of kind of bruising work that's not that glamorous but we're working very hard on new account operating relationships, cross-selling within the book, ensuring the ECR rates are set at appropriate levels really working hard on kind of the building blocks of this and I think the two places that you see it, number one, are the continued NII DDA growth obviously in the $324 million, but also secondarily, if you look at service charges, deposit fees on accounts was up 33% for this quarter compared to the same period last year.
On a spot basis, we're actually at 19 basis points and I checked last night, we're down another basis points so like 18 basis points as of yesterday.
