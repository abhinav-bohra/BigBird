Fiscal 2020 net sales increased by $307.5 million, which included an increase in base business net sales of $244.5 million and an increase in net sales from acquisitions of $63 million.
Excluding the negative impact of approximately $5 million of acquisition divestiture-related expenses, the amortization of acquisition-related inventory fair value step-up and non-recurring event -- expenses included in the cost of goods sold, our gross profit would have been $486.7 million, or 24.7% of net sales.
Of the $63 million of net sales from acquisitions, $33.7 million was attributable to an additional seven and one-half months of Clabber Girl net sales in fiscal 2020 and $27.8 million was attributable to one month of Crisco net sales.
During 2020 we incurred approximately $13.5 million in incremental COVID-19 costs at our manufacturing facilities, which primarily included temporary enhanced compensation for our manufacturing employees, compensation we continue to pay manufacturing employees while in quarantine and expenses related to other precautionary health and safety measures.
