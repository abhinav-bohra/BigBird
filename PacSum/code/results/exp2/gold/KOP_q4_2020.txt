Our consolidated sales for the year at $1.67 billion represents a new high in the fourth consecutive year of growth when we exclude KJCC from prior results.
Now this compares to $201 million earned in 2019 and exceeds both our recent guidance range of $204 million to $210 million and even more incredibly exceeds our original pre-pandemic guidance for the year of $200 million to $210 million of EBITDA.
