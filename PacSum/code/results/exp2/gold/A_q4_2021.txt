A year ago to our Agilent Investor Day, we raised our long-term annual growth outlook to the 5% to 7% range, while reaffirming our commitment to annual operating margin improvement and double-digit earnings per share growth.
Our NASD oligo business led the way with robust double-digit growth in the quarter and achieved full year revenues exceeding $225 million.
The strong growth in our Chemical and Energy business continues as we delivered 11% growth in the quarter.
We continue to perform extremely well in Pharma, our largest market, growing 21%, driven by our Biopharma business.
Our ability to drive growth and leverage our scale produce operating margins of roughly 30%, not more than 200 basis points from the prior year.
Now, looking at a performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generate revenue of $747 million.
At $6.32 billion for fiscal 2021, revenues are almost $1 billion higher than last year.
