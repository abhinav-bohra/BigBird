Consolidated revenues of $68.6 billion increased 10% above the prior year, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from our retail national account customers; and branded pharmaceutical price increases, which were in line with our initial guidance partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions.
Revenues were $3.1 billion, an increase of 1%, driven by growth in the primary care business and the contribution from kitting storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for COVID-19 vaccines, partially offset by lower revenue from COVID-19 tests in our Primary Care and Extended Care businesses as compared to the prior year.
Adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $330 million, driven by the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program, the prior year impact of an inventory impairment charge related to PPE that incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and growth in the Primary Care business.
For fiscal 2023, we currently anticipate approximately $0.10 of adjusted earnings per diluted share accretion related to the held-for-sale accounting based on their current estimated close date for the Phoenix Group transaction.
