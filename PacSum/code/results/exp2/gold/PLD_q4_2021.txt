During the quarter, we signed 62 million square feet of leases and issued proposals on 90 million square feet.
For strategic capital, we expect revenue, excluding promotes, to range between $540 million and $560 million.
This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI of more than $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rent growth.
Cash same-store NOI growth remained strong at 7.5% for the quarter and 6.1% for the full year.
