Net interest income increased $10 million, benefiting from an additional day in the quarter, higher loan fees and deployment of excess liquidity, partly offset by lower rates.
Loan yields increased 14 basis points, including 14 basis points from the net impact of PPP loans and 3 basis points from higher non-PPP fees.
Putting PPP and dealer side, the average loans and the remainder of our portfolio grew about $600 million or nearly 1.5% over the second quarter, including a 3% increase in general middle market.
