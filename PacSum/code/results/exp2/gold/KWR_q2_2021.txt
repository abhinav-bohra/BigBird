I also want to point out that our ability to gain new pieces of the business and take market share also contributed to the strong performance as our analysis shows, we had total organic sales growth due to net share gains of approximately 4% in the second quarter of 2021 versus the second quarter of 2020.
You can see from chart 8 where we show our sales volume trends that our sales volumes were up 35% from the second quarter of last year and has sequentially improved at a steady rate since then with the first quarter being unusually high as I mentioned earlier.
