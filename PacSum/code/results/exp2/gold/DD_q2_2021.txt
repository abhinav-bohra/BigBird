The earnings improvement resulted from volume gains most notably reflecting ongoing recovery in key end markets adversely impacted by the pandemic and the absence of approximately $150 million in charges associated with temporary idling certain facilities, partially offset by the absence of a $64 million gain associated with a joint venture that has since been divested.
Despite a challenging production environment with escalating raw material costs and continuous supply chain and logistics constraints, strong operating discipline and quick pricing actions resulted in about 460 basis points of margin expansion versus the year-ago period.
From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of $1.06 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.06 per share, up 53% and about 240%, respectively, versus the year-ago period.
Overall sales growth was broad-based with double-digit growth on an organic basis in all 3 reporting segments and across all regions.
During the second quarter, we purchased a total of $640 million in shares, which includes completion of our previous share repurchase program and the start of repurchases under our new authorization announced last quarter, which expires on June 30, 2022.
Specifically, operating EBITDA for our core results during the quarter was up about 40% versus last year after excluding the impact of the $150 million in idle mills incurred in the prior year, with about 240 basis points of margin expansion and operating leverage of one and a half times.
We also returned approximately $800 million of capital to shareholders during the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends.
