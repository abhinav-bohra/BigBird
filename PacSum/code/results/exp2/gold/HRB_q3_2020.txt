Client survey scores increased 3 points for price for value and 2 points for overall quality, considering the 9 point improvement in these scores last season, these results are tremendous.
This increase was primarily due to higher tax preparation fees due to volume growth in Assisted and DIY and the acquisition of just over 200 franchise offices this year which continues to be a good use of capital.
All of these improvements are fueling Wave's impressive performance which continued this quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of over 40%.
The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an increase in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $18 million.
