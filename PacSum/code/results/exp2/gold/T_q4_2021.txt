We also surpassed our high-end guidance for global HBO Max and HBO subscribers, adding 13.1 million subscribers in 2021, more than any year in HBO's history.
For the quarter, cash from operations was $11.3 billion, spending increase year over year with capex of $3.8 billion and gross capital investments totaling $4.9 billion.
For the year, earnings per share was up nearly 7% with strong organic growth in mobility, lower interest, lower benefit costs, and higher investment gains.
We added more than one million fiber subscribers for the fourth consecutive year, and full year broadband revenues were up 6.5% as we returned our Consumer Wireline business to revenue growth.
We also expect to remain a top dividend-paying company after deal close, with a dividend payout in the $8 billion to $9 billion range where anywhere in that range should rank us among the best dividend yields in corporate America.
We also continue to generate meaningful levels of free cash flow, nearly $27 billion in 2021, a number we feel good about when looking at our business after the WarnerMedia transaction.
We achieved more than half of our $6 billion cost savings run rate target, which we've reinvested into operations supporting our growth.
For the full year, free cash flow was $26.8 billion despite an increase in capex of about $900 million and more than $4 billion in higher cash content costs.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $8.7 billion even with a year-over-year increase of $1.4 billion in capex.
In Mobility, strong network performance and a consistent go-to-market strategy helped us lead the industry with about 3.2 million postpaid phone net adds.
We achieved this growth the right way with full year Mobility EBITDA up about $1 billion.
