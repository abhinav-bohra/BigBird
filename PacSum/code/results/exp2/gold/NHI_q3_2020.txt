Our debt capital metrics for the quarter ending September 30 were our net debt to annualized EBITDA at 4.8 times, weighted average debt maturity at 2.9 years and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 6.3 times.
Bickford, our largest assisted living operator representing 15% of annualized cash revenue, experienced an 80 basis point sequential decline in third quarter average occupancy, which compared to 270 basis point decline in the prior quarter comparison.
We are also continuing to work with prospective lenders and Bickford on the previously disclosed sale of nine properties, which we estimate will improve Bickford's annual cash flow by approximately $3 million.
As a result, today, we're announcing additional rent deferrals for Bickford, which together with other previously announced rent deferrals, will impact cash NOI growth by up to approximately $5.5 million over the next two quarters or approximately 3.5% of our trailing six-month cash NOI before deferrals.
