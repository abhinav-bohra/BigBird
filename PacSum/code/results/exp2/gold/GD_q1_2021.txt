This was driven by a 250-basis-point lower margin rate at aerospace, as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you, combined with $21 million more in corporate operating expense.
On the order side, I should observe that total backlog was down only $231 million sequentially, leaving a powerful $49.8 billion in total backlog.
The operating margin for the entire company was 10%, 70 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter.
The operating earnings on the defense side are up $45 million or 6.4%, while operating earnings in the aerospace side are down $20 million, but still nicely above consensus.
