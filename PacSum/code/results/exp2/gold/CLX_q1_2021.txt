For the total company, Q1 sales increased 27%, reflecting about a point of benefit from the acquisition of majority interest in our joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and about a point of headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
Importantly, this represented about a 30% increase in advertising support this quarter, compared to the year ago period, reflecting stronger investments to support our ambition to accelerate long-term profitable growth.
Turning to our fiscal year outlook; we now anticipate fiscal year sales to grow between 5% to 9%, reflecting our strong Q1 results, as well as our raised expectations for the balance of the fiscal year, including double-digit growth in Q2.
For perspective, we expect gross margin expansion in the front half, followed by a contraction over the balance of the fiscal year, as we lap gross margin expansion of 250 basis points delivered in the back half of fiscal year '20, driven by strong operating leverage from robust shipment growth during the initial phase of the pandemic.
Gross margin for the quarter increased 400 basis points to 48% compared to 44% in the year ago quarter.
First quarter gross margin included the benefit of strong volume growth, as well as 170 basis points of cost savings and 150 basis points of favorable mix.
