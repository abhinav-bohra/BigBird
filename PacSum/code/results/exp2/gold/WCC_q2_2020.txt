As we have done in prior economic cycles, we aggressively managed our business and took significant cost reduction and cash management actions, which enabled us to achieve a decremental margin of only 10%, and generate exceptionally strong free cash flow of $140 million or 250% of adjusted net income.
The legacy WESCO business generated approximately -- operating profit of $70 million [Phonetic], approximately $28 million lower than the prior year and a sales decline of approximately $285 million, representing a decremental margin of 10%.
The combined company is expected to generate free cash flow of more than $600 million annually by year three, which we expect will enable rapid deleveraging to within our target range within 36 months, as well as provide future capital deployment options to drive value creation.
