For the full year, we now anticipate a percentage sales decline in the mid to high single-digit range, which is a slight improvement from our previous expectation of an approximate 10% decline year-over-year.
As a result, of the gross margin expansion and SG&A cost reductions, our operating margin was flat during the quarter despite the 12% decline in sales.
Adjusted gross profit margin increased to 36% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with 35% a year ago.
We're also pleased that we generated positive free cash flow of $3.7 million during the quarter.
As a result, the segment's adjusted operating income margin increased to 19.5% compared with 18.3% for the second quarter of last year.
