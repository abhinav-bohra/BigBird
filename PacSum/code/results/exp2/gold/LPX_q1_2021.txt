As a result, LP exceeded $1 billion in sales, generated $461 million in EBITDA and $314 million in operating cash flow and earned $3.01 per share, all of which are quarterly records.
Compared to the first quarter of last year, net sales increased by 74% to just over $1 billion, driven by 49% growth in SmartSide and over $330 million of significantly higher OSB prices.
SmartSide net sales grew by nearly 50% versus Q1 of last year to $283 million and EBITDA more than doubled to $90 million.
Continued SmartSide growth and OSB price appreciation resulted in $93 million and $333 million, respectively, of incremental revenue for the quarter, compared to which everything else is really just a rounding error.
Smooth and ExpertFinish volumes more than doubled, with those innovative products reaching 8% of total SmartSide volume.
We generated $314 million of operating cash flow, including increased capital investments and heavy spending on logs, common practice for LP in the first quarter.
LP's South American segment also had a very strong quarter, with 50% more sales and 3 times more EBITDA than the first quarter of last year.
