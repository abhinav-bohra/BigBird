We remain optimistic that we will be able to deploy the vast majority of our current cash and future proceeds from the rest of the net lease platform seed sale by year-end, reflecting about $150 million of upside to what is currently reflected in our guidance range.
Consistent with our thesis regarding the value dislocation between multi-tenant and net lease properties, our effective acquisition yield on the retained multi-tenant asset could improve by up to 300 basis points after the acquisition and parcelization processes close.
