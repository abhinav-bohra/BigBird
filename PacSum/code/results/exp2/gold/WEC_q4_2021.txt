Overall, we expect the ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance.
Switching gears now, we're driving forward on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest five-year plan in the company's history.
We expect our Wisconsin Public Service utility to invest approximately $150 million in this project and for it to qualify for production tax credits.
One of the highlights is the planned investment in nearly 2,400 megawatts of renewable capacity over the next five years.
