Q1 revenue of $229.4 million declined 60 basis points on an organic basis versus the prior year, which excludes the effects of foreign currency.
In the first quarter, we generated $72.6 million in free cash flow, which represent over 40% growth versus the prior year, driven in part by the timing associated with strong retailer reorders placed in April, following the March consumption spike.
EBITDA and earnings per share for the first quarter grew 12% and 32% respectively versus the prior year.
