Operating margin of 24.3% improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage, along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives.
Speaking of price/cost, price/cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points.
Year-to-date, our teams have delivered robust margin expansion, with incremental margins for our seven segments ranging from 37% to 48%, inclusive of price/cost impact.
GAAP earnings per share of $2.45 was up 143% and included a onetime tax benefit of $0.35 related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets in the U.K. due to a change in the statutory corporate tax rate there.
For the full year, we expect price/cost impact to be dilutive to margin by about 100 basis points, which is 50 basis points higher than where we were as of the end of Q1.
