We grew revenue 15% operationally, which is once again above the anticipated growth rate for the animal health market, and these results were highlighted by 27% operational growth in our companion animal portfolio with 1% operational growth in livestock.
In January, the Human Animal Bond Research Institute and Zoetis released the results of a new global survey of more than 16,000 pet owners and 1,200 small animal clinics which reinforce how deep the connection is between pets and pet owners and how that dynamic relates to views on veterinary care and the related benefits of pet ownership.
Performance in companion animal was led by our small animal parasiticide portfolio bolstered by full year sales of Simparica Trio, which generated revenue of $425 million, an increase of $305 million compared to 2020 sales.
Another major growth driver for the year has been our global diagnostics portfolio, which grew 21% operationally with significant strength in international markets and the continued launch of VetScan Imagyst, our AI-driven diagnostics platform.
