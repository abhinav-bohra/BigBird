Continued strong demand across our Material Handling and Distribution segments drove a 58% year-over-year growth in sales, and we delivered a second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 20% on an organic basis, with all end markets supplying solid growth.
Material handling adjusted operating income increased approximately 8% to $17 million, driven by higher volume mix and the addition of Elkhart, which were partially offset by an unfavorable price to cost relationship due to escalating raw material costs and higher SG&A expenses.
Excluding the impact of the Elkhart acquisition, organic net sales increased 26% due primarily to higher volume mix.
