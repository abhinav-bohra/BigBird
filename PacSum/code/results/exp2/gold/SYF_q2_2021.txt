This strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from the government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions, leading to a slight increase in loan receivables, which were $78.4 billion for the second quarter.
When comparing these trends to the more normalized operating environment of the second quarter 2019, and excluding the impact of Walmart, purchase volume was 18% higher in the second quarter 2021 and purchase volume per account was 22% higher.
