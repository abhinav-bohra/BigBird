Clean is about decarbonizing our generation mix with our new goal to deliver 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050.
For the fourth quarter of 2019, we earned $0.57 per share compared to $0.23 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Supporting an internal culture focused on reducing costs and maintaining a financially strong company to access low cost capital are also key in delivering a 100% clean energy future affordably.
