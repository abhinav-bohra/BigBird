We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share expectations for the fourth quarter in a row delivering $1.98 adjusted earnings per share in the final quarter of 2021 and $8.40 adjusted earnings per share for the full year.
Adjusted operating income of 510 million grew by over 230% year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments and improved underlying performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical costs compared to prior year.
Fourth quarter adjusted revenue of 20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year over year, driven by membership growth in our government services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.
There are two main components to this increase: one, approximately 60% was driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and testing; front store sales, including demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories; as well as strong COVID-related prescription volume.
In the pharmacy services segment, fourth quarter revenues of 39.3 billion increased by 8.2% year over year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy, and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements.
