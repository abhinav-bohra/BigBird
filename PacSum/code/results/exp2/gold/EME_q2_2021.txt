Reported operating margin of 8.7% represents a 100 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter due to an improvement in gross profit margin given a more favorable revenue mix and continued strong project execution.
In addition to these increases in employment costs, our results for the second quarter of 2021 included a $4.1 million provision for credit losses due to the bankruptcy filing of a customer within our U.S. Industrial Services segment which negatively impacted our quarterly consolidated SG&A margin by 20 basis points.
We had revenue growth in our Electrical Construction segment of 19.3% and in our Mechanical segment, up 21.3%, which I believe reflects more than just the resumption of normal demand from the COVID-impacted results of the second quarter last year.
Specific quarterly operating performance by reporting segment is as follows: operating income of our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment of $42.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, increased by $11.1 million from the comparable 2020 period.
We leave the quarter with very strong RPO growth across these segments of almost 8% from the year ago period and nearly 10% for the end of 2020, and this is despite very strong revenue growth.
