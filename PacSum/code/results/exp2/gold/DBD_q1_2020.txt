We are delivering significant margin increase across all three business lines, with services rising by 230 basis points, products expanding 280 basis points, and our software and gross margin increased by 1,280 basis points due to an easier comp, as well as better delivery and management of our labor costs.
From an industry perspective, we expect our banking business, which generated approximately 74% of the company's revenue during 2019, will show greater resiliency in our retail business, due to the higher mix of services and software revenues.
