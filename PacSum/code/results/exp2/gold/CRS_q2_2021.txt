When excluding the impact of the special items, namely the goodwill impairment charge and the COVID-19 costs, adjusted operating loss was $32.3 million compared to adjusted operating income of $57.3 million in the prior year period and an adjusted operating loss of $30.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
The current quarter's operating results include a $52.8 million goodwill impairment charge associated with our additive reporting unit that is in our PEP segment.
The lower year-over-year SG&A expenses primarily reflect the actions we took to reduce costs, including the elimination of about 20% of our salary positions, managing discretionary spend closely, as well as the impact of remote working conditions that reduce certain administrative costs, such as travel and entertainment.
We ended the second quarter with total liquidity of $665 million, including $271 million of cash and no near-term financial obligations.
