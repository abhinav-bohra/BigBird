The $1 billion increase in our DTE Electric five-year plan is driven by distribution infrastructure investments, preparing our grid for electrification, and hardening initiatives, an increased cleaner energy investment due to our voluntary renewable program, which is still exceeding our high expectations.
As you'll see in our 2022 outlook and our five-year plan, we are on track to deliver 5% to 7% earnings per share growth through 2026 and dividend growth in line with our earnings per share growth.
At DTE Electric, we announced our plan to accelerate decarbonization by ceasing coal use at the Belle River Power Plant by 2028, reducing carbon emissions by 50% two years earlier than originally planned.
Our updated five-year utility plan is $18 billion, which is $1 billion higher than the prior plan.
