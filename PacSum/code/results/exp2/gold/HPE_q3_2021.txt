We generated record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year over year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October.
We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share, up 28% and 27% year over year, respectively.
Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter and in line with normal sequential seasonality, also in line with our outlook that factored in some of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged.
Even with these investments and one-time charges, our non-GAAP operating margin was 9.8%, up 190 basis points from the prior year, which translates to a 25% year-over-year increase in operating profit.
I am particularly proud of our non-GAAP gross margin that hit another record level of 34.7%, up 40 basis points sequentially and up 420 basis points from the prior-year period.
Our Q3 orders were up strong double digits year over year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our edge-to-cloud offerings.
With strong execution across the business and despite two unanticipated one-time charges, we ended the quarter with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47, up 31% from the prior year and above the higher end of our outlook range for Q3.
