Changes between the third quarter of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2019 were driven primarily by the following factors and the numbers I'm going to cover [Inaudible] for the company: One, $20 million â€” $21 million in bad debt allowance in the form of the $14 million of increased net debt expense versus the third quarter of 2019, coupled with $7 million of lease revenue reverse for tenants, that are accounted for on a cash basis per GAAP within the third quarter; two, over $20 million of short-term nonrecurring rental assistance; three, a $9 million decline in common area and ancillary revenue as well as percentage rents; four, a $4 million decline in parking income driven by protracted property closures and reduced parking utilization at our urban centers in New York City and Chicago primarily; five, interest expense increased $4 million due to a decline in capitalized interest; six, net operating income declined from the Hyatt Regency Hotel [Inaudible], it was about a $2 million decline; seven, a negative $0.03 per share dilutive impact from shares issued in the second quarter relating to our stock dividend issued in the second quarter.
We do expect approximately a 3% cumulative drop in occupancy from lease rejections, approximately half of which is already embedded within the 90.8% reported occupancy [Inaudible] third quarter, and the balance of these stores will close within the fourth quarter.
By October, for centers opened at least eight weeks, sales were up to 90% of pre-COVID levels.
