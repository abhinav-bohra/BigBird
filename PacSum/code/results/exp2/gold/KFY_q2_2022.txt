Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share also advanced to a new high in the quarter, improving to a $1.53, which was up $0.99 compared to adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and actually up $0.16 or 12% sequentially.
Fee revenue growth in the quarter for our consolidated Executive Search business was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially while our RPO and Professional Search business was up 76% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.
Revenue was up 47% and our diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.38 and $1.53, respectively.
Our adjusted EBITDA grew $69 million year-over-year and $13.5 million or 11% sequentially to $135 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, both are new quarterly highs.
Our adjusted EBITDA over the same comparison period is up 67%, that's nearly 3 times greater than fee revenue growth and our adjusted EBITDA margin is up 530 basis points to nearly 21%.
Although our search businesses, both Pro Search and Executive Search combined represent about 45% of our revenue, we believe there is still substantial market opportunity ahead, given the acceleration of an increasingly nomadic labor market.
