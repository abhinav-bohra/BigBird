Moving to slide 9, net interest income was down $5 million linked quarter given the expected decrease tied to lower merger accretion and PPP portfolio balances, core net interest income was up 1% as the benefit of lower deposit cost, day count, commercial loan growth, and higher investment portfolio income was partially offset by continued declines in consumer loan balances and overall loan spread compression, given the continued reductions in LIBOR and the competitive landscape.
We delivered earnings per share of $0.50 a share and a return on tangible common equity of over 18% on an adjusted basis, despite the near-term headwinds that the industry is facing with continued pressure on short-term rates and strong competition given growing levels of excess liquidity and muted loan demand.
And while we expected total fees to be down given relatively healthy levels of fixed income and mortgage banking fees last quarter, we also saw a return to more normalized levels in traditional banking fees, which were up 2% in the quarter with particular strength in wealth on strong annuity sales.
We generated PPNR of $284 million as underlying improvement in core net interest income and traditional banking fees was masked by the impact of expected declines in net merger-related and PPP non net interest income along with lower fixed income and mortgage banking fees.
Our net interest-bearing deposits declined 3 basis points -- our net interest deposit cost declined 3 basis points in the quarter.
Credit quality continues to be excellent with improvement in the overall quality of the loan portfolio highlighted by net charge offs of only 2 basis points and a 47% decrease in loan balances on deferral in the quarter.
