We generated $14.3 million net income or $1.28 of diluted earnings per share as a result of continued quality growth in our loan portfolio, a strong credit profile, disciplined expense management and low funding costs.
Our net credit loss rate during the quarter was 6.9%, a 210-basis-point improvement from last year, and we ended the quarter with a 30-plus day delinquency rate of 5.3%, down from 7% last year.
