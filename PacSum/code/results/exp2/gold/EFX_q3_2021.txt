Given our very strong third quarter performance, we are increasing our full year revenue guidance by approximately 320 basis points or $131 million, at the midpoint of a range between $4.9 billion to $4.921 billion, up 19% from last year, and increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.22 per share to a midpoint of $7.57 per share, which adjusting for technology transformation cost implies a 23% growth in EPS.
We had a very strong third quarter and first nine months of 2021, a continuation of our strong outperformance last year with record revenue in the quarter of $1.223 billion, which was up over 14% with core non-mortgage market and non-UC ERC claims revenue growth of 20%.
Non-mortgage growth in EWS and USIS and growth in International drove about 900 basis points to core revenue growth, excluding acquisitions and FX, with mortgage outperformance primarily in Workforce Solutions driving about 800 basis points of organic core growth in the quarter.
More importantly, our core growth, which excludes the impact of the mortgage market, unemployment claims and ERC-related revenues is expected to accelerate to 21% this year, a powerful figure that reflects the strength of our underlying business model and EFX2023 growth strategy.
Our U.S. B2B businesses of Workforce Solutions and USIS, which together represent almost 75% of Equifax revenue, again drove our growth, delivering 17% revenue growth despite the 21% decline in the U.S. mortgage market in the quarter.
Verification Services mortgage revenue grew 22% in the quarter despite the 21% decline in the mortgage market with the EWS outperformance driven by increased records, penetration and new products.
