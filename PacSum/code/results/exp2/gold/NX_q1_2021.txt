Based on our strong first-quarter results and ongoing conversations with our customers, we are raising our expectations for the year and now expect approximately 12% sales growth in our North American fenestration segment, approximately 5% sales growth in our North American cabinet components segment and approximately 22% sales growth in our European fenestration segment.
We reported net income of $7.9 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the three months ended January 31, 2021, compared to $10,000 or $0.00 per diluted share during the three months ended January 31, 2020.
The increase in net income was somewhat offset by a $6.7 million increase in SG&A during the quarter, $4.6 million of which was related to the valuation of our stock-based comp awards, mainly due to an increase in our stock price, and $1.6 million of which was due to higher medical claims.
We reported revenue of $230.1 million during the first quarter of 2021, which represents an increase of 17.1%, compared to $196.6 million during the first quarter of 2020.
From a margin standpoint, this increase represents adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of approximately 260 basis points.
To summarize, on a consolidated basis for the full year, we currently expect to generate net sales growth of approximately 12% year over year to the midpoint of guidance, while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margin in the low 12% range.
Our North American fenestration segment generated revenue of $128.1 million in Q1, which was $17.7 million or approximately 16% higher than prior-year Q1.
