As we deployed 1 gigabit wireline networks, wireless/wireline converged networks and wireless networks, this quarter reflected an increase in demand from one of our top five customers.
General and administrative expenses were 7.7% reflecting tight cost controls and all of these factors produced adjusted EBITDA of $92.8 million, or 11.5% of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.06 compared to $0.88 in the year ago quarter.
Gross margins were 18.7% of revenue, reflecting solid overall performance, offset in part by the continued impacts of the complexity of a large customer program.
