For the year, excluding our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in June of 2021, we increased net sales by 11% to $3.3 billion, which was in line with our previous guidance.
The fourth-quarter net loss attributable to Albemarle was $4 million, reflecting an increased cost estimate to construct our Kemerton lithium hydroxide plant due to anticipated cost overruns from the impact of pandemic-related issues on the supply chain and labor.
La Negra 3 and 4 is currently in commercial qualification, and we expect to start realizing first sales from this facility in the second quarter.
For the fourth quarter, we generated net sales of $894 million, which is an increase of $15 million compared to the prior-year quarter.
We now expect 2025 lithium demand of approximately 1.5 million tons, up more than 30% from our previous estimates.
Beyond 2025, we anticipate continued growth with lithium demand of more than 3 million tons by 2030.
