While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year, with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal-year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit, and all the while, fighting for recovery of patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts.
This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID-related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter and with some tailwinds from our competitors' recall right at the end of the quarter.
Our experience over the last seven-plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%.
Excluding the impact of COVID-19-related revenue in both the June '21 and June '20 quarters, our global revenue increased by 29% on a constant-currency basis.
