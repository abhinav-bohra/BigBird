Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in 2020 includes $0.12 from an intangible asset impairment charge, $0.07 of restructuring costs, $0.04 of acquired backlog amortization, $0.03 of acquisition costs and $0.03 from a discrete tax benefit.
The increase of $0.22 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 consists of the following: $0.21 due to higher gross margins, $0.15 from a lower recurring tax rate, $0.07 due to government assistance programs, $0.06 due to lower interest expense, $0.02 due to lower operating expenses and $0.01 from the operating results of our acquisition.
Excluding the government assistance benefits, which contributed approximately 60 basis points to the 2020 gross margins and the amortization of profit and inventory in 2019, gross margins were up 90 basis points, primarily due to higher gross profit margins on Parts & Consumables and a higher overall percentage of Parts & Consumables.
