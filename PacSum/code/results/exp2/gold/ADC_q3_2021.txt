While raising the lower end of our acquisition guidance for the year to $1.3 billion our thoughtful and disciplined approach is evidenced by the nearly one-third of annualized base rents acquired year-to-date derived from ground lease assets and roughly 70% of annualized base rents acquired derived from leading investment grade retailers.
During the 3rd quarter, we invested approximately $343 million in 83 high quality retail net lease properties across our 3 external growth platforms, 80 of these properties were sourced through our acquisition platform representing acquisition volume of over $340 million.
While our investment activities further strengthen our best-in-class retail portfolio we have also fortified our robust balance sheet with $1.5 billion of capital markets transactions year-to-date positioning our company for dynamic growth in the quarters ahead.
