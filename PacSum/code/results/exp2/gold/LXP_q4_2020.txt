Also during the quarter, leasing volume was healthy at 1.7 million square feet, consolidated same-store NOI was up 1.6% and industrial cash renewal rents increased 3.4% with overall fourth quarter cash renewal rents down roughly 2.5%, due to office lease renewal roll downs.
In the fourth quarter, we generated adjusted company funds from operations of $0.19 per diluted common share to end the year at $0.76 per diluted common share, the high end of our guidance range.
Turning to leasing, we leased over 5.2 million feet during 2020 and at year-end, our portfolio was 98.3% leased, representing a slight decline compared to the previous quarter, primarily as a result of a year-end lease expiration in our Statesville in North Carolina, industrial facility.
