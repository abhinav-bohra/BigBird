Global Ecommerce revenue at constant currency grew 40% for the quarter and EBIT margins improved nearly 400 basis points on a year-to-year basis.
In the month of March, Domestic Parcel Services per unit labor cost delivered the best performance compared to any quarter since second quarter of last year.
Free cash flow was a net use of $1 million and cash from operations was $66 million, both an improvement from prior year due to favorable working capital changes largely around the timing of accounts payable and accounts receivable along with improved collections.
Our Presort business continued with the momentum we saw at the end of last year with both revenue and EBIT improving on a year-to-year basis.
