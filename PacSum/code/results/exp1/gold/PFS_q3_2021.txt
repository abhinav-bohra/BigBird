The focal point for Provident was our loan growth ex-PPP, which contributed to increased net interest income, and our strong quarter end loan pipeline, which reflects customer confidence and provides positive momentum for respectable growth going into the fourth quarter.
With a fairly neutral interest rate, risk position, excess liquidity and stable low-cost deposit funding, we continue to be well positioned to benefit from a rise in interest rates, while remaining well protected if rates remain low.
