For the third quarter of 2021, Tennant reported net sales of $272 million, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year, which included a favorable foreign currency effect of 1.2% and a divestiture impact of negative 2% related to the sale of our Coatings business in the first quarter of 2021.
To minimize the impact of higher freight costs and related supply disruptions, we continue to prioritize local-for-local and region-for-region manufacturing and sourcing to allow us to manufacture our products closer to our customers.
While we expect that these macro headwinds will continue well into 2022, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term sustainable growth and improve our operational efficiencies to generate long-term value for our shareholders.
The increased demand for our products combined with the effect of macro level constraints on our production capabilities contributed to a record order backlog that varies by product category or region and is now 3 to 5 times our historical averages.
