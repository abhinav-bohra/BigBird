We expect to see a continued ramp in the third and fourth quarters as we execute against our near-term growth strategy and have continued to strengthen the business for the long term with new talent, data assets, partnerships, and solutions that continue to bolster our offerings and provide our clients differentiated insights that help them grow revenues, lower operating costs, and improve the risk and compliance profile.
On our first-quarter call, we discussed our key priorities for 2021, which are to continue to grow our share of wallet with our strategic customers; to approach and monetize the SMB space in new and innovative ways; to launch new products domestically to localize new and existing products globally; and lastly, to integrate the Bisnode acquisition.
Leveraging the investments we've made in nontraditional data and our sales and marketing solutions, we signed additional business with one of the largest online retailers who will be using our data and analytics to support their efforts in growing a new business line that needed help targeting specific retailers in high foot traffic areas such as airports and sports stadiums.
In North America, we signed a multiyear deal with Ceridian, a global human capital management software company for Analytics Studio and various sales and marketing products, including the new Rev.
The improvement was primarily driven by higher prior-year expenses related to the retirement of debt as part of the initial public offering, lower interest expense, improvements in operating income driven by lower equity-based compensation related to stock options granted in the prior-year quarter, and the net impact of Bisnode acquisition.
