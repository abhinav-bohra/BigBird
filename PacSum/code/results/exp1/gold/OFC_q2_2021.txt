Through the second quarter, we completed total leasing of 1.7 million square feet, which included 815,000 square feet of renewals, 205,000 square feet of vacancy leasing and 641,000 square feet of development leasing.
During the quarter, we placed 197,000 square feet of development projects in the service including Project EL, 107,000 square foot specialized facility we built for a defense contractor in San Antonio.
