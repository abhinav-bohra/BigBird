Through the strength of our market-leading businesses, innovative product and process technologies and unique enterprise capabilities, the company delivered financial results better than what we outlined during our last earnings call as we capitalize on a faster recovery in residential end markets, particularly in the U.S., improved manufacturing leverage and strong cost controls.
Throughout this past quarter, our global team has demonstrated tremendous resiliency, continuously adapting to changing market conditions and maintaining an incredible focus on taking care of each other, supporting our customers and maximizing our financial performance relative to the market opportunity.
Within North American residential fiberglass insulation, sales volumes were largely consistent with Q2 2019 and some favorable price realization on the January price increase helped to partially offset negative price carryover from last year.
After experiencing a significant drop in order volumes at the start of the quarter, we continue to see our business improve in May and June as shelter-in-place restrictions began to lift, and demand for our products in most of our end markets increased.
Within most of our commercial and industrial end markets, the recoveries has been slower, and we continue to take the necessary actions to balance our production with expected near-term demand.
