While volume declined 4% year over year due to supply constraints from several factors, including our own maintenance, lingering effects of weather-related outages, and global logistics challenges, we continued to see robust underlying demand across our end markets, particularly for higher-margin downstream and sustainability-led applications.
Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $512 million, and operating EBIT margins declined by 520 basis points on lower olefin and co-product pricing, combined with higher raw material costs and energy costs.
In the packaging and specialty plastics segment, operating EBIT was $1.4 billion, up $662 million year over year, primarily due to margin improvement and partly offset by lower-supply volumes.
The packaging and specialty plastics business reported higher net sales year over year, driven by price gains in all regions, as well as in key applications, such as flexible food, industrial, and consumer packaging.
In the fourth quarter, Dow once again delivered top and bottom-line growth year over year, with sales growth and margin expansion in every operating segment.
In the packaging vertical, demand for lower carbon emissions, recyclable, and circular materials are driving demand for Dow's industry-leading plastics portfolio and in-house application design capabilities.
We see global demand across the diverse consumer market vertical remaining at elevated levels, particularly for applications like electronics, 5G, appliances, pharma, and home care, where several of Dow's growth investments are targeted.
These results translated into significant cash generation for the quarter, with cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion, up $901 million year over year, and cash flow conversion of 88%.
