During 2020 we incurred approximately $13.5 million in incremental COVID-19 costs at our manufacturing facilities, which primarily included temporary enhanced compensation for our manufacturing employees, compensation we continue to pay manufacturing employees while in quarantine and expenses related to other precautionary health and safety measures.
Excluding the negative impact of approximately $5 million of acquisition divestiture-related expenses, the amortization of acquisition-related inventory fair value step-up and non-recurring event -- expenses included in the cost of goods sold, our gross profit would have been $486.7 million, or 24.7% of net sales.
Fiscal 2020 base business net sales also benefited from $35.8 million in net pricing, inclusive of our spring 2019 list price increase, our 2019 trade spend optimization program as well as the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in lower than average daily trade promotions during the height of the pandemic.
It's humbling that our company benefited from such a tragedy and at the same time it's a tribute to our employees working in the midst of the pandemic and dealing with our own issues caused by it that we were able to respond as well as we did to the increased needs of consumers as they cope with COVID and the resulting quarantine.
