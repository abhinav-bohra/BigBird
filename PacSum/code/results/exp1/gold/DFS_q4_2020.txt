Our digital bank operating model combined with disciplined expense management has historically generated industry-leading efficiency, but in 2020, we took additional action to control costs and delivered on our commitment to cut $400 million from planned expenses despite absorbing several one-time items that have occurred during the year.
We also took quick action at the onset of the pandemic to mitigate credit risk by tightening new account underwriting criteria, reducing promotional rate offers and pulling back on credit line increases, and we added $2.4 billion to reserves as the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated.
While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter.
As expected, the tightening of our underwriting criteria combined with elevated payment rates impacted our loan growth and our total loans decreased 6% year-over-year.
Net interest margin continued to improve, up 34 basis points from the prior year and 44 basis points from the prior quarter to 10.63%.
Our strong fourth quarter results were the capstone to good performance in a very challenging year, proving the value and resilience of our digital banking business model.
In this environment, we will remain disciplined on expense management but also committed to making investments for growth and efficiency and anticipate higher marketing expenses relative to 2020 levels.
Operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year driven by one-time items related to software write-offs, charges for penalties and restitution, and costs of a voluntary early retirement program.
