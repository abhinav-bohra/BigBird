SG&A expenses were $47.8 million in the third quarter, down $3 million from the same period a year ago, reflecting the actions we took to reduce costs, including the elimination of about 20% of our global salaried positions late last fiscal year, managing discretionary spend closely as well as the impacts of remote working conditions that reduced certain administrative costs such as travel and entertainment.
The current quarter's operating results include $7.6 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, including inventory writedowns, associated with our ongoing actions to reduce cost and narrow focus in our additive business unit within our PEP segment.
Over the last four quarters, we have generated $189 million in free cash flow and ended the third quarter with total liquidity of $539 million, including $244 million of cash and no near-term financial obligations.
Again, the current quarter's results were largely in line with the expectations we set at the beginning of the quarter and reflect the impact of significantly lower volume compared to the prior year combined with a targeted inventory reduction, partially offset by the cost reduction efforts.
