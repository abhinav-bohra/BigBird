On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was about $38 million below last year's Q1 as we benefited from a $21 million true-up in Q1 2021, which is a $6 million negative true-up in Q1 2022, and the prior year also benefited from timing of revenues under contract.
Let's talk about our developer platform, Dolby.io, where we are focused on enabling developers to create the most compelling experiences in target markets where we can offer the most differentiation, virtual live performances, online and hybrid events, social audio, premium education, gaming, and content production, which we estimate to represent a market opportunity of about $5 billion and growing.
While revenue and earnings per share finished within our range of guidance, both were impacted by a $6 million negative true-up for lower-than-estimated unit shipments in our foundational audio technologies.
At the same time, we see strength across Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and our imaging patents portfolio, and we remain confident in our ability to grow these revenues at a rate of over 35% this year.
Mobile decreased by $31 million or 29% compared to Q1 of last year as our foundational audio revenues last year benefited from both high recoveries and timing of revenues under contract, partially offset by new imaging patent licenses.
Samsung has been showcasing Dolby Atmos across their soundbar, PC, and mobile products for some time, and we are excited that they have decided to offer their TV customers the most immersive audio experience with Dolby Atmos.
We saw new soundbar products from Samsung and Hisense supporting Dolby Atmos and the latest TVs from Sony, Panasonic, and TCL, all featuring the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience.
Net income on a GAAP basis in the first quarter was $80 million or $0.77 per share per diluted share compared to $135.2 million or $1.30 per diluted share in last year's Q1.
On a year-over-year basis, Q1 CE licensing increased by approximately $6 million or 11%, driven by higher foundational audio revenues for DMAs and soundbars, as well as higher recoveries.
