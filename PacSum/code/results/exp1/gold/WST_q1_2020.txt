During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS.
We'll first look at Q1 2020 revenues and profits where we saw strong sales and earnings per share growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and generics market units and contract manufacturing.
We recorded $167 million in gross profit, $20 million or 13.6% above Q1 of last year, and gross profit margin of 34% with a 90-basis point expansion from the same period last year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $88 million reported this quarter, compared to $71.3 million in the same period last year or a 23.4% increase.
We had 13% organic sales growth in the first quarter, largely through strong high-value product sales.
