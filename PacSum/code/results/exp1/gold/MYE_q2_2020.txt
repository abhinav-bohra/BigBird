For the full year, we now anticipate a percentage sales decline in the mid to high single-digit range, which is a slight improvement from our previous expectation of an approximate 10% decline year-over-year.
The increases we saw from the fuel container sales in the consumer end market, and the Tuffy acquisition in the distribution segment were more than offset by sales decreases across the rest of our end markets.
Sales in our consumer end market increased significantly year-over-year as a result of higher demand for our fuel containers.
This was due to solid operational execution and favorable price-cost margin, which more than offset the lower sales volume during the quarter.
Adjusted gross profit margin increased to 36% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with 35% a year ago.
