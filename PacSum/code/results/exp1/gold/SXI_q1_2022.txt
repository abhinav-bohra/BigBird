Revenue and consolidated adjusted operating margin increased significantly year-on-year in fiscal first quarter 2022 as we leveraged positive demand trends and converted new business opportunities from our pipeline.
Electronics revenue increased approximately 37% year-on-year, primarily due to a broad-based geographical recovery with continued solid demand for relays in renewable energy and electric vehicle applications along with positive trends in transportation, appliance, test and measurement and distribution end-markets.
We continue to have significant financial flexibility to pursue new organic and inorganic growth opportunities given our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and consistent cash flow generation.
