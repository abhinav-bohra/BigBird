Both our homebuilding and financial services businesses contributed to these year-over-year improvements as pre-tax income from our homebuilding operations increased $23.3 million or 38%, and our financial services pre-tax income increased $14 million or 110%.
The new home industry is also benefiting from market share gains versus the existing home market, as the combination of low existing supply and the increased preference for new construction has served as tailwinds.
The combination of low interest rates, constrained existing home supply and a heightened interest in single-family home ownership has resulted in a very favorable environment for our industry.
In addition to maintaining price discipline, with respect to our homes, we also exercised cost discipline across our organization during the quarter, leading to a 90 basis points year-over-year improvement in our SG&A ratio.
The increase in homebuilding pre-tax income was the result of a 21% increase in home sale revenues and a 160 basis point improvement to our homebuilding operating margins.
Our general and administrative expense was up only modestly for the second quarter as increases in stock-based compensation and bonus expense, driven by strong operating results during the quarter, were partially offset by cost reduction measures implemented at the outset of the pandemic.
The strongest part of the market continues to be at the more affordable price points, which has been a strategic focus of ours for some time now.
Gross margins increased on both build-to-order and speculative home deliveries, driven by price increases implemented across the majority of our communities over the past 12 months.
