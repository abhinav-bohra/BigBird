We continue to focus on introducing new more sustainable materials to our product lines, new products design to solve consumer needs identified by data and insights, and refined product strategy tied to our renewed purpose to help consumers reduce food waste and eliminate the use of single plastic products and packaging.
And we have been working with retailers around the world to take limited amount of products into new channels, and we closed the year ahead of our objective of $50 million in B2B revenue, which is product sales sold through retails in their loyalty programs.
The decrease of 80 basis points was driven primarily by higher resin cost of 200 basis points, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies in the first half of the year.
We refinanced the debt for more flexibility with more favorable terms, continued our efforts to divest of non-core assets, significantly improved our tax rate and remediated the material weakness within our Mexico operations.
We started building new capabilities to open up our iconic brand to new channels of distribution, with the goal of dramatically increased consumer access to our products.
We will continue to fix our core business, continue to enter into product categories, and continue to open and expand into new channels, all of which we believe will transform this iconic brand.
