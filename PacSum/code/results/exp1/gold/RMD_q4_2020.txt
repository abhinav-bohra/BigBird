During fiscal year 2020, we generated $802 million of cash that allowed us to return $225 million of cash dividends to you, our shareholders, while also investing in our future with a double-digit increase in R&D, including clinical research, both digital and in person, as well as design and digital innovation across our sleep apnea, COPD, asthma and our software as a service businesses.
So, looking forward, we have built a sophisticated set of analytic capabilities, including an epidemiology patient model that has helped us model the impacts of both the headwinds and the tailwinds that are part of this COVID-19 crisis, and we have detailed scenarios of the impacts by city, by region, by country and by ResMed business line.
While our financial results in March and June have benefited from high demand for ventilation devices and lower operating costs, our underlying core business of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma remains strong and well positioned for long-term growth.
