We concluded 2019 with another quarter of profitable growth in Q4, led by our environmental service segment which achieved better-than-expected results on a combination of higher landfill and incineration volumes, project wins and strengthen our field services.
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew by 10% on a 3% increase in revenue, and we generated record adjusted free cash flow of $208.5 million.
Safety-Kleen revenue was up 2% on growth in our SK branch business and pricing of our core services which offset year-end weakness in base oil and blended pricing.
Revenues were up 1% for the quarter, and favorable business mix drove an 8% growth of adjusted EBITDA and a 100-basis-point improvement in margin.
Our average price per pound for incineration in Q4 was flat with a year ago primarily reflecting the effects of a large project that we did in Q4 2019, that delivered a significant amount of low-price volume.
