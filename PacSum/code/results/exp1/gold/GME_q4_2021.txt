With that said, here is a brief recap of what changed in fiscal year 2021: we installed a new management team comprised of technology veterans and introduced a more equity-focused executive compensation structure to increase alignment with stockholders; we refreshed the Board with stockholders and individuals who possess records of value creation, while reducing individual director compensation; we ended relationships with high-priced external consultants who were costing the company millions of dollars per year; we hired hundreds of new individuals with e-commerce, operations and technology experience, while eliminating many redundant and unnecessary roles; we recapitalized the company's balance sheet after raising approximately $1.67 billion in capital; we expanded our product catalog to seize more market share in areas such as PC gaming, personal electronics and virtual reality; we invested in our fulfillment network by standing up new facilities on the East Coast in York, Pennsylvania, and on the West Coast in Reno, Nevada; we invested in our systems and tech stack after years of decay and neglect; we invested in U.S.-based customer service and established a new facility in South Florida; we invested in a dedicated blockchain team and new capabilities to drive the development of initiatives such as our NFT marketplace, which we expect to launch by the end of the second quarter; we see significant long-term potential in the more than $40 billion market for NFTs.
