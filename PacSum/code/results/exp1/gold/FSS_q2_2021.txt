We are optimistic that an infrastructure package in these areas would provide funding that would support the use of the majority of our product offerings, including equipment sales and rentals of dump trucks and trailers, safe digging trucks, road marking equipment, sewer cleaners and street sweepers.
In summary, we delivered another outstanding quarter with operating results exceeding our expectations despite dramatic increases in commodity costs and ongoing supply chain disruption, including factors linked to the global shortage in semiconductors.
Some components reported to be part of the deal, which includes a total of $550 billion in new federal investment in U.S. infrastructure include: $110 billion for roads; $73 billion for power infrastructure; $65 billion to expand broadband access; $55 billion for water infrastructure; $46 billion for environmental resiliency; and $11 billion for transportation safety.
Tax expense for the quarter increased by $1.9 million, largely due to the increase in pre-tax income levels, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity.
Our teams again delivered impressive results with meaningful growth in both the top and bottom line, while achieving adjusted EBITDA margin toward the high end of our target range despite widespread supply chain disruptions and an unprecedented commodity cost environment.
