These results are a testament to the favorable housing fundamentals that exist today as well as the strategic focus of our company, which targets the more affordable segment of the market and adheres to a build-to-order operational model.
Our teams did an excellent job executing in their respective markets, leading to double-digit year-over-year increase in closings, orders and quarter-end backlog for our company.
Home sale revenues grew 49% year-over-year to over $1 billion, while homebuilding operating margin improved by 380 basis points from the prior-year quarter.
The demand for new homes during the quarter remained strong and continued to be broad-based in nature as we witness positive trends across the number of markets and price points.
We also expanded our home sales gross margins by 200 basis points and improved our SG&A leverage by 180 basis points.
We continue to see particular strength at our more affordably priced communities as homebuyers from all demographic segments look for alternatives to the lack of availability in the high cost of existing homes in most markets.
