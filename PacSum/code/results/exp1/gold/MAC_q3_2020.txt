Changes between the third quarter of 2020 versus the third quarter of 2019 were driven primarily by the following factors and the numbers I'm going to cover [Inaudible] for the company: One, $20 million â€” $21 million in bad debt allowance in the form of the $14 million of increased net debt expense versus the third quarter of 2019, coupled with $7 million of lease revenue reverse for tenants, that are accounted for on a cash basis per GAAP within the third quarter; two, over $20 million of short-term nonrecurring rental assistance; three, a $9 million decline in common area and ancillary revenue as well as percentage rents; four, a $4 million decline in parking income driven by protracted property closures and reduced parking utilization at our urban centers in New York City and Chicago primarily; five, interest expense increased $4 million due to a decline in capitalized interest; six, net operating income declined from the Hyatt Regency Hotel [Inaudible], it was about a $2 million decline; seven, a negative $0.03 per share dilutive impact from shares issued in the second quarter relating to our stock dividend issued in the second quarter.
Most of the results were better than the second quarter, but we were obviously adversely impacted in the quarter due to COVID in general and specifically due to the protracted California and New York City closures.
Some leases signed in the third quarter of note include Gucci, Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Ducati Paris at Scottsdale Fashion Square; Kids Empire and State 48 Brewery at SanTan; Barbarie's Grill at Danbury Fair; Starbucks at Fashion District Philadelphia; Madison Reed at 29th Street; Polestar at The Village at Corte Madera; finally, Lucid Motors at Scottsdale Fashion Square and Tysons Corner.
