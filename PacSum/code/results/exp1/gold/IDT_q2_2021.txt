We are successfully reducing the overhead in our traditional communications segment and redeploying those resources to support and accelerate the growth of our higher-margin businesses in the Fintech and net2phone-UCaaS segments.
The quarter's results were highlighted by year-over-year revenue expansion from our three higher-margin businesses, National Retail Solutions, BOSS Revolution Money Transfer and net2phone-UCaaS.
IDT delivered another strong quarter, including significant year-over-year increases in consolidated revenue, income from operations and EPS.
