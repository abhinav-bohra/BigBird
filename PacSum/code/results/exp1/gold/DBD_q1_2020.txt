While revenue was in line with our pre-COVID expectations, and we continue to deliver strong year-over-year improvements in profitability.
We are delivering significant margin increase across all three business lines, with services rising by 230 basis points, products expanding 280 basis points, and our software and gross margin increased by 1,280 basis points due to an easier comp, as well as better delivery and management of our labor costs.
