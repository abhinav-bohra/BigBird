As a reminder, discussions today on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude effects from unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments and any extraordinary reinstatement premiums and related commissions.
Our direct premiums earned growth of 15% in the third quarter was primarily driven by primary rate increases in Florida earning through the book.
We ended the third quarter with total revenue down 7.8% to $287.3 million, driven primarily by the realized gain on investments of $53.8 million in the third quarter of the prior year versus a $4.3 million realized gain in the current quarter.
