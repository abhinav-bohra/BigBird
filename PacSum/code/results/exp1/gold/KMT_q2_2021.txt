The improved year-over-year performance in our margin was primarily due to the positive effect of raw materials as expected, which contributed approximately 590 basis points, incremental simplification/modernization benefits, and temporary cost control actions, partially offset by lower volumes and associated under-absorption.
These solid results were driven by improving sequential sales, reflecting both market improvement and growth from our strategic initiatives, as well as increasing benefits from simplification/modernization.
The year-over-year improvement in EBITDA margin was driven by lower raw material costs, increasing benefits from simplification/modernization, and effective cost control actions.
