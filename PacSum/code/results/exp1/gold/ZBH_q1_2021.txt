Those high-priority markets and submarkets where ZB has a path to leadership, and we believe are right to win in markets like sports medicine, ASC and in the external closure market for us and each of these deals gives us a gap filling and, we believe, differentiated product portfolio to drive growth, and that's important to growth, but also drive additional confidence in our ASC business category and of course, inside of this active portfolio management phase, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental business that we discussed back in Q4.
I'm very proud of the ZB team for how they stood up and delivered against a backdrop of a whole lot of things that were absolutely out of their control and I know I talk a lot about the importance of our talent, our mission, our culture here at ZB and I can tell that each were absolutely critical for us in 2020 and continue to be in 2021 and well beyond and with that in mind, we've made some additional changes to our leadership team here very recently.
COVID clearly is not over, just as I stated a minute ago and I'm very confident we're going to continue to have surprises ahead and disruptions ahead, but based on what we saw at the end of Q1 and what we're seeing in the beginning of Q2 and coupling that with just the pace of vaccine rollouts right now, we're clearly moving in the right direction.
We're focused on what we're going to define as mission-centric M&A that is WAMGR accretive that would absolutely increase our weighted average market growth and does not disrupt our best-in-class margin profile and as you've seen, we've moved this forward already with selective tuck-in acquisitions that we did last year and that really does illustrate the strategy of work.
That will be the second topic and the third topic would just be around our long-term growth strategy, just reiterating our position there and how we believe that's going to drive value for our shareholders and stakeholders overall.
