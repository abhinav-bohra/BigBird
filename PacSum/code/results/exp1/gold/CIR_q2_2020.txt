While this year, we had the impact of COVID-19 on commercial Aerospace, although partially offset by the Virginia Class Submarine order for $9 million.
The $2 million of lower revenue in the Aerospace & Defense team delivered $3 million of incremental operating income, driven by pricing, productivity, and cost actions.
Our cost actions remain in line with the targets we laid out in our first-quarter earnings call, and our price actions across the company are coming in as expected.
