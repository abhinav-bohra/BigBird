We are also beyond grateful for the scientists who created the vaccines, the people that produce them, the government agencies who prioritize shot for our community, residents and associates, as well as CVS Health, Public Health Departments and other pharmacy partners who helped administer these life saving vaccines.
When the transaction closes, we expect to receive approximately $300 million in net cash proceeds which will strengthen Brookdale's liquidity position.
Early on we realized the importance of vaccines and we took a leadership role in successfully advocating for priority vaccine access for assisted living residents and associates and worked closely with public and private officials to improve the vaccine rollout.
