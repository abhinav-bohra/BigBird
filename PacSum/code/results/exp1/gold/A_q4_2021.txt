A year ago to our Agilent Investor Day, we raised our long-term annual growth outlook to the 5% to 7% range, while reaffirming our commitment to annual operating margin improvement and double-digit earnings per share growth.
Our NASD oligo business led the way with robust double-digit growth in the quarter and achieved full year revenues exceeding $225 million.
We continue to perform extremely well in Pharma, our largest market, growing 21%, driven by our Biopharma business.
The strong growth in our Chemical and Energy business continues as we delivered 11% growth in the quarter.
The strong expansion of our installed base in 2021 and increasing connect rates bodes well continued to strengthen our ACG business moving forward.
We expect another year of strong double-digit growth as the team continues to do a great job of increasing throughput with existing capacity.
