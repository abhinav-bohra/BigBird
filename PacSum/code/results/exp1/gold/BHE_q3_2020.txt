Improved profits and focused expense management resulted in non-GAAP earnings of $0.32 per share, which includes $1.3 million or $0.04 per share of COVID-related costs.
In Q3, we delivered revenue of $526 million, which was up 7% sequentially from Q2, supported by strong demand in our defense, semi-cap and telco sectors and improved manufacturing productivity.
Our new business pipeline continues to be strong across our targeted sectors and subsectors, and we remain very encouraged about the prospect for continued wins, where the outsourcing environment for both engineering and manufacturing projects remains favorable.
During the quarter, gross margin was positively impacted by higher revenues, which enabled improved leverage across our cost structure, increased productivity across our sites and lower sequential COVID-19-related costs.
After a challenging couple of quarters, I'm pleased to report that our manufacturing and engineering services operations have essentially returned to pre-COVID productivity levels, which has supported our improved results for Q3.
Overall, for the fourth quarter, we expect increased revenues from stronger demand and new programs in defense, industrials and telco to offset anticipated declines in medical as we pivot manufacturing from COVID-19-related therapeutic equipment to diagnostic, trauma and elective surgical devices.
And we had another strong quarter of bookings in Q3, where we awarded business that should represent over $200 million of future engineering and manufacturing revenue.
