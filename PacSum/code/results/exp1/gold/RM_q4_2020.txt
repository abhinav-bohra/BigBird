We generated $14.3 million net income or $1.28 of diluted earnings per share as a result of continued quality growth in our loan portfolio, a strong credit profile, disciplined expense management and low funding costs.
Our $150 million allowance for credit losses as of December 31 continues to compare quite favorably to our 30-plus day contractual delinquency of $60.5 million and includes a $30.4 million reserve for additional credit losses associated with COVID-19.
