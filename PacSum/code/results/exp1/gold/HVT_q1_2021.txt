Now looking at our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter, our inventories were $103.6 million, which was up $13.7 million over the December 31, 2020 balance and down $6.9 million versus the first quarter of last year's balance.
We're planning to increase our inventories as the production and product flow improves and are investing in additional warehouse capacities in our distribution network.
We're very pleased with the results of the first quarter and I'm encouraged with the continuing momentum that we're seeing with increased written sales, higher traffic and higher closing rates and average tickets.
We believe this trend will continue for 2021 because of the large backlog of orders, the very strong housing market, the government cash subsidies and the increased demand for furniture and other home related products.
While we do not know how long we will see these dramatic increases in incoming orders, we believe that the importance and the value of the home has risen dramatically in the past year.
