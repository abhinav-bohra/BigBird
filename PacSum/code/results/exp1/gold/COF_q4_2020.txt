The increase was largely driven by higher card loan revenue margin as strong credit results led to lower suppression, the impact of third and fourth-quarter deposit pricing actions and a modest decline in our cash balance, which was partially offset by lower yields on cash and securities.
Our liquidity reserves from cash, securities and Federal Home Loan Bank capacity declined slightly from the third quarter to end the year at approximately $144 billion, including about $41 billion in cash driven by continued strong deposits.
At the end of the fourth quarter, Domestic Card ending loan balances were down $20.1 billion or 17% year over year, driven by three factors: cautious consumer behavior, reduced spending and demand for new credit, and drove payment rates to historically high levels.
The revenue margin was up 121 basis points year over year to 16.91%, largely driven by two factors: strong credit drove lower revenue suppression; and year over year, net interchange revenue in the numerator of the margin is essentially flat, while average loan balances, the denominator of the margin calculation, are down 16%.
The Domestic Card charge-off rate for the quarter was 2.69%, a 163-basis-point improvement year over year and a 95-basis-point improvement from the sequential quarter.
Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.7% at the end of the fourth quarter, up 70 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points higher than a year ago.
