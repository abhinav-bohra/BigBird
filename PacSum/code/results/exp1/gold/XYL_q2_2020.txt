You will have seen our announced wins in Telangana, India and with Anglian Water in the U.K. The Telangana irrigation project is our largest win in the country to date, and we do anticipate it will generate roughly $115 million in revenue over the next two to three years.
Notably, China grew 6% in the quarter as the utility end market returned to nearly pre-pandemic levels, and industrial and commercial businesses began to modestly recover.
As we continue to feel the near-term impacts from COVID-19 across the emerging markets, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects for the water sector.
The applied water segment's orders declined 17% in the quarter, while revenue declined 13% as site restrictions continue to impact customers across industrial, commercial and residential end markets.
We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and total liquidity of roughly $2.4 billion driven by the $1 billion green bond offering we issued in June as well as strong cash flow performance in the quarter.
While U.S. sales were impacted by double-digit declines in the dewatering business, Western Europe revenues were flat in the quarter, showing resilience and some early signs of recovery, especially with our utility customers.
As we noted last quarter, we expect utilities to continue to remain resilient as they focus on maintaining their critical infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment.
This performance was largely driven by the $115 million deal we won in India which is expected to deliver revenue beginning late this year and over the next three years.
