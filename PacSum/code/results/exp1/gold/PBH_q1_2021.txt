By segment, in North America, revenues were essentially flat, positively impacted by the Women's Health, Oral Care, and Skin categories, but offset by lower Cough and Cold, Eye & Ear Care, and GI shipments, as categories we participate in faced declines in incidence levels and usage rates related to COVID-19.
This decline was attributable to both a difficult comparison in the prior year for a number of products as well as significantly lower sales of Hydralyte in Australia, as a result of COVID-19's impact to lowering both general consumer illness and activities such as athletics.
Solid earnings per share growth was attributable to positive contributions across our operating expense line as well as lower interest expense and share count from our strong free cash flow and strategic capital allocation.
