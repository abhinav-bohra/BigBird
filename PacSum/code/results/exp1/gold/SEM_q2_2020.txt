In our critical illness recovery hospitals, we have held steady during the second quarter on census and our occupancy in light of some of the challenges COVID presents, while our cost of care has increased, we have seen increased occupancy and revenues every month throughout the pandemic.
We recorded $55 million in other operating income in the second quarter related to payments received under the provider relief funds, $54.2 million was recorded with our other activities and 800,000 was recorded in the Concentra segments.
Our outpatient rehabilitation volumes and revenues were down year over year 48% and 44% respectively in the month of April and May resulting in adjusted EBITDA losses in both of those months in our outpatient rehab segment.
Volume and revenue shortfalls in June compared to prior year were 19.7% and 17.8% respectively which was a significant improvement from April and May and we experienced positive adjusted EBITDA in June.
