For the year, excluding our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in June of 2021, we increased net sales by 11% to $3.3 billion, which was in line with our previous guidance.
Our strategic execution and ability to effectively manage the challenges of the global pandemic enabled us to capitalize on the strength of the lithium and bromine markets and generate results that exceeded expectations.
We introduced this slide early last year to lay out our 2021 objectives designed to support the four pillars of our strategy: to grow profitably, to maximize productivity, to invest with discipline, and to advance sustainability.
The fourth-quarter net loss attributable to Albemarle was $4 million, reflecting an increased cost estimate to construct our Kemerton lithium hydroxide plant due to anticipated cost overruns from the impact of pandemic-related issues on the supply chain and labor.
La Negra 3 and 4 is currently in commercial qualification, and we expect to start realizing first sales from this facility in the second quarter.
Looking ahead, our outlook for 2022 has improved based primarily on favorable market conditions for lithium and bromine.
