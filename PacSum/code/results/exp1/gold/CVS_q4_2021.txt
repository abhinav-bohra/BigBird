Our forecast reflects increased volume from COVID testing and front store sales in our retail business relative to our forecast at investor day, offset by the accelerated timing of vaccine boosters pulled into the fourth quarter of 2021.
We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share expectations for the fourth quarter in a row delivering $1.98 adjusted earnings per share in the final quarter of 2021 and $8.40 adjusted earnings per share for the full year.
Our success is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs, including medical and pharmacy, and products and services that utilize CVS Health capabilities, such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs.
Adjusted operating income of 510 million grew by over 230% year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments and improved underlying performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical costs compared to prior year.
Fourth quarter adjusted revenue of 20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year over year, driven by membership growth in our government services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.
