We had a net loss of $17 million for the third quarter or a diluted loss per share of $0.04 compared to a net loss of $89 million for the prior-year quarter primarily driven by the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment, lower transition-related costs, preferred dividends included in the prior-year period and lower interest expense partially offset by the call premium related to the partial redemption of the senior secured notes.
Adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $197 million, an increase of 27% primarily driven by the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustments reflected in the corporate segment along with lower overall operating costs driven primarily by lower net personnel expenses due to ongoing cost management initiatives.
These headwinds include lower usage revenues driven by the impact of COVID-19 of approximately $6 million, lower royalty revenues from the wind down of the Data.com partnership of approximately $6 million, a decision we made in the second half of 2019 to make structural changes within the legacy credibility business of $3 million and the shift of a government contract from Q3 to Q4 of $4 million.
Other third-quarter renewals include a multiyear enterprise license deal with HSBC supporting their data and analytics strategy, a Global 500 office supply retailer who turned to Dun & Bradstreet to help them manage fraud risk and an expanded multiyear relationship with a multibillion-dollar private shipping supplies company.
