Quarterly gross margin remained strong at 49.6% primarily driven by higher average selling prices and fewer promotions in our direct-to-consumer business, partially offset by increases in freight costs.
Further, the global supply chain disruptions, including the congestion at ports around the world, especially in the United States and the COVID-19 related closures of factories in South Vietnam where we manufacture a limited amount of our product have delayed our ability to ship goods.
Skechers direct-to-consumer business achieved the highest quarterly sales gains, increasing 44%, driven by a 61% increase in our international business and a 35% increase in our domestic business.
Skechers third quarter revenue of $1.55 billion was a new record for the period and a remarkable achievement given the ongoing global supply chain disruptions just discussed.
The third quarter sales gain of 19% was the result of a 20% increase in our domestic business and a 19% increase in our international business, which represented 58% of our total sales for the period.
Importantly, unit volume improved 17% with an average selling price per unit increase of 23%, reflective of our less promotional stance, the success of our Comfort Technology product and a return to a more normal lifestyle and shopping behavior.
Without them we wouldn't have achieved our strong results and do what we do best; design, deliver, and market what we believe is the most comfortable and innovative footwear available today.
