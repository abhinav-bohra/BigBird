For the third quarter, we generated record adjusted pre-tax title earnings of $528 million compared with $407 million in the year ago quarter and a 21.2% adjusted pre-tax title margin compared with an 18.6% in the third quarter of 2019, and our best since the third quarter of 2003.
We had a 40% increase in direct orders closed, driven by an 87% increase in daily refinance orders closed and 8% increase in daily purchase orders closed offset by a 16% decrease in total commercial orders closed.
As Randy mentioned, the third quarter was a record quarter for adjusted pre-tax title earnings and produced our best quarterly adjusted pre-tax title margin since the third quarter of 2003, as we benefited from the delayed spring selling season and sustained momentum in refinance.
Total commercial revenue was $216 million compared with the year ago quarter of $301 million due to the 16% decrease in closed orders and a 14% decline in total commercial fee per file.
