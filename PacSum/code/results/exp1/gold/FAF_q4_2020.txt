Investment income within Title Insurance and Services segment was $52 million, down 26% primarily due to the impact of the decline in short-term interest rates on the investment portfolio and cash balances, partially offset by higher interest income from the company's warehouse lending business.
Revenues in our Title Insurance segment were up 26% in the fourth quarter and we effectively managed our expenses, achieving a 53% success ratio, which contributed to a pre-tax margin of 18.9%.
As we disclosed in January, our Property and Casualty business entered into a book transfer agreement, which provide qualifying agents and customers an opportunity to easily transfer their policies.
This quarter, our investment income benefited from a $4.4 million catch-up related to our Warehouse Lending business On a go-forward basis, we expect investment income to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $45 million per quarter with short-term rates at current levels.
