These quarterly results and our improved outlook for the balance of the year resulted in our raising key components of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to be at 13.8% and growth in AFFO per share of 11.6%.
We now have had three successive quarters of demand at or near all-time records, and projected market level rent growth has risen from the 10% range to the mid-teens percent nationally and in some submarkets as high as 35%.
During the quarter, we began roughly $350 million of new developments with expected strong value creation and IRRs, and we raised our full year guidance on starts once again.
