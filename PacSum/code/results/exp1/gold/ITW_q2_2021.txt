While the pace of raw material cost increases accelerated in the second quarter, our businesses have been active in implementing pricing actions in response to rising raw material costs since early in the year, consistent with our strategy to cover raw material cost inflation with price adjustments on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
In this strong demand environment and in the face of very challenging supply conditions, our teams around the world leveraged our long-held close to the customer manufacturing and supply chain approach, and the benefits of staying fully staffed and invested through our winter recovery positioning, to continue providing world-class service levels to our customers while also continuing to execute on our long-term strategy to achieve and sustain ITW's full potential performance.
Operating margin of 24.3% improved 680 basis points on strong volume leverage, along with 150 basis points of benefits from our enterprise initiatives.
Speaking of price/cost, price/cost headwind to margin percentage in the quarter was 120 basis points.
In the second quarter, we saw continued recovery momentum across our portfolio, and we delivered strong operational execution and financial results.
