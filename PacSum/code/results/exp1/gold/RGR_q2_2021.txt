Since the onset of COVID-19 in March of 2020, we remain proactive in maintaining the health and safety of our employees and mitigating its impact on our business, by providing all hourly employees with an additional two weeks of paid time off in 2020 and an additional week in 2021, providing cash and other incentives for employees to become fully vaccinated, holding multiple on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics at our manufacturing facilities, reducing hiring in early 2020 to help maintain the health and safety of employees and the cleanliness of our facilities, encouraging employees to continue to work remotely wherever possible and maintaining social distancing throughout each manufacturing facility, including in every manufacturing cell, confidentially communicating with and assisting employees with potential health issues through our dedicated facility nurses, restricting visitor access to minimize the introduction of new people to the factory environment, implementing additional cleaning, sanitizing and improved ventilation and other health and safety processes to maintain a clean and safe workplace, providing all employees with multiple face mask coverings and other personal protective equipment and currently mandating their use by unvaccinated and at-risk individuals at all times in our facilities and issuing periodic guidance and reminders to all associates to encourage them to engage in safe and responsible behaviors.
