Finally, orders in the quarter were $35 million, driven by strong international refining awards in Asia and defense in the United States.
In the quarter, we had a quick turn material order, which made up approximately half -- a little over half of the revenue in the Navy.
As Jeff had mentioned in his remarks, the company completed a large material-only order for a defense customer, which required very little conversion resources.
Sales in the defense, the Navy market were $9.4 million in the quarter.
Gross profit was $9.3 million, slightly off the $9.7 million last year, and gross margins were down 20.7% versus 22.9% last year, again, impacted by COVID-19 in the first quarter.
Q2 net income was $2.7 million or $0.27 per share, up from $1.2 million or $0.12 per share last year.
Order level in the quarter was strong, especially given the state of crude oil refining and petrochemical markets.
In particular, we are focused on reducing our material costs, hiring and quickly onboarding welders, differentiating our company from our competitors in the defense industry through superior execution and leveraging IT tools to increase the productivity of our team.
