Based on this quarter's credit performance and the improving economic outlook, we reduced our allowance for credit losses by $142 million more than net charge-offs, while still maintaining one of the strongest allowance to loan ratios in the industry at 2.44%.
Similar to prior quarters, the impact from historically low long term interest rates was offset by our cash management strategies, lower deposit costs and higher average notional values of active loan hedges.
