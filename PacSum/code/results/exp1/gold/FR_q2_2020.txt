In its second quarter preliminary flash report, CBRE reported 19 million square feet of net absorption versus 56 million square feet of completion.
Second quarter 2020 FFO includes approximately $500,000 of cash bad debt expense related to tenant accounts receivable and $400,000 of non-cash bad debt expense related to the write-off of certain deferred rent receivables.
As of yesterday, we have collected 98% of 2Q monthly rental billings and so far, we've collected 97% of July billings, which is ahead of the pace we experienced in the second quarter.
In addition, the denominator reflects the total monthly rental billings and is not reduced for any reserves for bad debt expense or rent deferrals.
