Fifth, as part of our 2022 general rate case, we recently reached an agreement that subject to OPC final approval will resolve the annual revenue requirement, average rate based, capital ratios, and a corresponding increase in customer prices.
Based on recent trends in our service territory, primarily driven by industrial growth, and anticipated distributed energy resources growth, including transportation, electrification adoption, we are raising our long-term growth guidance from 1% to 1.5%.
Industrial deliveries increased 8.5% weather adjusted as our service territory continues to attract growth from high tech and digital customers, including data centers, customer expansion, and new site development activity, all point to strong growth in the sector.
These investments establish the foundation for Intelligent Energy Network that enables the integration of greater amounts of renewable energy, distributed energy resources, and increases system flexibility, and resiliency.
Also, in collaboration with customers and stakeholders, we issued our inaugural Distributed System Plan focused on modernizing our grid to accelerate distributed energy resources, and maximize grid benefits for all customers and community members.
