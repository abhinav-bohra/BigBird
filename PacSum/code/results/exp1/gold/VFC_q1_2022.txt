Our global DTC business delivered high single-digit growth relative to prior peak levels driven by a strong acceleration from our brick and mortar stores in the US and continued strength in our digital.
In EMEA despite the continued impact of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, the Vans business grew 125% this quarter representing 30% growth relative to fiscal 2020, with strength across all major markets as stores reopened throughout the region.
Strong sell-through trends and clean channel inventory levels from the past year are now translating into stronger fall '21 and spring '22 order books supporting an improving outlook for our wholesale business for this year and beyond.
