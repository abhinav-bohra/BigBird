The company recorded $0.79 in fully diluted GAAP earnings per share for the third quarter, excluding $0.04 per share for litigation reserve expense, net of tax effect and $0.02 per share for acquisition-related expenses, net of tax effect.
The decrease in the provision for credit losses during the third quarter as compared to the prior two quarters was due to improving economic conditions, modest levels of delinquent nonperforming loans, a decrease in loans outstanding, low levels of net charge-offs and a large decrease in the number and amount of the company's loan balances subject to borrow forbearance.
The increase in total revenues between the periods was driven by increases in net interest income, banking-related noninterest revenues and noninterest revenues derived from our financial services businesses.
The very large increase in total assets and average interest earning assets over the prior 12 months was driven by the second quarter 2020 acquisition of Steuben Trust Corporation and large inflows of government stimulus-related funding in PPP originations.
Net interest income was up $1.7 million or 1.9% between comparable annual quarters, driven by a $2.15 billion or 21.9% increase in average assets between the periods, offset in part by a 61-basis point decrease in net interest margin.
