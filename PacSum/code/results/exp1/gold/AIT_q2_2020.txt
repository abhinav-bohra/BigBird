As highlighted in recent quarters, our leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control and now automation puts us in a unique position to capture greater share organically as our customers outsource their technical MRO and production infrastructure needs.
Results include a non-cash LIFO charge during the quarter of approximately $1.9 million, which compared favorably to prior year LIFO expense of $2.7 million, resulting in a roughly 9 point -- basis point positive impact year-over-year.
This trend should supplement a strong cross-selling opportunity here at Applied that remains in the early innings, and is focused on expanding the reach of our fluid power, flow control, consumables and automation solutions across our embedded service center network customer base.
We also entered our second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet, having reduced outstanding debt by $115 million over two years, post our acquisition of FCX, with net leverage down to our stated target of 2.5 times.
To summarize, we are managing effectively in a slow and uncertain end market environment with timely execution of our recent cost initiatives, continued solid gross margin performance and another positive quarter of cash generation.
After seeing some stabilization during October and November, customer activity was unusually weak during December and remained subdued with organic sales trending down in the mid-single digits year-over-year, so far in January.
On an organic basis, segment sales declined 4.9% reflecting weaker flow control sales and slower activity across our industrial OEM customer base, as well as the remaining year-over-year drag from the large project referenced in prior quarters.
Our second quarter was characterized by cost discipline, margin control and solid cash generation within a persistent soft end market backdrop.
