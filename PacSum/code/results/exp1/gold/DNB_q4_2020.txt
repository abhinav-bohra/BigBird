Full-year adjusted EBITDA for the total company was $715 million, an increase of 30%, primarily driven by $134 million of lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustments reflected in the corporate segment, which has a 25 percentage point impact on the year-over-year growth; along with lower net personnel, travel, and marketing cost of approximately $55 million in the current year period, primarily resulting from ongoing cost management efforts; partially offset by increased technology cost of approximately $42 million related to data processing and data acquisition cost.
These headwinds include Lower usage revenues primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 of approximately $8 million; lower royalty revenues from the wind-down of the Data.com partnership of approximately $6 million; a decision we made in the second half of 2019 to make structural changes within legacy Credibility solution of $1 million; partially offset by the shift of $4 million of government revenues from the third quarter.
This was primarily driven by prior year's expense of $172 million related to the make-whole provision associated with the Series A preferred stock, which was redeemed as a result of the IPO, also the net impact of the lower deferred revenue adjustment of $39 million, as well as a higher non-operating gain of approximately $24 million related to the fair value adjustment of a foreign currency pilot.
These headwinds include lower usage revenues, primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19, of approximately $20 million; lower royalty revenues from the wind-down of the Data.com partnership of approximately $20 million; a decision we made in the second half of 2019 to make structural changes within legacy Credibility solution of $11 million; and Worldwide Network and nonrecurring revenues of $6 million.

In the midst of a challenging new environment, we're able to successfully complete our IPO, signed a definitive agreement to acquire Bisnode, and continued to transform our business with significant enhancements for our technology, data, and analytics, which are ultimately laying the foundation for our ability to execute on our near- and long-term growth strategies.
But the remainder of the improvement is primarily due to lower overall operating costs, driven by ongoing cost management initiatives, including lower net personnel expenses, partially offset by increased public company cost.
