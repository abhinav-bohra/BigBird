Although North American industry production was down 4% according to the third party estimates, light truck production was up 5% year-over-year and volumes on our core platforms increased 9% year-over-year.
Our current guidance remains as follows: From a revenue standpoint, $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion and an adjusted EBITDA basis, $850 million to $925 million and adjusted free cash flow of $300 million to $400 million.
The increase in our revenues on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects the recovery from COVID-19 related industry shutdowns that we experienced last year.
AAM's partnership with REE intends to incorporate our lightweight highly efficient next-generation electric drive units which feature fully integrated high speed motors and inverters into REE's highly modular technology that enables a fully flat EV chassis for multiple commercial vehicle applications.
In addition to benefiting from higher production level, our intense focus on optimizing the business and flexing our cost structure to align with the global market demand contributed greatly to our performance in the first quarter of 2021.
