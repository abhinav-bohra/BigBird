Turning to Slide 3, I will provide an update on our portfolio transformation and will review how our focus on those strategic actions, balanced capital allocation, and innovation-led growth position us extremely well heading into 2022 to continue unlocking value for our shareholders, innovating for our customers, and creating opportunity for our employees.
The 10% increase in volume for the year consists of gains in all three reporting segments and within all nine business lines, reflecting robust global customer demand in secular growth areas, such as electronics and water, along with recovery in end markets negatively impacted by the pandemic in prior year, such as automotive, commercial construction, and select industrial markets.
From a segment perspective, E&I delivered 10% operating EBITDA growth on volume gains and earnings uplift from Laird, which more than offset raw material and logistics segments, as well as start-up costs associated with our Kapton capacity expansion.
Customer demand was broad-based across the portfolio, led by greater than 20% volume growth in semiconductor technologies and high teens volume growth in Water.
In addition, our board has also authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program, which enables us to continue returning value to our shareholders as we expect to complete the remaining 375 million under our existing authorization in the first quarter, ahead of the planned expiration.
Our top-line performance also reflects significant pricing actions we took to offset $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter.
Overall sales growth was broad-based and reflects double-digit organic growth in all four regions and high-single-digit to double-digit organic growth in all three reporting segments.
In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 7% as pricing gains and volume growth more than offset higher raw material and logistics costs.
