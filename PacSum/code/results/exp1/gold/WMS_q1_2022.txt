We have issued several price increases since late last year to cover inflationary cost pressure, and we'll continue to use our leading market position in that respect as well as ADS and Infiltrator's scale position in material procurement and recycling operations to procure material at the best possible cost and availability.
There are additional headwinds related to driver availability, an increase in the use of common carrier and an increase in common carrier rates that we are working to offset.
The price increases we pushed into the market are largely covering material, and we continue to raise prices in line with these material increases as well as reprice quotes over 30 days old to ensure we're recovering the sequentially higher cost.
