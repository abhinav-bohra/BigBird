Yet, given the better than expected year-to-date performance and momentum exiting the quarter, we now expect total sales growth to be in the high teens versus our previous guidance of mid-teens.
In TAVR, second quarter global sales were $902 million, up 48% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period or 14% on a two year compounded annual basis.
These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations.
We are pleased to report better than expected second quarter sales of $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis from a year ago period.
In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Surgical Structure Heart guidance, we now expect underlying sales growth in the mid-teens versus our previous expectation of high-single-digit growth.
For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, for TAVR $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million, for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million, and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million.
We experienced strong year-over-year adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves including continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit, as well as our new MITRIS RESILIA surgical mitral valve, which was launched in Japan in the second quarter.
We continue to be optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated.
We now expect 2021 TMTT sales of $80 million to $100 million, up from our previous sales guidance of $80 million.
