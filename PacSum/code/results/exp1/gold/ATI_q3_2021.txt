EPS improve to $0.35 per share when you factor in the net positive impacts from settling our recent labor strike, including the benefits from our new collective bargaining agreement, and the lingering strike-related costs as well as the gain from the Flowform Products divestiture.
Our success is due in equal parts to accelerated rates of recovery in our diverse end markets, our significant business restructuring and transformation efforts and the perseverance of the ATI team.
Our airframe business expanded sequentially for two reasons: first, post-strike recovery efforts in our SRP business; and second, the increasing orders associated with our new European OEM long-term agreement.
Lastly, we continue to make progress on strategically transforming our Specialty Rolled Products business, taking deliberate actions to create a competitive cost structure.
