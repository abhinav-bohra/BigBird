We delivered the $285 million Asurion project on budget and ahead of schedule; we acquired a $683 million portfolio of office properties with attractive long-term returns; since announcing the acquisition, we have sold $163 million of noncore properties at attractive valuations; we raised our quarterly dividend over 4%; we increased the midpoint of our FFO outlook $0.165 per share since the beginning of the year; and we did all this while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDAre ratio of 5.6 times.
While the progression of the pandemic and the resulting impact on office utilization remain difficult to predict, customers and prospects fortunately continue to sign leases and our parking revenues continue to recover nicely.
Moving to investments, as we previously disclosed, we acquired the office portfolio from PAC in late July for a total investment of $683 million, including planned near-term building improvements.
