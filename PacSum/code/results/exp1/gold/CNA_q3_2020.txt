As we have done in previous years, we completed our annual Life & Group review in the quarter, which importantly includes the long-term care gross premium valuation or GPV analysis of our active life reserves.
Despite these unprecedented times, CNA continues to operate effectively, as our underlying business performance improved once again this quarter as evidenced by the ongoing acceleration in rate achievement, as well as higher overall growth and growth in new business.
The underlying loss ratio improvement consisted of only 0.5 point benefit due to lower frequency from the ongoing economic downturn, with most of the improvement driven by our International business, which has steadily returned to profitability as a result of our reunderwriting efforts in our London operation over the last 18 months.
Since long-term care reserves are discounted, these changes reflect our ongoing prudent approach to reserving and our steadfast resolve to protect our capital and earnings in an ongoing low interest rate environment.
As a reminder, our annual Life & Group reserve reviews include the long-term care gross premium valuation or GPV of our active life reserves, as well as the long-term care claim reserve analysis.
