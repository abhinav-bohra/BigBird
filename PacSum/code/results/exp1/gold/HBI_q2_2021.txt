With respect to our outlook, we raised our second half and full year expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share to reflect stronger-than-expected momentum in our business as well as benefits from the Child Tax Credit Payments in the U.S. What's most encouraging to me about our second half outlook, despite higher-than-expected inflation, we're well positioned to generate higher operating profit dollars while continuing to execute against our brand investment strategy.
However, I am encouraged by the progress we've made, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we execute our Full Potential plan to generate higher, more consistent levels of revenue and profit growth.
These risks include those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by governmental or regulatory authorities to combat the pandemic on our business and our operations as well as the business and operations of the consumer, our customers, suppliers, business partners and labor force.
Revenue, operating profit, operating margin and earnings per share all exceeded the high end of our guidance range.
Looking at the second quarter, we delivered strong results despite the increasingly challenged global environment and higher levels of inflation.
First, our strong second quarter performance and our increased outlook for the remainder of the year; and second, a brief update on our Full Potential plan.
In addition to the strong underlying performance of our brands, the category experienced above-average growth due to certain transitory items such as retailer inventory restocking, government stimulus and pent-up consumer demand.
And In International, sales were 11% higher than 2019 with double-digit growth in Champion and high single-digit growth in innerwear in spite of COVID headwinds around the world.
Over this time period, we gained 160 basis points of market share with gains in each product category across basics and intimates.
