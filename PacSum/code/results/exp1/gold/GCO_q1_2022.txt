Other highlights include hitting our highest store traffic numbers compared to pre-pandemic level as the vaccine rollout increased shoppers' confidence to return to physical stores, increasing the gross margin of almost 500 basis points compared to last year as our merchandise assortments and inventory management continued to fuel strong full-price selling, leveraging SG&A significantly compared to pre-pandemic levels, and achieving greater capital efficiencies by managing inventories and capital spending effectively leading to a healthy balance sheet and solid cash position.
Next, higher operating profit, combined with pre-pandemic share repurchases delivered outstanding Q1 earnings per share of $0.79, compared with a loss of $3.65 last year with positive earnings per share of $0.33 two years ago, all on an adjusted basis.
First, revenue and operating profit exceeded pre-pandemic levels, increasing 9% and 125%, respectively, over Q1 Fiscal '20 two years ago, even with our stores opened for a little less than 90% of the possible operating days in the quarter, given closures primarily in the U.K. and Canada.
These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expense and the expansion of our wholesale volume, which should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses, coupled with the impact of our cost reduction initiative once our business normalizes post-pandemic.
In addition, Journeys' store team executed with excellence, achieving much higher conversion rates and increased transaction size, capitalizing on improving store traffic to drive store revenue above pre-pandemic levels.
