For example, we anticipate that 2021 will continue to be impacted by pandemic headwinds, including inventory destocking, which we expect will wind down as we move through the second quarter and to be largely behind us as we move into the second half of the year.
Aerospace sales of $147 million were down more than 59% compared to the first quarter of last year, which included sales before the effects of the pandemic began to dramatically impact Commercial Aerospace.
To state this succinctly, we expect to achieve strong, mid-teens plus operating margins, with sales of approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, and we are targeting to exceed prior peak margins when we return to previous peak sales levels.
These numbers reflect the beginning of what we expect will be a gradual and steady recovery over the coming quarters as the world emerges from the economic effects of the pandemic and regains its confidence in air travel once again.
Throughout the pandemic, we have maintained a strong focus on cash, and in the first quarter, our free cash flow was a use of $6 million compared to a use of $19 million in Q1, 2020.
Despite significantly lower sales, we continue to tightly manage cash by controlling spending, which includes capital expenditures.
