We are pleased with the performance and solid results in the second quarter, including adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, which represents a 32% sequential improvement and reflects our continued transformation progress.
Our second quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 31.4%, primarily due to OE sales decline and related under absorption, including the previously mentioned COVID impact, partially offset by a 2% mix shift toward higher-margin aftermarket sales.
To date, actual spending in this area is still very [Technical Issues] but we expect it to grow substantially in the quarters and years ahead based on the commitments of our customers -- the commitments that our customers are making as well as from the potential for increased regulation and costs associated with emissions.
We estimate that even before the recent increased awareness driven by the global pandemic, Flowserve is delivering $100 million to $150 million annually of equipment and services into energy transition-related work, including areas like energy efficiency enhancements, upgrades, retrofits, carbon and emissions reductions, solar power facilities, biofriendly processes and lithium and hydrogen work.
In addition, the quality of our earnings also improved, with after-tax adjusted items declining from $61 million in the prior year period to just $3 million this quarter.
The higher level of bookings and our improved operational performance have provided us the confidence to raise our outlook further for the full year.
