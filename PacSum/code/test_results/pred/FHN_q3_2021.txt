Moving to slide 9, net interest income was down $5 million linked quarter given the expected decrease tied to lower merger accretion and PPP portfolio balances, core net interest income was up 1% as the benefit of lower deposit cost, day count, commercial loan growth, and higher investment portfolio income was partially offset by continued declines in consumer loan balances and overall loan spread compression, given the continued reductions in LIBOR and the competitive landscape.
We delivered earnings per share of $0.50 a share and a return on tangible common equity of over 18% on an adjusted basis, despite the near-term headwinds that the industry is facing with continued pressure on short-term rates and strong competition given growing levels of excess liquidity and muted loan demand.
We generated PPNR of $284 million as underlying improvement in core net interest income and traditional banking fees was masked by the impact of expected declines in net merger-related and PPP non net interest income along with lower fixed income and mortgage banking fees.
And while we expected total fees to be down given relatively healthy levels of fixed income and mortgage banking fees last quarter, we also saw a return to more normalized levels in traditional banking fees, which were up 2% in the quarter with particular strength in wealth on strong annuity sales.
And despite the difficult decision to delay the systems integration until February of next year, we continue to execute on the objectives of the MOE, with strong progress on integrating systems and aligning products and capabilities, including piloting a new digital platform for treasury services, launching new relationship and banker profitability tools, and completing the first round of banking center consolidations.
This reflected anticipated declines in other non-interest income and fixed income and mortgage that were partially offset by growth in brokerage trust and insurance tied to higher annuity sales, as well as higher service charges and fees as an increase in transaction volume and higher leasing income tied to terminations helped to mitigate the impact of a recent change in our NSF pricing structure.
