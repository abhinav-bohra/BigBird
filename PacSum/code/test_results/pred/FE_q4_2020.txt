Taking appropriate actions to address our recent challenges and fostering a strong culture of compliance, ethics and integrity, we are deeply committed to creating a culture in which compliance is endemic in second nature and where our leaders prioritize and encourage open and transparent communications with all of our stakeholders.
Participants in today's call include our President and acting Chief Executive Officer, Steve Strah; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jon Taylor; and our Executive Director and independent Board member, Chris Pappas.
Because we have a lot of ground to cover today, including: our solid operational performance last year, even in the face of the pandemic; our strategy for 2021 and beyond, including our commitment to building shareholder value; and the work we're doing to position the company for the future.
