Lease rates for our non-same-store portfolio, which includes strong performance from our Class B suburban communities, grew over 2% during the quarter on a blended basis, comprised of 2.6% of renewal lease rate growth and 1% of new lease rate growth.

While the economic shutdown has impacted the original expected pace of leases, we averaged approximately 16 leases per month during the second quarter and expect to reach breakeven levels of occupancy by year-end, followed by steady quarterly NOI growth thereafter.
Overall, same-store NOI declined 4.5% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 3.5% on a cash basis, due to the same-store office NOI decline of 4.8% on a GAAP basis and 3.7% on a cash basis as well as bad debt expenses related to COVID-19 of approximately $720,000.
