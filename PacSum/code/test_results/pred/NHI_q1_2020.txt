In April, NHI received 99.7% of its contractual rent, and so far in May, we have collected approximately 94%, which is in line with our expectations as we typically see a portion of collections through the 15th of the month depending on underlying lease terms.
We had a total of 192 active resident cases, which included 97 cases in our SNFs, 40 cases in the skilled nursing wings at our CCRCs and senior living campuses, and 55 cases at our senior housing properties.
For the quarter ending March 31, cash NOI increased 9.2% to $76.3 million compared to $69.8 million in the prior year.
