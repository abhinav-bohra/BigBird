As Al mentioned, our first quarter fiscal 2022 results surpassed our initial expectations and the strong results reflect the flexibility of our global business model, our strong presence in each region and the hard work and dedication of each and every one of our employees who as we like to say at Unifi are working today for the good of tomorrow.
In fiscal Q1, the volatility in the market was driven by the rising freight costs from China, the uncertainty in the exchange rate and the rising cost of textured yarn and Asia, all of which has increased the local market price for textured yarn.
Alongside our focus on meeting customers' expectations, the growing demand for our core products and product lines in each region contributed to the increased revenues, which of course naturally translated into significant year-over-year profit growth.
