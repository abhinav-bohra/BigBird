We generated record year-to-date free cash flow of $1.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year over year, putting us well ahead of the original outlook we announced last October.
We significantly expanded our non-GAAP gross and operating margins, driving our year-to-date non-GAAP operating profit and earnings per share, up 28% and 27% year over year, respectively.
Based on the strength of our Q3 performance and our confidence about our momentum in the market, we are again raising our fiscal year 2021 earnings per share and free cash flow outlook, and we are also resuming stock repurchases.
We delivered a very impressive third quarter at HPE with strong orders growth, expanded margins, and record free cash flow.
Our Q3 orders were up strong double digits year over year, and our year-to-date order volume has increased 11%, showing the strength of our edge-to-cloud offerings.
Building on the strength from the last quarter, we delivered Q3 revenues of $6.9 billion, up 3% from the prior quarter and in line with normal sequential seasonality, also in line with our outlook that factored in some of the expected supply chain constraints we flagged.
Our intelligent edge business accelerated its momentum again in Q3, with 23% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by a record number of new orders.
