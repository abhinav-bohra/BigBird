Results for the quarter included one month of Attain operations from the acquisition date of March 1st, which added approximately $20 million of revenue and $3 million of operating income after the expense related to amortization of intangible assets.
Our better-than-expected results were driven by the high level of COVID response work revenue in the U.S. segments and employment services work in Australia, which experienced higher-than-expected volumes of activities.
The segment operating income margin was 18.5% and reflects better-than-expected operating results for the COVID response programs that offset the significant revenue and profit headwinds to some core programs related to the pandemic.
