We generated strong year to date free cash flow of over $800 million and have increased our full year free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our prior forecast of $650 million to $750 million.
Higher earnings reflect improved performance in aftermaths from higher rental, used vehicle sales and lease results, as well as a declining depreciation expense impact related to prior residual value estimate changes.
Our full year forecast reflects an estimated cash flow benefit of $400 million from deferred capital expenditures due to OEM delivery delays as well as record proceeds from the sale of our used vehicles.
Unprecedented challenges impacting labor, supply chains and truck production are providing us with additional growth opportunities because they help drive companies to make long term outsourcing decisions.
