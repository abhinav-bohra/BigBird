We reported fourth quarter revenue of $140.7 million, which was our best quarterly performance ever, an operating margin of 57% and net income of $2.71 per share.
But just to make clear that our very strong quarter was not simply a matter of transaction timing, our earnings per share for the quarter was greater than the analyst consensus forecast for the fourth quarter and the next four quarters ahead combined.
Our interest expense for the year was $15.5 million, well below last year's level, as we benefited from a lower interest rate premium post our refinancing last year, lower market interest rate levels, reduced debt outstanding, and the absence of a refinancing charge.
In sum, we had a very strong finish to the year, resulting in very respectable pandemic year results on the top and bottom line, all consistent with our commentary on the past couple of quarterly investor calls.
