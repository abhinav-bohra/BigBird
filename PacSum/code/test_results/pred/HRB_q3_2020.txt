When we talked with you last quarter, we outlined our strategic objectives to digitally enable every aspect of our business to deliver our expertise to consumers in new and exciting ways, and we're seeing some positive results.
Then I'll review our tax season to date results, discuss our expectations for the second half of the season and provide an update on small business.
While we're excited about the progress we're making in our product and in the value we're delivering for our clients, we believe we can improve both our volume and net average charge result in the second half and have already taken the appropriate steps.
We're focused on serving Assisted clients with higher quality and better value and are on track to achieve our goal of holding share in the category.
