Those risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, changes in customer demand and response to products and services offered by the company, including demand by the power generation markets, electrical transmission and distribution markets, the industrial markets and the metal coatings markets; prices and raw material costs, including zinc and natural gas, which are used in the hot-dip galvanizing process; changes in the political stability and economic conditions of the various markets that AZZ serves, foreign and domestic; customer-requested delays of shipments; acquisition opportunities; currency exchange rates; adequate financing and availability of experienced management and employees to implement the company's growth strategies.
Metal Coatings turned in another excellent quarter with sales up 7.3% to $128 million and Infrastructure Solutions up 8.3% to $102 million and over 23% up when adjusted for the divestiture of SMS. The higher volumes resulted from strong operational performance and improved activity in most of our served markets.
Metal Coatings is continuing to focus on sales growth, including leveraging our spin galvanizing operations at several sites, operational execution and customer service as labor and operating expenses due to material cost inflation are increasing.
We generated net income of $22.3 million and earnings per share of $0.88 per diluted share, both representing over 300% improvement versus the prior year's first quarter.
Our businesses leverage the realignment actions taken last year to improve operating margins, while maintaining their focus on providing outstanding quality and service to our customers.
