Digital-only subscription revenue grew as a result of the large number of new subscriptions we have added in the past year, continued strength and retention of the $1 per week promotional subscriptions who graduated to higher prices, and finally, the positive impact from our digital subscription price increase, which began late in the first quarter of 2020.
We now have more than eight million paid subscriptions across our digital and print products, a testament to the success of our strategy, the strength of the market for paid digital journalism and our unique opportunity to meet that demand.
We saw moderated growth in net subscription additions in the second quarter, which we expected given that Q2 is traditionally our softest of the year, and we were comparing against last year's historic results at the beginning of the COVID crisis.
The combined strength in these two revenue streams more than offset cost growth, and as a result, we recorded $93 million in adjusted operating profit, a 78% improvement compared to the same quarter in 2020.
Digital news subscription ARPU for the quarter increased approximately one percentage point compared to the prior year and nearly five percentage points compared to the prior quarter, which marks the first quarter with a positive year-over-year result since 2013.
Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic had on our business in 2020, we will also present certain comparisons of our operating results in 2021 to 2019, which we believe, in many cases, provides useful context for our current year results.
