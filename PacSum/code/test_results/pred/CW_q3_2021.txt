Looking at our profitability, adjusted operating income improved 12% with adjusted operating margins strong at 17.5%, reflecting higher sales and operating income across all our segments as well as the benefits of our operational excellence initiatives.
Free cash flow was similarly strong, up 76% compared with the prior year, with strong free cash flow conversion that exceeded 125% and keeps us on track to achieve our long-term objectives.
Our A&D markets improved 15%, reflecting solid growth in commercial aerospace, naval defense and yet another quarter of strong performance from our PacStar acquisition.
While we maintained our outlook for sales, operating income, margin and free cash flow, we tightened and raised the bottom end of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range.
As we expected and as we indicated last quarter, our operations continued to be based with some supply chain disruptions caused by both delays in container shipments and shortages in electronic components, principally impacting sales within our A&I and Defense Electronics segment.
