While we clearly faced our fair share of those challenges, I want to focus my introductory comments and recognizing the tremendous execution of our Badger Meter teams globally, for their proactive and constructive dialog with customers to manage priorities, expectations and build trust, for their agility and effectively redesigning certain product components to provide greater flexibility on supply sources, for their unrelenting diligence and supplier and logistics management, and for their collaboration across functions to maximize our deliveries to customers.
Our water quality solution sales were also impacted by supply chain challenges on a more modest basis, yet still delivered results in line with our expectations.
In addition to the difficult comparison, our manufacturing output in the current quarter continued to be limited by supplier shortages of certain electronics and other components along with logistics challenges.
A great result considering both the difficult prior year comparison and current year supply chain challenges.
