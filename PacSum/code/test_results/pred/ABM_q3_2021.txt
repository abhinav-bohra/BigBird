Revenue growth benefited from improved access to client sites, enabling us to execute on a large number of projects Technical Solutions ended the third quarter with a record backlog level and the long-term outlook for this segment is particularly favorable given our position as a leading provider of electrical vehicle charging infrastructure.
Excluding the impact of reserve taken in the third quarter as well as other one-time factors including a favorable prior year self-insurance adjustment of $26.1 million, our adjusted income from continuing operations was $61.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to $50.1 million or $0.75 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year.
Revenue growth in the third quarter was led by performance of our Aviation segment, where revenues increased 51% compared to the prior year period and the segment operated profitably.
Overall, demand for ABM's higher margin virus protection services remained elevated in the quarter, underscoring ongoing client concerns regarding cleaning and disinfection of their facilities.
As detailed in yesterday's release, ABM generated strong third quarter results featuring double-digit growth in revenue, continued solid cash generation, and a 20% gain in adjusted earnings per share.
Our strong performance in aviation reflected a seasonal improvement in air travel as well as our strategic shift toward securing high margin and more stable service contracts with airports and related facilities.
