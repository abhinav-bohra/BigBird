Lower volumes led to margin decline versus a very strong margin that this segment posted in the comparable quarter last year, and we have taken structural cost actions in this segment, which will support its margin in the second half along with reconvering volumes.
To be clear, even with a strong backlog and positive recent trends, we still see demand uncertainty in our markets and are not back to business as usual, but our teams have proven their ability to manage costs and operations and we are prepared to operate and achieve results in a wide variety of scenarios that may be in store for the second half.
As you can see this segment continued to deliver a solid margin performance posting improving margin on declining revenue for the second quarter in a row, we expect this segment to deliver flat or improved absolute profit for the full year.
So decremental margins are challenging and require heavy lifting on cost containment, where marking & coding business did a good job, achieving a flat margin year-over-year and we have taken proactive actions to manage the cost base in the digital printing business.
In addition to the tight cost controls and variable costs, we took further structural cost actions in the quarter as part of our business realignment activities, which will benefit us in the second half.
We expect these benefits to continue accruing in the second half and expect this segment to deliver year-over-year growth in absolute earnings and margin in the second half of this year.
