And we shared with you two goals that underpin our efforts: first, to accelerate market share capture with a target growth rate of at least 400 basis points above IP by the end of our fiscal 2023; second, to return ROIC into the high teens powered not only by leveraging growth, but also by structural cost takeout of 90 to $100 million also by the end of fiscal 2023.
Q3 is muted by PPE comps, but the non-safety and non-janitorial business grew about 21% year over year, and we expect our total company growth to meet or exceed our fiscal Q4 commitment.
