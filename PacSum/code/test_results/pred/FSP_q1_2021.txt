From a debt reduction perspective, we are actively working on the potential sale of select properties that we believe have their near-term value objectives, and where we believe such value may not be fully reflected in our share price.
And while losing some of the current positive FFO spread that is generated between rental constance and debt constance from the property disposition debt pay down plan, we believe shareholders should maintain our NAV per share with less risk to their NAV from lower debt levels capitalizing the remaining property portfolio, while the company gains more overall flexibility in it's ongoing real estate investing activities.
