We did report a net loss of $184 million in the second quarter or $0.80 per share, but that was all due to a very large mark-to-market loss on our hedge contracts of $205 million and a $114 million charge related to the early retirement of the senior notes from our June 28 refinancing transaction.
For the quarter, we generated $20 million of free cash flow as the preferred dividends, increasing our year-to-year free cash flow to $53 million.
