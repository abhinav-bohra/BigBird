In pharma the increased demand for our injectable components including supplying some of the COVID-19 vaccine distributions, and increased demand for our active material science solution, including those for COVID-19 test kits, offset declines in the prescription drug and consumer healthcare markets.
In beauty and home, sales to the personal care and home care markets increase, while sales to the beauty market declined due to the continued low level of retail beauty activity related to the ongoing pandemic related lockdowns.
Our food and beverage segment deliver a stellar performance this quarter as consumers continue to cook at home during the pandemic, driving strong demand for our innovative food dispensing closures.
We have the industry's widest range of dispensing systems, active material science solutions and drug delivery technologies and services that we leverage across our reporting segments.
We also achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin comparable to the prior year, while absorbing the mix shift within our pharma segment and the relative mix across our three segments.
