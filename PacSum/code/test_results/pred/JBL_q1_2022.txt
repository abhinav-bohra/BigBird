First off, the team delivered $400 million of core operating income on roughly $8.6 billion in revenue, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7%.
The team delivered strong results on three fronts: revenue, core operating income, and core diluted earnings per share.
In summary, we delivered strong results, grew in key end markets, and successfully navigated a dynamic global supply chain, clearly demonstrating the power of Jabil by way of our scale, tools, team, and relationships.
These results were primarily driven by broad-based strength in several key end markets, including healthcare, industrial and semi cap, and of course, mobility, as customary for our first fiscal quarter.
Core operating income during the quarter was $400 million, an increase of 9.6% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.7%.
Revenue for our DMS segment was $4.7 billion, an increase of 11.1% on a year-over-year basis.
Our results were better than expected due to a combination of continued end-market strength and excellent operational execution by the entire Jabil team, along with lower tax and interest expense.
The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based, with strength across our healthcare, automotive, and mobility businesses.
GAAP operating income was $350 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.63.
