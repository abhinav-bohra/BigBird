Conversely, the translation of those positives into revenue growth was slower than historical standards, driven by a number of factors, including a protracted continuing resolution; a higher dollar value of awards under protest; delayed awards and slower ramp-up on sold contracts; lower staff productivity due in large part to the omicron variant surging during the quarter; and lower-than-anticipated billable expenses.
We expect this increase to be accomplished through 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions.
As we look ahead, we remain on track to deliver strong growth in adjusted EBITDA through fiscal year 2025, supported by continued revenue growth, stable adjusted EBITDA margins, and strategic deployment of capital.
Revenue growth was slower this quarter for the following three reasons: first, funding delays resulting in slower ramp on new work and existing work; second, lower staff utilization resulting from an uptick in PTO taken over the holiday period, due in part to a rise in COVID cases and the inclusion of the New Year's Eve holiday in this quarter's results.
Our investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA dollars from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025.
We also said this fiscal year growth pattern would look different from recent years, with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration in the second half.
