Throughout 2020, our team was focused on the many challenges brought on by the pandemic, including monitoring tenant performance, assisting in reopening plans and collaborating to develop plans that ensure long-term stability and success for both our tenants and EPR Properties.
Customers representing approximately 95% of our pre-COVID contractual cash revenue, which includes each of our top 20 customers, are either paying their pre-COVID contract rent or interest or have deferral agreement in place.
During the quarter, we wrote off 2.4 million in receivables related to putting two additional customers on a cash basis of accounting, bringing the total for the year for such write-offs to 65.1 million, including 38 million of straight-line rent.
