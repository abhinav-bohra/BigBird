Consolidated revenues of $68.6 billion increased 10% above the prior year, primarily driven by growth in the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment, largely due to higher volumes from our retail national account customers; and branded pharmaceutical price increases, which were in line with our initial guidance partially offset by branded-to-generic conversions.
Today, we reported third quarter fiscal 2022 results, another quarter with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all four segments, reflecting strength in the fundamentals across our businesses.
Adjusted operating profit increased 18% to $330 million, driven by the contribution from kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies for the U.S. government's COVID-19 vaccine program, the prior year impact of an inventory impairment charge related to PPE that incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and growth in the Primary Care business.
Next, pursuant to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, we anticipate the pending divestiture to sell McKesson's U.K. retail and distribution businesses will close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and the transaction to sell certain European assets to the PHOENIX Group will close in the first half of fiscal 2023.
