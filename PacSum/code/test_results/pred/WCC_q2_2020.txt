As we have done in prior economic cycles, we aggressively managed our business and took significant cost reduction and cash management actions, which enabled us to achieve a decremental margin of only 10%, and generate exceptionally strong free cash flow of $140 million or 250% of adjusted net income.
I'll lead off with a few introductory remarks, and then Dave will take you through our second quarter results, and then we'll provide a review of the excellent progress we're making on the Anixter integration, as well as the outstanding value creation that our transformational combination of WESCO and Anixter will create.
We are both building on this early successes, and we remain highly confident in capturing the significant upside potential and exceeding our three-year cost savings, sales growth, margin expansion and cash generation synergy target.
