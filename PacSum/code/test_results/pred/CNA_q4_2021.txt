Our Life & Group segment produced core income of $6 million, and our Corporate & Other segment produced a quarter loss of $94 million, mainly impacted by a non-economic charge related to asbestos and environmental.
Excluding the impacts of COVID in the prior year quarter, the underlying loss ratio improved by 0.8 points as we continue to recognize some of the margin built in the current accident year from the earned rate increases, as we did last quarter.
The increase from the prior year is attributed to significantly improved underlying underwriting gain, and while still substantial a lower level of cat loss compared to 2020, as well as higher net investment income driven by limited partnership returns.
