As we look ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on potential future growth opportunities in multiple market segments and we're focused on executing five straightforward operating objectives to drive improved value for shareholders.
We believe our alliance with Oaktree can enable a level of growth and earnings per share accretion, and potential value creation that we cannot achieve on a stand-alone basis, as well as, support the refinancing of our corporate debt.
So to address our growth and refinancing objectives with these constraints, we focused our structured financing solutions that would provide incremental capital to accelerate our growth and position the company to successfully refinance our upcoming corporate debt maturities without encumbering the assets necessarily of PHH, our operating company.
In terms of benefits, MAV supports our servicing and subservicing growth objectives on a capital-efficient basis and will help generate increased cost efficiency through increased origination and servicing scale.
