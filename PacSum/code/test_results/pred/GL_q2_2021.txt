Net life sales increased 67% to $18 million and net health sales were $6 million, up 52% from the year ago quarter due primarily to increased agent count and increased agent productivity.
In the second quarter, net income was $200 million, or $1.92 per share compared to $173 million or $1.62 per share a year ago.
At American Income Life, life premiums were up over the year ago quarter to $348 million and life underwriting margin was up 16% to $108 million.
The increase in margin is due primarily to the higher premium and lower amortization related to the improved persistency.
