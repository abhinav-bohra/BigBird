Pass product sales through September 17, 2021, to the upcoming 2021-2022 North American ski season increased approximately 42% in units and approximately 17% in sales dollars as compared to the period in the prior year through September 18, 2020, without deducting for the value of any redeemed credits provided to certain North American pass holders in the prior period.
To provide a comparison to the season pass results released in June, pass product sales through September 17, 2021, for the upcoming North American ski season increased approximately 67% in units and approximately 45% in sales dollars as compared to sales for the 2019-2020 North American ski season through September 20, 2019, with pass product sales adjusted to include Peak Resorts pass sales in both periods.
We saw strong unit growth from renewing pass holders and significantly stronger unit growth from new pass holders, which includes guests in our database who previously purchased lift tickets or passes, but did not buy a pass or a lift ticket in the previous season; as well as guests who are completely new to our database.
We are pleased with the results of our season pass sales to date, which continue to demonstrate the strength of our data-driven marketing initiatives and the compelling value proposition of our pass products, driven in part by the 20% reduction in all pass prices for the upcoming season.
