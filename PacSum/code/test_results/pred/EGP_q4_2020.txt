Bad debt for the fourth quarter of $1.1 million included a single, straight-line rent charge of $677,000 as part of an ongoing process of replacing an existing tenant with a better credit tenant at a much higher rental rate at a California property.
From a capital perspective, during the fourth quarter, we issued $17 million of equity at an average price just over $140 per share, and as previously disclosed, we closed on two senior unsecured private placement notes totaling $175 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.65%.
Some of the results the team produced include Funds From Operation, came in above guidance up 8.7% compared to fourth quarter last year.
