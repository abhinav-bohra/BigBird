We expect strong long-term consumer demand, especially for Saucony, Merrell, Sweaty Betty, our work brands and Sperry, which will launch a line of products in the active sport category next spring.
This strategic focus led to our recent acquisition of Sweaty Betty, a trend right women's active wear brand that adds a very meaningful DTC business to our portfolio with over 80% of revenue generated through DTC channels.
Our brand portfolio strategy and international distribution base continue to reduce risk and provide a meaningful strategic benefit in the current environment as the company is not dependent on any single product category, geographic region, consumer group or distribution channel.
Together with the DTC businesses operated by our distributor partners around the world, nearly 40% of our global revenue and a larger percentage of our payers is now generated through consumer direct channel, enabling enhanced brand shopping experiences, a wealth of consumer insights and data and a more efficient business model.
While consumer lifestyle choices have increased demand for performance product, the underlying trends in this category are long-term in nature and are expected to persist.
Adjusted earnings per share for the company were $0.62 in line with our expectation despite the shortfall in revenue driven by macro supply chain issues.
Reported diluted earnings per share were breakeven and include a number of non-recurring or exceptional items comprised of approximately $34 million of cost related to bond retirements executed in the quarter to significantly improve the company's capital structure and future liquidity, including future savings of nearly $10 million in annual interest expense.
