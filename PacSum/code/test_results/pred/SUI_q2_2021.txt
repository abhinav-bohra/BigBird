Year-to-date we have filled more than 1,000 revenue producing manufactured housing and annual RV sites and have delivered more than 580 ground-up and expansion sites that will continue providing the runway for growth over subsequent quarters.
The change is being driven by continued outperformance of transient RV, marinas, the sustained strength in our manufactured housing portfolio and our robust acquisition activity, particularly as we begin to realize the meaningful marina industry consolidation opportunity.
In the second quarter, we delivered 61% growth in core FFO per share to $1.80 as compared to the second quarter of 2020 exceeding the high end of our guidance of $1.63 as our ongoing momentum accelerated beyond our forecasted expectations.
