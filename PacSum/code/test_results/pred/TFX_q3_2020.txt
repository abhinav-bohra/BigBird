Overall, considering the environment we are operating in, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as it reflected the expected improvement in trends across many of our global product categories, led by a faster-than-expected recovery within our Interventional Urology business, and continued strength within our vascular access product sales.
We are pleased to be able to deploy capital for a differentiated product portfolio that leverages existing Teleflex call points and is immediately accretive to our revenue growth rates, adjusted growth and operating margin profile and to our adjusted earnings per share.
Quarter three revenues was $628.3 million, which was down 4.1% as compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis but far better than the 12% decline we experienced during the second quarter of the year.
The decline in year-over-year revenue is due to the impact of COVID-19, which we estimate caused a net negative impact of approximately $78 million, or approximately 12%.
