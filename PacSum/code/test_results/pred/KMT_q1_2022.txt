We also began our recently announced share repurchase program, buying back $13 million of shares in the quarter, reflecting the high level of confidence we have in our growth and margin improvement initiatives and free cash flow generation.
These factors were partially offset by the removal of $15 million of temporary cost control actions taken in the prior year and a slight headwind from higher raw material costs beginning to flow through the P&L.
Our strong operating leverage resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin improving significantly by 730 basis points to 18.6%, demonstrating the benefits of the investments we have made over the last few years.
Our sales performance was in line with our expectations, increasing 19% organically year-over-year and outpacing our normal quarter-over-quarter seasonal trend.
Nevertheless, despite the production slowdowns related to the chip shortages and other uncertainties, we expect Q2 sales to be up 9% to 14% year-over-year and in line with the normal sequential growth pattern of 1% to 2%, which highlights the relative strength of our other end markets outside of transportation.
