Also, all of our employees have been working from home using the best possible remote communication and collaboration tools and our team members, including sales and support, marketing and product development continue to be highly effective.
As such when the pandemic began to unfold in mid-March, we at DHI jumped into action to aid our communities by launching COVID-19 resource centers on each of our brand sites to assist both clients and candidates alike with information relevant to their needs in these challenging times.
We continue to transform our sales organization this quarter with the addition of a new customer success leader, a new Dice agency program leader and the relaunch of managed services as sourcing services, with a focus on delivering vetted candidates for targeted client searches.
