While the duration of the crisis remains unclear, we have assessed the crisis's impact on every element of our business, employee, tenant, vendor safety and security, a return to save building operations, construction schedule delays, forward leasing pipeline and renewal activity and of course, all the related financial implications.
We're also, however, focused forward on the opportunity set to anticipate situations where we can enhance our business plan execution, whether that be through extending lease terms, improving the pricing of our current supply chains, we're working with institutional partners to seek opportunities where market position, talent base and capital can create growth opportunities.
