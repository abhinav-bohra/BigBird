Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low cost oil development come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 a barrel by the middle of the decade.
In 2020 we significantly surpassed our five-year emission reduction targets, reducing the operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 40% and flaring intensity by approximately 60% compared to 2014 levels.
Bakken net production in the first quarter averaged 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
We had net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to an adjusted net loss of $176 million, which excluded an after-tax gain of $79 million from an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 2020.
As our portfolio generates increase in free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.
