Our first quarter net income totaled $6.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share and FFO totaled 60.2 million or $0.35 per diluted share and in line with consensus estimates.
Our first quarter annualized net debt-EBITDA increased to 6.5 and is above our current 6.1to 6.3 range, and the increase is due to lower NOI, sequential NOI from the fourth quarter.
Decrease was primarily due to the reduction in our other income guidance, which I just mentioned, and that was partially offset by higher professional fees at year-end.
