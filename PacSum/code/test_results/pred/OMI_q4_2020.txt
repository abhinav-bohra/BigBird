The strong performance in the quarter as well as the full year was a result of the successful execution and implementation of the key initiatives discussed during the previous quarterly earnings calls, which included two major items: one, infrastructure investments, with a focus on current and long-term profitable growth; and two, operational improvements, with a focus on enhancing the customer experience and increasing operating efficiencies.
The combination of these investments and operational improvements in our Global Products and our Global Solutions segment continue to strengthen our position in supporting our customers across the entire value chain, with our products and our distribution network delivering what is needed to both the hospital as well as the home, while utilizing our services and data management to increase customer efficiency.
Here are just a few examples of these investments and operational improvements: one, the installation of new N95 production lines in our U.S.-based manufacturing facilities; two, we added nonwoven fabric manufacturing in our Lexington, North Carolina facility; three, we continued to expand our isolation and surgical gown production capacity; and four, we optimized the operational process to maximize output of the production lines.
