We generated very strong financial results in the third quarter with increases in both home closings and gross margins leading to nearly 40% growth in adjusted EBITDA.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the new home market was very strong supported by wage growth, low unemployment, low mortgage rates, low housing supply and high consumer confidence.
As we monetize our longer-term assets and increase the share of lots controlled by option, we will generate plenty of liquidity to both grow the business and remain on course to reduce our long-term debt below $1 billion.
On our call today, Allan will review highlights from the third quarter, our response to the pandemic and the strength of the new home market, and then recap our strategic objectives for the coming quarters.
As we adapted to a new working environment, we realized there were opportunities for us to improve our cost structure without reducing our ability to sell and build a growing number of homes in the quarters ahead.
