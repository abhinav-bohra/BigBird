As I mentioned earlier, we've been actively positioning Hyatt for the future with intense focus on advancing three pillars of our long-term strategy, namely: first, to maximize our core business; second, to integrate new growth platforms; and third, to optimize our capital deployment.
I'm optimistic that the most recent trends in our business and also the important developments over the past quarter, including, of course, the acquisition of ALG demonstrates significant progress toward realizing the benefits of our long-term strategy.
