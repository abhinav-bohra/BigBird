After an expected margin improvement of approximately 100 basis points this year, we expect a similar operating profit margin increase next year with margins continuing to be driven by our Strategy 1.0 lean cost initiatives and further margin leverage driven by sustained fixed cost reductions and revenue growth.
We expect continued revenue improvement in 2022, driven by continued revenue growth from the pandemic lows, organic revenue growth, partially driven by higher than normal price increases that will offset wage inflation and further revenue growth driven by initial contributions from our digital solutions that will take-- that will be stronger next year.
Based on these revenue drivers and an expected higher 2021 year-end revenue run rate, we believe revenue in 2022 will exceed 100% of the adjusted pre-COVID revenue level of approximately $4.55 billion, which includes historical revenue acquired with G4S and PAI.
And despite other operational issues that impacted the quarter including labor shortages and wage inflation in the US that is not yet been offset by price increases that have been enacted, operating profit margin improved by 50 basis points to 10.8%.
