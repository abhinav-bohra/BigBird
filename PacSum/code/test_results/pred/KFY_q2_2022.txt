Fee revenue growth in the quarter for our consolidated Executive Search business was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially while our RPO and Professional Search business was up 76% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.
Our adjusted EBITDA grew $69 million year-over-year and $13.5 million or 11% sequentially to $135 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, both are new quarterly highs.
So as Gary mentioned, fee revenue in the second quarter grew $204 million or 47% year-over-year and $54 million or 9% sequentially, reaching an all-time high of $639 million.
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share also advanced to a new high in the quarter, improving to a $1.53, which was up $0.99 compared to adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and actually up $0.16 or 12% sequentially.
Although our search businesses, both Pro Search and Executive Search combined represent about 45% of our revenue, we believe there is still substantial market opportunity ahead, given the acceleration of an increasingly nomadic labor market.
Now just as market demand has been strong, our execution has been stronger, driving our fee revenue, earnings and profitability to new all-time highs.
