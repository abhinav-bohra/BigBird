the positive bovine hydatidosis cases were in the liver and 37.5% in the lung and 12.5% in the spleen .", "the reason why the lung and liver are mostly affected could be due to the fact that the lungs

bed than any other organs and this could account for the observed higher prevalence than seen in the other organs . in humans , however , the liver is most commonly affected .", "the explanation to

berhe   who found a lower viability rate of 10.7% in cattle in tigray region of ethiopia . the possible reason why no viable cysts were observed by rinaldi et al", ".   could be due to the differences in immunological responses by different individual hosts or deworming of the animals by use of antihelmintics .   out of a total of 19 hydatid cyst infested organs that were investigated ( 15 lungs

hydatid cyst density ( 4 cysts per liver ) .", "this was however different from findings by ibrahim   in saudi arabia who observed that the liver had a higher cyst density .", "the difference in the cyst density could mainly be attributed to the higher vascularisation of lung tissue compared to liver .", "the other reason in the difference in cyst density could be as a result of the soft texture of the lung tissue in comparison to liver , which has a harder texture thus restricting hydatid cyst development .", "the number of hydatid cysts that were examined in the lung was 108 while in the liver was 16 .", "most of the dead cysts in the liver were found to be calcified compared to the lung .", ", kebede et al . , and berhe   who reported a higher fertility rate of pulmonary and lower fertility rate in hepatic cysts .", "this could probably be due to the various metabolic reactions that take place in the liver as compared to lungs .", "however ibrahim   found a higher fertility rate in liver at 38.8% than in the lung at 25.1% and so did dalimi et al .   who reported a higher fertility rate in the liver than in the lung .", "the high percentage of viable cysts indicates that there is a high risk of dog exposure in situations where offal are carelessly disposed of and dogs have access to the infected offal , like the situation is in western province of zambia .", "this points to a possible intervention area in which dogs should be prevented from ingesting infected with cysts such as the lungs and liver . in this study ,", "the annual economic loss as a result of

loss due to ce and other losses such as reduced milk production and reduction in reproduction in cattle .", "the main thrust of the study was to describe the hydatidosis situation in western province

prevalence of cyst positive cases ( 2.5% ) compared to senanga ( 2.1% ) , kalabo ( 1.4% ) , and lukulu ( 0.6% ) ( table 3 ) .", "sex was found to be positively associated with hydatidosis ( p = 0.035 ) with female cattle being more likely to test positive than males ( odds ratio = 1.62 ) . on the other hand ,", "hydatidosis was independent of age ( p = 0.31 ) where the mean age among the positives was 7.8 years ( range : 7.47.6 ) and that among the negatives was 7.5 years ( range : 7.38.3 ) . in terms of distribution of hydatid cysts by organ , 51.2%", "were found in lungs , 47.6% were in livers , while 1.2% were in the kidneys .", "mukukutu camp in senanga district accounted for the highest prevalence at 4.0% ( 95% ci 3.811.8% ) , while lukulu central camp in lukulu district had the lowest prevalence at 0.3% ( 95% ci 0.20.9% ) . on comparison of camps in different districts", ", it was observed that in mongu , the highest prevalence of bovine hydatidosis was in limulunga veterinary camp at 2.9% ( 95% ci 1.44.4% ) with the lowest prevalence in luandui camp at 1.5% ( 95% ci 0.53.7% ) . in senanga district ,", "the highest prevalence was in mukukutu camp at 4.0% ( 95% ci 3.811.8% ) and the lowest was mouyo camp at 1.6% ( 95% ci 0.043.2% ) . in kalabo district ,", "the highest prevalence was observed in sikongo camp at 3.3% ( 95% ci 1.28.0% ) . in lukulu district ,", "the highest prevalence was in mbanga camp at 1.8% ( 95% ci 1.75.3% ) and lowest in lukulu central camp at 0.3% ( 95% ci 0.20.9% ) .", "the overall median number of cysts in an organ was 6 ( range 221 ) , in the lungs the median was 6 ( range 221 ) , and liver the median was 4 ( range ; 35 ) .", "the number of hydatid cysts that were examined in the lung was 108 while in the liver it was 16 .", "the lung had a highest density of cysts per organ compared to the liver ( table 4 ) .", "there was no significant difference in viability rate of hydatid cysts recovered from the lung ( 43.5% ) and in liver ( 43.8% ) .", "the prices used in the estimation of annual economic loss from condemned organs , were the 2011 average prices for wholesome and intact visceral organs obtained from zambeef butchery in mongu . while the average weights of the various organs were calculated from the data obtained from the abattoir prospective study .", "the average weight of a lung was estimated at 2.92  kg , liver and spleen were 3.34  kg and 2.00  kg , respectively .", "the average cost of lung was zmk ( zambian kwacha ) 12,000 per kg , liver zmk 18,000 per kg , and spleen zmk 12,000 .", "the cost of one lung = average weight  cost / kg ( 2.92 @ 12000 ) = zmk 35,040 ; cost of liver = average weight  cost / kg ( 3.34 @ 18000 ) = zmk 60,120 ; cost of spleen= average weight  cost / kg ( 2 @ 12000 ) = zmk24 , 000 , average annual slaughter= 14,405 ."], ["in this study , we investigated the prevalence of hydatidosis based on pm findings at two abattoirs in western province of zambia .", "it is therefore noted that the prevalence estimates provided here may have some bias as abattoir sample populations is not always representative of the reference populations where animals are drawn .", "this is often so because animals brought for slaughters are those that are old or out of production . considering the reduced sensitivity of pm inspection - based diagnosis ,", "there is always a possibility that some positive cases were missed resulting in underreporting the actual disease burden . despite these short - comings ,", "abattoir survey data is routinely used to estimate disease burden because of easy feasibility of conducting abattoir surveys compared to field surveys based on random study designs .", "besides , abattoir data provides opportunity for developing intervention strategies by timely diagnosis and condemning carcasses infected with zoonoses likely to enter the food chain .", "the observed prevalence of hydatid cysts in cattle sampled at the two abattoirs in mongu was found to be low ( 2.1% ) and was comparable to that observed during the retrospective survey ( 3.0% ) .", "furthermore , the findings in this study were in agreement with that observed in a study done in sudan which reported a prevalence of 3% in cattle . in arusha tanzania , a study by nonga and karimuribo reported a prevalence of 4.2% in cattle . similarly ,", "for instance , rkia azlaf and allal dakkak reported prevalence of 23.0% bovine hydatidosis in morocco   and so did kebede in ethiopia who reported a prevalence of 22.1% .", "in our study , the distribution of hydatidosis varied according to district with mongu reporting the highest prevalence compared to other districts .", "the reason for the high prevalence in mongu could be attributed to a high numbers of cattle and dog populations coupled with a high number of home slaughters during ceremonies , which in some cases are not inspected by the veterinary department staff .", "there is an increased dog and cattle interaction due to high populations and free range rearing of cattle which are often herded by boys with dogs ; this increases contact of cattle with dog faeces .", "further , dog access to slaughterhouse waste in mongu abattoirs is likely to increase exposure of both cattle and dogs in the district .", "sex was found to be positively associated with hydatidosis ( p = 0.035 ) with female cattle being more likely to test positive than males .", ", in iran , who observed that the prevalence was higher in females than males .", "there was a significant difference in the prevalence of hydatid cysts between carcasses slaughtered in 2007 and 2008 ( p = 0.024 ) , where prevalence of bovine hydatidosis in 2007 was 1.3% ( 95% ci : 0.691.93 ) and in 2008 was 2.4% ( 95% ci : 1.82.9 ) .", "this could be as a result of more animals coming from areas of higher prevalence of bovine hydatidosis such as mongu and senanga in 2008 than in 2007 .", "however , this could not be fully ascertained due to absence of trace back information during the period under review .", "the lung was found to be the most affected organ ( 51.2% ) compared to the liver ( 47.6% ) and the kidney ( 1.2% ) .", "this is in agreement with what was reported by getaw et al .   who observed that the lung had a higher prevalence at 55.2% and the liver at 37.1% while the kidney was the least affacted organ .", "the results are also in agreement with findings by cadmus and adesokan ( 2009 ) in nigeria , and kebede et al .   who did their study in ethiopia . however , our results are at odds with the findings from a study conducted in libya where researchers reported higher prevalence in the liver than in the lung   and al - khalid ( 1998 ) cited by dakkak   who showed that in libya , 75% of the positive bovine hydatidosis cases were in the liver and 37.5% in the lung and 12.5% in the spleen .", "the reason why the lung and liver are mostly affected could be due to the fact that the lungs and livers are the first capillary beds encountered by migrating echinococcus oncospheres via the portal vein route before any other peripheral organs .", "the lungs however have a larger capillary bed than any other organs and this could account for the observed higher prevalence than seen in the other organs . in humans , however , the liver is most commonly affected .", "the explanation to this differences in the predirection sites between cattle and human is beyond the scope of this study .", "cysts viability study revealed that the overall percentage of viable cyst in this study was 43.5% which is comparable to findings by other researchers like ibrahim   who found cyst viability of 47.8% in sheep and 24% in goats .", ", who did not observe any viable cyst from their survey and berhe   who found a lower viability rate of 10.7% in cattle in tigray region of ethiopia . the possible reason why no viable cysts were observed by rinaldi et al", ".   could be due to the differences in immunological responses by different individual hosts or deworming of the animals by use of antihelmintics .   out of a total of 19 hydatid cyst infested organs that were investigated ( 15 lungs and 4 livers ) for cyst fertility , viability , and density", ", it was found that the lung had a higher average density of cysts infestation ( 7 cysts per lung ) ( table 4 ) while the liver had a low hydatid cyst density ( 4 cysts per liver ) .", "this was however different from findings by ibrahim   in saudi arabia who observed that the liver had a higher cyst density .", "the difference in the cyst density could mainly be attributed to the higher vascularisation of lung tissue compared to liver .", "the other reason in the difference in cyst density could be as a result of the soft texture of the lung tissue in comparison to liver , which has a harder texture thus restricting hydatid cyst development .", "the number of hydatid cysts that were examined in the lung was 108 while in the liver was 16 .", "most of the dead cysts in the liver were found to be calcified compared to the lung .", ", kebede et al . , and berhe   who reported a higher fertility rate of pulmonary and lower fertility rate in hepatic cysts .", "this could probably be due to the various metabolic reactions that take place in the liver as compared to lungs .", "however ibrahim   found a higher fertility rate in liver at 38.8% than in the lung at 25.1% and so did dalimi et al .   who reported a higher fertility rate in the liver than in the lung .", "the high percentage of viable cysts indicates that there is a high risk of dog exposure in situations where offal are carelessly disposed of and dogs have access to the infected offal , like the situation is in western province of zambia .", "this points to a possible intervention area in which dogs should be prevented from ingesting infected with cysts such as the lungs and liver . in this study ,", "the annual economic loss as a result of condemnation of organs due to bovine hydatidosis was low at k 15 , 894,039.00.(3,311 us$ ) per annum .", "the loss was found to be low due to the low prevalence of hydatidosis in cattle in western province of zambia .", "the total annual loss could be greater than the estimated amount bearing in mind that this only took into account direct losses and not indirect losses as a result of weight loss due to ce and other losses such as reduced milk production and reduction in reproduction in cattle ."], ["the main thrust of the study was to describe the hydatidosis situation in western province so as to increase public health awareness , describe the socioeconomic impact , and to recommend possible mitigation measures .", "it should be noted however , that echinococcosis is a disease of multiple hosts and the objective of this study could only be addressed by the application of conventional observational studies . this study has demonstrated that hydatidosis is an important disease and is endemic in western province .", "the disease also causes considerable economic losses as a result of offal condemnations . despite the low infection rate demonstrated by the current study", ", there are certain socioeconomic conditions that are favourable for the existence of ce , and therefore ce still remains one of the most important helminth zoonotic disease hence the need for increased attention in control and prevention of the disease .  ", "livestock and dog echinococcosis prevalence studies and surveillance can help map out ce risk landscape profiles that will determine communities at greatest risk to human ce", ". a molecular analysis of human and animal hydatidosis would be desirable in order to effectively map out epidemiology of the disease and determine the spread of the disease .", "a specific study of the disease in dogs could also help in knowing the prevalence in the definitive host .", "wildlife species have not been shown to harbour e. granulosus in zambia . in view of the extensive livestock / wildlife interface areas in the province ,", "furthermore , a study in small ruminants such as sheep and goats may improve epidemiological understanding of the disease in zambia . with the current study having been done on cattle ,", "it is also suggested that in areas where there is a presence of large numbers of wildlife definitive hosts such as observed in some parts of kalabo , lukulu , and kaoma districts , increased effort should be made to sample some of the possible wildlife definitive host of echinococcus spp .", "effort should be made to ascertain the host specificity of local strains of the parasite in respect to cattle and other domestic animals . to effectively come up with a control program , possible wildlife reservoirs , and the survival of eggs under the local climatic and soil conditions have to be investigated ."]]}
