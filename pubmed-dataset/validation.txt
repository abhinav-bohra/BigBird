ena and/or anti - dsdna ( multi-)reactivity may increase the likelihood of identifying a patient with sard [ 11 , 12 , 17 ] , it is apparent in our primary care cohort that 30% of ana positive sera are of medium to high titre ( n = 27 ) , 21% contain anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity ( n = 19 ) , and 37% of the latter reveal multireactivity ( n = 7 ) . in our secondary and tertiary cohorts , the ana prevalence is also relatively low ( 11 and 16% , resp . ) , but in both clinical settings about half of the ana positive sera are of high titre ( 48 -

dsdna reactivity in the tertiary care ( 21% ) is lower than in the secondary care and similar to the primary care .", "this might be related to the spectrum of diseases investigated in the tertiary versus the secondary centres .", "also the higher number of ana requests by tertiary care departments not typically involved in the diagnosis of sard might be the result of academic profiling of the respective departments .", "for instance , the cardiology department of the mumc is specialized in inflammatory cardiomyopathies and a possible autoimmune aetiology of these diseases .", "cardiology requested 108  ana tests ( 9.2% ) , revealing 13% ana positive results of which 20% was anti - ena and/or anti - dsdna antibody positive .", "a second important difference is the presence of a division of clinical immunology within the department of internal medicine of the tertiary care hospital , implying that many patients with sard are evaluated by clinical immunologists instead of rheumatologists .", "the latter difference might at least explain the lower relative prevalence of anti -

3% of sard patients had antibodies directed to the dfs70 antigen . obviously , in sard patients other anti - ena antibodies might be present that hamper correct recognition of the dfs iif pattern", "indeed , the identification and correct interpretation of the dfs pattern might prove to be challenging for diagnostic laboratories and would require additional training .", "moreover , the majority of patterns recognized do not seem to be compatible with a dfs pattern , but this might be the consequence of only interpreting the strongest pattern in the current study .", "since the identification of the dfs pattern might be challenging for routine diagnostic laboratories and inaccurate interpretation can have significant consequences , an immunoadsorption protocol to diminish anti - dfs70 antibody reactivity to hep-2000 cells could be implemented in the current iif assay in order to significantly improve the performance characteristics of the ana iif test [ 21 , 25 ] .", "this approach sustains recognition of sard -

ena and/or anti - dsdna reactivity ( n = 19 ) , and 37% of the latter reveal multireactivity ( n = 7 ) . in our secondary and tertiary cohorts , the ana prevalence is also relatively low ( 11 and 16% , resp . ) , but in both clinical settings about half of the ana positive sera are of high titre ( 48 -

3% of sard patients had antibodies directed to the dfs70 antigen . obviously , in sard patients other anti - ena antibodies might be present that hamper correct recognition of the dfs iif pattern", "indeed , the identification and correct interpretation of the dfs pattern might prove to be challenging for diagnostic laboratories and would require additional training .", "moreover , the majority of patterns recognized do not seem to be compatible with a dfs pattern , but this might be the consequence of only interpreting the strongest pattern in the current study .", "since the identification of the dfs pattern might be challenging for routine diagnostic laboratories and inaccurate interpretation can have significant consequences , an immunoadsorption protocol to diminish anti - dfs70 antibody reactivity to hep-2000 cells could be implemented in the current iif assay in order to significantly improve the performance characteristics of the ana iif test [ 21 , 25 ] .", "this approach sustains recognition of sard -

defined anti - ena and anti - dsdna reactive antibodies [ 11 , 12 , 26 , 27 ] . both approaches enable to distinguish or reduce the number of positive ana results lacking clinical relevance .", "in addition , multiplex anti -

interpretation of positive ana results", ". rather , an alternative testing algorithm for detection of patients with sard might be more appropriate .", "this might either be achieved by immunoadsorption of anti -
