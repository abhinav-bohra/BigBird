Given the timing of interest rate declines in 2020 and excluding the fourth quarter benefit from our EnerBank acquisition, we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be up modestly compared to the prior year, but this will ultimately be dependent on the timing and amount of PPP loan forgiveness.
Pre-tax, pre-provision income remain strong; expenses are well controlled; credit quality is outperforming expectations; capital and liquidity are solid; and we are optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our markets.
Including PPP and the EnerBank acquisition, linked quarter net interest income is expected to grow between 5% and 6% in the fourth quarter.
