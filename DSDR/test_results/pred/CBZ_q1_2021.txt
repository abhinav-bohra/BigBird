Turning to the benefits and insurance group, total revenue grew by 9.6%, with same unit revenue growth of 1.6% in the first quarter this year.
We started the year strong and are seeing a continuation of the positive trends that we experienced in the second half of last year in our employee benefits business, the core of our property and casualty business, and the advisory services provided within our retirement plan services businesses.
And for 2021, we continue to estimate capital spending at approximately $12 million to $15 million for the full year.
This impacts our reported gross margin, which was 27.1% on an adjusted basis this year compared to 22.6% a year ago.
