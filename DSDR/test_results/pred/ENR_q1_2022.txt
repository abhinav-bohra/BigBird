As a reminder, we executed price increases in our battery segment in the first quarter of this year, and we have taken pricing in auto care in both the second and third quarters of the prior year.
Given the continued strength of demand in our categories and our efforts to offset the majority of these headwinds through pricing and cost reduction initiatives, we are maintaining our fiscal 2022 outlook for roughly flat net sales, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3 to $3.30, and adjusted EBITDA of $560 million to $590 million.
However, adjusted gross margin decreased 320 basis points to 37.5% versus the first quarter of 2021 as pricing, lower COVID-related costs and synergies were offset by more than 700 basis points of margin erosion from inflationary cost pressures.
First, our team delivered in the critical holiday season and our categories remain strong.
This was roughly flat to prior year on an organic basis.
