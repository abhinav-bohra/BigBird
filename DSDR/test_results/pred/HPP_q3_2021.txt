We signed 318,000 square feet of new and renewal office leases in the third quarter at 8.3% and 5.1% GAAP and cash rent spreads, with the bulk of that activity, about 65% in the Peninsula and Valley.
In the third quarter, we generated FFO excluding specified items $0.50 per diluted share compared to $0.43 per diluted share a year ago.
For our three same-store studio properties, NOI increased 49.8% on a GAAP basis and 45.5% on a cash basis.
Recall that the addition of Harlow to the in-service portfolio as of the second quarter, accounts for more than 30 of the 50 basis point drop in lease percentage since first quarter Harlow is 50% leased and we are in leases with the tenant for the balance of the building.
Nearly all of which was offset by the prior period supplemental property tax reimbursement of $1.3 million received during the third quarter.
