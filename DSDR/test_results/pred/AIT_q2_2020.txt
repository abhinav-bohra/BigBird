We are narrowing our previous guidance ranges and now expect sales of down 2% to flat year-over-year or down 5% to down 3% on an organic day per day basis as well as earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.40 per share.
On an organic basis, segment sales declined 4.9% reflecting weaker flow control sales and slower activity across our industrial OEM customer base, as well as the remaining year-over-year drag from the large project referenced in prior quarters.
Both of these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of our website at applied.com.
EBITDA in the quarter was $74.5 million compared to $76 million in the prior year quarter, while EBITDA margin was 8.9% or 9.2% excluding non-cash LIFO expense in the quarter.
While, we remain highly focused on managing costs in the second half of our fiscal 2020 given the current environment.
As highlighted on Page 8 of the deck, reported gross margin of 28.9% was up 4 basis points year-over-year.
By segment, our guidance assumes mid-to low-single digit organic declines year-over-year in our service center segment during the second half and low-single digit organic declines in our Fluid Power and Flow Control segment.
Combined with our cash generation potential, we believe our position is strong and we are eagerly moving forward to realize our full potential.
