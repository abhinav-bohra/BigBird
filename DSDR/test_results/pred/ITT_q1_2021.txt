On adjusted earnings per share, the increased sales volume and the strong productivity expected in 2021, combined with the carryover impact of our 2020 cost actions, will generate earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $4 at the high end, which equates to 19% to 25% growth versus prior year.
As you can see, the majority of our earnings growth will be generated by stronger volumes and net productivity, partially offset by the incremental headwinds from rising raw material costs and our continued investment for growth.
As a result of our strong Q1 performance and our confidence in ITT's ability to outperform, we are raising our outlook for 2021 across all facets of our guidance.
From a profitability perspective, ITT generated adjusted segment operating income growth of 27% and margin expansion of 300 basis points on 2% organic sales growth.
This is driven by continued share gains in Motion Technologies amid the broader auto market recovery, stronger growth in Connectors and demand in the Industrial Process short cycle.
