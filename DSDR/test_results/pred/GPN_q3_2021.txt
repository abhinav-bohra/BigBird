We remain encouraged by the trends we are seeing in the business and we are raising the lower end of our guidance for adjusted net revenue to now be in a range of $7.71 billion to $7.73 billion, reflecting growth of 14% to 15% over 2020.
We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 49.3% in the Merchant Solutions segment, an increase of 200 basis points from the same period in 2020, as we continue to benefit from the underlying strength of our business mix and the realization of cost synergies related to the merger.
We are also pleased that our acquiring business is globally generated 22% and 19% adjusted net revenue growth, compared to the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 respectively.
Our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel solutions delivered growth in excess of 20% year-on-year, once again this quarter as we continue to benefit from our unique ability to seamlessly blend that difficult and virtual worlds and create frictionless experiences for our customers on a global basis.
