Diluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to $1.88 per share from $2.55 per share a year ago.

Sales were up double digits in every region.
We expect to see a slightly improved sequential gross margin in our fourth quarter as additional price increases are implemented in the quarter.
For the full year 2021, we expect consolidated net sales to be up by a high single-digit percentage.
