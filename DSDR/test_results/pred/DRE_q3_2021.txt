These quarterly results and our improved outlook for the balance of the year resulted in our raising key components of our 2021 guidance, including year-over-year core FFO growth now expected to be at 13.8% and growth in AFFO per share of 11.6%.
For same-property NOI growth on a cash basis, we have increased our guidance to a range of 5% to 5.4% from the previous range of 4.75% to 5.25%.
We started $349 million of new development totaling two million square feet that consisted of six speculative projects and two build-to-suits in the quarter.
