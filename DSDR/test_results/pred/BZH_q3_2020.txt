The COVID outbreak impacted the timing of both orders and spec starts during the quarter such that a larger than usual share of this backlog will deliver in the first quarter of fiscal '21 rather than the fourth quarter of this year.
And third, we improved the cost structure of the business.
For the full year of fiscal 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be up 5% to 10% compared to last year with a big improvement in gross margin more than offsetting the impact of fewer home closings.
As we monetize our longer-term assets and increase the share of lots controlled by option, we will generate plenty of liquidity to both grow the business and remain on course to reduce our long-term debt below $1 billion.
With our reunderwriting process complete and demand improvements evident, we have resumed our regular land acquisition and development activity and expect to return to more normalized spending levels in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021.
