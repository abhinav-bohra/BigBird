In medical, sales grew sequentially and year-over-year.
HPMC Q3 sales and earnings were in line with the second quarter and much improved from the third quarter of 2020.
Our success is due in equal parts to accelerated rates of recovery in our diverse end markets, our significant business restructuring and transformation efforts and the perseverance of the ATI team.
It feels great to report that we returned to profitability in the third quarter, three months ahead of our expectations.
