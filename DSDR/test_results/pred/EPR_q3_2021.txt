During the quarter, we also collected $7.7 million of deferred rent and interest from accrual basis tenants and borrowers and the deferred rent and interest receivable on our books at September 30 was $40.9 million, which we expect to collect primarily over the next 27 months.
Total revenue for the quarter was $139.6 million versus $3.9 million in the prior year.
As we have done in previous quarters, we would also like to update you on the expected ranges of contractual cash revenue that we expect to recognize in our financial statements for the fourth quarter of '21, as well as our expected collections that relate to those same periods.
