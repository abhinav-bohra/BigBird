Operating margin for the quarter was negative 7% compared to negative 77% in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to increased 737 production volumes and the resulting decrease in excess capacity costs as well as less net forward losses in the absence of a loss on disposal charges.
The second quarter 737 deliveries have increased to 35 compared to 19 shipsets delivered in the second quarter of last year.
The fuselage segment recorded $4 million of favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments and $36 million of net forward losses during the quarter, primarily due to the 787 program.
As we work through the second half of the year, we are starting to see the benefits of increasing narrow-body production rates.
We are maintaining our 2021 free cash flow guidance of negative $200 million to $300 million.
