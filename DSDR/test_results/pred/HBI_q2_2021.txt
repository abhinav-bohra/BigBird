The higher revenue outlook is driving our increased operating profit and earnings per share guidance for the second half and full year.
Champion sales in our International segment increased 15% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency as compared to the second quarter 2019.
In U.S.
Investing in our brands is critical to the long-term success and health of our business, and we remain committed to it.
Activewear's operating margin of 10.2% declined 290 basis points compared to 2019 as the leverage from higher sales was more than offset by higher expedite and distribution costs to meet the higher-than-expected demand as well as increased investments in brand marketing.
Turning to U.S.
We exceeded the high end of our expectations across all of our key metrics, driven by continued top line momentum in both global innerwear and activewear businesses.
For the third quarter, we issued adjusted operating profit guidance of $235 million to $245 million.
We're going to continue to increase the investment behind our brands, and we're excited about the consumer reaction that we're getting.
