Excluding the impact of reserve taken in the third quarter as well as other one-time factors including a favorable prior year self-insurance adjustment of $26.1 million, our adjusted income from continuing operations was $61.3 million or $0.90 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, compared to $50.1 million or $0.75 per diluted share in the third quarter of last year.
Aviation revenue increased 51% in the third quarter to $175.7 million, marking the first period of year-over-year revenue growth in the Aviation segment since the third quarter of fiscal 2019.
Operating profit in this segment grew 18.2% year-over-year to $84.7 million, reflecting efficient labor management, reduced bad debt expense and ongoing client demand for higher margin virus protection services.
This improvement was driven by revenue growth in each of our five business segments, reflecting an improving business environment and continued demand for our virus protection services.
Third quarter operating cash flow from continuing operations was $87.6 million compared to $130.9 million in the third quarter of last year.
I'll now discuss our cash and liquidity.
