Operating income was up 19%, and margins expanded 180 basis points to 16.5% from cost management, integration benefits and operational excellence.
We're off to a strong start with our first quarter results and performance, and we're confident in our integration and operating expectations, as well as our top line growth of 3% to 5%, supported by a solid 1.10 book-to-bill this quarter.
Funded book-to-bill was 0.84 for the quarter.
Organic revenue is up approximately 2% with mid-single-digit growth in our core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts of about three points from our commercial businesses, consistent with our expectations.
