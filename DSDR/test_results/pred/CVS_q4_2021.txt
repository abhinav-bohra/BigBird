We delivered adjusted operating income of 17.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $8.40, up approximately 8.1% and 12% year over year, respectively.
Fourth quarter adjusted revenue of 20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year over year, driven by membership growth in our government services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee.
For pharmacy services in 2022, we expect 6% to 8% revenue growth and 7% to 9% adjusted operating income growth, as we create long-term value for our clients and our members.
Our liquidity and capital position remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter with full year cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion and nonrestricted cash of over 3.8 billion.
2021 was an important year for CVS Health.
