We look forward to being able to fully maximize the reopening of theater exhibition as we expect that 98% of our theaters will be opened by the end of May, and consumers will have the opportunity to see a strong lineup of film titles for the remainder of 2021, many of which have been delayed several times.
Cash collections from customers continued to improve, and we're approximately 72% of contractual cash revenue or $98.1 million for the first quarter and 77% for April.
