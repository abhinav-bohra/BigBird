For the year, our DMS segment revenue was $15.4 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up an impressive 49% year over year.
We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.6 billion.
We have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which give us confidence in our ability to deliver 4.5% in core margins in FY '22 along with $6.35 in core earnings per share and $700 million in free cash flow.
Next, I'd like to talk about our solutions and how they're enabled by our structure, our investments, and our customers.
The bulk of our strategic growth capex will be in the healthcare, automotive, 5G wireless, power generation and energy storage, semi cap, and eco-friendly packaging end markets.
Turning now to our first-quarter guidance on the next slide.
In summary, our business has grown rapidly over the last several years to serve a diverse blend of end markets that today are benefiting from long-term secular trends.
