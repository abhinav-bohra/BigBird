We expect operating margin in the Fire & Emergency segment to increase to approximately 14% as a result of increased sales volume.
We are also estimating adjusted operating income of $610 million to $655 million compared to $496 million in the prior year and adjusted earnings per share of $6.35 to $6.85 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $4.94 in 2020.
We are pleased with our solid performance in the first half of 2021 as well as the improved visibility we have for the second half of the year, which has positioned us to once again provide quantitative expectations.
