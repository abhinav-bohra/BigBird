Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased more than 7% versus the prior year comparable period.
As a result of these financings and the strong cash flow generation of its existing portfolio, NextEra Energy Partners ended the quarter with more than $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes funds raised in the second quarter financing activities and existing partnership debt capacity to support its ongoing growth initiatives, including the acquisition of the approximately 590 net megawatts of renewables from Energy Resources as well as previously announced acquisition of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects, both of which are expected to close later this year.
For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share.
During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $150 million and we expect its full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million.
