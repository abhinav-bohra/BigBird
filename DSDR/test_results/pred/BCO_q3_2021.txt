Our 2021 revenue as compared to adjusted pre-COVID levels as Mark pointed out, has improved from 89% in the first quarter of this year to 93% in the third quarter that we just reported.
We expect continued revenue improvement in 2022, driven by continued revenue growth from the pandemic lows, organic revenue growth, partially driven by higher than normal price increases that will offset wage inflation and further revenue growth driven by initial contributions from our digital solutions that will take-- that will be stronger next year.
On December 31, 2020, our total leverage ratio was 3.3 turns At the end of 2021, given our free cash flow guidance and the completion of the G4S and PAI acquisitions, we're estimating a net debt of $2.175 billion or $2.325 billion, including the planned ASR.
Third quarter reported operating profit was $116 million, up 16% versus last year.
