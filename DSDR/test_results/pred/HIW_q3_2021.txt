In addition to our improved 2021 FFO outlook, we also increased our same-property cash NOI growth outlook to a range of 6% to 7%, up more than 150 basis points at the midpoint from our July outlook.
As Ted mentioned, we closed on the acquisition from PAC in late July, delivered the $285 million Asurion development in September and sold $120 million of noncore assets at the end of the quarter.
We signed 83,000 square feet of leases on these developments during the quarter, bringing leasing to 59% for both buildings.
