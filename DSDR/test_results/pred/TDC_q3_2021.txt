Total ARR increased 7% year-over-year as reported and 6% year-over-year in constant currency.
The negative $10 million is due to revenue pulled into the first half of the year from the third quarter, partially offset by upfront recurring revenue recognized in Q3, all related to the renewal or expansion of on-premises deals.
Customers are recognizing that Teradata with our connected multi-cloud data platform for enterprise analytics is the best solution to overcome these challenges, and they are increasingly migrating to the cloud with Teradata Vantage.
With regards to earnings per share, we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.15, while still continuing to invest in the business, an increase of $0.19 from the midpoint of the previous range.
We are pleased that each of our regions saw growth in cloud customers in the quarter.
Some of our year-to-date highlights include total ARR growth of 7% versus the prior year, which is in line with our 2021 full year outlook range of mid- to high single-digit growth.
