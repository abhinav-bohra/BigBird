Software-as-a-Service revenue for the fourth quarter was $96 million, an increase of 5% over the prior-year quarter.

Looking forward and subject to currency movements, we expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 20% to 22% during fiscal-year '22.
We are doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the parts, the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale.
