For the first quarter, we grew sales 29% year over year to $3.3 billion.
Our first priority for our use of cash is to invest in our growth and extend our leadership.
I'm pleased to note that in Quarter 1, we experienced the most favorable first-quarter pricing environment in more than a decade.
Net income was $74 million, up 111% year over year.
Looking ahead, we expect that glass supply will continue to be short to tight, and we will continue to partner with our customers to maximize our glass supply.
We are off to a great start, and we expect that strong demand and positive momentum to continue throughout the year.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our businesses.
And we are committed to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks.
