In our fiscal fourth quarter 2021, we expect an increase in revenue and operating margin sequentially and year-on-year.
We generated strong free cash flow of $17 million in the second quarter and through the first half of fiscal 2021 have achieved 95% free cash flow to net income conversion rate.
On a year-over-year basis, Specialty Solutions revenue decreased approximately 17.8% to $22.8 million and operating income of $3.2 million or a 26% year-on-year decrease.
As expected, the revenue and operating income decline reflected the economic impact of COVID-19 pandemic on this segment's end markets.
At the Engraving segment, margin improved approximately 100 basis points sequentially due to favorable geographic mix, productivity and cost actions.
In regard to our fiscal third quarter 2021 outlook, we expect a moderate sequential revenue and operating margin improvement compared to fiscal second quarter 2021 results.
