Our second-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $57.2 million increased 52.5% year over year, and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 400 basis points to 19.2%.
Excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange translation and the impact of the bushing block business divestiture, adjusted EBITDA increased 155% compared to the prior-year period.
Organic sales for the quarter increased 27.1% compared to the second quarter of 2020.
As we look ahead, we continue to see broad-based strength across our businesses and are encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers, particularly in the general industrial, semiconductor, heavy-duty truck, food and pharma, automotive, and petrochemical markets.
