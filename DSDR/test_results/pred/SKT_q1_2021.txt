Collections of contractual fixed rents billed in the first quarter of 2021 were approximately 95%.
We expect the 2021 net dilutive impact per share to be approximately $0.12 for net income, $0.18 for FFO, and $0.04 for core FFO.
This reflects the anticipated 61,000 square feet of space recaptured during the quarter related to bankruptcies and brandwide restructurings.
