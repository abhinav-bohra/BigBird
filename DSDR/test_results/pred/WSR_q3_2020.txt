Our accrued rents and other receivables had decreased by $1.1 million, largely the result of the write-off of accrued straight-line rent receivables on tenants converted to cash basis accounting and our bad debt reserve has increased by $4.3 million.
Our judicious and disciplined allocation of capital has produced positive third quarter operating results, including occupancy of 88.9% at the end in the quarter, revenue that approached $30 million for the quarter, up 8% from the second quarter.
