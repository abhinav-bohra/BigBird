The combination of these investments and operational improvements in our Global Products and our Global Solutions segment continue to strengthen our position in supporting our customers across the entire value chain, with our products and our distribution network delivering what is needed to both the hospital as well as the home, while utilizing our services and data management to increase customer efficiency.
And for the full year, we generated $339 million of operating cash flow, which was more than two times the prior year.
We expect cash flow to continue to be strong in 2021.
