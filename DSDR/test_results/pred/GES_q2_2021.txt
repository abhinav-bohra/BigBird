I believe that the progress we made in the second quarter, both with our financial results and with our initiatives to better position the Company for the future, demonstrates our team's strong leadership, their relentless hard work and their amazing commitment to our customers and our Company.
As we look into the second half of the year, we expect a slow recovery of our retail business, driven by similar metrics to those that we have seen since we have reopened our stores, but with a gradual improvement in customer traffic.
In August, we saw sales productivity at our retail locations of down 29% in the US and Canada, down 13% in Europe and down 33% in Asia.
Capital expenditures for the first six months of the year were $10 million, less than one-third of what we spent in the same period of the prior year.
We are confident that our e-commerce business will accelerate in the second half of the year as we increase our investment in marketing, continue to reposition our product offering and complete our Salesforce platform implementation.
The response to the line has been very positive, and the customers' interest in our brand is very strong.
We already see opportunities for increased business and believe that we will be able to capitalize on this strategy.
Our e-commerce business in North America and Europe was up [Phonetic] 9% for the quarter.
Now let me take you through some of the details on our performance for the quarter.
Improved visibility is helping us size our expected demand more effectively, and as a result, we can project our inventory needs more accurately, which is key to optimizing future sales, margins and profitability.
