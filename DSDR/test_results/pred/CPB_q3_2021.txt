Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales in Meals & Beverages grew 3%.
During the quarter, organic net sales declined 12% and adjusted EBIT decreased 27% driven by lower sales volume and a lower adjusted gross margin partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses.
Turning to Slide 12, as Mark just shared, our third quarter results were impacted by last year's demand surge related to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the gross margin impact due to pronounced inflation, our transition out of the COVID-19 environment, and some executional pressure as we continued to advance our transformation agenda primarily in our Snacks division.
As a result, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $2.90 to $2.93 per share, representing a year-over-year decline of minus 2% to minus 1% to the prior year.
retail driven by lapping increased demand of food purchases for at-home consumption at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year quarter when organic net sales increased 21%.
Overall within our Meals & Beverages division, the operating margin decreased year-over-year by 550 basis points to 17.2%.
The lower gross margin resulted from higher cost inflation including higher freight costs, other supply chain costs such as external sourcing and the weather-related disruption at the beginning of the quarter, reduced operating leverage and unfavorable product mix partially offset by the benefits of supply chain productivity improvements.
To put our fiscal 2021 earnings per share guidance into perspective at the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect fiscal 2021 to be in line with fiscal 2020 considering the impact of the 53rd week and 27% above fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS.
Pacific Foods continued to be a powerful growth engine within our soup portfolio with in-market consumption growth of nearly 30% on a two-year basis and continued share gains versus prior year, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of share improvement.
We are confident that we can address these issues and we have plans and pricing already in place as we exit the fiscal year and enter fiscal 2022.
