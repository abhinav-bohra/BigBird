Domestic wholesale sales grew 10% year-over-year and as compared to the third quarter of 2019 increased 17%.
The third quarter sales gain of 19% was the result of a 20% increase in our domestic business and a 19% increase in our international business, which represented 58% of our total sales for the period.
This compares to prior year net earnings of $64.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share on $155 million diluted shares outstanding.
Quarterly gross margin remained strong at 49.6% primarily driven by higher average selling prices and fewer promotions in our direct-to-consumer business, partially offset by increases in freight costs.
Given the severe supply chain constraints we experienced throughout the third quarter, which we believe will continue for the remainder of the year and into the first half of 2022, we are updating our previous guidance.
Capital expenditure in the quarter were $89.4 million of which 38 million related to investments in our new corporate offices and other real estate, $16.2 million related to the expansion of our joint venture owned domestic distribution center, $15.3 million related to investments in our direct-to-consumer technologies and retail stores, and $10 million related to our new, now fully operational distribution centers in China and the United Kingdom.
Total inventory was $1.23 billion, an increase of 17% or $177 million from September 30, 2020.
