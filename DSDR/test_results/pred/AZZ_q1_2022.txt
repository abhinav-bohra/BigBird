We are excited with the banks we have partnered with and look forward to improving our utilization of our credit facility as we remain active with acquisition opportunities, and we continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our $100 million existing buyback program.
Our Infrastructure Solutions segment, which was severely impacted by the COVID pandemic, particularly in the first quarter of last year, demonstrated its resilience as they improved sales to $102 million or up over 23% when considering the impact of the SMS divestiture.
We also benefited from lower interest expense while incurring a 25.5% tax rate for the quarter.
