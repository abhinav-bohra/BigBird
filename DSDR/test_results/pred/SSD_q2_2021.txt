In summary, we are very pleased with our strong second quarter financial and operational performance.
In Europe, income from operations increased 117.8% to $5.9 million primarily due to increased sales volumes and gross profit.
Importantly, while we expect these price increases will support our gross margin levels throughout the remainder of fiscal 2021, our gross margins in the first half of 2021 reflect an average cost of steel sourced prior to or earlier into this surge in steel market together with steel purchased more recently at significantly higher prices.
Looking at our sales results in more detail, the majority of the increase we experienced both sequentially and over the prior year period was a result of two price increases that became effective during the second quarter.
