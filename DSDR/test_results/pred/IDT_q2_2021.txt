Consolidated income from operations increased $11.6 million to $12.9 million this quarter, powered by a $9 million year-over-year increase in revenue less direct cost of revenue.
We are successfully reducing the overhead in our traditional communications segment and redeploying those resources to support and accelerate the growth of our higher-margin businesses in the Fintech and net2phone-UCaaS segments.
