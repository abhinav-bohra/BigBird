Given the impact of COVID-19 to our business, we did perform an assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles in the first quarter of 2020 and the result was that we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $106 million.
With our expectation of positive operating cash flow, each quarter this year, limited capital expenditure needs and our amended credit agreement, we have sufficient liquidity to support our operations and this would be while simultaneously reducing outstanding debt by the end of the year, including $4.5 million already paid down in the second quarter.
Gross margins were also down from a year ago, consistent with the decrease in revenues.
Our job is to build on the legacy Mistras has created over the years and it is our vision to take Mistras to the next level through more integrated programs and more predictive intelligence that will define our industry in the future.
Our utmost concern remains safety of our employees as well as those of our customers and the many other Mistras associates.
Gross debt increased by $3.3 million during the first quarter of 2020 from $254.7 million at the end of the year to $258 million at March 31, 2020.
