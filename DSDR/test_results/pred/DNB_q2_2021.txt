In our international segment, second-quarter revenues increased 147% to $164 million or 137% on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by the net impact from the acquisition of Bisnode and strong growth in both finance and risk and sales and marketing solutions.
Turning to Slide 2, I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the second quarter.
Second-quarter adjusted revenues for the total company were $521 million, an increase of 24.4% or 23.2% on a constant-currency basis.
Overall, we continue to see the year shaping up, as previously discussed, with organic revenue growth continuing to accelerate throughout the year, with Q3 expected to be a bit below the midpoint of our range and Q4 to be at the high end of the range.
Excluding the net impact of Bisnode, EBITDA margin was 40.8%.
