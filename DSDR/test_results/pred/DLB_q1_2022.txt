Operating expenses in the first quarter on a GAAP basis were $228.3 million, compared to $189.8 million in Q1 of the prior year.
The revenue increase from last year's Q2 is anticipated to be driven by -- primarily by higher broadcast and PC revenues from Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.
Other markets represented about 13% of total licensing in fiscal Q1.
Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter was $104.5 million or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $153.3 million, or $1.48 per diluted share in Q1 of last year.
As we enable more Dolby experiences across music, gaming, and sports, we add to our value proposition for new and deeper adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across devices and end markets.
Products and services revenue are expected to range from $75 million to $90 million for fiscal year '22 with improvements in Cinema products and growth in Dolby.io.
With that, let me take you through the outlook for Q2 and the full year.
These factors were partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and imaging patents within our fiscal Q1 of 2022.
And our effective tax rate for Q2 is projected to range from 19% to 20% on a GAAP basis and 18% to 19% on a non-GAAP basis.
