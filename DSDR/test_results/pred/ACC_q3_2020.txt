If the current environment remains stable, though, we are hopeful that the reduction in revenue through the remainder of the year should be limited to the impact of the 90.3% occupancy we achieved for the opening of the fall semester, and the $1.2 million in rent refunds that we have agreed to for the fourth quarter at one of our ACE partnership universities.
As we are not currently holding any discussions for on-campus rental refunds beyond one university partner, which we expect to total only $1 million -- approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter versus the $15 million we contributed in the second quarter of the prior academic year.
