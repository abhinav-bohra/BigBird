For the full year guidance of 2022, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $730 million to $750 million, representing year-over-year growth of 2% to 4%.
Adjusted EBITDA was $78.4 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 42%, again, exceeding the high end of our outlook for the fourth quarter.
We will lead with a subscription-first focus as it relates to new sales, and we'll also focus on migrating our maintenance customers to our observability products, which are sold as subscriptions, especially in the second half of the year when we expect that more of the functionality will be available.
Total license and maintenance revenue was $152 million in the fourth quarter, which is a decrease of 3% from the prior year period.
We believe we will return to accelerating margins again in the future, but in the near-term, we are committed to and excited about the investments in our business that we shared with you at our Analyst Day in November.
