When excluding the negative impact of COVID-19 had on our third quarter results, we estimate that our adjusted earnings per share would have grown approximately 13% as compared to the prior year period.
And while our adjusted margins were down in the third quarter as compared to the year ago period, we are pleased to see the sequential improvement in both gross and operating margins from the lows we experienced during the second quarter.
For the quarter, adjusted gross profit was $359.6 million versus $380 million in the prior year quarter or a decrease of approximately 5%.
If we were to normalize for the negative COVID impact, we estimate that our underlying business grew by approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our quarter two revenue performance.
