We anticipate that our adjusted operating margin could range from 13.7% to 14.5% in the third quarter, driven by volume and price, partially offset by investments of $6 million and incremental cost of $7 million related to the return of discretionary spend.
We are introducing our third quarter outlook with sales and margin improvements expected versus the prior year, and we have increased our full year adjusted outlook to account for the stronger second quarter and expected third quarter results.
