We raised full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to be no less than $13.25 per share, which reflects the following: our underlying outperformance, an increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, the net effect of COVID expectations, which has increased by $1 per share and is now expected to be approximately $2.50 per share for the full year, and continued caution in forecasting utilization trends in the remaining six months of the year due to the COVID pandemic.
Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.9 million members, an increase of 69,000 over the first quarter of 2021.
In Medicare, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $17 million, increasing the MCR by 200 basis points to 87.6% in the quarter.
