Starting with the second quarter, we currently expect sales to be up approximately 9% to 14% year-over-year and in the range of $480 million to $500 million.
This increase was driven by higher volume, favorable pricing exceeding raw material increases and manufacturing performance, including some simplification/modernization carryover benefits, partially offset by temporary cost control actions taken last year.
Organic sales increased by 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 18% in the prior year period.
On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.44 per share versus $0.03 in the prior year.
And despite the existing market and supply chain uncertainties, we remain confident in driving strong underlying operating leverage for the full year.
