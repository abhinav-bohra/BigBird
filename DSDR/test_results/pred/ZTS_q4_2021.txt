We again expect companion animal to be the primary growth driver in 2022 with the continued strength of our diverse parasiticide portfolio, further expansion of our key dermatology products, the adoption of our monoclonal antibodies for OA pain, and the growth in point-of-care diagnostics and reference labs.
Moving on to our International segment, where revenue grew 8% on a reported and operational basis in the quarter.
Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales from our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products.
2021 was an exceptional year for us with revenue of $7.8 billion and adjusted net income of $2.2 billion both exceeding the high end of our November full year guidance range.
