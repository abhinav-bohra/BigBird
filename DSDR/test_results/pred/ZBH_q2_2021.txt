And that brings me to the last topic that we have before we move to the Q&A, and that's going to be around innovation.
The adjusted tax rate of 16.5% in the quarter was in line with our expectations.
And inside of that innovation, how we believe we're going to be able to drive attractive long-term growth that ultimately will deliver value to you, our shareholders.
Our global hip business increased 39.9% or down 2.8% versus 2019.
Our reported GAAP diluted earnings per share were up significantly when compared to a reported GAAP diluted loss per share of $1 in the second quarter of 2020.
Still, we continue to be encouraged by the team's execution and ongoing strong momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee.
