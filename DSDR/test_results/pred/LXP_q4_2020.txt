In the fourth quarter, we generated adjusted company funds from operations of $0.19 per diluted common share to end the year at $0.76 per diluted common share, the high end of our guidance range.
At year-end we had 3.7 million square feet of space expiring in our single-tenant industrial portfolio in 2021, of which we expect at least a third to be renewed with the expiring rents below market, on average.
We were particularly pleased with the sale outcome of our Dow Chemical office building in the fourth quarter as we retired a substantial amount of secured debt and de-leveraged the balance sheet.
