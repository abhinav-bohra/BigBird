I want to start by reiterating the three key takeaways from today's call: one, we have fundamentally restructured our business to be more profitable, and this is showcased by a record year of EPS; two, our strategy is building momentum, and this will continue in 2022; and three, we are reinforcing our commitment to driving shareholder value, doubling our dividend and planning to repurchase at least $1 billion in shares in 2022.
Sephora will be a key driver of our growth in 2022 with the opening of another 400 new shops, reaching half of our store base.
The board has approved a 100% increase in our dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $2 per share, and a $3 billion share repurchase authorization.
