A&D revenue in the fourth quarter is expected to be flat to down 5% versus prior year, primarily due to supply chain constraints and the timing of shipments for large defense programs.
Industrial organic revenue was up 3% versus last year and up 1% sequentially.
Finally, operating margin was 24.2% in the quarter, up 50 basis points year over year and up 430 basis points from Q2.
We expect margin in Q4 to be roughly in line with prior year.
