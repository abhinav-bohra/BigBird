The average selling price of our net orders increased by 12% year-over-year, driven by price increases implemented over the past 12 months as well as decreased sales incentives.
MDC Holdings delivered another quarter of strong profitability in the first quarter of 2021 generating net income of $111 million or $1.51 per diluted share.
Also, as previously noted, our net new home orders for the first quarter could have been even higher were it not for our efforts to balance orders and pricing to best manage our backlog.
Gross margin from home sales improved by 200 basis points year-over-year to 21.9%.
We ended the first quarter with the largest backlog on a dollar value basis in our company's history, giving us great visibility into the remainder of the year and supporting our decision to make significant investments in land that will serve as a foundation for the growth in the coming years.
We continue to see particular strength at our more affordably priced communities as homebuyers from all demographic segments look for alternatives to the lack of availability in the high cost of existing homes in most markets.
