The first quarter delivered on that expectation, and the outlook for the remainder of the year continues to be strong.
This increase of 5% over last year was on the strength of our Pipeline & Storage segment results, as well as the impact of the Upstream and Gathering acquisition in Appalachia.
Our balance sheet is in great shape.
At the midpoint of our guidance ranges, we'd expect funds from operations to exceed our capital spending by approximately $50 million for the year.
In closing, National Fuel had a great first quarter.
