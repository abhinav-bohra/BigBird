My key message today is that we're on track to achieve all of our 2021 operational objectives that we set at the beginning of the year, including our $1 billion capital program, and that we are on track to exceed the free cash flow objectives.
In summary, we are well-positioned this year to return over 40% of our cash flow to investors through gross debt reduction and our base dividend, our top near-term priorities.
The proof point for this sustainability is our five-year benchmark maintenance scenario that can deliver around $5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $50 per barrel WTI price environment or closer to $7 billion of free cash flow at the current forward curve, along with a corporate free cash flow breakeven of less than $35 per barrel throughout the period.
Our peer-leading capital efficiency, our outsized free cash flow generation, our competitive cost structure, our investment-grade balance sheet, and our rising return of capital profile.
