Following a strong Q1 performance and accelerating demand signals across channels, we are confident raising the full-year outlook for the Dickies brand to mid teen growth in fiscal 2022 representing over 25% growth relative to fiscal 2020 levels.
Our global DTC business delivered high single-digit growth relative to prior peak levels driven by a strong acceleration from our brick and mortar stores in the US and continued strength in our digital.
We are encouraged by the continued broad-based momentum across our business and the set up for each of our big brands heading into the heart of our fiscal year.
