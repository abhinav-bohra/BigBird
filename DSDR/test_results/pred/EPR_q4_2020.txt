Percentage rents for the quarter totaled 3 million versus 6.4 million in the prior year.
However, we would like to update you on the expected ranges of contractual cash revenue that we expect to recognize in our financial statements for the first quarter of 2021, as well as our expected collections for the same period.
During the quarter, due to the continuing impact from COVID-19, we reserved the outstanding principal loan balance of 6.1 million and the unfunded commitment of 12.9 million for one of our attractions operators.
