Net interest income in the second quarter was $123.5 million, up from $120.6 million in the first quarter and down from $126.7 million in the second quarter of 2020.
This included a negative provision to the allowance for credit losses of $16.8 million, which with net charge-offs of $1.2 million reduced the allowance to $180.4 million, representing 1.5% of total loans and leases or 1.56% net of PPP balances.
The decline in the margin in the second quarter reflects the ongoing impact from the strong deposit growth and lower rates, partially offset by deployment of liquidity.
