The first quarter results highlight how we continue to execute on our long-term strategies including maintaining the highest standards in providing the Carlisle experience to our customers, investing in high return capital projects to drive organic growth across our core platforms, working an active pipeline of acquisition targets, returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, continuing on our ESG journey and demonstrating the exceptional and sustainable earnings power of the Carlisle business model.
Revenue was flat in the first quarter driven by CCM, CFT and CBF offset by the well-documented commercial aerospace decline in CIT.
