In the third quarter and for the year to date, we reported AFFO per share growth of 1.5% and 4.5% respectively.
Senior living communities, which represent 16% of our cash revenue, had third quarter average occupancy of 79%, which was down just 10 basis points from the second quarter.
While we cannot remove all the uncertainty that we will continue to experience for the next few quarters, we are confident that we have the strategy, operator quality and financial tools necessary to transition through this period.
As Eric mentioned, assisted living operators are now included as eligible providers beginning with Phase 2 of the Provider Relief Fund, which equates to approximately 2% of 2019 revenue, which most of our operators have or expect to receive.
