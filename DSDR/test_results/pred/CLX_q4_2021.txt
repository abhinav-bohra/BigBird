On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 8% and full year sales grew 12%.
Full year sales were up by double digits, on top of double-digit growth in the prior year.
We anticipate fiscal year sales to be down 2% to 6%, reflecting ongoing demand moderation, primarily in our cleaning and disinfecting products in the front half of the fiscal year, in addition to the unfavorable mix and higher trade spending as we move to a more normalized supply and promotional environment.
We have confidence in our strategic plans and our ability to execute to enable us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.
This represents about 50% of our portfolio.
Now turning to our segment results.
