We expect WarnerMedia's full year contributions when including Xandr to be revenues in the $37 billion to $39 billion range, EBITDA in the $6 billion to $7 billion range, and free cash flow contribution of approximately $3 billion as we expect 2022 to be the peak investment year for HBO Max.
We added more than one million fiber subscribers for the fourth consecutive year, and full year broadband revenues were up 6.5% as we returned our Consumer Wireline business to revenue growth.
To that end, we're encouraged with how the process for the WarnerMedia deal is progressing and now expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.
Let's now look at our segment operating results, starting with our Communication business on Slide 8.
Free cash flow for the quarter was $8.7 billion even with a year-over-year increase of $1.4 billion in capex.
Our fiber customer growth and fiber network expansion continues.
While we're still in the quiet period, I can share that we're very pleased with the results of Spectrum Auction 110.
Service revenues were up 4.6% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year driven by postpaid and prepaid subscriber gains.
Consolidated adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the $3.10 to $3.15 range.
As noted earlier, several onetime related impacts such as peaking 3G network shutdown costs are expected to impact year-over-year EBITDA trends in the first quarter.
We look forward to giving you more detail at our virtual analyst event, which we expect to host in March.
