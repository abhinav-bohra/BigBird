In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was 539 million, up 9% compared to fiscal '20, driven by continued strength in e-commerce, up 144% versus fiscal '20 combined with strong results from Journeys and licensed brands compared to pre-pandemic levels.
As I said, the footwear-focused strategy we embarked on a couple of years ago is the right strategy for our business and the foundation of our strong performance.
As we have experienced since the onset of the pandemic, increased shipping to fulfill direct sales pressure the gross margin rate in all our businesses, totaling 150 basis points of the overall decline, driven mainly by Schuh's much higher level of digital sales due to store closures.
Given the accelerated shift of our business from stores to digital and the impact from the pandemic, we continue to make progress on reshaping our cost structure with rent expense as a critical component.
As we enter back-to-school late in Q2, we assume that schools will return to in-person learning this fall with which should be a more normalized back-to-school selling season for Journeys and Schuh.
