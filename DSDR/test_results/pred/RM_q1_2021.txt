In the second quarter, we expect total revenue yield to be approximately 30 basis points lower than the first quarter, and our interest in field to be approximately 20 basis points lower due to the impact that the third and largest stimulus payment is expected to have on our higher-yielding small loan portfolio.
Our digital investments and geographic expansion will also offer new products to our customers including our new auto secured product which we began testing in the first quarter, and we expect to roll out to all our states by the end of the third quarter.
