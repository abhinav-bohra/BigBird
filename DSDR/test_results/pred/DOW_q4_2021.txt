The consumer solutions business achieved higher net sales year over year, with local price gains in all regions and across end market applications.
Turning to Slide 8.
We delivered operating EBIT growth of $1.2 billion year over year with margin expansion in every operating segment.
And finally, as we highlighted at our investor day, we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to $2.2 billion, well within our DNA target, as we continue to advance our higher return, faster payback projects, and execute on our decarbonize and grow strategy.
And we expect the elevated energy costs in Europe will be a $75 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment.
Our competitive advantage enables us to meet the increasing needs of our customers and consumers who are demanding more circular and sustainable products while we work to achieve zero carbon emissions in our own operations.
In industrial intermediates and infrastructure, strong demand for our high-value materials in appliances, construction, pharma, home care, and energy applications, combined with tight supply and increased global infrastructure investment, are supporting a constructive demand outlook.
Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $118 million, and operating EBIT margins declined 280 basis points, primarily driven by higher energy costs in Europe and our planned maintenance turnaround activity.
