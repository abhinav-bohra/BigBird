So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter, strong top-line growth in both Proprietary and contract manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow, our sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct of approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion.
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 17.9% was a 180-basis point increase from the same period last year, largely attributable to our Proprietary Products' gross profit expansion.
Our second priority is the continuity of manufacturing and supply of components and solutions to our customers.
On Slide 8, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter.
Sales price increases contributed $6.6 million or 1.5 percentage points of growth.
