Having said that, we continue to see improvements in our efficiency ratios, being 1.27% of equity for the fourth quarter in comparison to 1.32% in Q3 of 2020 and 1.62% for the full year, compared to 1.84% for the prior year.
On the hedging side, we added to our treasury features and swaption positions, mostly in the 10-year part of the yield curve which benefited from the steepening in the fourth quarter.
