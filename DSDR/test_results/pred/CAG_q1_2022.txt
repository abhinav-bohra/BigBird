The majority of our domestic retail pricing actions, however, just started to hit the market at the end of Q1 in response to the inflation we spoke to you about on our Q4 earnings call in July.
As you can see, on a two-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the first quarter increased 7% and adjusted earnings per share grew by nearly 8%.
As a reminder, we expect our first quarter this fiscal year to benefit the least from our inflation-justified pricing actions.
We are reaffirming our adjusted operating margin guidance to remain at approximately 16%.
Our ability to deliver solid results amid such a dynamic environment reflects the continued dedication of our team, as well as the strength of our brands and the Conagra Way playbook.
