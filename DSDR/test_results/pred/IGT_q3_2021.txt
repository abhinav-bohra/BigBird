On the back of very strong year-to-date results, we are raising our outlook as we currently expect to deliver revenue of approximately $4.1 billion, operating income of about $900 million and total depreciation and amortization of between $700 million and $725 million.
In summary, I would like to highlight that we reached a significant milestone this quarter with the year-to-date revenue and profit exceeding pre-pandemic results during the same period in 2019.
Operating income increased more than 140% year-on-year on high profit flow-through of global Lottery same-store sales growth, including a positive mix impact from Italy lottery sales and strong operating leverage across business segments, primarily associated with savings from the OPtiMa program.
The strength of our offer received important industry recognition, recently being named Product Innovation of the Year at the Global Gaming Awards in Las Vegas, and Technology Provider of the Year at the International Gaming Awards.
We delivered $113 million in cash from operations and $66 million in free cash flow during the third quarter.
