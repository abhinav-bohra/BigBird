The 9.9% renewal premium change was up more than 2 points from the third quarter of last year with strong renewal rate change of 6.3% and continued improvement in our customers' exposure growth.
Underlying underwriting income of $632 million pre-tax was 6% higher than in the prior-year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.
Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance.
To sum it up, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date.
The decline in core income was driven by prior-year reserve development and catastrophe losses.
Policies in force in both auto and homeowners were at record levels, driven by continued strong retention and growth in new business.
Turning to the top line, net-written premiums grew 7% to a record $8.3 billion.
We returned $821 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter with $220 million of dividends and $601 million in share repurchases.
