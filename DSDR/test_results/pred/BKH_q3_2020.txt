We also increased our five-year capital forecast to continue serving the growing needs of our customers and communities.
When looking at weather overall for this year's Q3, including the agricultural impacts, our Electric Utilities gross margin benefited by $1.6 million pre-tax compared to normal and our Gas Utilities gross margin benefited by $2.6 million pre-tax compared to normal.
Moving to Slide 4, I'd like to start, as we always do at Black Hills, with a focus on safety, the safety and the well-being of the people we work with and the communities we serve is paramount and we are committed to being on the forefront of safeguarding our co-workers and our customers at all times and especially now.
We also maintain strong liquidity to support our capital investment program.
A bit more color on that.
