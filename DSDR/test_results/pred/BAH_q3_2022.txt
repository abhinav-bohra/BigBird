Today, Lloyd and I will share our third quarter results in the context of our fiscal year 2022 guidance and our multi-year investment thesis.
We are now on Slide 6.
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $222 million, up 8% from the prior-year period.
And while top line growth and cash did not deliver at the levels we anticipated, we are delivering the bottom line results we need to invest in our business and our people to achieve our long-term growth initiatives.
Gross revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.10 to $4.30.
Total backlog grew approximately 19.2% year over year to $27.8 billion.
