Core FFO, excluding promotes, will range between $4.45 and $4.55 per share or year-over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint.
In response to continued strong demand, we are forecasting development starts of $4.5 billion to $5 billion, with approximately 35% build-to-suits.
We expect net promote income of $0.55 per share for the year, almost all of which will occur in the third quarter and is driven by our PELF venture.
We will hit that target this year with more than $225 million from procurement and $75 million from Essentials.
