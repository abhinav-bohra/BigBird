Finally, e-commerce sales were up 36% to fiscal '20 and accounted for 22% of total retail sales, up from 17% in fiscal year '20, while we also held on to 88% of last year's gains even while having the majority of our stores open during the quarter.
Our performance over last year's Q4 was driven by store sales and, versus two years ago, by digital and branded wholesale sales.
The profitability achieved during the quarter provides strong evidence of the operating margin expansion that we are continuing to see with our footwear-focused strategy as well as our ability to execute our growth algorithm.
We generated $240 million of operating cash flow, putting us in a great position to further invest in our business and return over $80 million to shareholders through share repurchases equal to 9% of outstanding shares, and we delivered record adjusted earnings per share of $7.62, an increase of more than 65% over fiscal '20.
Turning now to the current year.
