Excluding inventory related charges of $6.7 million in the current quarter and $6.9 million in the year-earlier quarter, our operating margin was up 250 basis points year-over-year to 12.1%.
As we position our business for growth in 2022 housing revenues, we believe that our fourth quarter SG&A expense ratio will remain roughly the same as the second and third quarters of this year or approximately 10%.
While we recognized that returns across the industry have expanded, our rate of improvement is meaningful and we believe our return on equity in the low to mid 20% range is sustainable.
We anticipate a return on equity this year of about 20% and further expansion in 2022, supported by double-digit growth in revenues and community count, with higher margins, as well as our recent share repurchase.
In the third quarter, our overall average selling price of homes delivered rose to approximately $427,000 from approximately $385,000, reflecting the strength of the housing market.
Overall, we reported net income for the third quarter of $150.1 million or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $78.4 million or $0.83 per diluted share for the prior year period.
We expect approximately 200 new community openings over the next five quarters to drive sequential increases in ending community count.
We expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 24% including a small favorable impact from energy tax credits compared to approximately 16% for the year-earlier period.
