Included in our first quarter operating expenses were SAP implementation and support costs of $3.4 million compared to $2.4 million in the prior year quarter.
I'm pleased to discuss our first quarter financial results with you today.
Selling expenses increased nearly 2% to $28.5 million, primarily due to increased personnel costs and commissions in cash profit sharing, partially offset by lower stock-based compensation and advertising and promotion expenses.
We ended the quarter with $305.8 million in cash on hand, after drawing down $150 million on our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility and ensure our working capital needs will be met in light of the current uncertainty, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.
We've been able to operate more efficiently, as evidenced by our 250 basis point improvement in our total operating expenses as a percent of sales for the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of 2019.
