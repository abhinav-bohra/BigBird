To be clear, the impact COVID-19 had during the first quarter on debt and equity markets affected our book value per share by approximately $0.45, made up of approximately $0.27 related to the balance sheet-only impact from the decline in the amount of unrealized gains in our fixed income portfolio with the remainder being attributable to the effect of unrealized losses on our equity securities reflected in the P&L and consequently in retained earnings.
On the expense side, the combined ratio increased seven points for the quarter to 94.1%, driven primarily by increased losses in connection with the continued diversification in the company's underlying business to states outside of Florida, an increase in core loss pick for 2020, an increase in prior year adverse development, partially offset by a lower level of weather events in 2020 and a small reduction in the expense ratio.
Our in-house claims and legal staff continue to deliver day in and day out for our company and for our reinsurance partners as we approach the finish line on these cat events.
