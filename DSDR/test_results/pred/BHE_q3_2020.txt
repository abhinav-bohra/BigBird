We expect that our gross margins will be 9% to 9.1% for Q4, and SG&A will range between $29 million to $30 million.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.32 for the quarter.
To this end, in the third quarter, we made the decision to exit a line of business in our A&D sector related to turbine machining.
In Q3, we delivered revenue of $526 million, which was up 7% sequentially from Q2, supported by strong demand in our defense, semi-cap and telco sectors and improved manufacturing productivity.
Our cash conversion cycle for the quarter improved to 81 days from 84 days in Q2.
During the first half of this year, we saw demand reductions in our core medical products in the cardiac, renal and orthopedic markets associated with trauma and elective surgeries as many of our existing customers and new customers reallocated their manufacturing and sales capacity in the fight against COVID.
In Q3, we continue to pay a quarterly cash dividend of approximately $5.8 million.
