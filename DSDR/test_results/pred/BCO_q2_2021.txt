Given the year-to-date impact of the pandemic and the uncertainty regarding the future impact we now expect full year 2021 percent revenue growth in the mid to high teens, and we continue to expect earnings to be around the midpoint of the range, reflecting higher margins.
It's important to note that our outlook for both 2021 and 2022 was driven primarily by growth in our core operations and does not include any material contribution from our Strategy 2.1 digital solutions, more on our core and digital strategies as well as on our 2023 financial targets at our Investor Day event in December.
