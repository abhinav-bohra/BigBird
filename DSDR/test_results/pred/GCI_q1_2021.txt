For the Digital marketing solutions segment, total revenue in the first quarter was $102.3 million, a decrease year-over-year of 12.7% on the same-store basis.
Now as of the end of the first quarter of this year, well ahead of our original goal of 300 million by the end of 2021.
On the same-store basis operating revenues decreased 16.5% as compared with the prior year quarter, due to the continued secular decline in print advertising and home delivery revenue, as well as the continued economic slowdown brought on by the pandemic.
We're showing a loss of 142.3 million on our income statement and we need to put that in perspective given the financing moves that we made in the first quarter, which significantly lower our cash outflows.
And we have a couple of new great examples to talk about this quarter, but going back to the last quarter, we highlighted our USA Today network ventures, which is our events and promotions business.
