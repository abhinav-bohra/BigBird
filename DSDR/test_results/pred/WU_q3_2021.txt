Overall, we achieved revenue growth in the quarter of 2% on a reported and constant currency basis, which was driven by 15% growth in digital and 31% growth in Business Solutions.
The consolidated GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 24.8% compared to 22.7% in the prior year period, while the consolidated adjusted operating margin was 25.2% in the quarter compared to 23.5% in the prior year period.
Revenue in the Europe and CIS region declined 3% on a reported basis or 5% constant currency on transaction growth of 3%.
GAAP earnings per share for the year is expected to be in the range of $1.80 to $1.85 compared to the previous outlook of $1.82 to $1.92, reflecting the tax impact related to the pending sale of Business Solutions.
Profitability was strong, with operating margin increasing to approximately 25%, as a result of solid Business Solutions revenue growth and lower planned marketing investments, which was partially offset as we continued to invest in our technology and global omnichannel platform.
Today, I will discuss third quarter results and our full year 2021 financial outlook.
Total C2C cross-border principal increased 4% on a reported basis or 3% constant currency, driven by growth in digital money transfer.
The digital partnership business continued to generate strong performance, driving regional transaction growth in the quarter and was the main contributor to the spread.
Constant currency revenue was impacted by U.S.
Note that M&A expenses are included in other operating margins for both the current and prior year period and segment margins exclude last year's restructuring charges.
