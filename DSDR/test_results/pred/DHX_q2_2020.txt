Second-quarter revenue for eFinancialCareers was $6.2 million, down 15% from the first quarter and 21% year-over-year, when excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates.
This success, along with the momentum we saw in signing new customers in the weeks leading up to the start of the pandemic in mid-March gives us great confidence that our focus on commercial accounts will be the cornerstone for our growth as the business environment normalizes.
We generated $7.1 million of operating cash flow in the second quarter compared to $11.1 million in the prior year quarter.
