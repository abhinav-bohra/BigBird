PPP loans added 17 basis points to the net interest margin in the fourth quarter as the level of net interest income from PPP increased $8.8 million compared to the third quarter, offsetting 3 basis points of negative impact from higher average cash balances, and 3 basis points of lower purchase accounting benefit on acquired loans.
We expect full year expenses to be down slightly from the $720 million operating level in 2020 as we execute on our expense savings target of $20 million, while continuing to invest in technology and infrastructure in 2021.
