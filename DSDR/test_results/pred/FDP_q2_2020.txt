In our vegetable product line net sales were $35 million, compared with $43 million in the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower net sales due to the impact of the Mann Packing's voluntary product recall.
Overall, volume was 26% lower, unit pricing was 2% higher and unit cost was 1% higher than the prior-year period.
Gross profit decreased $21 million to $37 million compared with $58 million in the second quarter of 2019.
