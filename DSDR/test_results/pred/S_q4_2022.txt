I'm pleased to share that we ended the fourth quarter with double-digit year-over-year improvement in both our gross and operating margins.
We're investing in our business, which is the right strategy given the huge market opportunity and strong demand for our leading platform.
We added a record number of $100,000-plus ARR deals, a record number of million dollar-plus ARR customers and closed our largest ever net new customer contract, one of the most influential and leading global Internet companies.
Across all of our capabilities, our cloud workload protection and data retention modules have been the most outstanding, each delivering year-over-year ACV growth of over 10x.
