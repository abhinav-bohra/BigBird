The average selling price of our net orders increased by 3% year-over-year, driven by price increases implemented over the past 12 months as well as a shift in mix to California, which has our highest average price.
Backlog conversion for the third quarter may be slightly lower than the third quarter of 2019 as a result of the significant increase in June orders compared to the prior year, which we are unlikely to deliver in the third quarter.
Our total dollar SG&A expense for the 2020 second quarter was up $9.6 million year-over-year, mostly due to variable selling and marketing expenses that increased in line with the 21% increase in home sale revenues during the period.
The combination of low interest rates, constrained existing home supply and a heightened interest in single-family home ownership has resulted in a very favorable environment for our industry.
Our general and administrative expense was up only modestly for the second quarter as increases in stock-based compensation and bonus expense, driven by strong operating results during the quarter, were partially offset by cost reduction measures implemented at the outset of the pandemic.
Gross margin from home sales for the 2020 third quarter is expected to again approximate 20%, excluding impairments and warranty adjustments, consistent with the 2020 second quarter.
Both our homebuilding and financial services businesses contributed to these year-over-year improvements as pre-tax income from our homebuilding operations increased $23.3 million or 38%, and our financial services pre-tax income increased $14 million or 110%.
Another driver of our order success has been our continued focus on a build-to-order model.
