Driven by our strong sales and merchandise margin rate expansion, non-GAAP EBT was $733.3 million, or 7.65% of net sales, and on a non-GAAP basis, increased $292.8 million, or 262 basis points from the same period last year.
In total, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.43, compared to non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.32 last year, an 84% year-over-year increase.
The balance of the deleverage was primarily due to $47 million of incremental COVID-related compensation and safety costs, as well as the $30 million donation we made to the DICK'S Foundation, most of which was in Q4.
Our consolidated same-store sales increased a record-setting 9.9%, which was on top of our 3.7% comp increase from the prior year.
Also in 2021, we will build on our momentum from 2020 and drive growth in important categories, including golf, athletic apparel, footwear and team sports, as well as in fitness, we saw significant gains throughout the pandemic.
SG&A expense is expected to deleverage versus both 2019 and 2020.
Now on to our results.
