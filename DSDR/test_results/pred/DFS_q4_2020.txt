While our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, our outstanding credit performance combined with the actions we took to reduce our funding costs and control our expenses, enabled us to exit the year with a 30% ROE in the fourth quarter.
Excluding one-time items, expenses were down 4% from the prior year.
Turning to Slide 7.
The 30-plus delinquency rate was 55 basis points lower than last year and increased 16 basis points from the prior quarter.
To wrap up credit, this was another quarter of strong performance across all of our lending products driven by the actions we've taken in underwriting, line management and collections, the resiliency of our prime customer base and the impact of government stimulus.
We also remain committed to disciplined expense management and we'll continue to invest to drive profitable long-term growth and efficiency improvement.
We believe that losses will increase in the second half of 2021 and into 2022.
Lower interest charge-offs and a favorable mix of promotional rate balances also contributed to the margin expansion from the prior quarter.
