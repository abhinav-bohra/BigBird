This quarter, we completed over 170,000 square feet of leasing of which more than 100,000 square feet was on vacant space.
So in summary, after adjusting for $0.06 of high terminate higher termination income and deferred expenses from the second quarter, we project our in-service portfolio for the 3rd quarter to be higher by $0.02 at the midpoint and our net acquisition and disposition activity to contribute a penny.
We expect to see improvements during the rest of the year and at the end of the year we think we're going to be at about 70% of where we were in 2019 on a full-year comparative basis.
The leases signed in the second quarter had a weighted average term of 7.5 years, many are expanding, as was the case with 2 large media and tech clients in LA and building quality is increasingly important as evidenced by strong tour and leasing activity at the GM Building, Reston Town Center, Colorado Center and the view floors at Embarcadero Center.
We now have new signed leases for 640,000 square feet of space that have yet to commence and are not included in our occupied in-service portfolio.
