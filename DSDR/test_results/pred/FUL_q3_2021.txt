Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $111 million was up 5% versus the same period last year and adjusted earnings per share were $0.79, up 4% versus the third quarter of last year, driven by strong volume growth, pricing gains and good cost controls offset by higher raw material cost.
All three GBUs had double-digit organic growth versus 2020 with Engineering Adhesives and Construction Adhesives up over 19% year-on-year and HHC up 13%.
We are also demonstrating our ability to price based on the value our critical adhesive solutions provider our customers.
