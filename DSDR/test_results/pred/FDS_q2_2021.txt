For the first half of fiscal 2021, we grew our revenue by 6%, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points and increased our adjusted earnings per share by 9% year-over-year.
Given our solid first half performance and improved visibility for the rest of the year, we are bringing up the lower end of our organic ASV plus professional services growth guidance range from $55 million to $70 million, so our full range is now $70 million to $85 million.
The Americas growth accelerated to 6%, driven by strong sales of workstations and research and wealth solutions and data feeds in CTS solutions.
The efforts we've made through our investment strategy are starting to drive our top-line and we delivered a strong first half due to our ability to execute on our pipeline with continued discipline.
