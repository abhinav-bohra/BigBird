Total WWE revenue was $263.5 million, a decline of 9% due to the cancellation of live events, including a large scale international event and the associated loss of merchandise sales, all due to COVID-19.
We look at the success we continue to have in India and the United Kingdom, we're excited to replicate that and to grow it further.
As a reminder, the year-over-year rise in television production costs reflects the impact of our investment in WWE ThunderDome relative to the lower cost of producing content from our training facility, as we did exclusively in the second quarter of last year.
