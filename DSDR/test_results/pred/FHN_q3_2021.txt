Moving to slide 9, net interest income was down $5 million linked quarter given the expected decrease tied to lower merger accretion and PPP portfolio balances, core net interest income was up 1% as the benefit of lower deposit cost, day count, commercial loan growth, and higher investment portfolio income was partially offset by continued declines in consumer loan balances and overall loan spread compression, given the continued reductions in LIBOR and the competitive landscape.
Given some higher cost tied to integration of our platforms along with higher costs due to markets reopening, much of which is marketing, as well as the seasonality and the idiosyncratic items, our expenses were up 3% in the quarter.
And with interest-bearing deposit costs down 3.3 basis points to 17 basis points for the quarter, our total funding costs improved 2 basis points.
As our capital levels remain strong with a CET1 ratio of around 10.1%, we increased our capital return by nearly 60% in the quarter, repurchasing 9 million shares of common stock and ended the quarter with a tangible book value per share of $10.88.
We believe our more diversified model and highly attractive franchise will continue to deliver revenue synergies and loan growth.
Overall we continue to make solid progress across the combined organization, and we're pleased to see evidence of the power of the MOE starting to emerge.
