Overall sales were great for Asia Pacific continue to be strong, but did sequentially declined compared to the first quarter due to unusually strong demand in the first quarter in our China metalworking business, but this is largely due to certain customers replenishing their supply chain in the first quarter.
We expect raw material prices to stabilize by the end of the 3rd quarter and we expect our product margins to get back to their targeted levels as we exit the year.
