For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT.
In Surgical Structural Heart, first quarter 2021 global sales was $213 million, increased 7% on an underlying basis over the prior year.
The improvement in our sales performance during the quarter was choppy, but we exited the quarter in a stronger position and that gives us continued confidence in our outlook for the balance of the year.
Also earlier this month, we received approval to begin treating patients at low surgical risk in Japan with SAPIEN 3.
And in Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies, or TMTT, I'm pleased to announce that the first patients were recently treated with EVOQUE Eos, our next-generation Transcatheter Mitral Replacement System.
Now, turning to our first quarter results.
As a company, we expect that Edwards will be positioned even stronger and be able to help more patients than ever before as the world emerges from the pandemic.
We remain confident in our long-term patient-focused strategy on our innovation pipeline.
Well, we are encouraged by the start to our year.
