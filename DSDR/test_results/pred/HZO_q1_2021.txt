Among these are improving margins on new and used boat sales, impressive service and storage performance of SkipperBud's, which has a long track record of performance in these categories, growth in our higher margin finance and insurance businesses, and growth in our brokerage business including our global Superyacht Services Organizations of Northrop & Johnson and Fraser Yachts.
Then, I will touch on how we are strategically approaching the important peak selling season, as well as discussing the meaningful opportunities in front of us to create growth and long-term shareholder value.
For the quarter we are particularly pleased with our continued solid performance in same-store sales, which increased over 20% which is on top of 24% same-store sales growth a year ago.
Beyond leaner industry inventory, we continue to invest in training and tools to ensure our team is able to pivot to continue to meet the needs of our customers digitally.
The combination of gross margin expansion and focused expense management resulted in considerable leverage and a record $1.04 of earnings per share for the quarter.
