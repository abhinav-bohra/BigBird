For the third quarter of 2021, Tennant reported net sales of $272 million, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year, which included a favorable foreign currency effect of 1.2% and a divestiture impact of negative 2% related to the sale of our Coatings business in the first quarter of 2021.
Net income in the third quarter was $21.5 million or $1.14 per diluted share compared to $11.7 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the year ago period.
To minimize the impact of higher freight costs and related supply disruptions, we continue to prioritize local-for-local and region-for-region manufacturing and sourcing to allow us to manufacture our products closer to our customers.
As Fay will discuss, while our revised full year guidance reflects what continues to be a challenging operating environment, our team remains committed to meeting the needs of our customers and executing against our enterprise strategy to deliver on our long-term financial commitments.
