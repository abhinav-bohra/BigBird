While our LOE-rate was lower than this for the first half of the year, as we look to the balance of the fiscal year, we expect to see slightly higher LOE due to the increased levels of maintenance over the spring and summer months.
As we approach the online date for Leidy South and the winter heating season, we expect to accelerate our completion operations and we plan to delay turning in line most of these new wells until early fiscal 2022, coinciding with the expected in-service date of our new capacity.
As it relates to the rest of the year, based on our strong second quarter results, we've increased our earnings guidance to a range of $3.85 to $4.05 per share, up $0.15 at the midpoint.
Our FM100 project is under construction and on schedule, which positions our pipeline, upstream, and gathering businesses for significant near-term growth.
