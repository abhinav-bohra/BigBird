Higher feedstock cost and lower seasonal demand during summer holidays reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets resulting in a third quarter EBITDA of $474 million, $234 million lower than the second quarter.
We continue to see strong demand for our products as we begin the fourth quarter.
In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated a record $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward the $5.4 billion of cash generated over the last 12 months.
At full capacity and historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA for our company.
