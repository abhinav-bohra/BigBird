In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 7% as pricing gains and volume growth more than offset higher raw material and logistics costs.
Organic growth for Industrial Solutions was up mid-teens for the full year as well.
Our target is to have a signed agreement by the end of the first quarter with the closing in the fourth quarter of this year.
For W&P, 17% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of a 12% increase in volume, including volume gains in all three businesses, and 5% pricing gains.
Turning to Slide 7.
From an earnings perspective, we reported fourth quarter operating EBITDA of 973 million and adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 per share, up 5% and 54%, respectively, from the year-ago period.
Our top-line performance also reflects significant pricing actions we took to offset $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter.
And finally, because of our ability to complete this transformation while maintaining a strong balance sheet, we will be in a position to generate value for all stakeholders through organic and inorganic investment in our businesses and by staying committed to our dividend and share repurchases as we announced today.
