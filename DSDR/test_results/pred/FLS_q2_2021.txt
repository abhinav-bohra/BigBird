Based on the combination of our strong first half bookings, driven mostly by shorter-cycle aftermarket and MRO activities and visibility into improving end markets, Flowserve was pleased to increase our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the full year to $1.45 to $1.65.
Second quarter reported operating margin increased 330 basis points year-over-year to 8%, including the $57 million reduction of adjusted items.
To date, actual spending in this area is still very [Technical Issues] but we expect it to grow substantially in the quarters and years ahead based on the commitments of our customers -- the commitments that our customers are making as well as from the potential for increased regulation and costs associated with emissions.
Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2021.
We are confident in our ability to continue to grow the Flowserve enterprise and ultimately restore our bookings to pre-pandemic levels in the coming quarters.
As I mentioned earlier, we estimated that roughly $30 trillion of energy transition-related investment over the next 10 years will be focused on energy efficiency.
