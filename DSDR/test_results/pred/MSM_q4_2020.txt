As Erik mentioned, Mission Critical includes growth investment, and that will be in the range of about $15 million in our first year of the growth program which is 2021.
Our average daily sales in the fiscal fourth quarter were $11.7 million, a decrease of 12.7% on an ADS basis versus the same quarter last year.
We believe that the actions we've taken recently, and those that we're taking now and into the near future, build to this level of outperformance over time.
