Now looking at our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter, our inventories were $103.6 million, which was up $13.7 million over the December 31, 2020 balance and down $6.9 million versus the first quarter of last year's balance.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the results of our operations in the first quarter of this year.
Our fixed and discretionary type SG&A expenses for 2021 are expected to be in the $265 million to $268 million range, a slight increase over our previous 2021 estimate due to rising benefit costs.
We expect that we will be able to match or exceed the same flow of product in Q2.
I'd like to provide an update on our operations during the quarter, specifically, our supply chain efforts as well as our distribution, home delivery and service areas.
