Now turning to our P&L and segment performance for the second quarter.
This time of year is also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business, which is why we're committed to serving our guests, our team members and our communities.
Segment profit margin grew by 140 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodities inflation.
For the rest of the fiscal year, we expect commodity and labor inflation to peak in our third quarter and then start to slow down as we enter the fourth quarter and lap commodities inflation of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year.
We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels, same restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31% and 35 to 40 new restaurants.
People and product will continue to be our focus and Rick will share more details about that in a minute.
Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 22% versus pre-COVID as this segment continues to see a strong rebound in performance.
