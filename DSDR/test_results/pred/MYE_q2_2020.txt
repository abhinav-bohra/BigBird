As a result, the segment's adjusted operating income margin was 4.4% compared with 8.7% for the second quarter of 2019.
For the full year, we now anticipate a percentage sales decline in the mid to high single-digit range, which is a slight improvement from our previous expectation of an approximate 10% decline year-over-year.
The increases we saw from the fuel container sales in the consumer end market, and the Tuffy acquisition in the distribution segment were more than offset by sales decreases across the rest of our end markets.
This was due to solid operational execution and favorable price-cost margin, which more than offset the lower sales volume during the quarter.
For the second quarter of 2020, we generated free cash flow of $3.7 million compared with $9.4 million last year.
