Fee revenue growth in the quarter for our consolidated Executive Search business was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially while our RPO and Professional Search business was up 76% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.
Earnings and profitability also continued to grow for KF Digital in the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $28.6 million and a 32.2% adjusted EBITDA margin.
In the second quarter, Consulting generated $164.9 million of fee revenue, which was up approximately $38 million or 30% year-over-year and $16 million or 11% sequentially.
As I mentioned earlier, new business in the second quarter grew to a new all-time high and it actually accelerated each consecutive month in the quarter and that positions us with a very strong backlog entering our third fiscal quarter.
We continue to take our balanced approach to allocation of capital.
New business wins for both RPO and Professional Search were also extremely strong in the second quarter, reaching new all-time highs.
