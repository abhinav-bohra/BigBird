Interest expense decreased to $2.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal '20, down from $5.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal '19 and decreased to $10.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal '20 and that was down from $16.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal '19.
The decrease principally reflects the previously mentioned lower gross profit margin, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales, mainly from lower performance-based compensation expense and lower acquisition-related expenses.
