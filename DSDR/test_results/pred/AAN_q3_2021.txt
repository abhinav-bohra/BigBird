On a same-store basis, lease and retail revenues increased 4.6% in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter.
As I mentioned last quarter, lease payment activity in 2021 has exceeded historical levels due to the government stimulus provided to our customer leading to higher lease renewal rates and lower write-offs as we saw in the third quarter and expect to see over the next three to four quarters, customer payment activity continues to normalize.
Adjusted EBITDA for the company was $53.6 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $64.3 million for the same period in 2020, a decrease of $10.7 million or 16.6%.
In addition to investments in our decisioning technology, we also continue to invest in our e-commerce channel and our GenNext strategy.
The increase in revenues was primarily due to the increased size of our lease portfolio, partially offset by the expected lower customer payment activity during the quarter and the reduction of 79 franchise stores during the 15-month period ended September 30, 2021.
We also expect lease merchandise write-offs in 2022 to settle below pre-pandemic levels but above the level we expect for full year 2021.
