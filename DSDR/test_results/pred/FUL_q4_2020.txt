We continue to meet high levels of demand for essential goods in the quarter, and our portfolio of adhesive solutions that enable more sustainable consumer products, drove strong growth in packaging, tissue and towel and tapes and labels.
Construction Adhesives' EBITDA margin was solid at 12.4%, down 80 basis points versus last year, reflecting unfavorable mix and an increase in variable compensation accruals as a result of the stronger top line results in the fourth quarter.
Revenues increased and margins improved sequentially throughout the year, and in the fourth quarter, we delivered 5% organic revenue growth with positive organic growth in each of our segments.
For the quarter, cash flow from operations of $139 million is up by 27% versus the same period last year, reflecting continued improvement in working capital performance.
