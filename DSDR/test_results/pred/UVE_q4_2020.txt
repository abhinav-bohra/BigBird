For the year, we generated earnings per share of $0.60 on a GAAP basis and a loss of $0.90 on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.
Despite the weather in 2020, we continued our focus on underwriting increasing our primary rates in Florida, close to 20% for the full year, including 7% in the 4th quarter for 2020 reinsurance costs as well as increases in some of our other states.
The full year increases were driven primarily by an increase of 13 points for increased weather in 2020.
