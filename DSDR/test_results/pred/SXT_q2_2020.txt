In summary, I expect mid-single digit revenue growth and mid to high single-digit operating profit growth for the Flavor Group for the remainder of the year.
Excluding divestiture-related costs and the results of operations to be divested, consolidated adjusted revenue was $294.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $302.8 million in the second quarter of 2019.
The impact of COVID-19 on our Food & Beverage business is mixed.
However, profit in Personal Care in the quarter was down by more than 35% due to the lower demand in make-up and other personal care products, and that was the main reason for the Color Group's overall decline in profit.
I'm pleased with the progress we had made in the first six months of this year.
Based on current trends, the Company is increasing our GAAP earnings per share guidance to $2.10 to $2.35.
Pharmaceutical had a nice quarter, up double-digits and natural colors continues to grow and that product line is up mid-single digits for the year.
