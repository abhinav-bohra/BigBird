In our vegetable product line, net sales were $42 million compared with $46 million in the third quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower sales volume as a result of the COVID-19.
Overall, volume increased 15%, unit pricing decreased 1% and unit cost decreased 1% compared with the prior-year period.
Adjusted gross profit for the quarter was $69 million compared to $76 million in the third quarter of 2019.
As compared with our third quarter of 2019 performance for the segment, the COVID-19 pandemic affected our net sales of fresh and value-added products by an estimated $56 million during the quarter, driven by reduced demand in our foodservice channel and shifting demand at retail due to the pandemic.
The decrease was primarily due to lower selling and marketing expenses in the Middle East and cost savings initiatives in North America.
