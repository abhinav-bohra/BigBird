As such, in Q2, we expect to incur approximately $5 million to $6 million of costs relating to the towage and initial milestone payments to the recycling yard, which represents the most part of our remaining cost associated with the unit, with only minimal cost expected to be incurred after Q2.
In the first quarter, we reported consolidated adjusted net income of 11 million, or $0.11 per share, up from 3 million, or $0.03 per share in the prior quarter.
