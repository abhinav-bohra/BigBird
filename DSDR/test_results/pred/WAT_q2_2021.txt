As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies.
Our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share for the second quarter increased 24% to $2.60 in comparison to $2.10 last year.
At current rates, the positive currency translation is expected to add approximately one to two percentage points, resulting in a full year reported sales growth guidance of 14% to 17%.
Moving on to our second priority on Slide 8.
In the first half of the year, we saw good momentum in our market segments driven by robust demand and strong commercial execution.
This includes a positive currency impact of approximately three percentage point at today's rates and also assumes no adverse demand or supply impact from COVID.
Looking at the third quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 9%.
Turning to free cash flow, capital deployment and our balance sheet.
