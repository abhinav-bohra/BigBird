In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Surgical Structure Heart guidance, we now expect underlying sales growth in the mid-teens versus our previous expectation of high-single-digit growth.
Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our sales grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis and we estimate that total TAVR procedure growth was comparable.
We remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity as patients and clinicians increasingly understand the significant benefits of TAVR therapy, supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence.
In TAVR, second quarter global sales were $902 million, up 48% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period or 14% on a two year compounded annual basis.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect research and development expenses as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range.
Edwards' growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad based across all countries.
Average shares outstanding during the second quarter were 630 million, down from the prior quarter as we repurchased 1.3 million shares during the second quarter for $112 million.
We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025 and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease.
There were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter.
