We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint versus Q3 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 7% year-over-year.
Our outlook for adjusted cash from operations has weakened further the EBITDA, driven by somewhat higher-than-expected working capital due to shifts in timing of sales to the latter part of the second half of the year, which will shift some collections into the following year, as well as higher inventory driven partially by elevated raw material costs.
Moving to slide 20.
In Latin America, sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically.
Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range.
This is all Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr sales and includes FMC sales of branded products and sales to our partners.
On the revenue line for the third quarter, we are expecting a 6% contribution from volume, 1% contribution from price and 1% benefit from FX.
