To conclude, I'm confident in our plans for the second half of the tax season, and we are on track to deliver our financial objectives for the fiscal year.
Consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we expect these client growth and net average charge expectations along with Wave to result in revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%.
We continue to expect interest expense of $90 million to $100 million and capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million.
While we're excited about the progress we're making in our product and in the value we're delivering for our clients, we believe we can improve both our volume and net average charge result in the second half and have already taken the appropriate steps.
