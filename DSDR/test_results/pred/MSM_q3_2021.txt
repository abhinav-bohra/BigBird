Our cumulative savings for the first half of fiscal '21 were 17 million, and we saved another 12 million in our third quarter bringing our year-to-date savings to 29 million against our goal of 25 million by the end of this year.
For fiscal '21, we expect a low single-digit total company growth, and we aim to achieve gross margins that are flat with fiscal '20.
