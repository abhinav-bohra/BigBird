Our Electric Distribution business earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared with earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2020.
As you can see on the slide, by the end of this year, we will have invested $55 million in our Massachusetts Electric Vehicle program helping to connect about 4,000 charge ports.
We also continue to project long-term earnings per share growth in the upper half of the range of the 5% to 7% through 2025 excluding the impact of our new offshore wind projects.
