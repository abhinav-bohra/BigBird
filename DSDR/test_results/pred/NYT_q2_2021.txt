Both operating costs and adjusted operating costs are expected to increase approximately 18% to 20% compared with the third quarter of 2020 as we continue investment into the drivers of digital subscription growth and comp against another quarter of low spending last year as a result of actions taken during the first year of the pandemic.
Total subscription revenues are expected to increase approximately 13% to 15% compared with the third quarter of 2020 with digital-only subscription revenue expected to increase approximately 25% to 30%.
As with subscriptions, the biggest factor in the gain in advertising amortize up nearly 80% year-on-year and more than 22% over the same period in 2019.
We now have more than eight million paid subscriptions across our digital and print products, a testament to the success of our strategy, the strength of the market for paid digital journalism and our unique opportunity to meet that demand.
Product development costs increased by approximately 28%, largely due to growth in the number of engineers employed and a higher incentive compensation accrual than we had recorded in the second quarter of 2020.
We saw moderated growth in net subscription additions in the second quarter, which we expected given that Q2 is traditionally our softest of the year, and we were comparing against last year's historic results at the beginning of the COVID crisis.
