Given our strong start to the year, we're pleased to announce an increase in our guidance for 2021 core FFO by approximately 6% from a range of $2.55 to $2.62 per share to a range of $2.70 to $2.75 per share.
As Jay mentioned, we reported today rent collections of approximately 97% for the first quarter, 98% for April rent collection.
So we ended the first quarter with $311 million of cash in the bank, a 0 balance on our $900 million line of credit, no material debt maturities until 2024 and an average debt duration of over 13 years.
