For the full year, our revenue was up 4% and earnings per share was up 202% from the prior year.
In our private capital advisory business, we have strong teams in Europe and Asia, and are in the process of rebuilding in the U.S., with an increased focus on higher value-added transactions.
For the quarter, interest expense was $3.5 million, as we continue to benefit from low market rates and debt reduction.
Our income taxes were considerably lower than last year, as our income was skewed to lower rate jurisdictions.
