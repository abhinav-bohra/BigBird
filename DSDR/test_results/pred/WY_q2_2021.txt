Timberlands earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter.
We expect our third quarter sales realizations and log sales volumes to be generally comparable to the second quarter.
Fiber costs were slightly higher in the quarter, primarily for Canadian logs.
Our balance sheet is extremely strong and with year-to-date adjusted FAD of nearly $1.9 billion, we expect to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.
For Engineered Wood Products, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-joists products as we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases.
