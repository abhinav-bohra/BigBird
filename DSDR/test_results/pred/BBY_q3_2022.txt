We expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year.
In addition, we are also starting to leverage our industry-leading and convenient buy-online-pick-up-in-store experience in partnerships with our vendors.
