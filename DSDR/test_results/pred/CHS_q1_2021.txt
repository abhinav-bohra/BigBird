Our first-quarter results underscore the tremendous progress we are making in our turnaround strategy and the power of our three unique brands and being a digital-first, customer-led company.
The year-over-year average age of new customers dropped 10 years at Chico's.
On-hand inventory levels, which were down 29% versus last year's first quarter and down 21% compared to the first quarter of 2019, drove more full-price sales and generated a solid gross margin in the first quarter.
All three brands and digital sales grew year over year.
The business strategy put in place in Soma around inventory, products, marketing, and digital is working, and we have every confidence applying the same strategy as Chico's and White House Black Market will continue the apparel sales momentum.
