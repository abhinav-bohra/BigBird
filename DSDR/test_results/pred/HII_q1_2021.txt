Excluding the impact of pension, diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $3.56 compared to $2.43 in the first quarter of 2020.
Technical Solutions revenues of $259 million in the quarter decreased 18.3% from the same period last year, mainly due to the divestitures of both our oil and gas business in the San Diego shipyard on February one of this year, partially offset by a full quarter of results from Hydroid, which was acquired at the end of the first quarter of 2020.
This compares to cash from operations of $68 million and net capital expenditures of $66 million and free cash flow of $2 million in the first quarter of 2020.
We continue to view the remainder of our 2021 guidance as appropriate with the exception of the effective tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 18%.
