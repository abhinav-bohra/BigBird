In total, sales for the quarter increased 8% compared to last year, and the sales increased over 5% for the first half of the year.
And as we saw across many of our refrigerated foodservice businesses, demand for avocado products in the channel started to return during the quarter.
Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were flat to last year.
We are well positioned from an inventory and capacity standpoint to meet the demand from our distributor partners and operators, and are confident in our ability to gain share throughout the recovery.
In addition to foodservice growth, our retail and deli businesses also remained healthy with demand elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Through the strategic actions we have taken to improve all facets of our operations and based on our record first half performance, we expect to benefit from more normalized operations in the back half of fiscal 2021.
A recovery in the foodservice industry remains the key driver for higher prices for this important market.
