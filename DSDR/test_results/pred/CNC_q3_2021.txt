At the end of the third quarter our marketplace membership was $2.2 million, and we are pleased with the progress of our clinical initiatives as we head into the fourth quarter.
While we are getting some SG&A leverage on our growth in 2021, there is a lot more to come over the next few years, as we execute on the value creation plan.
Brent, Drew and I are leading this effort and we believe, we now have an organizational structure in place to drive this forward across our business and functions.
In the quarter, we generated revenue of $32.4 billion and HBR of 88.1% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26.
In addition, we look forward to offer members who will no longer qualify for Medicaid, the opportunity to enroll in our marketplace for us.
We continue to work with the regulators to move the transaction to completion.
Now turning to our value creation plan.
As always, we intend and continue to provide transparent updates, as we progress through our initiatives and I look forward to seeing many of you at our December Investor Day.
