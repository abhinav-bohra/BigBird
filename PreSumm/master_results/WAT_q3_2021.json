are significant problems to solve in separating and purifying these newer modalities , having a deeper understanding of reagents coupled with our chemistry expertise will allow us to solve these problems .", "second , in bioprocessing , the largest challenge i felt as an engineer in bioprocessing versus small molecule processing was that once you define the process , you got stuck with it because it was in a drug master file .", "we have to decouple the process from the product .", "separately , the process development time scales are longer versus small molecules , given the sheer complexity of attributes you need to measure .", "a simple and robust tool that can measure multiple attributes as a potential solution .", "we believe that the bio cohort is the right lcms tool that can begin to address this challenge .", "third area is diagnostics , where we need a fast unbiased detection of multiple biomarkers to enable early disease detection .", "we believe , again , mass spec has a significant role to play here .", "moving now on to slide 8 .", "let me illustrate what i mean by sharing what we are doing to solve some of the key problems in bioprocessing .", "last week , we announced a partnership with sartorius , a leader in bioprocessing .", "we will combine our water biocare system as a bioprocess analyzers with sartorius amber bioreactors , giving scientists both faster and at line direct access to advanced quality characterization information .", "scientists across sartorius , waters and some of our customers have already shown that the combined offering will shorten product development timelines considerably , taking what currently takes six weeks to analyze down to only two days .", "it also lays the foundation for using the biocore as a bioprocess analyzer for process control and quality testing in the future .", "bioaccord is both versatile and easy to use and we expect that process engineers will be able to master it 's operation within one to two weeks .", "in fact , one of our customers had summer interns use the bioaccord and gave raving reviews on how simple it is to use .", "i 'm also an engineer who have been out of the last for many years and i was able to learn quickly .", "resulting configuration will allow direct analysis of bulk substance not just cell culture media , while targeting over 250 cell culture media analytics .", "separately , we also announced a multiyear collaboration with the university of delaware to develop technology for analytical characterization of manufacturing processes for biologics and normal modality .", "through these partnerships , researchers from both waters and the university of delaware will identify and develop solutions that can provide better aseptic sampling , make sensor and analytical instrument improvements and develop data analytics and process control .", "this partnership will help us expand our capabilities to characterize biological manufacturing processes in order to drive improvements in quality , yield , efficiency and process control .", "in summary , 2021 so far has been a very successful year for waters .", "we are laser focused on our commercial execution

expenses increased by approximately 17 % on a constant currency basis and on a reported basis .", "the increase was primarily attributable to higher labor cost due to the normalization of prior year cost actions , as well as higher variable compensation on the higher sales volume .", "in the quarter , our effective operating tax rate was 11.7 % , a decrease from last year due to some favorable quarter specific discrete items .", "excluding the impact of these discrete items , our year - to - date tax rate is consistent with the prior year .", "our average share count came in at 61.9 million

like to provide you with some update on our thoughts for 2021 on slide 11 .", "throughout this year , we 've seen good momentum driven by robust end market demand and strong commercial execution .", "we believe that this momentum will continue and expect our near - term growth initiatives to continue to contribute meaningfully to our performance .", "looking at the fourth quarter , the comparison is more challenging as it was the first quarter in our transformation journey and was further favorably impacted by post lockdown elevated year - end budget plus spending .", "in addition , we have six fewer calendar days in the fourth quarter of this year .", "this dynamic supports raising full year 2021 guidance to 15 % to 16 % constant currency sales growth .", "at current exchange rates ,

currency impact of approximately two percentage points at today 's rate and assumes no material adverse supply impact from covid .", "looking at the fourth quarter of 2021 , we expect constant currency sales growth to be 5 % to 7 % .", "at today 's rates , currency translation is expected to subtract approximately two percentage points resulting in fourth quarter reported sales growth guidance of 3 % to 5 % .", "fourth quarter non-gaap earnings per fully diluted share are estimated to be in the range $ 3.40 to $ 3.50 .", "this includes a negative currency impact of approximately three percentage points at today 's rates and assumes no material adverse supply impact from covid .", "before i wrap things up , i would like to make a few comments on our esg efforts and our core
