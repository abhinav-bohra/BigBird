first three quarters of 2020 , net income is $ 18.6 million or $ 1.25 per share .", "for comparison purposes , recall that in the first quarter of 2019 , the company recognized a onetime net gain of $ 9.8 million , or $ 0.66 per share , on the company 's divestiture of its nonregulated business subsidiary , usource .", "adjusting for this onetime gain , net income is down about $ 4.4 million or $ 0.29 per share compared to 2019 .", "the year - to - date decrease in earnings is primarily due to the warmer than normal winter weather in q1 , which unfavorably affected net income by approximately $ 3.1 million or $ 0.20 per share .", "in addition to the warmer winter weather , we estimate that net income has been unfavorably impacted by approximately $ 0.04 per share due to the covid - 19 pandemic .", "and similar to last quarter , i 'd like to recap the company 's response to the covid - 19 pandemic .", "our highest priority continues to be the safety of our customers and of our

mission and vision , the interactive report can be found on our website at unitil.com .", "our sustainability goals primarily fall under three categories .", "first , we are focused on advancing the grid .", "the need to reduce carbon emissions has driven a fundamental transformation within the energy sector , as customers adopt new technologies and as clean renewable energy resources are increasingly distributed across the electricity delivery system , the fundamental architecture of the electric grid must advance .", "we are actively investing in five key areas that will support our objective of advancing the electric grid and transforming the customer experience .", "this includes advanced metering , grid intelligence , distributed energy , customer services and innovative rate design .", "these initiatives will provide customers with greater control and visibility into their energy use , enabling and will enable distributed energy resources , access to the system and advance the system security , safety and reliability .", "the company also believes that natural gas remains key to a sustainable future as a cleaner and more affordable option for our customers .", "we estimate that the impact over the last 10 years from our customers choosing natural gas rather than home heating oil has had the impact of taking roughly 60,000 cars off the road .", "nearly 2/3 of main households still rely on fuel oil as their primary energy source for home heating , a larger proportion than in any other state in the united states .", "in new hampshire , more than 2/5 of households rely on fuel oil , the second highest proportion of the nation behind maine .", "this unusually high penetration of fuel oil presents significant opportunities to reduce emissions through continued customer conversions to natural gas .", "as we continue to expand the availability of natural gas to more customers , we also will continue to replace outdated infrastructure and modernize our gas system .", "as a result , we decreased our fugitive emissions from natural gas distribution by 47 metric tons over the last two years , lowering our total generation of fugitive greenhouse gas

massachusetts service area .", "this energy storage system has the ability to serve over 1,300 homes for over two hours and is designed to reduce peak loading on the substation equipment .", "this project has a capacity representing over 2 % of our system peak in massachusetts and offers a solution to advanced grid operations control cost variability and aid in the overall system reliability as we support renewable energy solutions .", "i 'll begin with the sales and margin discussion on slide 10 .", "year - to - date 2020 , our electric gross margin was $ 70 million , a decrease of $ 0.6

with warmer summer weather relative to the prior year .", "c&i sales decreased 3.6 % , reflecting lower usage due to the covid - 19 pandemic .", "for the first nine months of 2020 , our gross gas margin was $ 83.3 million , a decrease of $ 2.2 million over 2019 .", "that decrease was driven principally by the historically warm winter weather in the first quarter , which we have discussed in the past .", "the company estimates that year - to - date gas margin was lower by $ 3.2 million due to warmer weather .", "we also estimate that the covid - 19 pandemic unfavorably affected gas margin

first nine months of 2020 natural gas therm sales decreased 7.1 % compared to 2019 .", "we attribute the decline in gas sales to the historically warm winter weather and the covid - 19 pandemic .",

.", "as i noted , 2020 year - to - date gross margin -- excuse me , gross sales margin is lower than 2019 by $ 2.8 million .", "core operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $ 0.9 million compared to the same period in 2019 .", "this decrease primarily is due to lower employee benefit costs of $ 1.2 million as well as lower maintenance expense of $ 0.3 million , partially offset by higher bad debt expense of $ 0.4 million and higher professional fees of $ 0.2 million .", "depreciation and amortization was higher by $ 1.7 million , reflecting higher levels of utility plant and service .", "taxes other than income taxes increased by $ 0.9 million , reflecting property taxes associated with higher levels of net plant and service and a nonrecurring tax abatement realized in

effect on gas and electric sales margin was $ 0.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $ 2 million year - to - date .", "the company has been able to largely offset the decline in revenue with lower expenses .", "although o&m expenses in the third quarter were minimal .", "year - to - date o&m expenses have been favorable by $ 0.7 million .", "that favorable variance was driven principally by lower health insurance claims , slightly offset by higher pandemic costs related to ppe supplies and cleaning expenses .", "as noted earlier , the company was able to lower taxes other than income taxes by $ 0.6 million by recognizing payroll tax credits associated with the cares act .", "to help stakeholders gauge the potential effect of covid - 19 pandemic on sales margin , the company has provided sensitivities between usage and margin for the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "now turning to slide 14 .", "in the third quarter , we received proceeds of $ 95 million of long - term debt .",

term plan .", "on slide 15 , we are pleased to announce that our gas transmission pipeline , granite state gas , recently filed an uncontested rate settlement with the ferc providing for an annual revenue increase of $ 1.3 million , with rates to become effective in the fourth quarter of this year .", "we reached that settlement with the new hampshire and maine state regulators and agencies .",

relationship with state agencies and regulators .", "our regulatory outlook in 2021 includes the planned filing of base rate cases in new hampshire for both unitil energy , our electric distribution utility , and northern utilities , our natural gas utility .", "we plan to file decoupling mechanisms in both cases .", "if those mechanisms are approved , the percentage of our decoupled sales to
