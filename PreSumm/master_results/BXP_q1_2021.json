service portfolio occupancy includes a 100 % of our jvs , ended the quarter 140 basis points down or 640,000 square feet .", "now 50 % of that space that was added to our vacancy this quarter provided no revenue over the last 12 months .", "that is , it was a space that we were trying to recapture from defaulted tenants .", "in other words , much of this drop in occupancy does n't reflect in any future revenue decline .", "this includes the lord & taylor box , that 's prudential center , where we are in active discussions that we expect will result in a dramatic increase in the revenue from that piece of space .", "the office space that was given back by ascena at times square tower and their ann taylor retail outlets at the prudential center .", "next quarter , we 're going to have another one of these as we take back the arclight cinema space since they 've officially ceased to operate .", "that 's a 66,000 square foot lease at the hub on causeway joint venture .", "and again , they never paid rent .", "also this quarter , we took back 62,000 square feet in a recapture , so we could expand a growing tenant that we are negotiating a lease extension on and expansion at colorado center .", "but that lease has n't been executed yet to the spaces in vacancy .", "we did have one disappointment , which was the 200,000 square foot departure at the santa monica business park .", "we , however , today , as i sit here talking to you , have 640,000 square feet of signed leases that have yet to commence , and they are not included in our occupied in - service portfolio .", "unless we 're actually booking revenue , we do n't consider it occupied .", "on a relative basis , my view of the ranking and the activity in our portfolio .", "so this is active lease negotiations , tours , rfps , is as follows , from top to bottom : boston waltham , we do n't really have any space in cambridge , so i do n't include that ; midtown manhattan is second ; the san francisco cbd is third ; northern virginia is fourth , followed by the silicon valley peninsula , west l.a. , princeton and the d.c. cbd .", "all of the transactions i am going to describe to you are post -covid negotiations having begun in the latter half of 2020 or 2021 .", "so let 's start in boston , which , by the way , represents over 1/3 of the company 's total revenue .", "so during the first quarter in the boston cbd , we did five leases totaling 37,000 square feet .", "and in every case , the starting rent represented a gross rent roll -
