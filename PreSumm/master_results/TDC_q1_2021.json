over - year and 11 % sequentially .", "this is due primarily to a lower cost based beginning fiscal 2021 , spending less in discretionary sg&a year - over - year , less sales commission expense in q1 2021 when compared to our traditionally high bookings in q4 2020 , and a focus on efficient operational execution .", "as a reminder , we undertook some cost actions in q3 2020 to drive operational efficiencies that funded reinvestment in our strategic cloud initiatives .", "turning to earnings per share , earnings per share of $ 0.69 significantly exceeded our outlook range of $ 0.38 to $ 0.40 provided last quarter , by $ 0.30 when using the midpoint .", "to provide some context are the main drivers of this $ 0.30 differential , approximately $ 0.16 is attributable to the few transactions where recurring revenue was recognized on an annual basis in the first quarter instead of on a quarterly basis throughout full - year 2021 .", "this has no impact on full - year 2021 eps .", "the remaining $ 0.14 was driven by the following and will impact full - year 2021 eps .", "the higher than expected perpetual revenue and related higher gross margins , higher than expected consulting revenue , and related higher gross margins , and better recurring revenue growth in operational efficiencies .", "turning to free cash flow , we had an excellent quarter of free cash flow generation driven by strong cash collections , higher operating margin , and other favorable working capital dynamics .", "free cash flow in the quarter was 105 million , well ahead of the pace needed to achieve the annual free cash flow outlook of at least 259 we provided at the beginning of the year .", "as an update to cash payments related to our q3 2020 cost actions , we previously expected to make total cash payments of approximately 42 million during fiscal 2021 and that 27 million was to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 .", "we now expect total cash payments in fiscal 2021 of 36 million .", "we paid 18 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 , and the remaining 18 million is expected to be paid during the remainder of fiscal 2021 .", "about 14 million of the remaining 18 million is expected to be paid in the second quarter .", "turning to stock buyback , we bought back 2.6 million shares at an average price of $ 32.94 or 85 million in total , as we take advantage of our strong balance sheet to buy back stock and offset dilution for shares issued this year .", "turning to our outlook , as a reminder , the outlook we 're providing is based on the financial reporting change that we made for 2021 and announced on our prior earnings call .", "to reiterate beginning in fiscal 2021 , we reclassified managed services related arr and revenue from recurring revenue and into non-recurring consulting revenue .", "and reclassified third party software related arr and revenue out of recurring revenue and into non-recurring perpetual revenue .", "accordingly , the year -
