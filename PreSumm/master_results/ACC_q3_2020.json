term earnings will , of course , be affected by the governmental and university actions taken in response to the pandemic , we believe that we are on a path to return to a relative level of normalcy both operationally and financially after achieving over 90 % for this fall despite the amount of ongoing online instruction as well as seeing significant reductions in delinquencies , refunds , and resident hardships as we have started the new academic year .", "like last quarter , we cannot completely isolate every item related to the pandemic , but we believe ffom was negatively impacted by approximately $ 19 million versus our original expectations for the quarter .", "and year - to - date , ffom has been negatively impacted by approximately $ 42 million to $ 43 million .", "total property revenue was approximately $ 27 million impacted for the quarter , with $ 15 million due to covid - related rent relief , lost summer camp revenue , increased bad debt , and wave fees .", "and $ 12 million due to lower opening occupancy for the fall semester relative to our original expectations .", "partially offsetting the loss revenue , property operating expenses were $ 7.5 million than -- lower than originally budgeted , as jennifer discussed .", "also as a result of the lower originally budgeted property noi , joint venture partners ' noncontrolling interest and earnings was approximately $ 700,000 lower , and ground lease expense was approximately $ 1.4 million less due to a reduction in outperformance rent being paid to our university ground lessor partners as well as disney 's agreement to waive ground rent on the disney college program housing until occupancy resumes .", "additionally , third - party management fee income was approximately $ 1.2 million lower than expected .", "and ffom contributed from our on - campus participating properties was almost $ 500,000 lower , due to university 's refunding a portion of rents and lower fall occupancies at properties in both of these business segments .", "lastly , we benefited from approximately $ 700,000 in g&a and third - party overhead expense savings relative to our original plan due to both reduced travel and payroll costs .", "due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the pandemic , we will not be reissuing earnings guidance for 2020 .", "if the current environment remains stable , though , we are hopeful that the reduction in revenue through the remainder of the year should be limited to the impact of the 90.3 % occupancy we achieved for the opening of the fall semester , and the $ 1.2 million in rent refunds that we have agreed to for the fourth quarter at one of our ace partnership universities .", "also , while delinquencies and resident hardships have improved significantly in september , we still expect to run at an elevated level of bad debt relative to the 1 % level we typically operated at prior to the pandemic .", "with regards to operating expenses , we will , of course , strive to be as efficient as possible and create savings that can help offset the lower revenue levels in the near - term .", "however , with the new academic year physical occupancy levels above 90 % and approximately $ 2.5 million to $ 3 million in expected additional annual costs for covid - related cleaning supplies and procedures , we do not expect to be able to create expense savings at the same levels we did in the second and third quarters .", "and finally , as discussed last quarter , we continue to believe the three third - party development projects at the university of california , irvine , cal berkeley , and concordia university , originally scheduled to commence in 2020 will be delayed until 2021 .", "these projects were expected to contribute a combined $ 4 million in development fee income in the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "again , while there will be some continued financial impacts of the pandemic into the immediate future , the progress that has been made gives us confidence that longer term , our operating results will return to normalized levels .", "in the meantime , we continue to have a strong and healthy balance sheet and substantial liquidity to allow us to absorb the disruption .", "as of september 30 , we had $ 44 million in cash on hand and over $ 720 million of availability on our corporate revolver , with no remaining debt maturities in 2020 , and a manageable $ 167 million in secured mortgage debt maturing in 2021 .", "also , as detailed on page s16 of our earnings supplemental , the remaining phases of the walt disney world project represent our only ongoing development with phases spanning through 2023 and only $ 201 million in remaining development capital needs .", "as of september 30 , the company 's debt to total asset value was 41.3 % , and net debt - to - ebitda was 8.1 times .", "it 's worth noting that excluding the impacts of covid on operating results this year , net debt - to - ebitda would be in the range of seven to 7.1 times .", "although our leverage levels are temporarily elevated relative to the targets we have historically communicated , we feel confident that with the three - year capital plan we layout on page s16 as well as the expected normalization of the ebitda , the company 's debt to total assets will return to the mid-30 % range and net debt - to - ebitda to the high five to low six times range ."], "summary_gold": "q3 ffo per share $ 0.32 .<q>q3 adjusted ffo per share $ 0.32 .", "summary_pred": "our lease -
