sequential cost inflation driven by higher natural gas , diesel and recycled and virgin fiber costs .", "this commodity cost inflation combined with our seasonal increase in healthcare cost is forecasted to be approximately $ 100 million higher than the fourth quarter .", "however , the good news is that we expect the flow - through of the price increases that we are implementing to more

and higher labor costs that may persist through the fiscal year .", "our planned mill maintenance outage schedule declines throughout the fiscal year , but will still be approximately 100,000 tons higher than in fiscal 2021 .", "given these assumptions , we forecast adjusted segment ebitda to be in the range of $ 3.3 billion to $ 3.7 billion .", "this range is driven by varying levels of commodity inflation .", "since the formation of westrock , we have been able to grow sales , earnings and adjusted free cash flows across various business cycles at attractive compounded annual rates .", "we have a resilient business model , which was reinforced with record adjusted free cash flows in fiscal 2021 in the face of many challenges .", "our outlook for fiscal 2022 continues the
