volume and price mix on net sales .", "our intent when we began providing this information was to reflect the impact of the conversion of our lighting products to led .", "today , our lighting business is fundamentally different .", "for example , our product life cycles are shorter and our pace of innovation has increased .", "we frequently and successfully introduced new features and benefits of products rather than just direct product substitutions .", "therefore , we believe our historical reference to price mix is no longer meaningful and is less descriptive of how we manage

believe have been postponed due to the pandemic .", "sales in this channel of $ 76 million were down 9.5 % in the quarter .", "our retail sales channel continues to be a bright spot with net sales up 3 % to $ 55 million , driven largely by higher demand primarily for residential products .", "finally , a key impact of the pandemic has been and continues to be delayed or canceled projects by large retail customers in our corporate accounts channel .", "net sales in this channel of $ 24 million were down 28 % as compared to the prior year .", "these retrofit opportunities were delayed or

consistent with our fourth quarter gross profit margin even on lower sales .", "gross profit margin was $ 332 million , down approximately $ 23 million from the year - ago period .", "this decrease in

quarter .", "the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to the recognition in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 of unfavorable discrete items related to the deductibility of certain compensation .", "we currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 23 % for fiscal 2021 .", "our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter
