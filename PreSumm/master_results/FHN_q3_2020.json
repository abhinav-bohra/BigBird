digit to low double - digit range , but expect that level to represent the bottom for nim going forward .", "moving on to slide 8 and 9 , i would note that here , we have provided our results versus prior period combined results for fhn and iberia .", "we delivered solid performance in fee income again in the third quarter with relatively stable results on a linked quarter basis and a 23 % year -

to - date total of $ 18 million .", "we understand the importance of remaining incredibly focused on utilizing cost control as a lever in this environment .", "we have unique advantages to be able to do so given our merger and we 'll continue to look for further expense reductions beyond our targeted merger savings .", "turning to slide 13 and 14 , you see a review of our loan growth and funding profiles relative to combined first horizon , iberia results .", "as expected , period end loan growth was modest as customer demand remains muted , pay - offs continue and utilization rates have returned to more normal levels .", "bright spot in the quarter was continued strong mortgage warehouse demand , which drove loans to mortgage companies up $ 1.6 billion on a spot basis and approximately $ 430 million on average .", "similar to fixed income and mortgage banking originations , the loans to mortgage companies functioned as a counter - cyclical , high return specialty business for us and we expect continued strong performance .", "on the liability side , period - end deposits were up $ 2.3 billion , driven by the branch acquisition primarily as well as continued strong customer inflows , which enabled us to run off higher cost non customer balances .", "given current levels of excess liquidity and our enhanced market presence , we expect to continue to move our interest bearing deposit costs lower , particularly as we move to align our pricing strategies across the footprint .", "we also further improved our funding profile with a $ 1.2 billion reduction in borrowings from 2q combined levels as we leveraged our excess liquidity to pay down legacy iberia that federal [ phonetic ] home loan bank advances .", "turning on slide 12 , we 'll cover asset quality over the next few slides .", "clearly , our results this quarter reflect the impact of the merger with a lot of moving parts .", "but if we step back , broadly speaking , overall asset quality continues to remain fairly benign so far outside of energy despite the impacts of covid - 19 .", "net charge - offs came in at 44 basis points , up from 20 basis points for legacy fhn driven by energy - related losses and we saw a relatively modest 6 basis point increase in npls to 75 basis points of total loans , despite the impact of the merger .", "on slide 13 , you see , we continue to add reserves this quarter as the impact of the merger and branch acquisition added $ 475 million to the allowance for credit losses .", "outside of merger math , we also built reserves by a modest $ 13 million .", "therefore , we ended the quarter with reserves of $ 1.1 billion , which is equivalent to 2.15 % of the loan portfolio , excluding the low risk ppp and loans to mortgage companies portfolios and about four times annualized net charge - offs .", "when you also factor in the unrecognized discount on acquired loans , we have total loss absorbing capacity of $ 1.3 billion or over 2 % of total loans .", "on slide 14 , we provide an update of our view around the portfolios that investors have been most focused on in terms of impacts from the pandemic .", "we continue to do very detailed portfolio reviews of industries currently affected and in the quarter , we reviewed in detail $ 9 billion of loans in the commercial portfolio across these various sectors .", "as a result of that , as well as other broader portfolio reviews , we believe that just under 11 % of our total loans should be and are subject to a heightened level of monitoring .", "we 've shown the sub sectors of the portfolio that may be more stressed such as real estate lending , energy , retail , trade and the non-fast food portion of our accommodation foodservice portfolio .", "it 's important to note that other sectors such as essential services , recreational goods , manufacturing and home improvement are continuing to perform well , and additionally our higher quality consumer portfolio is performing well as well with a weighted average fico score of 750 on a refreshed basis .", "as we 've mentioned to date , customers are proving to be more resilient than originally feared and overall stress appears to be declining .", "we 've provided data in the appendix on the reserve coverage across our portfolio , as well as on deferrals which have now declined meaningfully to around 2.4 % of federal loan balances from a peak of almost 13 % .", "overall , we continue to feel very comfortable with our risk profile and reserve levels , particularly after going through the very detailed process of marking the iberia loan book , which represents about 45 % of the portfolio .", "moving on to capital and tangible book value per share on slide 15 , as we mentioned , tbv per share of $ 9.92 remained relatively stable to second quarter as strong earnings were offset by the impact of the iberia merger and the truist branch acquisition and the cet1 ratio ended the quarter at $ 9.15 .", "near term , we expect to continue targeting a cet1 ratio in the 9 % to 9.25 % range .", "turning to slide 16 for merger integration update , we continue to be very energized as bryan said by the opportunities ahead of us in connection with our merger of equals .", "in the year since we announced the deal , we 've established a strong merger integration framework to help ensure that we capitalize on the opportunities in a highly efficient manner even in the face of the pandemic .", "we 've already done a great deal to align our cultures , processes and systems to ensure a successful integration .", "we 've completed much of hr related integration by identifying leadership and converting payroll systems .", "and on the customer side , we 've built out our go - to - market and organizational models , as well as finalizing our customer experience dashboard .", "we 're on track to convert various other platforms and are currently planning for the full systems conversion to occur in the fall of 2021 .", "again as bryan said , in the third quarter , we delivered $ 8 million of cost savings , bringing the year - to - date total to $ 18 million .", "and in the table on the right , we provided a modestly updated view of our expected saves over time .", "we continue to be highly confident in our ability to deliver at least $ 170 million of annualized savings in 2022 , but the path of the save got shifted by a quarter or so .", "this largely reflects the fact that we now believe it 's prudent to target a september - october system conversion versus the previous year of the late second quarter conversion .", "in the table on the right as well we 've provided the estimated timing of our merger savings on an annualized basis .", "in third quarter 2020 , our annualized expense base excluding incentives and commissions totaled about $ 1.52 billion , and based on our expectations for the timing of the merger sales , we believe that our 2021 expenses excluding incentives and commissions should reflect a low single - digit decrease .", "wrapping up on slide 17 , we believe we 're well positioned to capitalize on the benefits of our more diversified business model over time and through our iberia merger and the branch acquisition , we now have an expanded franchise across some of the most attractive markets in the south .", "as we 've demonstrated this quarter , we have a revenue mix that helps us offset nii pressure from the low rate environment .", "we also have the advantage of merger cost saves and through prior acquisitions and efficiency initiatives , we 've proven our commitment to expense controls .", "our prudent approach to risk management should help us mitigate credit losses going forward , and we have the benefit of the marked loan book and significant loss absorption capacity .", "while the economic environment remains challenging and loan demand is needed , it gives us the ability to focus on merger integration for the next year , and we believe our business model will result in outperformance and shareholder value creation in the quarters and years ahead .", "since i know they 're listening , i want to give a quick shout out to all those on our various teams across ir , accounting , finance , credit and technology in particular that have done an extraordinary work and have spent long hours getting us to this point .", "this is my 47th quarterly earnings call with first horizon and i 've seen a lot over the years , but the complexity and the uniqueness of this quarter and the year take the cake .", "we believe our strong balance sheet capital and liquidity will serve us well in this difficult operating environment .", "we 've maintained strong underwriting standards and built a diversified portfolio focused on profitability and performance in a downturn .", "despite the economic headwinds , we are uniquely positioned to capture merger opportunities with enhanced scale , better efficiency and improved earning power to create significant shareholder value .", "we are incredibly committed to continuing to assist our associates , communities and customers in efforts to overcome the impact of covid -
