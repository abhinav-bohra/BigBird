term target for the siding ebitda margin by 5 percentage points to 25 % .", "on slide 13 , very high market demand for osb pushed prices to record levels adding $ 246 million of revenue and ebitda in the quarter which rather overshadows both the continued excellence of our cost control and the growth of structural solutions , which rose to 49 % of total osb volume .", "we are , therefore , raising our long -
