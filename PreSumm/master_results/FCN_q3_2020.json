thirds of our prior three quarters because of holidays and some end - of - year factors .", "this year , we thought the evolution of covid might allow for better .", "back in july , we suspected that covid would still be here in the fourth quarter .", "but we , and i 'm guessing most of you , did not believe it was going to be as present as it is today .", "and therefore , we hoped for a somewhat more rapid unfolding of the opening of courts , more rapid derejudification of the legal system , more of an opening of cross - border travel , all of which , of course , would allow a faster return to normal for some of the businesses that were hurt by covid .", "we also thought that if that did n't happen at the speed we hoped for , onto the other side , we would see a continuation of the extraordinary strength we had in our restructuring business in the second quarter .", "what has happened in reality is both of these , but unfortunately to a somewhat lesser extent than we had expected .", "first , in terms of just the businesses that were negatively affected by covid , they are in large part starting to come back .", "we have started to see some signs of improvement in flc and in other parts of our business that have been affected by travel restrictions and court closures .", "but that recovery is at a considerably slower pace than we had hoped .", "it 's just not the hockey stick we expected to see begin in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter .", "second , in terms of the restructurings and bankruptcies , last quarter , if you recall , we talked about the fact that there is uncertainty -- there was uncertainty around that .", "we talked about how we could , at a scenario where the government actions caused a temporary pause on bankruptcies and restructurings , at least in some parts of our world .", "we believe then and continue to believe now that the restructuring market is going to be here for a considerable amount of time .", "but we also understood that there could be waves because of government policies .", "for example , the aggressive monetary stimulus that we have seen can affect or at least seriously delay bankruptcies and restructuring activity .", "what has happened here recently is that market forces began to play out to be more in favor of loose money and against restructuring activity than we had expected , not extraordinarily worse , but around - the - edges worse .", "you can see that in our third - quarter results , but you can also see it very vividly in external data .", "notably , if you look at , for example , august and september chapter 11 filings and defaults , they fell to just over half the level that they were between may and july .", "and i think the reason for that is essentially the loose money .", "the loose money has allowed for an unprecedented issuance of speculative - grade bonds this year and at remarkably reasonable rates .", "if you look at the rates right now , they are also not too different from where they were pre-covid , and the spreads compared to march have halved .", "and that has made a difference in the third quarter , and it 's obviously making a difference at this point in time .", "the consequence of that is not that our restructuring business is doing poorly .", "to the contrary , it is still experiencing considerably higher demand than it did pre-covid , but it is just not as strong as we had hoped and expected back in july .", "and it is not as strong enough to offset the slower pace of recovery we are seeing in the other parts of our business .", "so the combination of covid being more significant and longer impact on parts of our business and the loose money have a slowing effect on the pace of bankruptcy filings and other restructuring activities , together , means that we just no longer feel confident in an anomalous fourth quarter , a fourth quarter that 's higher or as high as the first three quarters of the year .", "and if you build in a more typical ratio of fourth quarters compared to prior quarters , you get to the $ 5.25 to $ 5.75 range for adjusted eps , that ajay will now talk about , as opposed to the $ 5.50 to $ 6 that we had before .", "so we 've moved our guidance there .", "that 's all i was going to say on guidance .", "let me move on to what , i guess , is the next set of questions on many people 's minds , which is , so what does that mean going forward ?", "how does that play out ?", "and i 'm guessing there are two versions of that question .", "one is , how does that play out near term ?", "and two , does that change the fundamental trajectory of the company longer term ?", "let me talk to both of those with a caveat that perhaps counter - intuitively , it is easier to predict the medium and long term than it is the short term .", "i 'm sure that 's also pretty counterintuitive , but that 's my experience in this business .", "and the reason for that is , in the short term , we can be and are buffeted by factors such as those i just described , factors that are external to us , loose money , m&a trends , regulatory activity , etc .", "whereas my view of our history is that over the long term in this business , over the long term whether we perform or not , is much more of a function to us , of what we do , which is ultimately in our control .", "if we are well positioned around the core issues our clients are facing , if we have great people with great brands and if we are in the market in an effective way , my experience is , and i think the data show , we grow over any medium term .", "the factors we can control over the medium term outweigh the short term factors .", "as a result , in my mind , though , there is uncertainty in the short term .", "i am at least as confident about the long term as when we went into covid .", "in the short term , of course , the trends we are seeing this could continue .", "we are seeing a gradual strengthening of the businesses that are slow now , but it 's gradual .", "we do n't see anything that suggests we 're going to have -- go backwards , but we also do n't see a current acceleration of those trends .", "so we could be below our long - term expectations for some subsets of our business for a while .", "and so of course , the loose money and the government stimulus could continue to erode the strong performance of corp fin for a while .", "i should note , however , that , that can reverse itself incredibly fast , for example , with around couple of large bankruptcies or restructurings happening , we win then .", "but for sure , it is possible that loose money could affect us for a while , notwithstanding our belief that loose money cannot ultimately offset forever the underlying economics of businesses .", "so absolutely , there are things that are out of our control , and those things could mean there are slowness that continues into the first half of the year .", "but over any medium or long - term period , one has to believe there 's going to be litigation in the world , there 's going to be investigations in the world , there are going to be tribunals to try cases .", "juries will eventually allow -- be allowed once again to sit in the same room at the same point in time .", "we will have an m&a activity .", "and the underlying economic realities will dictate there are bankruptcies and restructurings .", "so over any medium term , our results , in my view , will be much less affected by forces outside our control and more dictated by questions like , are we well positioned , are we strengthening our businesses , are we going after the right adjacencies .", "on the people side , are we retaining the best people , are we developing great people , are we an attractive place for people to join .", "and as you know , we felt pretty good about the answers to those questions going into covid .", "in terms of the jobs and awards we had won around the world , the list had never been longer or more impressive .", "we had extended into key new adjacencies that were supporting our business , cybersecurity , business transformation , public affairs and others .", "we had expanded and enhanced our geographical footprint .", "we had record numbers of new promotions and our ability to attract senior talent from the outside , as shown by the powerful number of senior hires that we have achieved , had never been as strong .", "and a consequence of that , i 'm sure you all remember , was unprecedented organic growth for this company in 2018 and ' 19 .", "double - digit top line growth that drove record earnings .", "and even if one discounts some of that growth as anomalous or a catch - up from prior years or you 're having slower growth this year , our multiyear trajectory now for an extended period of time , still calculates it to be an impressive set of numbers .", "important this year , notwithstanding covid and notwithstanding all of its challenges , we have continued to invest between each of those critical levers .", "we have continued to also support our clients and what are turning out to be high - profile , brand - building assignments .", "the largest bankruptcies globally , mega deals with antitrust implications , largest investigations happening in different parts around the world , asia , germany , the u.s. companies facing an antitrust cases related to data privacy , and companies at the center of the covid pandemic working toward a vaccine , among many other high - profile engagements .", "as a result , we have deepened the most key client relationships in our firm and continue to win industry accolades , from leading the deal bankruptcy tables for this 12th consecutive year , to having more employees named to who's who on consulting experts guide than any other firm globally for the fifth consecutive year , to alm recently naming us a pacesetter for the financial crisis management , among many others .", "importantly , in the face of covid , we have promoted more people this year than ever before .", "our employee engagement scores are the highest we have ever had .", "our retention rate is the highest we have ever had .", "and our attractiveness to leading experts at other firms that now see fti as a fabulous platform for advancing their careers , as measured either by the number of hires we 've done or probably more currently than not -- our phone is ringing -- has never been higher .", "as i 'm sure you know , not all firms have gotten through covid as well as we have thus far , and some of our competitors are experiencing other stresses .", "and as a consequence , the number of conversations we 're having with terrific people whose culture fits with us , who want to join us , is powerful indeed .", "as a consequence , in the face of this covid , and we have committed to and achieved record headcount growth , leaving us with a strength of team around the world that i believe is unprecedented in this company 's history .", "as a result , notwithstanding the incredible growth we were experiencing coming into the covid , today , i feel at least as bullish , if not more , about our prospects coming out of it .", "i 'm pleased to report strong third - quarter results .", "most notably , our forensic and litigation consulting , or flc segment , delivered strong sequential improvement even with significant opportunity remaining for increased utilization .", "conversely , in the corporate finance and the restructuring segment , bankruptcies ebbed , perhaps in part due to government stimulus benefiting certain industries , which in turn had us reporting revenue in that segment at less than the level reached in the second quarter of 2020 .", "underscoring our market - leading positions and resiliency , even in the face of a global pandemic , this quarter 's revenue of $ 622.2 million was a record high .", "both billable headcount of 5,019 and year - over - year billable headcount growth of 15.8 % were records that are giving us ample capacity for future growth and profits .", "let me take you through the details .", "for the quarter , revenues of $ 622.2 million were up $ 29.1 million or 4.9 % , , compared to revenues of $ 593.1 million in the prior - year quarter .", "our revenue growth year over year was driven by higher demand in our corporate finance and restructuring and economic consulting segments , which was partly offset by lower demand in our flc and strategic communications segments and a decline in pass - through revenue as compared to the prior - year quarter .", "gaap earnings per share of $ 1.35 in 3q ' 20 , compared to $ 1.59 in the prior - year quarter .", "adjusted earnings per share of $ 1.54 , compared to $ 1.63 in the prior - year quarter .", "the difference between our gaap and adjusted earnings per share in the quarter reflects a $ 7.1 million special charge , which reduced gaap earnings per share by $ 0.14 and $ 2.3 million of some noncash interest expense related to our convertible notes , which decreased gaap earnings per share by $ 0.05 .", "the special charge is comprised of two items .", "first , we announced in august that we have leased approximately 120,000 square feet of new space at 1166 avenue of the americas , consolidating from approximately 160,000 square feet of space in two offices in new york .", "we expect to take possession of the space in april of 2021 .", "in advance of this , and given most employees are currently working from home , we have already abandoned 67,000 square feet of space resulting in around $ 4.7 million in lease abandonment and relocation costs .", "second , in the quarter , we took performance -

related revenues in the quarter were $ 15.4 million .", "as a reminder , we consider revenues as acquisition - related for the first 12 months post acquisition .", "as such , this quarter , one month of andersch revenues and three months of delta partner revenues were considered acquisition -

related costs driven by the 18.1 % increase in billable headcount .", "sg&a expense also rose because of a onetime adjustment to earn - out accretion expenses related to our andersch acquisition , and additional employee and infrastructure costs added as part of the delta partners acquisition .", "turning to flc , our revenues of $ 119.1 million decreased 16.5 % , compared to the prior - year quarter .", "the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by lower demand for disputes and investigation services , in part because certain matters were at least deferred due to travel restrictions to client locations as well as foreclosures and delays .", "adjusted segment ebitda of $ 13.6 million or 11.4 % of segment revenues , compared to adjusted ebitda of $ 27 million or 18.9 % of segment revenues in the prior -
