to market to grow cloud while protecting our base and drive awareness and demand for our platform , a mix the ongoing pandemic .", "given our cloud momentum and the purchasing behavior of our high - end enterprise customer base as more of them move to vantage in the cloud , we expect that we will contract differently with our customer base versus what we have historically done on - premises .", "we anticipate that some or many of our customers may choose to purchase or use committed volumes of cloud instances directly from the public cloud providers rather than through us .", "this could create variability in our total arr and recurring revenue in subsequent quarters .", "as only the arr and recurring revenue associated with our vantage software will flow through our p&l rather than that plus the cloud infrastructure .", "however , we are happy to take that trade - off as that recurring revenue has a higher gross margin for teradata and it is easier for our customers to a elastically consume teradata in the public clouds versus on - premises .", "additionally , as more customers and workloads move to the cloud , it is likely more of our business will be consumption based and will not necessarily be recognized ratably creating more variability in the recurring revenue we report by quarter .", "furthermore , many of our customers will operate vantage on - premises as well as in the cloud .", "and thus we expect that may change our on - premises contracts with customers , which could result in on premise revenue recognized other than ratably which also may create more variability in the recurring revenue we report by quarter .", "as a result we anticipate it becoming more difficult to forecast our recurring revenue , especially on a quarterly basis .", "therefore , we will not be providing guidance for recurring revenue by quarter .", "with that said , our 2021 annual guidance , which considers the week is expected to grow total arr is anticipated to grow in the mid to high single -
