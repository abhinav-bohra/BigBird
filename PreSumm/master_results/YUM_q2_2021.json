through was partially offset by labor and commodity inflation , as well as increasing semi-variable costs as we return to normal operations .", "as mentioned on our previous call , we expect these margins to return closer to historical pre-covid levels later this year given inflationary pressures , along with increased staffing at our restaurants as a result of increases in dining room patronage and a return toward our historical daypart mix .", "during q2 , we continued to see recoveries of amounts past due , primarily led by kfc international .", "these recoveries resulted in a $ 4 million net benefit to operating profit related to bad debt during the quarter , representing a $ 17 million year -
