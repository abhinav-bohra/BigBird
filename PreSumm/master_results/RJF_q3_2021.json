related expenses , the non-controlling interest of $ 10 million and other expenses related to our private equity valuation gains and higher business development expenses .", "as we discussed last quarter , we successfully executed a debt offering in the fiscal third quarter to take advantage of the low rate environment and significantly extend the maturities of our existing balances .", "we raised $ 750 million of 30 -
