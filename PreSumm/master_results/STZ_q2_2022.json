term growth goals for our beer business .", "the hard seltzer landscape has shifted considerably in recent months .", "therefore , we 've lowered our growth expectations for corona hard seltzer resulting in a sizable obsolescence charge taken for q2 , which includes our view of the total impact for the fiscal year .", "going forward , we plan to focus on competing in this space in where we offer meaningful points of differentiation and unique value to consumers .", "i 'll have more to say on this topic in a moment .", "number three , while our wine and spirits business was challenged in the quarter by underperformance of several mainstream brands due to tough covid comparisons , our recent route -

calorie , low - carb offerings , and open up to more distinctive consumer value propositions that include things like more flavor , different alcohol bases , and functional benefits .", "we 've already started to innovate in this way with distinct products like refresca and lemonada .", "we 've also discovered that consumers are looking for more robust taste and flavor in their seltzers .", "as a result , we will be altering the flavor and taste profile of our seltzer portfolio to better align with the changing consumer preferences while also introducing single -

end super premium plus portfolio grew net sales double digits during the quarter .", "in on - premise channels , our investments are paying off with enhanced wine offerings at major restaurant chains .", "we 're driving in critical emerging channels like three - tier e-commerce and direct - to - consumer , which continued to drive high - end growth , where we 're outpacing category performance at key accounts , such as instacart , amazon , and albertsons with the resurgence of online shopping due to the covid pandemic .", "for example , constellation 's fine wine share has expanded significantly in the latest 12 weeks due to the robust growth of the prisoner on instacart and robert mondavi winery on wine .com .", "in fact , e-commerce and dtc sales are up nearly three to four times versus 2019 , and they comprise roughly 3 to 5 % of our business versus 1 % pre pandemic .", "going forward , we will continue to focus on becoming a category leader in e-commerce and dtc as we believe these channels will make up a significant portion of our mix over time and will continue to be an opportunity for high -

thirds of those are in favor of legalizing for recreational use as well .", "in fact , nearly two out of three americans already have legal cannabis access as 37 states have legalized for medical use and 18 states for adult use .", "while we 're optimistic about federal legislation within this congress , canopy is not waiting for this reality to materialize .", "canopy's u.s. business grew 91 % year over year in their most recent quarter , driven by robust consumer demand for their cbd and cpg products , including martha stewart -

accretive price points .", "and fifth , and certainly not least , our shareholder value equation continues to be based on outsized growth combined with the return of dollars to shareholders .", "and let me reiterate , our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged .", "we remain committed to our goal of returning 5 billion in value to shareholders by the end of fiscal year ' 23 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases .", "our strong operational performance and cash flow generation allowed us to make significant share repurchases in q2 aligned with our commitment , which contributed to the increase in our earnings per share guidance for the year .", "at the same time , we remain committed to continuing to reinvest in our business with an emphasis on our beer business to keep up with the robust demand for our products .", "q2 certainly reflected yet another strong quarter of marketplace performance for our beer business .", "due to continued robust consumer demand for our core beer portfolio , we now expect to exceed our initial , top line , and operating income targets for our beer business .", "additionally , our strong cash flow generation enabled us to continue to repurchase shares during the quarter .", "and through september , we 've repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for $ 1.4 billion .", "as a result , we 've increased our full - year fiscal 2022 comparable basis diluted earnings per share target , and we now expect to be in the range of $ 10.15 to $ 10.45 .", "this range excludes canopy equity and earnings impact and reflects the increase in beer operating income guidance and decrease in the average -- in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding based on shares repurchased through september partially offset by an increase in the tax rate for fiscal year 2022 .", "now let 's review q2 performance and our full - year outlook in more detail , where i 'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results .", "net sales increased 14 % , driven by shipment volume growth of nearly 12 % and favorable price partially offset by unfavorable mix .", "depletion volume growth for the quarter came in above 7 % , driven by the continued strength of modelo especial and corona extra , as well as the continued return to growth in the on - premise channel .", "depletion trends tempered in q2 versus q1 , driven by out - of - stocks due to ongoing robust consumer demand , as well as lost shipping days for some of our distributors due to severe weather events , including hurricanes and wildfires .", "we estimate that these factors hampered q2 growth by approximately two to three points .", "as bill mentioned , on - premise volume accounted for approximately 11 % of the total beer depletions during the quarter and grew strong double digits versus last year .", "as a reminder , the on- premise accounted for approximately 15 % of our beer depletion volume pre covid and accounted for only 6 % of our depletion volume in q2 fiscal 2021 as a result of the on- premise shutdowns and restrictions due to covid - 19 .", "selling days in the quarter were flat year over year and will also be flat in q3 .", "wholesaler depletions continued to outpace cases shipped during q2 , resulting in a lower - than - normal distributor inventory on hand at the end of the quarter .", "to rectify this gap , shipment case volume is expected to exceed depletion case volume throughout the second half of the fiscal year , resulting in a gradual improvement of distributor inventories during q3 and q4 as inventories are expected to return to normal levels by the end of the fiscal year .", "moving on to beer margins .", "beer operating margin decreased 530 basis points versus prior year to 37.2 % .", "benefits from favorable pricing , mix , and foreign currency were more than offset by unfavorable cogs , increased marketing investments , and higher sg&a .", "the increase in cogs was driven by several headwinds that include the following : first , a q2 obsolescence charge of $ 66 million .", "as a result of our production constraints earlier in the year , we prebuilt hard seltzer inventory in advance of the key summer selling season based on our best estimates for fiscal year 2022 .", "due to the overall slowdown in the hard seltzer category in the u.s. , some of that growth is not going to materialize in the fiscal year , resulting in excess inventory .", "second , increased brewery costs , driven by labor inflation in mexico , increased headcount , and incremental spend related to capacity expansion .", "third , a step - up in depreciation expense , largely due to the incremental 5 million hectoliters at obregon .", "and finally , as expected , increased material costs predominantly driven by increased commodity prices and inflationary headwinds on pallets , cartons , and aluminum .", "these cogs headwinds were partially offset by favorable fixed cost absorption .", "marketing as a percent of net sales increased 150 basis points to 9.9 versus prior year as we returned to our typical spending cadence , which is weighted more heavily toward the first half of the fiscal year .", "as a reminder , marketing spend in the first half of the prior year was significantly muted resulting from covid - 19 - related sporting and sponsorship event cancellations and or postponements .", "lastly , the increase in sg&a was primarily driven by an increase of approximately $ 12 million in legal expenses , as well as higher compensation and benefits .", "as mentioned earlier , we are increasing full - year fiscal 2022 net sales and operating income guidance for our beer business .", "we are now targeting net sales growth of 9 to 11 % , reflecting the strength of our core beer portfolio and pricing actions that are higher than initially planned .", "furthermore , we are now targeting operating income growth of 4 to 6 % , which implies operating margin in the low to midpoint of our stated 39 to 40 % range .", "please note that the updated guidance includes all obsolescence charges and legal expenses incurred in the first half of the fiscal year .", "we continue to expect our gross margin to be negatively impacted for the fiscal year as benefits from price and our cost savings agenda are expected to be more than offset by several cost headwinds .", "however , the mix and magnitude of these headwinds have changed from our original assumptions presented at the beginning of our fiscal year .", "first , we 're still estimating a significant step - up in depreciation expense , which began to accelerate in q2 .", "however , some of this depreciation started later in the year versus planned .", "as such , we are now estimating total beer depreciation expense to approximately $ 250 million , an increase of approximately $ 55 million versus last year , or a $ 10 million decrease versus our original planned estimate .", "second , we still expect expect substantial inflationary headwinds across numerous cost components to continue during the second half of our fiscal year as commodity prices continue to rise , specifically across aluminum , diesel , and pallets resulting from a rather volatile inflationary market .", "and third , due to the growth moderation within the hard seltzer market , as well as lower acv levels across the category on new items , we do not expect our hard seltzer skus to meet originally planned volume expectations , which results in a positive mix benefit versus our original estimate .", "conversely , due to the slowdown in the hard seltzer sector , excess inventory resulted in a fiscal year - to - date obsolescence charge of approximately $ 80 million .", "please note that these losses cover our hard seltzer obsolescence exposure and as such , we do not expect to take any additional obsolete charges in the back half of the fiscal year for hard seltzers .", "from a marketing perspective , we continue to expect full - year spend as a percentage of net sales to land in the 9 to 10 % range , which is in line with fiscal 2021 spend of 9.7 % of net sales .", "i 'd like to remind everyone of the difficult buying overlaps we will encounter as we 're facing a 28 % and 12 % growth comparison for shipment volume and depletion volume , respectively .", "additionally , we expect to perform our normal annual brewery maintenance during q3 , which will result in less throughput versus q2 as we have to shut down production for a few days .", "as such , we are estimating low single - digit shipment volume growth for q3 .", "moving to wine and spirits .", "q2 fiscal 2022 net sales declined 18 % on shipment volume down 36 % .", "excluding the impact of the wine and spirits divestitures , organic net sales increased 15 % , driven by organic shipment volume growth of nearly 6 % , favorable mix and price and smoke - tainted bulk wine sales .", "robust mix driven by the prisoner brand family , meiomi , and kim crawford accounted for approximately nine points of the year - over - year organic net sales growth .", "shipments were negatively impacted by port delays for our international brands and route - to - market changes , which also impacted depletions .", "depletion volume declined 2 % during the quarter and was additionally impacted by the challenging overlap the consumer pantry loading behavior especially for our mainstream brands that experienced robust growth during the beginning of the covid - 19 pandemic .", "however , as we head into the second half of the fiscal year , we feel as though most of these challenges are behind us and expect shipment volume and depletion volume to generally align in the second half of fiscal 2022 .", "moving on to wine and spirits margins .", "operating margin decreased 620 basis points to 19.7 % as mix benefits from the existing portfolio and divestitures combined with favorable price were more than offset by increased marketing and sg&a spend , higher cogs , and margin - dilutive smoke - tainted bulk wine sales .", "higher cogs were driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption and increased transportation costs .", "these headwinds were partially offset by lower great raw materials and other cost savings initiatives .", "keep in mind that we 're lapping lower sg&a spend in q2 fiscal 2021 due to covid and having smaller business post divestitures , resulting in significant marketing and sg&a deleveraging , impacting operating margins .", "for full - year fiscal 2022 , the wine and spirits business continues to expect net sales and operating income to decline 22 to 24 % and 23 to 25 % , respectively .", "this implies operating margin to approximately 24 % , which is flattish to prior year on a reported basis , which shows significant margin expansion on an organic basis .", "excluding the impact of the wine experience divestitures , organic net sales is expected to grow in the 2 to 4 % range .", "from a q3 perspective , keep in mind that we are lapping unfavorable fixed cost absorption of $ 20 million in the prior year resulting from decreased production levels as a result of the 2020 u.s. wildfires .", "we expect this favorable overlap to be partially offset by a continued increase in transportation costs and incremental unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to the new zealand frost .", "also , we continue to expect marketing and sg&a deleveraging as a result of the wine and spirits divestitures .", "as such , we expect marketing and sg&a to continue to be a significant drag to operating margins in q3 fiscal 2022 .", "now let 's proceed with the rest of the p&l .", "fiscal year - to - date corporate expenses came in at approximately $ 117 million , up 7 % versus last fiscal year .", "the increase was primarily driven by higher consulting services and compensation and benefits partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact .", "we now expect full - year corporate expenses to approximate $ 245 million , driven by increase in compensation and benefits .", "comparable basis interest expense for the quarter decreased 4 % to approximately 96 million versus prior year primarily due to lower average borrowings .", "we now expect fiscal 2022 interest expense to be in the range of 355 to $ 365 million .", "the slight decrease versus our previous guidance reflects early redemption of higher interest rate debt , as well as $ 1 billion of senior notes issued in july at attractive rates .", "our q2 comparable basis effective tax rate , excluding canopy equity earnings , came in at 21.8 % versus 16.9 % in q2 of last year , primarily driven by the timing of stock - based compensation benefits and a higher effective tax rate on our foreign businesses .", "we now expect our full - year fiscal 2022 comparable tax rate , excluding canopy equity and earnings , to approximate 20 % versus our previous guidance of 19 % .", "this increase is primarily due to a higher effective tax rate on our foreign earnings than originally estimated .", "i would also note that we expect stock - based compensation tax benefits to be weighted toward q4 .", "as a result , we expect our q3 tax rate to be higher than our full - year estimate at approximately 21 % .", "we also now expect our 2022 weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 192 million , reflecting the impact of our september year -
