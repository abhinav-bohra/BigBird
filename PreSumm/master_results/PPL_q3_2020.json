party challenging ppl electric utilities based return on equity for transmission .", "the ferc order sent the complaint to settlement procedures .", "if no settlement can be reached , the case will go to public hearing .", "we continue to believe that ppl electric utilities ' current transmission return on equity is just and reasonable , and that complaint is without merit and based on flawed assumptions and calculations .", "also in the u.s. on october 23 , lg&e and ku notified the kpsc of the company 's intent to file a rate request later this month .", "as part of the rate case , we will be applying for approval to deploy advanced metering to further enhance grid automation and reliability in the state .", "assuming the maximum suspension period for such a proceeding , the resulting base rate changes would be effective july 1 , 2021 .", "shifting gears to a few notable highlights related to our sustainability efforts and governance updates , in august , we announced that we joined an exciting new initiative to accelerate the development of low -

quarter segment results on slide 6 .", "first , i would like to highlight that the estimated impact of covid on our third - quarter results was about $ 0.04 per share , which was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the u.k. and lower demand revenue in kentucky .", "this is less than the $ 0.06 impact we experienced during the second quarter , primarily due to the improving electricity demand that vince mentioned earlier in his remarks .", "as a reminder , the majority of this impact is recoverable via the u.k. decoupling mechanism , which adjusts revenues on a two - year lag .", "turning to the quarterly walk , starting with the q3 2019 ongoing results on the left .", "we first separate the impact of weather and dilution for comparability purposes of the underlying businesses .", "during the third quarter , we experienced a $ 0.02 unfavorable variance due to weather compared to the third quarter of 2019 , primarily in kentucky .", "we experienced substantially higher degree days in kentucky during the third quarter of 2019 that led to a favorable variance last year .", "weather in the third quarter of 2020 was about $ 0.01 favorable overall compared to plan , primarily due to stronger load in pennsylvania versus normal due to the warmer conditions in july .", "in terms of dilution , during the third quarter , we continued to recognize the impact of the november 2019 draw on our equity forward contracts , which resulted in dilution of about $ 0.03 per share for the quarter .", "moving to the segment drivers .", "excluding these items , our u.k. - regulated segment earnings increased by $ 0.01 per share compared to a year ago .", "earnings results include higher foreign currency exchange rates , compared to the prior period , with q3 2020 average rates of $ 1.54 per pound , compared to $ 1.26 per pound in q3 2019 , and lower interest expense , primarily due to lower interest on index - linked debt .", "these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes , primarily due to the impact of covid - 19 , lower other income due to lower pension income and higher income taxes .", "segment earnings were $ 0.02 per share higher than our comparable results in q3 2019 .", "the increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted gross margins , primarily resulting from returns on additional capital investments in transmission .", "and as we saw in q2 , our customer mix mitigated the impact on sales from covid - 19 as our positive impact from our significant residential base in pennsylvania and fixed charges more than offset lower demand in the c&i sectors .", "turning to our kentucky - regulated segment .", "results were flat to the comparable results one year ago .", "factors impacting the results include lower commercial and industrial demand due to the impact of covid - 19 offset by factors that were individually not significant .", "results at corporate and other were $ 0.01 per share lower compared to a year ago , driven primarily by higher income taxes due to timing , which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter .", "we again outlined the changes in weather - normalized sales for each segment by customer class as we did last quarter .", "and like q2 , we saw lower demand in the c&i sectors , partially offset by higher residential load in each of our service territories .", "demand in the c&i sector , while still lower than last year , has been steadily recovering as certain covid restrictions have been lifted .", "in pennsylvania , demand improved from about an 11 % decline in c&i load in the second quarter to a 4 % decline during q3 compared to a year ago .", "c&i declines in pennsylvania continue to be primarily in retail trade and services industry and manufacturing , respectively .", "our large industrial customers have generally returned to pre-covid operations and are not expecting future reductions at this time .", "our kentucky segment reported about a 7 % c&i load decline during q3 , compared to the greater than 14 % decline we saw last quarter versus the prior year .", "and like pennsylvania , the services industry , such as restaurants , retail and hotels continue to be negatively impacted in our commercial sector in kentucky .", "much of the improvement we experienced during q3 was on the industrial side as many manufacturing companies were able to reopen after temporarily being forced to shut down in q2 .", "specifically , industrial volumes were driven in part by auto manufacturing volumes returning to pre-covid levels .", "coal mining and non-auto manufacturing continue to be more negatively affected .", "finally , in the u.k. , c&i load improved to about a 14 % decline in the third quarter , compared to a 20 % decline that we experienced last quarter versus a year ago as government restrictions put in place in late march were further eased throughout the month of july .", "the primary driver of the increase was seen in the large industrial and manufacturing sectors that have largely closed during the full lockdown phase and have since opened , albeit not quite the pre-covid levels .", "it 's clear on this slide that the u.k. demand has not recovered as sharply as our u.s. service territories which underscores the value of the effective decoupling mechanism there .", "we remain encouraged by the recovery we have observed in each of our service territories during the third quarter , but we 'll continue to monitor load impacts as we move into the winter months , including the impact of additional temporary lockdowns should they arise , such as the lockdowns we are currently experiencing in england and wales .", "at this time , the current lockdown is not as stringent as what we experienced early in the year as workers that are not able to work from home can still go to work and many retail establishments can still provide takeout options .", "in addition , strong residential demand is expected to continue to act as a hedge to lower c&i demand .", "now i know i just stated a lot of percentages .", "so let me take a moment to summarize the impact of covid - 19 on our ongoing results in 2020 .", "we experienced a $ 0.10 per share impact to the end of the third quarter .", "the remaining $ 0.03 is primarily from lower demand in kentucky , and we have been able to offset the majority of that through effective cost management .", "overall , we believe our strong regulatory constructs , balanced rate structures and customer mix , positions ppl well to continue to operate at a high level in this challenging environment .", "in closing , i remain very proud of how our teams across ppl have risen to the challenge of covid - 19 .", "we continue to deliver electricity and gas safely and reliably to our customers .", "at the same time , we remain as focused as ever on innovation and continuous improvement as we position the company for future success .", "with that , operator , let 's open the call for q&a ."], "summary_gold": "compname reports q3 earnings per share $ 0.37 .<q>sees fy 2020 earnings per share $ 2.40 to $ 2.50 from continuing operations .<q>q3 reported earnings of $ 0.37 per share .<q>qtrly earnings from ongoing operations of $ 0.58 per share .", "summary_pred": "third -
