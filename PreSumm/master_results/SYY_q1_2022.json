out of an unprofitable customer , which we announced in our third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call , and because during the quarter , some consumers are switching from their favorite qsr drive - up back to some of the excellent sit - down restaurants served by our more profitable u.s. foodservice segment .", "local case volume , within a subset of usfs , our u.s. broadline operations , increased 23.8 % , while total case volume within u.s. broadline operations increased 28.1 % .", "with respect to our international business , restrictions continue to ease across our international operations in the first quarter .", "international sales were up 34 % versus fiscal 2021 while also improving sequentially over prior quarters to down less than 1 % versus fiscal 2019 , indicating that we have more upside to come .", "foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of 1.1 % on sysco 's sales results .", "inflation continued to be a factor during the quarter at approximately 13 % .", "the good news is that we continue to manage our profitability well in the inflationary environment .", "let me call out a couple of numbers , and then we 'll discuss inflation further .", "gross profit for the enterprise was approximately $ 3 billion in the first quarter , increasing 33.9 % versus the same quarter in fiscal 2021 and also exceeding gross profit in fiscal 2019 by 2 % .", "the increase in gross profit was driven by year -
