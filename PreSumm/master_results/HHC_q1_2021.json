unit project starling and secured financing for the project in april .", "this is only our second multi-family project in bridgeland and like marlow in columbia follows on the success of lakeside row , which opened during the fourth quarter of 2019 , and is already 94 % leased only after one year in operations .", "starling is the first project launched in what will be our new town center , bridgeland central , where we plan to accelerate development over the next few years .", "finally , in summerlin , we have already announced two new projects , which commenced construction in april .", "our multi-family product , tanager echo and our next office building , 1700 pavilion .", "we look forward to bringing these assets online quickly as their predecessor projects , tanager and two summerlin office buildings are both 100 % leased .", "at the seaport , as david mentioned , we received approval last week from the new york city landmarks preservation commission on our proposed design for a building on the site of the surface parking lot at 250 water street .", "this favorable ruling confirms that the proposed architecture is appropriate for the seaport historic district and allows us to proceed with the formal new york city uniform land use review procedure , known as ulurp .", "through this process , approval from the new york city planning commission will be required to allow us to complete the necessary transfer of development rights to the parking lot site .", "this project presents a unique opportunity at the seaport to transform this last available development site into a vibrant mixed -

of - a- kind neighborhood .", "during the quarter , the seaport reported an operating loss of $ 4.4 million , which was largely unchanged from the same quarter last year .", "while noi was largely the same year - over - year , the revenues and corresponding expenses during the first quarter of 2021 were comparatively lower .", "this was due , of course , to the impact of covid - 19 that still exists in new york city .", "capacity restrictions have limited the amount of seating in our restaurants .", "foot traffic has declined within our retail locations and social distancing requirements limited our ability to maximize the entire space of the pier 17 rooftop .", "despite these challenges , we still had a good quarter with continued success at the greens and making further progress in the construction of the tin building .", "as new york city begins to slowly reopen , we are in a strong position to capitalize on the city 's post -covid return to normalcy .", "we have several new concepts gearing up to launch soon at pier 17 and the fulton market building .", "and in 2022 , we plan to have a grand opening for the tin building , which will bring increased foot traffic to the area .", "we believe the combination of project completions and the reopening of the manhattan economy will make the seaport , one of the premier entertainment and food and beverage destinations in all of manhattan .", "with 2 million square feet of new development under way , we are actively seeking out future opportunities where we can put our capital to work .", "one of the ways to do this is by introducing new product types , which will further diversify our portfolio .", "over the next few quarters , we hope to announce new projects throughout our master - planned communities in categories such as single - family for rent , medical office , new timber office buildings , senior housing , residential condos and cultural amenities .", "this type of development will enhance our communities , increase our stream of recurring income and ensure that we 're putting forth maximum effort to deliver outsized returns for our shareholders .", "i 'm happy to be joining all of you today on my first hhc earnings call .", "i look forward to meeting most of you over the next several months through upcoming conferences , roadshows and meetings .", "i 'm going to start with a review of our mpc and strategic development performance , then we 'll turn to our financial results and balance sheet .", "with the start of the year , our mpcs across the country continued to experience tremendous growth .", "we achieved year - over - year growth in new home sales , price per acre of residential landfills and mpc ebt compared to the first quarter of 2020 .", "new home sales accelerated quickly during the first quarter with 929 new homes sold in our community , 35 % more compared to the first quarter of 2020 and 34 % higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "this is an incredible pace that persists since the latter half of 2020 , and we see this trend continuing .", "land sales , however , were down 5 % in the first quarter with 54 acres sold versus 57 acres sold in the first quarter of last year .", "this is attributed to fewer lots sold in bridgeland and no super - pads sold in summerlin , which , as we 've always said , are very lumpy quarter - to - quarter and should be evaluated on an annual basis .", "the fact that land sales were only down 5 % without closing on a single super - pad highlights the strength of the quarter for our mpc .", "mpc ebt , which is a metric of profitability we look at for the segment , increased 44 % compared to the same period last year .", "this uptick in earnings was mostly the result of higher custom lot sales and increased units closing at the summit , our 555 - acre , members - only community in summerlin .", "during the quarter , the summit closed on 19 units versus six units closed during first quarter of 2020 , a substantial increase that helped drive quarterly mpc ebt to $ 63 million .", "summerlin had a breakout quarter with new home sales higher by 41 % in the first quarter of 2021 versus the same period in 2020 .", "in addition , price per acre in summerlin residential land grew 13 % or $ 199,000 to $ 1.7 million per acre for the first quarter of 2021 , as compared to the first quarter of 2020 .", "this also compares very favorably with the $ 762,000 per acre achieved last quarter .", "this increase was attributed to selling only custom lots as opposed to a typical quarter where the majority of our sales are generated through the sale of super - pads .", "summerlin has been a huge beneficiary of the recent migratory patterns of homebuyers leaving high - cost , high - tech states like california .", "we see no indication of this trend slowing anytime soon .", "further , we believe the growth demonstrated within summerlin is sustainable as the broader las vegas economy improves .", "bridgeland continues to demonstrate excellent results in the first quarter .", "new home sales grew 33 % when compared to the same quarter last year , and price per acreage of residential land increased from $ 439,000 in the first quarter of 2020 to $ 459,000 , a 5 % increase .", "the influx of homebuyers to bridgeland have been impressive , and we have reason to believe this momentum will continue .", "similar to what we have seen in summerlin , the surrounding houston economy has improved since the lows of last year in oil prices and the overall energy markets have improved .", "we view this as a strong catalyst for continued growth in home sales .", "while land sales were below the first quarter of 2020 , the momentum in new home sales confirms demand is still robust , and we expect strong results through the balance of the year .", "in woodlands hills , new home sales more than doubled from 41 homes in the first quarter of 2020 to 84 homes this quarter .", "similarly , the woodlands hills sold 16 acres of land during the quarter , representing a 92 % increase when compared to the same period last year .", "in addition , we continue to see steady increase in the price per acre of our residential land sold to homebuilders .", "price per acre of residential land increased from $ 303,000 in the first quarter of 2020 to $ 307,000 this quarter .", "although these numbers are from a lower starting basis , given this is our least mature community , the results are an encouraging sign of future expansion ahead as we have only just scratched the surface in terms of residential land sales .", "in our strategic developments segment , the demand for our homes in ward village remains robust .", "we contracted 46 units during the quarter , of which 30 units were from victoria place .", "the sales pace at this tower has been incredible with 85 % of the units presold , and we are only just starting construction .", "during the quarter , we closed on a $ 368 million construction loan for this project at libor plus 500 basis points with an initial maturity date of september 2024 , and two one - year extension options .", "this 85 % presold tower has hard deposits from buyers that can be used to fund construction .", "our other two towers under construction , ' a'ali'i and ko'ula , are making strong progress and are 86 % and 79 % presold with estimated completions expected at the end of 2021 and 2022 , respectively .", "during the quarter , we closed on five units between waiea and anaha generating $ 35 million in sales .", "subsequent to the quarter end , we closed on the last remaining unit at anaha , which is now completely sold making this ward village 's third sold - out tower , only three units remain at waiea .", "it is important to note that $ 20 million was charged during the quarter related to additional anticipated costs to repair construction defects previously identified at waiea .", "this is comparison to the $ 98 million charge in the first quarter of 2020 for the estimated repair costs related to this matter .", "as we previously stated on last year 's earnings call , we believe the general contractor is ultimately responsible for the defects , and we expect to recover all the repair costs from the responsible parties .", "taking a look at gaap earnings .", "for the first three months ended march 31 , 2021 , we reported a net loss of $ 67 million or $ 1.20 per diluted share , compared to a net loss of $ 125 million or $ 2.88 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2020 .", "the year - over - year improvement was accredited to a stronger result in our mpc and strategic developments segments , in addition to no impairment charges during the quarter compared to a $ 49 million impairment charge against the outlet collection at riverwalk during the same period last year .", "this was partially offset by a loss on the early extinguishment of debt due to the repurchase of the company 's $ 1 billion senior notes due 2025 and the repayment of the loans for 1201 lake robbins and the woodlands warehouse in february following our $ 1.3 billion bond offering .", "we also reported lower noi from our operating assets , largely related to the expiration of a short - term lease at the woodlands tower that ended in june of 2020 , as well as lower operating performance from our covid - impacted assets within retail and hospitality .", "excluding our loss on the early extinguishment of debt and non-recurring items , hhc would have reported a net loss of $ 31 million or $ 0.56 per diluted share during the first quarter of 2021 .", "the bond offering , i mentioned , is just an example of howard hughes 's opportunistically approaching the high - yield market at the right time .", "this successful issuance allowed the company to reduce its annual interest expense by $ 11 million with the refinancing of its 2025 notes and extended out its maturities by an additional two years .", "further , the issuance was offered across two separate tranches , which allows us to manage our future refinancing needs .", "the offering includes a $ 650 million eight - year issuance due 2029 at a rate of 4.125 % and a $ 650 million 10 - year issuance due 2031 at a rate of 4.375 % .", "this bond offering increased our unencumbered book value of assets by over $ 300 million , further reduced our cost of debt and extended our maturity profile .", "our nearest debt maturity is not due until october of 2021 , which is our $ 28 million loan on the outlet collection at riverwalk .", "following the end of the quarter , we closed on several construction loans in order to ensure that we are well positioned for the strategic development activity jay discussed earlier .", "this included construction loans on our multi-family project in bridgeland and downtown columbia .", "in april , we secured a $ 43 million construction loan for starling at bridgeland , which bears an interest at libor plus 275 basis points and matures in may of 2026 with an option of a one -
