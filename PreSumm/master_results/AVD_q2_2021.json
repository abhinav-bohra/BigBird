applied solutions , they 've got ability to use multiple products .", "and if you look at this last year , we really had our kind of core products available , which are generally linked to either kind of nematode or insect control .", "in addition then we have a micronutrient and zinc .", "and so for this year , we did have several people that applied multiple and did a multiple -- three different products and did very well .", "but a lot of growers looked at it and said , ok , let 's wait on that investment until we get to the ' 22 season when you add more .", "so , we have n't given you good visibility of what the future look like for our toolbox .", "but what we 're excited about in ' 22 , and so for the first time , we 'll have -- we 'll be able to include both soybeans and cotton to solutions being applied by our growers .", "and so , up until now , it 's corn growers just applied corn , but they -- corn growers generally grow soybeans as well .", "and in the southern market , the corn growers in addition to soybeans also many of them are cotton .", "so , this is a greater utilization of -- and really kind of -- for the design of what simpas is about .", "and then as you see in ' 23 , our portfolio grows even more .", "so that when we get into that ' 23 season , we 're talking about 42 different products in that platform .", "and this will continue to grow over time .", "and as we talk with growers and distribution and retailers , we 'll see kind of what they really want .", "in addition , though , we have and -- up there on the board , we have third - party products from a number of different companies that really would like us to get their products registered and improved into the simpas system .", "so highlights that we 've seen here from our last year 's experience here , what we 're seeing generally is that our simpas users are twice the size of our smartbox users .", "generally , our smartbox users kind of average treating about half of their field and it goes at full rate , but they -- if they 're doing -- they got 1,000 acres and they do 500 acres of corn , they 're going to apply 500 with insecticide and nematicide , but the soybeans , the other 500 , are n't getting touch .", "but what we are seeing though is that if the farmers ' farms are twice the size and as such just with the three products we have , they 're purchasing three -- i 'm sorry , four times the amount as far as revenue .", "so , that 's what we really envision that this would be a big upswing from what we 've seen in smartbox with utilization of multiple solutions .", "and then finally , we 've done the math and at current corn prices , all we 're looking at in order to pay for a simpas system over over a five - year period is just 0.5 bushel per acre increase .", "so , it 's not a major investment when you look at it that way .", "and i think we expect with simpas solutions to be more than double - digit increases in their yield .", "and then , so for this ' 22 year , what we 've done and again even with the delta strain that we 're seeing going , there have been a number of operations that we 've been able to place and still expect to do where we can do field demos and actually bring in people from all over to -- and even bring in people from brazil as well , bringing people in to see the system work and its performance .", "and in addition , they are being able to demonstrate the return on investment .", "and lastly , what we 've got is our -- for our team , sales wise , we have outfitted them with , what i call , soup to nuts a - to - z on simpas .", "basically , giving them the ability to see and be able to explain that to everybody in the chain , whether it's a third party , whether it 's a distributor , how they make money , whether or not it 's a retailer trying to figure out how he writes his prescription , how he gets agronomists information in there , how he shows return on investment with the growers .", "so , what we 've done is we 've created this ipad that basically covers five major areas .", "so , there is the simpas solutions , the cartridges , what really the simpas ' experience is all about , and logistics .", "and so from each one of those topics , it breaks out into additional tabs .", "so , basically there are , as i call this , a - to - z , essentially [ phonetic ] 32 different tabs for which our sales team can do and download this for our retailers .", "so if you take a look at one of these -- we 're talking about a simpas solutions .", "when you pull that up , then you can type -- you can hop on into any one of the products that we 're currently offering .", "in addition , then you can hit the coming soon , and you can see the table that i provided just before this .", "and then similarly , if you go to the business builder , a retailer can kind of get a lot of questions answered around the scope of what 's the prescription like , what 's the business model and can provide him with much better comfort that what he 's promoting in simpas is a win - win for everybody .", "so , that 's where we are with our update , and we 'll continue to provide this as we go through .", "and i 'm keep pushing the team to continue to sharpen their pencil and provide continual updates as to where we 're going to be .", "so , before we switched to questions , i have a couple -- we had a couple of questions that were brought up in this last quarter that i wanted to address here in front of everybody .", "so , one question was about our acquisitions and what kind of return are we getting on those ?", "that we 've talked about , we make acquisitions in the 5 to 6 times ebitda , which for the industry is generally 10 to 12 times ebitda , and we play in that space where we look for what we think are going to be nice wins for us , and we pass on those where we think it 's little too expensive .", "but you 've seen by our over 50 products and five manufacturing sites and three closed delivery systems and eight businesses that we are successful and operate in that space .", "so what we did is , we said ok , we just took a look at this ' 14 to ' 20 , which is kind of the down cycle that occurred from ' 13 to today , and we looked at what the actual cash that we paid for these , we 've got a mix set of businesses and product lines .", "and when we looked at the kind of incremental benefit , we took the ' 21 current projection , which looks pretty solid and we calculate out that incremental ebitda and it comes out in that 5 to 6 times range and kind of return on capital employed at 10 % .", "and if we were to take these incremental businesses and the sign addition -- current overheads that are with our existing business , if we put that proportionately on to these businesses , it kind of moves that number to in between 7 and 8 times .", "so , a second question has to do within our working capital .", "how do we make the determinations ?", "what metrics do we use ?", "and it kind of goes into three different areas .", "so , with the external acquisitions , we 've got a very robust model that we use that takes a product with sales , cost of goods , opex assigned to it , any interest assigned to it , as far as the working capital , and we actually do build to an earnings per share over each of the 10 years .", "once we do that and then we measure kind of an internal rate of return , a payback period on the acquisition , i already mentioned the 10 - year p&l , and that 's the basis for how we measure making our acquisitions .", "with return to internal investments , such as what i mentioned in the new product pipeline or simpas or the green solutions , we do look at a similar concept as to what we do with acquisitions .", "we 've build out what it looks like maturity generally that 's in the five to seven year period .", "looking out kind of -- we 've build out again over a period until we hit maturity , and measure what the short - term , mid-term and long - term returns are going to be .", "and that 's how we prioritize our basic internal growth initiatives .", "and then , lastly , we have decisions to make about how to regionally deploy our working capital .", "and with regards to our existing business and , i would say , the more mature businesses have a better return on capital .", "when we look at our domestic business or even our mexico business we 've had for 20 - some years , those tend to have higher return rates .", "but when we go into newer territories and try to establish a beachhead and grow particularly as you get into central and south america , the credit terms tend to be longer .", "although we 're trying to offset that with longer payment terms to our suppliers , generally , we have to make strategic decisions there .", "and let 's take brazil , for instance , we have not -- we had not participated much in brazil , and years passed , in 2019 , we acquired a business and we 're building that business today , and that does not reap the same standards or the same levels of return .", "but overall , we look at what 's in the best interest of the firm on all of these for what 's the short - term return , mid-term and long - term return .", "so with that , i think , brock , we 'll open up to any questions audience might have ."], "summary_gold": "american vanguard corp - qtrly net sales were up 29 % to $ 135 million in 2021 , compared to $ 105 million in 2020 .", "summary_pred": "so , with regards to revenue , we said that we would be in low double -
