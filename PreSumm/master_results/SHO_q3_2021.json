point sequential increase in occupancy at an average rate for the comparable portfolio that not only grew 13 % from the second quarter of 2021 , but was also just above the third quarter of 2019 .", "these strong results were primarily the result of strong leisure demand over the summer vacation season that peaked in july and then moderated in august and september , partly as a result of typical seasonal patterns but also due to a short -
