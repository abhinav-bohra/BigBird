related risk criteria to our underwriting .", "temporarily slowing land spending contributed to an increase in liquidity during the quarter .", "but more importantly , it allowed us to review every proposed transaction against new risks to employment , household income and supply .", "while our review resulted in us exiting a handful of positions , in the vast majority of cases , we were able to validate and renegotiate pending transactions .", "going forward , we are confident we have a lot pipeline that supports our growth ambitions .", "and third , we improved the cost structure of the business .", "as we adapted to a new working environment , we realized there were opportunities for us to improve our cost structure without reducing our ability to sell and build a growing number of homes in the quarters ahead .", "that was important to us because we saw the demand was rebounding quite quickly .", "prior to the covid - 19 pandemic , the new home market was very strong supported by wage growth , low unemployment , low mortgage rates , low housing supply and high consumer confidence .", "in late march , that momentum gave way to the pandemic .", "and in april , industrywide demand plummeted .", "but as you 've heard and read , housing demand began recovering very quickly , and by june , was arguably better than prior to the pandemic .", "for you and for us , that raises two crucial questions .", "where did this surge in demand come from ?", "only time will reveal the answers .", "but here is what we think is driving it and why it may last .", "first , low mortgage rates have gotten even lower .", "this is a real plus for buyers as it improves affordability , increasing access to new homes for all buyer segments , especially first - time buyers .", "second , working from home and schooling from home have led to a massive reappraisal of shelter needs .", "our buyers are telling us that new homes offer crucial advantages over most apartments and used homes , including more space , more flexible floor plans and better outdoor living features , plus they 're move - in ready and do n't require costly cleaning or time - consuming improvements .", "third , the shift to remote work appears to be durable .", "despite some challenges posed by remote work , both employees and employers have experienced an enormous boost to productivity arising from the elimination of commutes .", "knowledge workers in particular are capable of working from completely different places , which can only benefit demand for new homes .", "and fourth , this may be the tipping point demographers have predicted for a decade , reflecting the moment that ownership - reluctant millennials embrace the inevitability and desirability of homeownership .", "this is our most speculative observation , but millennials represent about a quarter of the us population , so their housing preferences have to be watched very closely .", "despite the many challenges presented by the pandemic , we see no reason to deviate from our longer - term balanced growth strategy , which targets a double - digit return on assets by growing ebitda faster than revenue from a more efficient and less leveraged balance sheet .", "as we monetize our longer - term assets and increase the share of lots controlled by option , we will generate plenty of liquidity to both grow the business and remain on course to reduce our long - term debt below $ 1 billion .", "finally , i want to express our corporate support for the elimination of prejudice , discrimination and injustice in our country .", "we have shared on social media a letter i wrote to our employees expressing both my personal views and our corporate commitment to addressing these issues in our company and our communities .", "i am extraordinarily pleased with the enthusiasm our team has shown to learn about and honestly discuss these issues .", "we are taking steps that will allow us to share the benefits of greater inclusion and diversity with our employees , customers , trade partners and shareholders .", "i know our efforts can make a difference .", "as allan highlighted earlier , adjusted ebitda in the quarter was up nearly 40 % versus the prior year to $ 54 million .", "this performance was driven by strong results across our core metrics .", "specifically , compared to last year , we grew homebuilding revenue by 10 % to $ 532.5 million as we benefited from an 8 % increase in closings combined with a 3 % increase in our asp .", "our gross margin , excluding amortized interest , impairments and abandonments , was up approximately 180 basis points to 21.2 % , driven by increased margins on spec homes and our ongoing efforts to simplify product and reduce incentives .", "this margin excludes impairments and abandonments associated with our reunderwriting process totaling $ 2.3 million .", "sg&a as a percentage of total revenue was 11.7 % , down 50 basis points , even with $ 1.4 million in one - time charges associated with improving our ongoing cost structure .", "total gaap interest expense was up around $ 2.1 million , primarily due to our decision to carry a fully drawn revolver through nearly the entire quarter for liquidity purposes .", "even with that , however , our cash interest expense was down $ 3.7 million as a result of our prior debt retirements and refinancing activities .", "our tax expense in the quarter was about $ 5 million for an average tax rate of 24 % .", "taken together , we owned $ 15.3 million of net income from continuing operations or $ 0.51 in earnings per share this quarter , up $ 3.6 million versus the prior year .", "as clarity into market conditions has improved , we are comfortable offering the following guidance into our expectations for the full year and the fourth quarter .", "for the full year of fiscal 2020 , we expect adjusted ebitda to be up 5 % to 10 % compared to last year with a big improvement in gross margin more than offsetting the impact of fewer home closings .", "this would represent the second highest level of ebitda we 've produced in a decade .", "for the fourth quarter , the pandemic has impacted a variety of our operational metrics , particularly timing .", "for example , our beginning backlog is essentially flat to the level we had last year , but the stage of completion is very different .", "the covid outbreak impacted the timing of both orders and spec starts during the quarter such that a larger than usual share of this backlog will deliver in the first quarter of fiscal ' 21 rather than the fourth quarter of this year .", "accordingly , we expect our backlog conversion ratio will be in the low - 70 % range rather than the high - 80 %s like last year .", "our margin expectations reflect the strength in demand that occurred during the third quarter and our cost improvement efforts .", "specifically , we expect gross margins will be up at least 100 basis points to around 21 % and sg&a will be down more than 5 % on an absolute dollar basis .", "finally , with our reunderwriting complete , a cash component of land spend will accelerate , likely exceeding $ 100 million .", "at the beginning of the third quarter , we owned or controlled more than a three - year supply of land based on our trailing 12 - month closings .", "this position allowed us to pause land spending , assess the demand environment and reunderwrite land deals that were in process .", "this process resulted in modest land acquisition and development spending during the quarter totaling just under $ 56 million .", "with our reunderwriting process complete and demand improvements evident , we have resumed our regular land acquisition and development activity and expect to return to more normalized spending levels in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021 .", "of course , we 'll take a disciplined approach given the ongoing spread of the coronavirus and the long - term impacts the pandemic may have on the economy .", "strategically , we expect to sustain a lot position representing at least three years ' supply with a growing share controlled by options , allowing us to better leverage our spend , improve return on assets and reduce risk .", "we ended the third quarter with over $ 400 million of liquidity , more than double this point last year .", "this reflected more than $ 150 million of unrestricted cash and no outstandings on our revolver .", "with a durable business model that mixes to be built and spec homes and a growing land positions supported by larger share of options , we expect to generate sufficient liquidity to both reduce borrowings and grow our business in the years ahead .", "we have no significant maturities until 2025 and our clearly defined deleveraging path includes $ 50 million term loan repayments in each of the next three years .", "after our upcoming september repayment , we will have just over $ 100 million remaining on our goal of bringing our total debt below $ 1 billion .", "the third quarter of fiscal 2020 was very successful .", "we increased closings and improved margins , driving both revenue and profitability growth .", "we also took steps to improve our business and ongoing cost structure .", "these results , coupled with the tremendous sales momentum that we experienced in the back half of the quarter , position us to realize the objectives of our balanced growth strategy .", "while there have been and will continue to be many challenges associated with operating during the pandemic , i 'm very proud of our team for taking decisive steps to improve long - term shareholder value .", "it is because of them that i 'm confident we have the people , the strategy , and the resources to navigate this fluid environment and execute our plan over the coming years ."], "summary_gold": "beazer homes q3 earnings per share $ 0.51 .<q>q3 earnings per share $ 0.51 .<q>qtrly homebuilding revenue of $ 532.5 million , up 10.4 % .<q>also announced retirement and succession plans for robert l. salomon , executive vice president and cfo .<q>beazer homes usa -
