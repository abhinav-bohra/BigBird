end growers have told us that current market issues are not impacting them at all , and they continue to flourish .", "another important fact to remember is that unlike in 2018 , there are no regulatory issues getting in the way right now .", "three years ago , california badly boxed the rollout of the recreational marketplace .", "that overwhelmingly was the issue that impacted the market back then .", "it was nearly impossible to get a license to operate legally , regardless of whether you were a cultivator or a dispensary .", "while the current marketplace in california remains more expensive and bureaucratic than other states , it is vastly improved from what we 've seen in the past and the legal market there continues to grow .", "some of you are also wondering whether the current situation will result in some consolidation .", "the answer is pretty simple .", "yes , of course , it will .", "but those kinds of ebbs and flows are exactly what we expect to happen .", "it 's what happened in colorado back in 2015 , it happened in oregon when it went legal , and it 's likely to happen in california to some degree .", "in fact , that 's also what we 're seeing right now in oklahoma .", "like many new markets , oklahoma , had explosive growth out of the gates and probably got a bit overbuilt .", "so we expect to pause there before growth resumes .", "we have told you repeatedly over the years that this industry is likely to be choppy from time to time .", "this is not the first time the industry has seen an oversupply of cannabis and just to be clear , it will not be the last .", "what 's important for hawthorne as we keep running our play .", "the growth will be there in the long term .", "i 'm not worried about that .", "instead , i want to make sure that we 're doing everything we need to distance ourselves from the competition .", "jim has already told you that we wo n't slow down on our innovation efforts , which , by the way , go much further than just new product development , which brings me full circle to the mjbiz conference a couple of weeks ago in vegas .", "like most major trade shows , mjbiz , was canceled last year due to covid .", "so we have n't seen the industry all - in - one place for over two years .", "what was clear to us and frankly , nearly everyone we interacted with is how far hawthorne has come in those two years and how much we 've distanced ourselves from the competition .", "we have fundamentally changed our approach to selling , and that transformation is continuing .", "we 've brought new products to the market that have improved the results for growers , by both increasing the yields and lowering their operating costs .", "and we 've used the innovation to help us in more qualitative ways , like the establishment of the hawthorne social justice fund , within our corporate foundation .", "while i understand the questions you all need to ask about the step down in our growth rate , i would urge you not to lose sight of the bigger picture .", "there is no doubt that we 're the clear leader in the industry .", "there is no doubt that our competitive advantages are unique , and there 's also no doubt that the cannabis industry still has miles of runway ahead of it .", "so looking ahead at fiscal ' 22 , i 'm not worried about a few speed bumps .", "rather , i 'm excited to see how much further we can push this business , and continue to lead the way in an industry , that remains poised for years of growth .", "let 's move down the p&l now to the gross margin line .", "like nearly all other cpg companies , we 've continue to see pressure from higher commodities and distribution costs .", "however , the year -
