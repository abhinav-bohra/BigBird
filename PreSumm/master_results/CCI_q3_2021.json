effective way to deploy spectrum at scale and established broad network coverage .", "with our high quality towers concentrated in the top markets , we are clearly benefiting from this focus with an expected 6 % organic growth for our tower segment in 2021 and an expected 20 % increase in tower core leasing activity next year when compared to these 2021 levels .", "with history as a guide , we believe the deployment of additional spectrum on existing cell sites will not be enough to keep pace with the persistent 30 % plus annual growth in mobile data traffic .", "as a result , we expect cell site densification to remain a critical tool for carriers to respond to the continued growth in mobile data demand as it enables our customers to get the most out of their spectrum assets by reusing the spectrum over shorter and shorter distances .", "when the current cell site upgrade phase shift to densification phase , we believe the comprehensive offering of towers , small cells and fiber will be critical for our customers and provide us with an opportunity to further extend the runway of growth in our business .", "while we expect the densification phase of build out will drive additional leasing on our tower assets for years to come , we believe small cells will play an even greater role as the coverage area of cell sites will continue to shrink due to the density of people and therefore the density of wireless data demand .", "with more than 80,000 small cells on air or committed in our backlog , high capacity fiber assets and the vast majority of the top 30 markets in the u.s. and industry -
