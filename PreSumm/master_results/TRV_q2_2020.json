tax net investment income decreased by 54 % from the prior year quarter to $ 251 million , somewhat better result than we had previewed in our call last quarter .", "the decrease was driven by a non-fixed income returns , where results for our private equity , hedge fund and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a one quarter lag .", "accordingly , the impact of the disruption in global financial markets that occurred in the latter half of the first quarter impacted our second quarter results .", "as the broader markets have recovered in the second quarter , that should , at least to some extent , benefit our non-fixed income results in the third quarter .", "it 's worth mentioning here that recoveries may not be reflected in the private equity and hedge fund results as quickly as the downturns were .", "given continued economic uncertainty , fund managers who report their results to us may take a more measured approach and not be as quick to write - back up the valuations they just marked down , particularly in light of what may be continued challenging prospects for the earnings and cash flows of the funds underlying investments .", "fixed income returns decreased by $ 24 million after tax as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates and the mix change , as we chose to maintain a somewhat higher level of liquidity and held more short -
