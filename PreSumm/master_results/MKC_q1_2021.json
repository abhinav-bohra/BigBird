per - share growth of approximately 4 % .", "we are increasing our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations to growth of 5 % to 7 % , which includes a favorable impact from currency .", "this increase reflects our higher adjusted operating profit outlook and the impact from optimizing our long -

19 costs , our incremental erp investments and the tax headwind .", "based on the expected timing of some expense items such as covid - 19 costs and brand marketing investments as well as a low tax rate in the first half of last year , we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year .", "our first quarter performance was a strong start to the year , and we are optimistic for the balance of the year , though we recognize we are lapping a very strong earnings performance in the second quarter of 2020 while also making investments to drive growth in 2021 .", "in summary , we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook , with earnings growth partially offset by incremental covid -
