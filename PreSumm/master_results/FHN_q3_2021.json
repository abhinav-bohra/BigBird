term headwinds that the industry is facing with continued pressure on short - term rates and strong competition given growing levels of excess liquidity and muted loan demand .", "given the continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment as markets reopen , i 'm increasingly confident that our client - focused value proposition with a broad product set positions us well to be nimble and focus on the key segments where we can differentiate .", "as a result , there were several bright spots in the quarter that i think are worthy of noting .", "our net interest income was down in the quarter given expected reductions in net merger - related and ppp portfolio benefits .", "we generated core net interest income growth of 1 % with underlying loan growth of 1 % , which was driven by a commercial loan growth of 2 % .", "we continue to see momentum in our commercial pipelines and the quarter ended with unfunded commitments up 5 % to just over $ 19 billion .", "our team remains strongly focused on serving clients and anticipating their needs to continue to deepen relationships across our expanded footprint .", "our net interest - bearing deposits declined 3 basis points -- our net interest deposit cost declined 3 basis points in the quarter .", "the team is intensely focused on moving our costs toward peer median , and we think we are well positioned to hit the target sometime next year .", "it 's also important to note that we 're well positioned to benefit in a rising rate environment and ended the quarter with interest rate sensitivity profile of a 16 % increase in net interest income and a 100 - basis point shock across the yield curve .", "and while we expected total fees to be down given relatively healthy levels of fixed income and mortgage banking fees last quarter , we also saw a return to more normalized levels in traditional banking fees , which were up 2 % in the quarter with particular strength in wealth on strong annuity sales .", "credit quality continues to be excellent with improvement in the overall quality of the loan portfolio highlighted by net charge offs of only 2 basis points and a 47 % decrease in loan balances on deferral in the quarter .", "that , coupled with improving macroeconomic environment , drove another robust reserve release with a provision credit of $ 85 million in the quarter .", "this was a 26 % decrease in the provision benefit this quarter versus last quarter .", "given the impact of cecl , as we look ahead , provision expense will likely be a headwind for us and the industry overall .", "as our capital levels remain strong with a cet1 ratio of around 10.1 % , we increased our capital return by nearly 60 % in the quarter , repurchasing 9 million shares of common stock and ended the quarter with a tangible book value per share of $ 10.88 .", "and despite the difficult decision to delay the systems integration until february of next year , we continue to execute on the objectives of the moe , with strong progress on integrating systems and aligning products and capabilities , including piloting a new digital platform for treasury services , launching new relationship and banker profitability tools , and completing the first round of banking center consolidations .", "given some higher cost tied to integration of our platforms along with higher costs due to markets reopening , much of which is marketing , as well as the seasonality and the idiosyncratic items , our expenses were up 3 % in the quarter .", "however , as anthony will cover later , we expect expenses to moderate in the fourth quarter .", "alongside our integration efforts , we continue to invest in technology and people to drive revenue synergies and expense efficiencies , and thus far we 've identified approximately $ 35 million in revenue synergies tied to the merger .", "we remain confident in our ability to deliver at least $ 200 million in net annualized savings by the fourth quarter of next year .", "as we begin to look ahead in the next year , i 'm increasingly optimistic about the pace of the macroeconomic recovery as the world emerges from the pandemic and that the power of our combined organization will continue to be increasingly evident .", "i 'm very grateful for the dedication and hard work of our associates as they continue to work to deliver value for all of our constituents ; clients , communities , and shareholders and help drive the momentum to achieve our long - term performance objectives .", "and now , anthony will run through the financial details .", "slide 6 provides the highlights of the quarter , most of which bryan has already covered .", "overall we continue to make solid progress across the combined organization , and we 're pleased to see evidence of the power of the moe starting to emerge .", "i 'll briefly touch on slide 7 where we outline the notable items in the quarter which reduced our results by $ 51 million after - tax or $ 0.09 per share .", "in addition to merger - related notable items of $ 44 million , we recorded $ 23 million of non-cash , pre-tax costs tied to retiring legacy iberiabank trust preferred securities in the quarter and expect to record an additional $ 3 million next quarter .", "the redemptions will reduce interest expense by about $ 5 million annually with an expected payback of approximately five years .", "slide 8 provides an overview of our adjusted financials for the quarter .", "we generated ppnr of $ 284 million as underlying improvement in core net interest income and traditional banking fees was masked by the impact of expected declines in net merger - related and ppp non net interest income along with lower fixed income and mortgage banking fees .", "adjusted expenses of $ 480 million moved higher largely reflecting idiosyncratic items tied to strategic investments and additional costs we incurred tied to markets reopening .", "given continued improvement in the macroenvironment , overall credit quality , and muted loan growth , we posted a credit to provision of $ 85 million , which was down from $ 115 million credit last quarter .", "this reduction drove a $ 0.04 decline in eps .", "but overall , we continue to post healthy returns with an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 18.4 % and 14 % before the impact of the provision credit .", "as bryan mentioned , tangible book value per share came in at $ 10.88 , up 1 % as gaap net income was largely offset by a $ 0.23 impact tied to the return of capital and a $ 0.07 decline tied to the mark - to - market on the security portfolio in oci .", "moving to slide 9 , net interest income was down $ 5 million linked quarter given the expected decrease tied to lower merger accretion and ppp portfolio balances , core net interest income was up 1 % as the benefit of lower deposit cost , day count , commercial loan growth , and higher investment portfolio income was partially offset by continued declines in consumer loan balances and overall loan spread compression , given the continued reductions in libor and the competitive landscape .", "during the quarter , we ramped up our security purchases to put more excess cash to work and added around $ 400 million on a spot basis at a yield of around 1.5 % .", "as a result , our securities to interest - earning assets ended the quarter at 11 % , up 1 % .", "our current plan is to put a total of $ 1 billion of excess cash to work in securities by year - end , and we will continue to reevaluate opportunities to redeploy additional cash as we move forward .", "reported nim was down 7 basis points linked quarter with core nim down 8 basis points , driven by a 5 basis point impact tied to higher excess cash .", "we ended the quarter with excess cash of $ 14 billion , up from $ 12.7 billion in the second quarter .", "core nim was also lower given a 2 basis point reduction in interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans , as well as overall spread tightening with new origination spreads down around 15 basis points linked quarter , which collectively translated to about 3 basis points of pressure on the margin .", "we also generated a 2 basis point benefit to the margin with further improvement in the deposit mix for the dda and a decline in interest - bearing deposits .", "i would also note that this quarter we added disclosure to the relationship of core net interest income to risk - weighted assets to help illustrate the impact of nii , excluding the excess cash position .", "under this view , you can see that year - over - year , the metric is down about 10 basis points compared to the core margin , which is down about 40 basis points .", "and on slide 10 , let 's cover the puts and takes on fees .", "headline fees were down around 7 % in the quarter .", "this reflected anticipated declines in other non-interest income and fixed income and mortgage that were partially offset by growth in brokerage trust and insurance tied to higher annuity sales , as well as higher service charges and fees as an increase in transaction volume and higher leasing income tied to terminations helped to mitigate the impact of a recent change in our nsf pricing structure .", "fixed income average daily revenue came in at $ 1.3 million compared with $ 1.4 million last quarter .", "mortgage banking and title fees were down $ 4 million given continued spread tightening and our focus on driving more of our originations on balance sheet .", "while overall originations were down 11 % for the quarter , portfolio originations were up 5 % .", "the reduction in our other non-interest income was driven by an $ 11 million decrease in security gains tied to a legacy ibkc investment in the second quarter .", "with regard to service charges , we recently began aligning key features across the legacy institutions approach to service charges , with the goal of simplifying and streamlining the experience for our clients .", "the new program was launched in late august at first horizon , with the remainder of the change occurring following the system conversions in february for our iberiabank franchise .", "over time , we expect the changes to reduce our overall nsf overdraft fees in the range of $ 9 million to $ 10 million annually , with changes going into production in august for first horizon and with the february conversion for the iberiabank clients .", "adjusted expenses totaled $ 480 million , up $ 15 million in the quarter , largely because of seasonality and some idiosyncratic costs related to strategic investments and additional costs related to markets reopening , which was slightly offset by $ 1 million tied to incremental merger cost saves .", "personnel expense decreased $ 4 million linked quarter with salaries and benefits stable as a $ 4 million fica credit helped mitigate the impact of day count , seasonally higher medical cost , and labor supply constraints .", "incentives and commissions remained relatively stable as a $ 3 million increase from pandemic - related vacation carryover partially offset lower revenue base payouts in fixed income and mortgage .", "i should note that as we continue to shift more of our mortgage originations on balance sheet , you will see a reduction in mortgage fee income without a corresponding reduction in incentives .", "additionally , higher contractor cost tied to investments in new systems , largely in areas like treasury solutions and business banking online , as well as increased advertising spend given our reopening of markets , pushed outside services up $ 9 million .", "and finally , other non-interest expense was up $ 11 million in the quarter driven by higher tax credit related contributions , a $ 2 million increase in fraud cost , and higher travel and entertainment costs also for markets reopening .", "we are focused on driving efficiencies and identifying opportunities to redeploy expenses toward areas which provide higher growth for the organization , particularly post the systems conversions in february .", "on slides 12 and 13 , we cover our balance sheet profile .", "excluding ppp balances , which were down $ 1.8 billion in the quarter , average loans increased 1 % in the quarter .", "and as bryan mentioned , this reflected commercial growth of 2 % .", "our pricing strategies in the mortgage warehouse business helped deliver a 7 % increase in balances with purchase volume up 3 percentage points linked quarter to 56 % .", "additionally , we continue to see traction in other specialty businesses with growth in asset - based lending , equipment finance , and franchise finance , somewhat offset by reduction in commercial real estate , given higher levels of refinancing activity from the capital markets .", "this is being somewhat offset by continued pressure in retail real estate secured refinancings , which drove a 1 % decline in consumer loans , but we 're reviewing opportunities to increase our recapture of these with refi opportunities .", "overall , we are pleased to see the path of the economic recovery and the increased activity levels across our footprint translate to this level of loan growth .", "on the liability side , we saw a continued inflow of deposits , driven by a $ 1.1 billion average increase in dda , or 4 % , which helped to further improve the mix of deposits .", "and with interest - bearing deposit costs down 3.3 basis points to 17 basis points for the quarter , our total funding costs improved 2 basis points .", "as bryan mentioned , we are intensely focused on driving our interest - bearing deposit costs down toward peer median levels .", "on slide 14 and 15 we provide information on the asset quality and reserves where we continue to see exceptional low levels of charge - offs in non-performing loans and our allowance coverage of loans is healthy at 1.45 % and 1.65 % , excluding loans to mortgage companies and the ppp portfolio .", "additionally , when you consider the unrecognized discount on acquired loans , our total loss absorption is roughly 2 % , which is very strong .", "turning to capital on slide 16 .", "our cet1 ratio of 10.1 % , down from 10.3 % in the second quarter tied to the accelerated share repurchases in the quarter , loan growth , and higher unfunded commitments .", "as bryan mentioned , we returned $ 224 million in capital to common shareholders during the quarter , including $ 142 million , or 9 million shares of common stock repurchases .", "moving on to merger integration on slide 17 .", "while we had to delay the core systems conversions to early next year , we continue to make substantial progress across a number of fronts .", "during the quarter , we completed a couple of conversion events and completed our wealth and trust and credit card conversions , finalized the mortgage system conversion , and launched a pilot of our new online banking platform for commercial customers .", "we achieved $ 96 million in annualized run rate savings against our net target of $ 200 million .", "additionally , we continued making solid traction on revenue synergies and have thus far identified roughly $ 35 million of annualized revenue synergies that are tied to commercial loans and additional synergies tied to debt capital markets , mortgage , and private client wealth .", "we are extremely focused on retaining and growing our client base by continuing to enhance or expand our set of products and services .", "on slide 18 , we provided our fourth quarter outlook .", "we expect nii to be down at the high end of the low - single - digit range with average interest - earning assets and loans down modestly given the outlook for reduced merger accretion and ppp benefits and continued low rates .", "we expect to continue to see modest loan growth , excluding ppp , and that we will see benefits as we continue to lower deposit costs .", "at period end , we had a total of $ 2 billion in ppp loans , including $ 600 million related to round 1 and total ppp fees of $ 45 million .", "we expect the vast majority of the round 1 portfolio to be forgiven by the end of the year and that the round 2 will largely be forgiven by the third quarter of next year .", "regarding non-interest income , we expect fee income to be down in the high and the mid- to - high single - digit range with additional decreases tied to our nsf pricing changes and seasonally lower mortgage and wealth fees , as well as further moderation in fixed income .", "we expect non-interest expense to decrease in the low - single - digit range with higher third quarter levels , which included investments , seasonality cost tied to markets reopening , and some idiosyncratic items .", "and our outlook calls for charge - offs to be in the range of 5 to 15 basis points and that it 's reasonable to see continued reserve outflows near term .", "finally , we expect our cet1 ratio to remain in the 9.5 % to 10 % range .", "as bryan mentioned , we feel good about our positioning and our ability to perform well given the current economic environment .", "finally , slide 19 includes our short - and long - term objectives .", "we believe our more diversified model and highly attractive franchise will continue to deliver revenue synergies and loan growth .", "our moe objectives to complete the systems integration and to identify other expenses to redeploy to higher - growth and higher - return opportunities will allow us to continue to support the dynamic digital needs of our clients and associates and drive continuous improvement in productivity and efficiency beyond the integration .", "and as we continue to actively manage capital , our balance sheet , and credit quality performance position us well to continue to deliver attractive results near term and into the future .", "and with that , i 'll give the call back to bryan .", "i 'm excited about the momentum in the results of the combined organization and what we 've achieved this quarter .", "the power of our attractive franchise , with the benefit of a more diversified business model in higher growth markets , is evident in our results .", "the progress we have made toward our merger integration objectives continues to deliver revenue synergies , provide our clients with improved products and technology .", "as the macroeconomic environment continues to improve , our capital structure and risk management infrastructure positions us to deliver higher growth and top -
