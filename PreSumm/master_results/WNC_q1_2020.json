quarter financial results .", "on a consolidated basis , first - quarter revenue was $ 387 million , with consolidated new trailer shipments of approximately 9,150 units during the quarter .", "as brent mentioned , customer pickups of equipment were below our initial expectations for the quarter , leading to revenue also coming in below expectations .", "first -

plus percent .", "so in total , i 'd like to think of our total cost base is approximately 75 % to 80 % variable .", "we have moved quickly to ensure that our variable costs are coming down in line with volumes .", "additionally , we have temporarily but significantly reduced fixed costs in the second quarter by executing a two - week , companywide furlough that incorporated 90 % of all salaried employees .", "we plan to handle the near - term market disruptions with furloughs and downtime as we continue to work to permanently lower cost .", "we will give an update on some of these plans at the second - quarter call .", "we are also heavily scrutinizing and anticipating cutting most discretionary , nonessential expenditures in the short term .", "in addition , executive officers took voluntary salary cuts , as brent mentioned .", "we have a significant amount of our incentive - based pay that is tied to financial performance metrics , like operating income and free cash flow .", "and these act as a relief by significantly reducing depending on financial performance .", "i 'd like to stress that we have contingency plans for multiple scenarios .", "and while the actions we 've walked through are important steps in reducing costs , we have additional levers that we 're ready and able to pull should the situation dictate .", "given that we 're all managing through unprecedented uncertainty and conditions , that can change at a moment 's notice , we have decided the time is not right to provide detailed forward guidance .", "however , under current circumstances , we expect free cash flow to be positive in 2020 .", "moving on to our balance sheet .", "our liquidity or cash plus available borrowings as of march 31 was $ 277 million with $ 155 million of cash and $ 122 million of availability on our revolving credit facility .", "in march of this year , we proactively drew $ 45 million from the revolver to bolster our cash balance .", "our modeling suggested a $ 45 million revolver pool covered the worst case we could envision , which is to say , we do not expect to tap our revolving credit facility again in 2020 , but it is further liquidity that remains available to us .", "moving on to capital allocation on slide 6 .", "regarding capital expenditures , we are again heavily scrutinizing spend and only proceeding with projects that are critical to the maintenance of our existing operations .", "we are targeting a 50 % reduction from our previous guidance to approximately $ 20 million in spend and stand ready to reduce further as required .", "we expect to free up cash through working capital reductions , and that , coupled with our quick and decisive cost cuts , should allow us to deliver positive free cash flow even in this difficult operating environment .", "with regard to capital allocation during the first quarter , we invested $ 6.3 million in capital projects , paid our quarterly dividend of $ 4.5 million and repurchased $ 8.9 million of shares prior to the pandemic .", "for the near term , our approach to capital allocation centers around preservation of cash .", "we will carefully control capital expenditures while prioritizing our dividend and assessing opportunities for debt reduction .", "turning to our debt structure , our nearest maturity is not until march of 2022 when our term loan matures .", "the balance stands at just $ 135 million , and we expect to look to refinance this instrument in the next year .", "we are covenant - light with no financial covenants on our term loan or high - yield bonds .", "the only potential financial covenant in place is on our revolving credit facility , which dictates a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of one to one when excess availability on the revolver is less than 10 % of the total facility .", "we obviously do not expect this covenant to come into play .", "we 've been in close contact with our bank group over the past couple of months .", "they have been very helpful in advising on the trends that they see developing in the debt markets , and we have confidence in continuing with the partnerships that we have in place .", "now finally on slide 7 , i think it might be helpful to spend a moment comparing where the company stands now compared to prior cycles .", "with the uniquely severe nature of this crisis , it seems like the 2008 to 2009 time period will provide the most relevant comparison .", "while we know some of you who have followed wabash for more than a decade , i think it would be useful to discuss some of the challenges the company faced during the last cycle and why we do n't expect a repeat this time .", "first and foremost , in early 2008 , the company did not have the cash or liquidity balance that it enjoys today .", "this lack of liquidity , combined with limited access to fresh capital during the financial crisis , forced the companies to take drastic steps that we will not repeat .", "i think it 's fair to say that experience has left a scar tissue around the organization , and those are mistakes that we will not repeat .", "and clearly , our present liquidity situation speaks to that .", "beyond our presently stronger liquidity situation , this company has also grown and diversified our product and end market exposure over the last decade .", "we have gone from primarily a producer of dry vans to a holistic provider of transportation equipment and expanding our portfolio to include tank trailers , truck bodies and expanding our customer and end market exposure accordingly .", "in summary , we feel that we 're well -
