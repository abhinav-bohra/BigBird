month q4 maintenance renewal rate of 88 % was above the low - to mid-80 % renewal rates we noted -- we expected in 2021 .", "based on our customers ' loyalty and strong execution of our customer and go - to - market teams , we expect to return to our retention rates to improve in 2022 and approach our historical best - in - class levels in the low - 90 % range .", "our continued focus on driving subscription - first resulted in an 18 % year - over - year increase in subscription revenues in the fourth quarter , and we believe we are well - positioned to accelerate this level of growth moving forward .", "for the full year , we delivered $ 719 million of gaap revenues , representing flat year - over - year performance relative to 2020 ; and adjusted ebitda of $ 303 million , representing a 42 % ebitda margin while growing subscription revenue 19 % year over year on a gaap basis .", "we anticipate both our license and subscription revenues to grow in 2022 , reflecting a recovery in sales to new and existing customers and further expanding our recurring revenue base .", "our focus on delivering simple , powerful and secure solutions , combined with our still very early efforts to build out our system integrator and enterprise go -

able as the spin has been completed prior to the start of the fourth quarter .", "in addition , our public filings will present n - able as discontinued operations in prior periods for better comparability .", "at the start of 2021 , we determined not to provide full year guidance , given the uncertainty we faced at that time as a result of the cyber incident , the ongoing impact of the covid -

to mid-80s , we ended the year with renewal rates at approximately 88 % for 2021 .", "we also saw new sales improve as we moved through the year in our commercial business , and our fourth quarter financial results reflect another quarter of improving execution .", "that execution led to another quarter of better -

over - year declines in license sales for the past nine quarters and a reduction in our renewal rates in 2021 .", "the trend of lower license sales intensified with the introduction of subscriptions of our licensed products in the second quarter of 2020 , as well as the cyber incident in december of 2020 as well .", "we focus more of our efforts on longer - term customer success and retention .", "as i mentioned earlier , we are encouraged by the fact that our renewal rates remained higher than our expectation of low - to mid-80s that we shared at the start of 2021 .", "on a trailing 12 -

premises subscription sales resulted in an approximately 8 percentage point headwind to our license revenue for the quarter .", "moving to our subscription revenue .", "fourth quarter subscription revenue was $ 34.4 million , up 18 % year over year .", "this increase is due to the additional subscription revenue from sentryone products , as well as increased sales of our on - premises subscriptions as part of our early efforts to shift more of our business to subscription .", "total arr reached approximately $ 631 million as of december 31 , 2021 , reflecting year - over -

premises subscription sales , as well as sales of our database offerings , including the sentryone products acquired in the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "total license and maintenance revenue for the full year in 2021 decreased 3 % year over year to $ 594 million .", "total maintenance revenue grew 2 % , reaching $ 479 million .", "license revenue for the full year was negatively impacted by a combination of the 2021 cyber incident and the impact of offering perpetual license products on a subscription basis , which we expect to yield more revenue over the full duration of a typical customer lifetime but negatively impacts license revenue and total revenue in the near - term .", "we finished 2021 with 829 customers that have spent more than $ 100,000 with us in the last 12 months , which is a 5 % improvement over the previous year .", "we continue to supplement our traditional high - velocity , low - touch sales approach with targeted efforts to build larger relationships with our enterprise customers , which we spoke about at our analyst day in november .", "we delivered a solid fourth quarter of non-gaap profitability .", "fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was $ 78.4 million , representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 42 % , exceeding the high end of the outlook for the quarter despite continuing to invest in our business .", "and for the year ended december 31 , 2021 , adjusted ebitda was $ 303 million , representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 42 % as well .", "excluded from adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter are one - time costs of approximately $ 9.3 million of cyber incident related remediation , containment , investigation and professional fees , net of insurance proceeds .", "these one - time costs for the full year of 2021 totaled approximately $ 33.1 million net of insurance reimbursements .", "these cyber incident - related costs are not included in the adjusted ebitda , are one - time and nonrecurring .", "they are separate and distinct from our secure by design initiatives , which are aimed at enhancing our it security and supply chain processes .", "costs related to our secure by design initiatives are and will remain part of our recurring cost structure on a go - forward basis .", "we expect one - time cyber incident - related costs to fluctuate in future quarters , but to overall , lower in future periods .", "these one - time cyber costs are , however , difficult to predict .", "net leverage on december 31 was approximately 3.9 times our trailing 12 - month adjusted ebitda .", "as a reminder , we retained the full amount of the $ 1.9 billion in term debt that we had prior to the spin - off of n - able .", "our cash balance was $ 732 million at the end of the fourth quarter , bringing our net debt to approximately $ 1.2 billion .", "our plan is to keep that cash on our balance sheet for the foreseeable future .", "we intend to maintain flexibility as it relates to our cash on balance sheet .", "our debt matures in february of 2024 , and we expect to reevaluate our level of gross debt and possible paydowns well in advance of that maturity date .", "i will now walk you through our outlook before turning it back over to sudhakar for some final thoughts .", "we are providing guidance for the first quarter of 2022 and for the full year of 2022 for total revenue , adjusted ebitda margins and earnings per share .", "for the full year guidance of 2022 , we expect total revenue to be in the range of $ 730 million to $ 750 million , representing year - over - year growth of 2 % to 4 % .", "we expect our total revenue to be positively impacted by increases in our license revenue , as well as subscription revenue growth as a result of an increase in new sales in 2022 as compared to 2021 .", "we will lead with a subscription - first focus as it relates to new sales , and we 'll also focus on migrating our maintenance customers to our observability products , which are sold as subscriptions , especially in the second half of the year when we expect that more of the functionality will be available .", "we expect that our total revenue growth will be partially offset by a decline in maintenance revenue due to lower license sales over the past two years .", "adjusted ebitda margin for the year is expected to be approximately 41 % .", "non-gaap fully diluted earnings per share is projected to be $ 1.01 to $ 1.08 per share , assuming an estimated 162.6 million fully diluted shares outstanding .", "our full year and first quarter guidance assumes a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.13 down from the 1.16 we assumed for 2022 when we provided our initial 2022 outlook at our analyst day in november .", "even so , we are comfortable reaffirming the guidance we gave previously .", "for the first quarter of 2022 , we expect total revenue to be in the range of $ 173 million to $ 176 million , representing a year -

term , we are committed to and excited about the investments in our business that we shared with you at our analyst day in november .", "finally , we believe our unlevered free cash flow conversion will improve in 2022 over 2021 and we expect to be in line with our fourth quarter 2021 levels .", "i 'm pleased with our strong q4 performance , exceeding our outlook in both total revenue and adjusted ebitda and with how we ended 2021 .", "we are executing our mission to help customers accelerate their business transformation via simple , powerful and secure solutions for multi-cloud environments .", "i 'm excited about accelerating our ability to serve our customers and to grow our business .", "we expect to deliver strong license and subscription growth in 2022 via continued execution of our strategy .", "in 2022 , we will continue our journey of subscription growth with unified platforms , superior customer experiences , expanding go -
