related mortality , with a loss of $ 58.3 million in the first quarter compared to a loss of $ 21.9 million in the fourth quarter .", "the change from the fourth to the first quarter is largely explained by the national covid -

over - year basis .", "although we are encouraged by the improved income in the international operations , we do remain cautious with our near - term outlook as both the u.k. and poland deal with covid and related economic impacts .", "next , we are very pleased with the results generated by colonial life , with adjusted operating income of $ 73.3 million in the first quarter compared to $ 71.2 million in the fourth quarter .", "this uptick was primarily driven by a slight improvement in the benefit ratio and a lower expense ratio .", "the benefit ratio of 55.4 % was slightly improved from 56.6 % in the fourth quarter but did remain higher than our historical trends due to the continued impact from covid on our life insurance line .", "results in the accident , sickness , and disability line , as well as the cancer and critical illness line , were generally consistent with our long - term experience .", "premium income for the first quarter picked up slightly from the fourth quarter , increasing 1.8 % , primarily the result of favorable persistency trends .", "we will need to see further recovery in new sales to rebuild premium growth back to the historic levels of 5 % to 6 % .", "we 're encouraged by the sales trends we saw in the first quarter for colonial .", "although quarterly sales were down 9.2 % year - over - year , that has sharply improved from the 31 % cumulative decline we experienced for the last three quarters of 2020 .", "we look forward to further improvement in sales momentum over the balance of 2021 .", "we are encouraged by the uptake we are seeing in our recently developed digital enrollment tools , which in the quarter accounted for about 1/3 of our enrollments .", "it is also encouraging that face -

term assumption of a range of 85 % to 90 % , primarily due to the continued impact of covid - related mortality on our claimant block .", "in the first quarter , we estimate the accounts were approximately 15 % higher than expected , a similar trend to what we experienced in the fourth quarter .", "ltc claim incidence was higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and remains volatile on a monthly basis .", "we anticipate that the interest -
