term and post - pandemic revenue support .", "in our workplace furnishings segment , we see the potential for multiple supportive secular trends .", "first , increased office floor plate resets as organizations work to adjust to the new social distancing environment ; second , increased demand for our architectural products platform , which can quickly create physical separation with minimal construction time while maintaining natural life ; and third , more demand tied to work from home and from increased smaller satellite office locations .", "hni is uniquely positioned to benefit from these trends given the value orientation of many of our brands .", "generally , these trends will take some time to gain momentum .", "most of them will require a broader and more meaningful return to the office than we are currently seeing .", "customers are generally assessing their options right now and are still in a mode of figuring out next steps .", "these trends wo n't be enough to offset near -

from - home trends , record low mortgage rates and low housing inventory , all support positive demand patterns and should provide cyclical and secular support going forward .", "we are excited about the cyclical strength , secular opportunities and company - specific initiatives within our residential building products segment .", "i will then come back and give some concluding thoughts .", "consolidated non-gaap net income per diluted share was $ 0.20 .", "that was down from the $ 0.38 we reported in the second quarter of 2019 .", "second quarter consolidated organic sales decreased 21.2 % versus the prior year .", "including the benefit of acquisitions , sales were down 20.6 % .", "consolidated non-gaap operating income declined $ 9.4 million versus prior year on a sales decline of $ 109 million , which means our deleverage rates or decremental margin was 8.6 % .", "that 's well below our targeted range of 25 % , which includes the benefits of cost actions .", "given the circumstances , our members did a great job of limiting the impact of declining volume .", "in the workplace furnishings segment , first quarter sales decreased 24.8 % year - over - year .", "despite the top line pressure , we were able to generate $ 7.8 million of non-gaap operating income in the segment .", "while that is down from the $ 19.7 million in the prior year quarter , the decremental margin was only 11 % .", "sales in our residential building products segment decreased 8.6 % year -
