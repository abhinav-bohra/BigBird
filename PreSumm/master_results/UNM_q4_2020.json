tax operating income was $ 245.9 million or $ 1.21 per common share .", "so we saw about an $ 11 million decline in sequential quarterly earnings .", "as i 'll outline in my comments in more detail , the primary drivers of that quarter - to - quarter change were higher mortality impacts in us group life and colonial , higher short - term disability claims and leave volumes and group disability , and lower levels of miscellaneous investment income from bond call premiums .", "we did experience some favorable offsets from long - term care claims experience and positive marks on the alternative investment portfolio .", "before i begin my discussion of operating results this quarter , let me summarize for you the economic and business conditions that existed in the quarter and outline the impacts that it had on our results .", "first , as i mentioned , covid -

force blocks .", "we are seeing signs in our results as the impact is leveling out supporting our view that premium growth in 2021 for our core segments is expected to show a slight increase with group line increases offsetting small declines in the voluntary businesses .", "with a resurgence of infections and mortality in the fourth quarter , the reopening in the economy , with some people returning to more normal activity in their [ technical issues ] day -- generate some inconsistencies [ technical issues ] covid - related std claims increased with the resurgence of infections pressuring overall std benefits experience .", "leave requests continued to run significantly above year - ago levels and on a quarter - to - quarter basis , driving continued expense pressure in the group disability line .", "providing a small offset that was dental utilization in the fourth quarter , which was somewhat lower than we experienced in the third quarter .", "the net impact to our fourth quarter results from these trends was negative , related to what we experienced in the third quarter .", "finally , financial market conditions were generally favorable in the quarter .", "this is most impactful to unum in the credit markets where corporate bond spreads continue to tighten while us treasury rates did increase .", "this combination continues to create a challenge for achieving attractive new money yields on investment opportunities , but it is favorable for overall credit quality and our outlook going forward for potential credit impacts .", "we 've seen a dramatic reduction in downgrades and impairments in the first quarter 2020 , as well as the significant decline in our watchlist for potential credit concerns .", "in addition , the marks on our alternative asset investment portfolio showed a strong improvement in the fourth quarter and we estimate the portfolios recovered roughly half of the valuation decline experienced in the second quarter .", "against this high level backdrop , i 'll now focus on our business lines , beginning with unum us group disability .", "adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $ 64.7 million compared to $ 73 million in the third quarter .", "there were three primary factors that impacted these results .", "first , we experienced pressure on std claims from the resurgence in covid infection rates with the volume of covid -

term outlook as both the uk and poland and deal with covid impacts and related economic shutdowns .", "colonial life had a more challenging fourth quarter with adjusted operating income of $ 71.2 million compared to $ 92.2 million in the third quarter .", "these results were primarily impacted by a higher benefit ratio of 56.6 % compared to 52.2 % in the third quarter , which was primarily driven by higher covid -
