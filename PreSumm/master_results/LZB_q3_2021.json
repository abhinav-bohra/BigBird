19 , which i 'll detail more in a minute .", "and we delivered strong consolidated non-gaap operating margin of 9.5 % , including another profitable quarter for joybird .", "all of this on a base of last year 's third quarter , which was the strongest quarter in the company 's recent history for both the sales and consolidated operating margin .", "in addition , our strong cash generation enabled us to return more than $ 7 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we declared an increase in the dividend to 15 % -- to $ 0.15 per share .", "now i 'll take them out to explain the specific covid -

19 absenteeism disproportionately affecting our most mature us plants were our most complicated and higher price furniture is billed .", "so for the quarter with lower - than - expected units made particularly at our mature us facilities , there was a mix shift in production with fewer sectionals and other high - priced items manufactured , even though we have the orders for the .", "and because our la- z - boy furniture galleries stores tend to sell a higher proportion of custom product , sofas and sectionals with higher selling prices , our retail segment was particularly impacted by the shift in mix .", "additionally , we were affected by demand and covid issues impacting shipping routes around the globe and -- an experienced delays and overseas shipments of finished product to our international and case goods business .", "and of component parts to our manufacturing operations during the period , which impacted all of our business .", "as an example , we were short of supply of electronic components for our highest margin power units and this two contributed to the shift in mix .", "our supply chain challenges affected our quarter and we 'll continue to drive uncertainty in the near -

to - date , we paid $ 9.7 million in dividends to shareholders and spent approximately $ 1 million purchasing 22,000 shares of stock in the open market , since reinstating our program in december under our existing authorized share repurchase program , leaving 4.5 million shares of purchase availability in the program .", "and yesterday , our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend to $ 0.15 per share , demonstrating its confidence in the strength of our business .", "before turning the call back to kurt , let me highlight several important items for the upcoming fourth quarter .", "first , i remind you that our effective non-gaap adjustments for the fourth quarter will include purchase accounting and related tax adjustments for acquisitions to - date , which are expected to be a $ 0.02 per share benefit in the fourth quarter .", "this excludes any further adjustments to the joybird contingent consideration liability , which is dependent on estimates of joybird 's ongoing business trajectory .", "second , i remind you that last year 's fourth quarter included a one - time $ 16 million benefit in cost of sales for the rebate of previously paid tariffs , which was included in both our gaap and non-gaap results and which was mostly offset by a bad debt expense of $ 13.5 million , due to the art van furniture bankruptcy and a provision for potential credit losses in the covid - 19 environment also included in both our gaap and non-gaap results .", "our non-gaap results for last year 's fourth quarter excluded a non-cash , non-tax deductible joybird goodwill impairment charge of $ 27 million , mostly related to the future financial projections at the beginning of the pandemic , and a $ 6 million pre-tax benefit from purchase accounting , primarily related to the reversal of the joybird contingent consideration liability by its full carrying value also based on financial projections at that time .", "and now looking at our ongoing business .", "let me update the perspective previously provided for the fiscal ' 21 fourth quarter .", "but we think it important to offer it in the near - term given the unusual business trends , driven by the pandemic .", "we have a significant order backlog that will have a long tail in terms of production and deliveries .", "we are expanding output , and we will continue to increase production capacity .", "we are optimistic about our business trajectory and confident we will deliver strong results in the fourth quarter and beyond .", "with respect to raw materials , we took pricing on written orders beginning in october to cover cost increases given slower progress to work through our backlog in q3 , we will experience less of that benefit in q4 than originally expected .", "meanwhile with cost for raw materials continuing to escalate , as well as those for freight , we continue to evaluate the need for further pricing actions .", "also , as we saw in q3 , we are still experiencing extreme uncertainty with respect to covid - 19 , including related shutdowns and absenteeism affecting our plants , hiring challenges , impacts of global supply chain volatility impacting availability and timing of component parts and finished good shipments and most recently weather challenges .", "considering all of these factors , we now expect fiscal ' 21 fourth quarter consolidated sales growth of 34 % to 39 % versus the prior year fourth quarter , which included the month long pandemic shutdown .", "we expect non-gaap consolidated operating margin at the lower end of the 9 % to 11 % range .", "included in these margin expectations is the anticipation that joybird will sustain profitable operations , even as we test investment effect in this to optimize topline growth .", "and looking to next fiscal year .", "with our existing backlog of written orders and the capacity increases we have under way , we will not experience our usual seasonality in q1 and q2 .", "and instead , we expect to continue to make moderate sequential improvement in wholesale capacity from q4 throughout the first half of next fiscal .", "further as we increase efficiencies , we will focus on reinvesting a portion of returns back into our business to strengthen our capabilities for longer - term results beyond the pandemic .", "and of course , we expect the impacts of covid and the global supply chain disruptions to continue to cause uncertainty and some temporary volatility as we move forward .", "and now back to kurt .", "we feel very positive about our business for the long - term .", "we have always had one of the strongest brands in the industry and we believe we have further strengthened this over the past year allowing us to build market share and a more solid foundation from which to grow .", "at the same time we have build a sizable cash position , which provides us the mean and flexibility to invest in opportunities that will drive long - term growth and return for all of our stakeholders .", "i have made the decision to step down as president and ceo of la - z - boy after 42 - years associated with this great company and i will remain chairman of the board .", "this decision was not taken lightly and has been in the works for some time .", "i believe a thoughtful and dedicated leader should be responsible along with the board of directors for a well planned and comprehensive leadership transition .", "so the company may continue to move forward with this view of bumps in the road as possible .", "i believe we have accomplished that .", "these types of things have a timeline of their own and for la -
