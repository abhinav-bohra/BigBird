oriented businesses , environmental products and building materials continues to improve in north america , and the current outlook for the third quarter looks strong .", "however , we remain cautious on some of our international projects given the potential for a slower reopening outside the u.s. due to covid .", "i 'd also like to note that we are seeing higher costs for the plastic and fabric components of our environmental and construction mining systems .", "while this presents some near - term margin pressure , we expect to fully offset these higher costs through the ongoing efforts of our supply chain team as well as through pricing adjustments .", "overall , we expect another strong quarter for this segment with organic sales and margins at similar levels to the second quarter .", "in addition , normerica is now part of the performance materials segment , and the acquisition will contribute two months of sequential sales growth to the segment in the third quarter .", "as doug stated earlier , we expect modest earnings per share accretion to begin in the fourth quarter this year as we move through the integration period , ramping up to full run rate accretion over the next 12 months .", "and now let 's move to specialty minerals .", "specialty minerals sales were $ 142.7 million in the second quarter , 30 % higher than the prior year and 3 % lower sequentially .", "paper pcc sales grew 31 % versus the prior year on recovering paper demand and the continued ramp -
