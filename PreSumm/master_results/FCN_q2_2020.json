term uncertainty these days for a number of our businesses , but also the enormous confidence that we have in the medium - and long - term prospects for all of our businesses .", "so let me start with the results .", "one way to look at them , a pessimistic way to look at them , is to note that our adjusted earnings per share of $ 1.32 is down significantly from a year ago .", "another way to look at it , however , is to note first that we happen to be cycling an all - time record quarter for adjusted eps , so the comparison is a difficult one .", "but second and more important , if you step back and think about it , in the face of covid , in the face of some parts of our businesses being at record low levels of utilization due to travel restrictions , court closures , and other challenges arising from covid , and in the face of a substantial amount of extra capacity that was added pre-covid , we still managed to deliver the fifth best adjusted earnings per share ever in the history of this company and the highest revenue quarter ever .", "so i am extraordinarily positive about the results and i hope you are too .", "as we discussed during the last quarter 's earnings calls , we expected this to be a slow quarter .", "and parts of our business were , in fact , extraordinarily slow .", "obviously , a number of parts of flc , but in truth , parts of every segment .", "and yet overall , we have been able to deliver incredibly solid results .", "so let me just try to describe a little bit of how that happens .", "in part , it happens because the markets not only take away , they give .", "though discretionary spend on consulting services is , of course , down considerably , and as i think you know , deal flow is reduced and courts ' closures meant litigation was postponed , the covid crisis , and resulting economic turmoil created need as well .", "need for restructuring , for crisis communication , for crisis litigation support .", "so some of what we are seeing is simply a major shift in client needs and spend versus simply a reduction .", "so some of these results are market - driven .", "to me , what is much more powerful and much more relevant to our long - term efforts to build this enterprise for our people and for you , our shareholders , is to talk about the part of the results that are not due to market forces , but rather due , in recent times to the incredible efforts by our teams to work effectively from home , together with , over the last several years , the efforts of our people to strengthen our position , to extend into new adjacencies and geographies , and to anticipate and deliver on our clients ' needs .", "so i 'd like to try to illustrate that duality .", "first fin corp , and where you obviously , see incredible second - quarter results , but also into our other businesses in econ and flc and strat comms and tech as well .", "let me start with corp fin .", "i think -- i suspect that anyone in restructuring today is busy .", "and of course , most of you remember that corp fin 10 years ago in the midst of a market boom had record results .", "so it 's obviously easy to simply say , wow , the markets are up and so is fti 's corp fin business as well .", "for me , framing this point that way misses critical , powerful points .", "points that suggest , though , obviously , we are affected by markets , we are not forks on a wave .", "over time , we determine our destiny and part of what we are seeing is the markets , but part of what we are seeing is the result of actions that our teams have taken over time , not simply the markets .", "a couple of ways to see that , one way is to recall that corp fin -- our corp fin business was growing and thriving even before this market boom .", "in fact , during 2018 and 2019 , when the restructuring market was hovering around all - time lows , we delivered record revenues , up 17 % and 28 % , respectively .", "that was no way we were riding , that was us lifting us .", "it was the result of our teams ' investments and incredible efforts that drove those results .", "equally as powerful is to not just look at how similar we are in corp fin to where we were 10 years ago , but to look at how we 've changed since then , how we 've enhanced our positions .", "ten years ago , during the last recession , we already had a powerful , strong corp fin business .", "but we were primarily a u.s. business at that point in time .", "we were in london , but we were probably no .", "we did n't have a german business .", "we did n't have an asian or australian business .", "we had a smaller business in latin america , and even in the u.s. , we were primarily known as the best creditor rights business .", "we did , in fact , do company side work , but we were known primarily for our middle -

outs , in performance improvement , in merger integration , etc .", "there are waves in our business .", "but what our teams have done is to take a fundamentally strong u.s. business , and rather than sit on it , they 've made it fundamentally stronger , turning us into a powerful , global , multidimensional player .", "our success today reflects not just the markets , but the changes that our teams have driven and that is true for corp fin , but it 's also true for our other segments as well .", "i wo n't be as long - winded on the other segments , but let me touch on them .", "in strat comms , for those of you who have been long - term shareholders , you may remember that 10 years ago when the recession hit , that business , in large part , melted down .", "not because we were n't good , but because we -- we were focused on one part , an important part , but a small part of our clients ' core needs .", "today , some parts of this business are also extraordinarily slow , but critically , other parts are soaring .", "with the result that if you exclude the negative impact from fx and have through revenues and look at strat comm normalized for those , our strat comm revenues are actually up for the first half of 2020 .", "and i do n't know of any other competitor in that industry who can say that .", "similarly , if you look at econ , 10 years ago , we already had a fabulous econ business , but it was primarily a fabulous -- fabulous north american business .", "today , we still have a fabulous business in the u.s. , but now , we have a fabulous business in multiple locations around the world .", "and as a result , the time when litigation , investigations , and m&a transactions are down , and some have been delayed and travel is restricted , and you can't get to your clients , we have a business that even with some slow parts is overall even more in demand .", "and even in flc , where , as you can see from our results , we have had a drastic decline in revenues in a number of places due to some large jobs rolling off and the effect of the travel restrictions and the delays in litigation and investigations .", "even there , the breadth of the conversations we are having across multiple dimensions with clients remains robust , reflecting the investments our teams have made to increase the depth and the reach of our offerings , from construction to cyber to investigations to data and analytics in multiple places around the world .", "so , yes , what you are seeing on the negative and the positive side is somewhat a function of markets .", "markets fluctuate up and down and those affect us .", "to me , what is much more powerful and more durable is the nonmarket - driven pieces , the way our teams have invested to control our destiny , by growing core capabilities that allow us to serve the most important client needs in a wide range of circumstances .", "and that to me is a more powerful and the more exciting part of the results you 're seeing from this company .", "let me see if i can tie those observations about the quarter in our history to what we see going forward .", "first of all , the most obvious point , but one i have to underscore is something i 'm sure you all believe as well is that there is tremendous uncertainty in the world .", "i do n't think anyone can definitively say what the impact of covid will be over the longer term or even in the medium term on things like bankruptcy , m&a , litigation trends , or the economy more generally , or what the specific impact looks in different paces , in latin america , the u.s. , in india , in asia , the u.k . so i believe we have to recognize there 's clearly just a lot of uncertainty in the world , particularly , in the short term .", "and so therefore , you can run a lot of scenarios in terms of how our business is going to perform .", "for us , you could run an incredibly negative scenario .", "you could say , wow , what would happen if bankruptcies slowed down dramatically in the businesses that are slow , stays slow ?", "that would be a pretty negative scenario .", "we do n't believe that 's the most likely scenario .", "as ajay will talk about , our current belief is the strong businesses are likely to stay strong .", "and our businesses that have been weak so far this year are likely to see a recovery -- a gradual recovery , but a recovery .", "and that 's how we came to the judgment for the rest of the year that reaffirms our guidance .", "but we have to underscore the concept of uncertainty here .", "in these covid days , in truth , nobody knows the depth and duration of the impact we may see .", "and although we have enormous confidence in all of our businesses over any medium term , you could have a scenario where government actions cause a temporary pause on bankruptcies in some places around the world .", "and of course , you can always have the random idiosyncratic factors , like , you lose some big jobs instead of winning them .", "so please recognize , although we are reaffirming guidance , we also are and need to underscore just how uncertain the world is now .", "let me , therefore , instead talk to what i believe is more important , which is where based on the efforts our team have made and are making , we can drive this business in the medium and longer term .", "because over the medium and longer term , i believe markets matter but more at the core .", "as we just talked about my experience and i believe our results have shown that if you do the right things over a medium - term period , even though quarters can fluctuate and market conditions fluctuate , through the fluctuations , you build the business .", "so we focus a lot on making sure we 're thinking hard about what the right things are .", "so let me describe a few of them we talk about .", "first of all , not most critically , but importantly , focusing on knowing the difference between a bad business and a good business that happens to be hurt by some temporary factors , exogenous factors .", "we can't mix that up .", "we can't take a good business like our flc business or our efc business and overreact to temporary exogenous factors .", "second , it 's about being willing to support those good businesses during slow times , and indeed , invest in them even in slow quarters .", "in fact , in general , in some slow quarters , it 's especially important to be willing to invest in talent because it 's oftentimes the case that precisely in slow quarters , the most great talent is available .", "and to think about our history here , as we 've talked about a few times , some of the most important outside hires we 've done have been during slow times in our business .", "we got terrific cyber capabilities during a period where flc was slow .", "we acquired cdg , which augmented our company side capabilities in the u.s. at a time when corp fin was slow .", "and as you may have noticed , we just closed the deal with delta partners , which is in the non-restructuring part of cf at a period when the non-restructuring part of cf is not booming .", "we made each of those investments because we could find great talent .", "talent that we thought would collaborate terrifically with the rest of our firm at those point in time .", "talent we had confidence in , and it has proven , at least so far in the first two cases , that if you get great talent whenever it is available , over any medium term , it pays for itself , even if at that point in time that business is slow .", "our core belief , therefore , is , notwithstanding fluctuations in earnings .", "we always need to be focused on attracting , developing , and betting behind terrific talent , whether it is recruited or it 's homegrown .", "my experience is that if one does that , if we continue to do that , we will continue to do the essence of building a professional services firm .", "build great businesses , extend those businesses into new adjacencies , extend our core positions to new places , grow our brand , attract , grow , and retain , and develop great people .", "and as a result , be more relevant for your clients and take market share .", "and thereby , you build a firm and make sure people proud to be there and attracts other great people .", "and through that , ultimately , but also powerfully , delivers for you , our shareholders .", "that is the path we have been on these past few years , and i believe in the face of covid , it is even more important path to commit to stay on going forward .", "so with that , let me turn this over to ajay to take you through the quarter in more detail .", "beginning with the second - quarter results .", "as steve said , we reported record quarterly revenues and our results were better than we anticipated at the time of our last earnings call .", "considering the impact of the covid -

quarter 2020 net income of $ 48.2 million , compared to net income of $ 64.6 million in the prior - year quarter .", "the year - over - year decrease was largely due to higher compensation , which was primarily related to an 18.2 % increase in billable headcount and higher variable compensation , which was partially offset by a decline in sg&a expenses and a lower tax rate .", "sg&a expenses for 2q ' 20 of $ 126.9 million were 20.9 % of revenues .", "this compares to sg&a of $ 129.9 million or 21.4 % of revenues in the second quarter of 2019 .", "the decrease was primarily due to lower travel and entertainment expenses resulting from covid -
