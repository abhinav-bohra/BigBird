rex , beta and in other ownership interest .", "these declines in fair value were impacted by our outlook for transaction values as well as other company - specific factors .", "our general and administrative expenses were $ 2 million for the three months ended june 30th , 2020 as compared to $ 2.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 .", "our g&a expenses benefited from lower employee compensation , lower professional fees , lower office rental cost , lower depreciation and other costs .", "corporate expenses for the second quarter , which represent general and administrative expenses , excluding depreciation , stock - based compensation , severance and retirement costs and other non-recurring or other items , were $ 1.2 million as compared to $ 1.9 million in 2019 .", "in addition to the g&a reductions mentioned above , corporate expense has benefited from the reflection of director fees as a stock - based compensation item as well as a change that will result in a portion of management 's estimated incentive bonus compensation will also be paid invested equity instead of cash .", "note that we made this change in the second quarter , but it will be applicable for the year - to - date period .", "so approximately $ 0.1 million of the decline is attributable to this catch - up of the first quarter 's portion .", "as we 've mentioned before , we will continue to look for ways to reduce our cost structure .", "some of the steps that we are making now or plan to make are relatively small , but we understand every step counts .", "so , as an example , we are continuing to seek to minimize our office -
