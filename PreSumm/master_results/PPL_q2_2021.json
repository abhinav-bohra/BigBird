year period upon retirement of such assets , as well as return on those investments at the utilities then weighted average cost of capital .", "as we announced in january , mill creek unit 1 is expected to retire in 2024 .", "mill creek unit 2 and ew brown unit 3 are expected to be retired in 2028 as they reach the end of their economic useful lives .", "these units represent a combined 1,000 megawatts of coal -

leading performance and safety , reliability , customer satisfaction , and optional efficiency , advancing a clean energy transition while maintaining affordability and reliability , maintaining a strong financial foundation , and creating a long - term value for our shareowners , fostering a diverse and exceptional workplace , and building strong communities in the areas we serve .", "today , we announced second - quarter reported earnings of $ 0.03 per share .", "tax rate change and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt , partially offset by earnings from the u.k. utility business that have been recorded as discontinued operations .", "i 'll note that the tax - related item was a noncash adjustment prior to the completion of the sale of wpd in june .", "adjusting for these special items , second - quarter earnings from ongoing operations were $ 0.19 per share compared with $ 0.20 per share a year ago .", "we remain encouraged by the economic recovery from the pandemic in both our pennsylvania and kentucky jurisdictions , which has resulted in continuously improving commercial and industrial sales .", "these higher sales were offset by several factors , which i will cover on the next slide .", "so let 's move to slide 11 for a more detailed look at our second - quarter segment results .", "as a reminder , we 've adjusted the 2020 corporate and other amount to reflect certain costs previously reflected in the u.k. - regulated segment , which was primarily interest expense .", "total amount of these costs was about $ 0.02 per share for the quarter .", "turning to the ongoing segment results .", "our pennsylvania - regulated segment results were $ 0.02 per share lower compared to a year ago .", "the decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted gross margins , driven by lower transmission demand as discussed in q1 and consistent with our expectations and an increase in the reserve recorded as a result of a challenge to the transmission - based return on equity , partially offsetting these negative variances were increased returns on additional capital investments .", "we also experienced an additional $ 0.01 decline due to favorable tax - related items recorded in the second quarter of 2020 .", "turning to our kentucky - regulated segment .", "results were $ 0.01 per share higher than our comparable results in q2 2020 .", "the increase was primarily driven by higher commercial and industrial demand revenue as we experienced a strong recovery in 2021 in these sectors from the significant impacts of covid - 19 and lower interest expense primarily due to the interest costs previously allocated to the kentucky - regulated segment in 2020 that are now reflected in corporate and other .", "partly offsetting these items was higher operation and maintenance expense , primarily at our generation plants .", "results at corporate and other were flat compared with a year ago .", "higher interest costs of $ 0.01 a share related to the corporate debt previously allocated to the kentucky segment were offset by several factors that were not individually significant .", "i 'll cover some notable financing - related updates .", "first , following the sale of the u.k. utility business , we successfully completed a series of financing activities in june and july that led to a significant reduction in holding company debt .", "the result was a total reduction of ppl capital funding debt by about $ 3.5 billion , which was in line with our previously discussed targets .", "through these actions , we 've reduced total holding company debt to about 20 % of ppl 's total outstanding debt , while effectively clearing all near - term maturities at ppl capital funding through 2025 .", "in addition to the activity of ppl capital funding , we redeemed at par $ 250 million at lg&e and ku energy in july , which was part of our original financing plan for the year in order to simplify the capital structure of the company by eliminating intermediate holding company debt .", "that was the final remaining outstanding debt security at the lke entity .", "therefore , we have deregistered lke as we no longer expect to issue debt out of this entity .", "we expect ppl capital funding will be the financing entity at the holding company level to provide support to all of our operating subsidiaries .", "the successful execution of liability management leaves ppl well positioned and on track to achieve our targeted credit metrics post closing of the narragansett electric acquisition .", "in addition to these notable financing updates , we also reduced outstanding short - term debt as an efficient use of available cash until we fully deploy the remaining proceeds from the sale of wpd .", "in summary , as we continue to execute our strategic priorities , i am incredibly excited about ppl 's future .", "we continue to deliver electricity and natural gas safely , reliably , and affordably for our customers .", "we continue to evolve our clean energy strategy and to drive innovation across our company .", "we completed the sale of our u.k. utility business , achieving outstanding value for our shareowners .", "we 're on track to close on our narragansett acquisition within the expected time frames .", "and the new ppl will emerge from our strategic repositioning as a much stronger company , one poised for long -
