duration strategy .", "with that as a starting point , we believe that conditions later in 2021 and 2022 may create good entry points for these asset classes as the vaccine continues to be distributed , businesses reopen and recovery brings back the more cyclical real estate and infrastructure subsectors that have been disproportionately hit .", "in the fourth quarter , infrastructure returned 8.4 % , which lagged the global stock index return of 14.8 % .", "while we underperformed our benchmark in the fourth quarter , we exceeded our excess return target for the full year .", "assessing the infrastructure universe 's sensitivity to the economic situation and pandemic , we believe that 9 % benefits from secular trends , 50 % is relatively unaffected by the economy and pandemic , 20 % is directly sensitive to the economic recovery , and 21 % will be reliant on successful penetration of the vaccine .", "key investment themes for infrastructure include digital transformation of economies , including 5g deployment ; decarbonization and development of renewable power ; and the potential for recovery in travel .", "we continue to see adoption of infrastructure allocations with asset consultants and institutions .", "with the new administration and potential for additional fiscal stimulus via infrastructure , we also believe that wealth advisors may have more interest as well .", "in fact , our closed -

up in performance .", "i also want to mention that our real assets multi-strategy portfolio had very good relative performance in 2020 , outperforming by 200 basis -- 240 basis points for the year , which puts us in good position with investors who are looking for inflation protection .", "looking backward over a period of low inflation , investors had not felt a need for this portfolio , which includes real estate , infrastructure , resource equities , commodities and short - duration credit .", "however , it has the highest inflation sensitivity of all of our strategies , and we are seeing increased interest in inflation protection , perhaps no surprise considering the deficit and monetary statistics cited earlier .", "as matt mentioned , allocating resources to our investment department is always a priority .", "this past year has been particularly gratifying as we continue to see the growing return on investments we 've made over the past five years in our people , it , processing strategies and data and quantitative resources .", "one example is our transition of u.s. reit team leadership that we announced in the fourth quarter .", "our current head , tom bohjalian , will be retiring in the middle of this year , and our succession plan has been put in place with jason yablon assuming leadership in partnership with matt kirschner .", "it 's hard to imagine replacing as a strong a leader and investor as tom .", "but in the spirit of continuous improvement , we expect jason to give tom a run for his money .", "we 'll continue to build the team for depth and succession .", "we will never be complacent on performance and innovation , and we will continue to drive our alpha mining initiatives .", "last quarter , i noted that we have a stable of -- track record accounts for strategies that have been developed over the past three years , ranging from existing strategy extensions to new ideas generated by our investment teams .", "all but one outperformed benchmarks last year .", "we 'll be adding more track record accounts in 2021 , including one in renewables and clean energy .", "our challenge will be to convert these investment ideas into investor allocations .", "our recent hire of greg bottjer from nuveen , who heads global product strategy and development , will help us bring some of these strategies to market as well as map out real asset strategy extensions for the next phase of growth .", "overall , i 'd say the state of our investment department is strong .", "and we are optimistic about our ability to capitalize on the investment opportunities that are expected to come along with a post - pandemic economic recovery .", "let me start by stating the obvious .", "2020 was a year that all of us would like to forget .", "the one - two punch of covid and political and social upheaval has had a devastating impact on our culture and economy , and we 're not out of the woods quite yet .", "in contrast to the unprecedented challenges that we faced last year , u.s. equity markets posted remarkably positive returns led by the covid beneficiary plays as demonstrated by the strength in the faang and related stocks , as joe already touched on .", "while most active managers continued to battle the dual challenges of declining fees and net outflows , the equity markets offered them a reprieve with the s&p 500 and nasdaq up 16.3 % and 43.6 % , respectively , last year .", "while alternative income strategies such as preferred securities also performed well , delivering returns in high single digits , most real asset strategies , notably real estate and infrastructure , did not .", "as joe noted , global and u.s. real estate securities indices actually declined by 9 % and 5.1 % , respectively , while global listed infrastructure indices also fell by 4.1 % .", "it 's a point of pride for us that unlike our peers in the industry that benefited from market appreciation , we faced significant market headwinds last year , and yet , still generated industry - leading organic growth .", "importantly , our growth was broad - based and -- with almost every region , strategy and channel contributing to record - breaking results .", "we ended the quarter with record assets , as matt said , of $ 79.9 billion .", "assets under management in each of the open - end fund , closed - end fund and advisory channels also ended the year at record levels .", "in the quarter , gross inflows were a record $ 7.3 billion and net inflows contributed $ 3.9 billion .", "virtually , all the organic growth in the quarter was derived from the wealth channel .", "our confidence in the new generation of closed -
