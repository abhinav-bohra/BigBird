quarter exercise .", "but with this , we 've actually used lifetime losses .", "and we have used those , which we do n't think are really relevant .", "but nevertheless , since that question will probably be asked , we did that analysis anyway .", "we use full 2018 and to 2020 dfast severely adverse scenario , and said , ok , if -- what are the losses that are generated , and you can see them on slide 4 .", "and if those were the -- channels were to be used now , would we still be well capitalized and the capital ratios hold up ?", "and the answer is yes , they do .", "so quickly , one question so i do n't forget again about liquidity , which is the next slide .", "we have tons of liquidity .", "we are -- we currently have over $ 8 billion , i think it 's $ 8.5 billion of liquidity , safe liquidity available .", "a lot of it is in cash .", "we will take some of the cash position down as we think things are settling down in the marketplace .", "but with that , let me switch over quickly and talk about the quarter .", "we reported a net loss of $ 31 million , $ 0.33 a share .", "this is driven in the large part to the large provision that we do .", "the provision for this quarter was $ 125 million .", "this increased our credit losses to $ 251 million , which is 1.08 % .", "so we used to be , at december 31st , we were at $ 109 million or 47 basis points .", "on january 1st , under cecl , that number bumped up to $ 136 million or 59 basis points and now in the end of march , we were at 1.08 % or $ 251 million .", "and that obviously was the biggest driver in the $ 31 million loss that we are posting this quarter .", "i will ask leslie to give you some more detail around cecl and the assumptions that went into calculating that provision .", "but i will say , before i hand it over to her , is that we believe this at march 31st , our reserve estimate is based on both data that is current and conservative at that quarter end .", "this reflects our best estimate of lifetime credit losses on the portfolio .", "in second quarter , we will go through the same exercise .", "there are three big areas , which will impact our cecl estimates for the next quarter , which is going to be an update of the macroeconomic outlook .", "an update of our portfolio , especially our high - risk sectors .", "and also , our assessment of impact of government stimulus because we 've seen more stimulus this time around than we 've ever seen in the history of the republic .", "so $ 2.5 trillion and counting in fiscal stimulus and god knows how much on the monetary side .", "so i 'm going to refer you to slide 8 in the supplemental deck that talks a little bit about our cecl methodology .", "fundamentally , for the substantial majority of our portfolio segments , we 're using econometric models that forecast pds , lgds and expected losses at the loan level for those are then aggregated by portfolio segment .", "our march 31st estimate was largely driven by the moody 's march mid-cycle pandemic baseline forecast that was issued on march 27 .", "this forecast assumes an approximate 20 % decline in gdp in q2 , unemployment reaching about 9 % in q2 , the vix approaching 60 and year -

quarter , projected credit losses for our significant portfolio , c&i , cre , bfg , residential under each of those scenarios as well as the bank 's pro forma regulatory capital ratios .", "now those were calculated as if all incremental losses were applied to the march 31 , 2020 , our capital position .", "so they do n't really take into account any ppnr that might offset losses over the course of the forecast horizon or any actions management might take to reduce risk weight -- risk -

capitalized threshold of under those distressed scenarios .", "let 's talk ppnr , pre-provision pre-tax net revenue .", "it came in at $ 85 million this quarter , and that compares to $ 104 million last quarter .", "so what was that delta of that $ 19 million ?", "so , really three buckets .", "first , nii was down by $ 5 million .", "nii really is for two reasons ; one , our margin contracted by 6 basis points from 2.41 % to 2.35 % .", "and the reason for that is asset yields came down faster .", "deposit pricing really was n't changed much until pretty late in the quarter .", "you will see a very meaningful impact on deposit pricing going forward .", "but for this quarter , that the basis risk between these assets are priced and what things they 're tied to versus deposits .", "there was that gap of a few weeks , which is what caused margin to come down .", "also , first quarter is not a very strong asset growth quarter for us .", "the nature of our business is first quarter tends to be our slowest quarter .", "so we did n't see that much in terms of asset growth .", "so you combine little - to - no asset growth .", "and by the way , a lot of other banks are seeing asset growth coming from time draws .", "our business is not built around that kind of business .", "and we did not get that benefit , and we did not see a lot of line growth .", "i do n't think it 's a benefit .", "i think it 's a good thing that we did not have that business but that creates little bit of asset growth and nim that compressed 6 basis points leads to a $ 5 million reduction in nii .", "last quarter , we had $ 7.5 million or so of securities gains .", "well , this quarter , we 've had $ 3.5 million of securities losses .", "so that 's an $ 11 million -

quarter expenses are always higher because you start to fight the cycle all over again .", "hsa contributions , the 401 ( k ) contribution , and all that stuff hits in the first quarter , so that is what drove expenses higher .", "if you compare it into expenses from a year ago , that 's probably a better way to compare , and those expenses were obviously much lower .", "our first quarter this year , it was much lower .", "so what does it really mean for next quarter ?", "well , for next quarter , we expect asset growth to pick up for no other reasons , and we 're doing a lot of ppp loans .", "we 'll probably do some main street lending loans .", "we expect margin to expand .", "deposit prices have come down very , very aggressively , not just in the middle of this march , but also at the beginning of may .", "and that should feed into margin , and we are very positively biased toward our margin in the second quarter and beyond .", "expenses should come down as well because all that five - level stuff that i talked to you about will be behind us after the first quarter .", "and naturally , expenses will get better next quarter .", "so that 's what all the guidance we 'll be able to give you , but i do feel it 's important to mention these things in some level of detail .", "i mentioned a little bit on ppp program .", "so i think we could rename bankunited for the month of april as bank of ppp .", "that 's like all we 've been doing .", "to give you a little comparison , we have an sba business where we probably do roughly about 200 units of business in a year .", "we are now in the process of trying to do over 3,000 loans through the sba in less than a month or so .", "it has -- has been a very large operational challenge that people across the company have been recruited to help in .", "and so far , we 've already close to $ 700 million of loans that we 've done and we 're not done yet .", "we still have a few more that we will do over the course of today and tomorrow , or day after , until the money runs out .", "we 're also now on a case - by - case basis providing deferrals to borrowers , who are being impacted by the pandemic , and that started somewhere in the middle of march .", "those requests have now tapered off somewhat in the last week to two weeks , and tom can talk about that in a little more .", "but before that , tom , why do n't you spend a little time talking about loans and deposits ?", "just give a little more detail around that .", "so let 's start off with deposits , where we 've continue to make good progress on our deposit growth initiatives .", "as you can see , deposits grew for the quarter by $ 606 million , and just over 50 % of that or $ 305 million was noninterest dda , which now stands at the 18.4 % of total deposits , compared to 15.9 % a year ago .", "i guess , as we 've talked in all of these calls , growing noninterest dda is one of the most important things that we 're trying to do in the bank right now .", "and unlike what some other banks have reported , most of this dda growth was really core dda growth .", "this was n't related to draws on lines of credit .", "and i 'll go into a little bit more detail about that later .", "we 've consistently been moving down deposit pricing as the fed has reduced rates .", "the cost of total deposits declined by 12 basis points this quarter from 1.48 % to 1.36 % .", "additional moves by the fed in late march had minimal impact on our ability to move cost of funds down further in q1 .", "but as raj mentioned , you 'll see that impact much larger in q2 .", "to give you a better idea of this , the spot rate on total interest - bearing deposits , including our certificates of deposit , declined by 36 basis points of december 31 , 2019 , to march 31 , 2020 , and then by another 27 basis points through april 17th of 2020 .", "so a total of 63 basis points decline during that period of time .", "and if you go to slide 7 in the deck , you 'll get a little bit more information and detail on that .", "on the loan side , raj mentioned , loans that are relatively flat for the quarter with net growth of $ 29 million .", "there were some parts of the portfolio where we actually saw very good growth .", "the c&i business had total growth of $ 353 million , which was a good quarter for that segment .", "mortgage warehouse outstandings have also increased by $ 84 million , but really offsetting that , our cre book declined by $ 315 million , which is pretty much in line with what we expected , primarily driven by the continued decline in new york multi-family , which was $ 249 million .", "and unlike a lot of banks , particularly some of the larger banks , we have not experienced any real growth in our line utilization since the onset of this crisis .", "the majority of our c&i growth , as i mentioned , was not the result of draws .", "our utilization ratio , which we track consistently throughout this process really has n't moved too much during this entire thing , only by a few percentage points through the total period of time .", "it has generally remained in line with our three - year averages with the exclusion of the mortgage warehouse business .", "i would like you to flip to page 16 .", "this is what i was talking about at the beginning of the call .", "these are the segments that we have sort of circled around and saying these are the portfolios that will have increased stress based on our estimation : this is retail in the cre book ; retail in the c&i book ; the franchise finance that we 've talked about to you in the last six months ; hotels for obvious reasons , airlines , cruise lines and energy .", "so in total , it 's about 14 % of our portfolio .", "what we 're trying to show you here is what -- as of march , what part of these individual portfolios were past - weighted and what were classified , criticized and nonperforming .", "so now let me say something sort of which is obvious , but i 'll mention it anyway .", "just because we have highlighted these portfolios , i 'm not trying to say that loans on these portfolios are going to go back .", "we also expect the large portion of these loans will be just fine .", "sponsors with deep pockets will be able to bear the brunt of the pain here .", "but in terms of monitoring , we are calling these sort of the ones what we will monitor on a heightened basis because we think these are in harms ' way more than other parts of the portfolio .", "by the same logic let me say , it does n't mean that anything that is outside of this portfolio is all fine .", "we have to monitor everything because there will second , third , fourth quarter impacts in other parts of the business as well and we will monitor them , too .", "but this is where that the heightened monitoring will be .", "so it 's too early to really see the impact of the covid situation on risk rating migration .", "and you can see that , with the exception of franchise finance portfolio , substantially , most of these segments are past - rated at march 31st .", "we did move a bunch in the franchise portfolio into those lower categories in the quarter .", "let me talk a little bit about npas , a little bit of our course of actions and then charge - offs .", "npas -- of npls for this quarter , they were basically flat .", "npas were down a little bit , a couple of basis points .", "npls were also down a few basis points from 88 basis points to 85 basis points .", "and just to remind you that these numbers in npas and npls , the way we report them included guarantee portion of nonaccrual sba loans .", "so really just keep that in mind that the criticized classified this quarter went up by $ 269 million , $ 207 million of that $ 269 million was in the franchise portfolio .", "and 90 % of that $ 207 million was really attributable to covid as that kind of play itself out in the month of march .", "charge - offs were 13 basis points .", "they elevated from last quarter mostly because of one credit in bfg equipment where we took the charge - off , but we 're already seeing recoveries from that situation this quarter .", "so more detailed metrics are toward the end of the slide deck , page 22 , 23 , 24 and 25 .", "so i will encourage you to spend some time on to those as well .", "tom , i mentioned these portfolios for heightened monitoring .", "so , why do n't you spend a few minutes and just give them a little more -- with a little more detail ?", "so we 'd refer you to slide 14 in the deck , which provides some additional detail around the level of deferrals and segments .", "but through april 20 , we have received request for deferrals from almost 800 commercial borrowers and approved modifications for about 500 of those borrowers , totaling a little over $ 2 billion .", "we 've also processed about $ 500 million in residential deferrals , excluding the ginnie mae that 's early buyout portfolio , which would represent about 10 % of that portfolio .", "these deferrals typically take the form of a 90 - day principal and / or interest payment deferrals for commercial loans , and those payments are generally due at maturity .", "for residential borrowers , these payments are typically at the end of the deferral period consistent with deferral programs being offered by the gses .", "now we 'll obviously be reassessing each of these loans at the end of the 90 days and looking in making the best decisions we can at that point in time .", "as you can see , the large amount of commercial deferrals is in the commercial real estate portfolio , particularly the hotel subsegment , where 90 % of the borrowers , by dollars , have requested and been approved for deferrals , followed by the retail subsegment .", "we have also received a high level of deferral requests from borrowers in the franchise finance portfolio , as we 've mentioned , where 74 % of the borrowers have been approved for deferrals .", "on other c&i portfolio subsegments with this -- where we 're seeing higher levels of deferral request include accommodation and food services , arts and entertainment and recreation and the retail trade .", "at this point , and as of today , modification requests appear to be slowing over the last 10 to 15 days .", "starting on slide 17 , we provide a little bit deeper dive into some of the higher - risk portfolios , subsegments that raj has already mentioned .", "and in the retail segment , the cre book contains no significant exposure to big box or large shopping malls .", "we estimate that about 60 % of the cre retail exposure is supported by businesses that we would categorize as essential or moderately essential and the remainder we would categorize as nonessential businesses .", "within this segment , ltvs averaged 57.5 % , and 84 % of the total are below the 65 % level .", "retail exposure in the c&i book is well diversified with the largest concentration of being to gas station and convenience store owner operators .", "i 'll refer you to page -- on slide 18 , where you could see further breakdown of the franchise portfolio , which is a fairly diverse portfolio , both by some concept in geography .", "we saw over a $ 200 million increase in criticizing classified assets in this segment during the first quarter .", "approximately 90 % of these downgrades were directly related to the covid - 19 crisis .", "i 'll also mention that the current environment to fitness center -- and to fit this sector , which up until now , has been really the better - performing sector in this book , is coming under stress as most of these are now closed with the social distancing guidelines .", "some of the restaurant concepts actually may fare better , particularly those with heavy drive through exposure and good digital strategies .", "on slide 19 , you can see that most of the hotel book represents well -
