quarter abatements were elevated relative to the third - quarter abatements of $ 28 million , and this was largely due to the protracted summer closures of several large properties in new york and in california .", "this resulted in delayed negotiations with tenants at those properties .", "cumulatively for the year , in 2020 , we granted $ 56 million of abatements .", "number two , $ 19 million of covid -

up demand from our market consumers , and softer comparables in the last half of the year informed this thinking for ramped up growth later in 2021 .", "in terms of ffo by quarter , we estimate the following cadence : 21 % in the first quarter , 24 % in 2q , 25 % in 3q , and the balance 30 % in the last quarter .", "we view 2021 as a transitional year as we pivot away from the disruption and widespread closures caused by covid during 2020 .", "we do expect that the first - quarter ' 21 will include lingering effects of covid , including from retroactive rent adjustments relating to 2020 .", "trough occupancy appears to have been contained to roughly 88 % , which we estimate to be at the end of the first quarter .", "and we do believe there 's an opportunity to grow occupancy later part in the year and certainly over the coming years , which should fuel future operating growth .", "again , more details of the guidance assumptions are included in the company 's form 8 -

end was $ 555 million .", "as tom previously noted , collection efforts are now over 90 % .", "this improved collection environment is a direct byproduct of the extensive efforts by a vast many within the company to negotiate thousands of agreements with our retailers .", "i can tell you , we are extremely proud of those efforts , as tom has already noted .", "as a result , we do anticipate further improvement in collections into 2021 .", "and in addition , we estimate the collections of both contractually deferred and delayed rent collections in 2021 that relate to 2020 billed rents in the approximate range of $ 60 million to $ 75 million .", "during 2021 , we expect to generate over $ 200 million of cash flow from operations , and this is after recurring operating and leasing capital expenditures and after dividend .", "this assumption does not include any potential capital generated from dispositions , refinancings , or issuances of common equity .", "this operating cash flow surplus will be used to delever the balance sheet , as well as to fund our development pipeline .", "and as for development , we expect to spend less than $ 100 million in 2021 , excluding further development expenditures on one westside , which recall , is independently funded by a construction loan facility .", "in the fourth quarter , much of our focus , again , was working with retailers to secure rental payments and improve our collection rates .", "looking at our top 200 rent -
