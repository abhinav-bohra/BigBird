consumer recycled , or pcr , plastics in packaging and other applications .", "hyperzone 's outstanding performance can also be leveraged to allow for increased blending of pcr without sacrificing performance .", "as you can see in the chart , hyperzone hdpe blended with 25 % pcr can still exceed the crack resistance of standard polyethylene by 70 % .", "our customers are leveraging lyondellbasell 's advanced technology to improve the crack resistance , top load strength , impact resistance and other critical properties for their products while simultaneously improving the sustainability profile of their business models .", "now let 's step back a bit and on slide seven review some of the macroeconomic forces that have been driving lyondellbasell 's business performance during the pandemic and the ongoing recovery .", "one way to think about the trajectory of the economy is to untangle a few of the societal trends that are fueling demand in markets for nondurable goods , durable goods and transportation .", "in the early days of the pandemic in march , april and may of 2020 , we saw elevated demand for nondurable goods as households engaged in pantry stocking to protect against supply disruptions and adapt to the transition toward increased working from home , schooling from home and other lifestyle changes associated with quarantines and societal lockdowns .", "lyondellbasell 's olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from the double - digit improvements in packaging demand as increased utilization of nonbulk packaging and e-commerce deliveries boosted demand for our materials .", "in 2021 , consumer packaged goods demand remains elevated by single - digit percentages relative to prepandemic levels .", "we expect somewhat elevated demand for packaging will persist following the pandemic with some permanent changes in society as a portion of the population continues to work remotely , school remotely and use home delivery for convenience .", "the second economic driver for our businesses has been the recovery in consumer - , industrial - and construction - related demand for durable goods that began in the third quarter of 2020 .", "this trend can be reflected by the dark blue line that tracks the ongoing recovery in vehicle production in north america .", "with government stimulus supporting the us economy and limited options for travel , leisure and public dining , consumers remodeled homes and purchased appliances , home entertainment and vehicles that drove recovery for the industrial economy .", "this trend has been boosting demand for lyondellbasell 's propylene oxide from our intermediates & derivatives segment that is used in polyurethane foams for furniture and construction insulation as well as polymers from our o&p segments that are used both directly and in plastic compounds produced by our advanced polymer solutions segment .", "the third significant trend is the increased mobility that is developing around the world as vaccination rates improve and activity in the travel , leisure and hospitality sectors returns to some semblance of normalcy .", "increases in vehicle miles traveled are supporting a rebound in crude oil and gasoline prices to bring back margins for our oxyfuels business in the i &d segment .", "while a slower rebound in international air travel is holding back demand for jet fuel , strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve profitability for lyondellbasell 's refining segment during the second half of this year .", "increased mobility will also benefit our polymer businesses as the restaurant , hotel and tourism industries restock and begin to address substantial pent - up demand .", "the sum of these trends points to a strong outlook for both the global economy and lyondellbasell during the remainder of 2021 and well into 2022 .", "on slide eight , these trends can be seen in first quarter global demand growth for our two largest products , polyethylene and polypropylene , relative to prepandemic levels seen two years ago in the first quarter of 2019 .", "over this period , we 've seen modest improvements in european demand .", "in the first quarter of 2021 , north american demand was quite strong , but constrained by lack of supply due to the downtime triggered by the cold weather and associated power outages in texas .", "northeast asian demand increased by an astounding 23 % driven by the postpandemic strength of the chinese economy .", "since imports account for approximately 40 % of china 's demand needs for polyethylene , china 's growth benefited lyondellbasell 's production sites in the united states and the middle east that export polyethylene to china .", "global demand for polyolefins has grown by 14 % over the past two years , far above the long - term trends of 4 % and 5 % annual demand growth for polyethylene and polypropylene , respectively .", "strong global demand and constrained production have supported polyethylene contract price increases of $ 950 per metric ton in the us from may 2020 through march of this year , with $ 420 per ton occurring since november and more than $ 300 per ton of additional price increases on the table for april and may of 2021 .", "as demand should get even stronger as we progress through the recovery , we expect tight markets and strong margins for polyolefins to persist into next year .", "in january , we talked about concerns that global polyethylene capacity additions , particularly in china , could outpace global demand and depress operating rates and profitability over the coming years .", "this quarter , we have updated the chart we discussed during the fourth quarter call to address operating rates for both polyethylene and polypropylene .", "predictions of reduced operating rates due to new capacity are highly reminiscent of forecasts from consulting reports published in 2016 .", "these are depicted by the dotted blue line , which predicted global operating rates would dip due to capacity additions on the us gulf coast from 2017 through 2018 .", "more importantly than delays in capacity , we believe recent forecasts are underestimating demand growth .", "early in the pandemic , many predicted declines in pe demand for 2020 .", "by the middle of the year , forecasts improved to flat demand .", "most consultants now believe that global polyolefin demand grew by approximately 4 % in 2020 , similar to growth rates seen consistently over the past 30 years .", "adjusting these forecasts to 4 % demand growth for both ' 20 and ' 21 results in a predicted operating rate shown by the dotted gray line .", "last quarter , we suggested that 2021 would likely follow the patterns seen after prior recessions , and this year 's demand growth could be higher than the historical trend of 4 % .", "a 7 % growth in demand during 2021 for only one year with reversion to the historical mean in 2022 and beyond would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line .", "today , with global polyolefin demand growing in the first quarter by 14 % over the past two years , we are even more confident that the recovering economy is likely to facilitate a more orderly absorption of this new capacity by the global market , which should support robust margins .", "over the last 12 months , lyondellbasell converted almost 80 % of our ebitda into $ 3.4 billion of cash from operating activities .", "in the first quarter of 2021 , our businesses delivered over 40 % more free operating cash flow relative to the same period last year .", "we expect continued improvement of our ltm performance as we progress through each quarter of 2021 .", "as bob mentioned , our goal for this year is to accomplish meaningful deleveraging to further strengthen our investment -
