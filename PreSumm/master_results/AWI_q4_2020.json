19 , airassure and vidashield .", "and then i will discuss the increasing importance of healthy spaces before turning the call over to brian to provide a detailed review of our financial performance for both the quarter and the year .", "with regard to the marketplace , in the fourth quarter , we saw sequential improvement , pretty much as we expected .", "the various end markets and channel activity continued to be mixed by territory and vertical .", "new orleans , for example , exhibited quarter - over - quarter strength related to hurricane damage and the pacific northwest continued to improve .", "meanwhile , the upper midwest and southern california moderated .", "the number of healthcare projects bid during the quarter picked up nicely but was offset by slower activity in education .", "so although we saw overall sequential improvement , underlying conditions remain choppy and drive near - term uncertainty as building owners seek to determine the best path forward to adapt their facilities to enable the safe return of occupants .", "for the full year , 2020 sales of $ 937 million were down 10 % from 2019 .", "adjusted ebitda of $ 330 million was down 18 % from 2019 , coming in at the high end of our guidance range .", "adjusted free cash flow for the year was a strong $ 212 million or 23 % of sales , once again demonstrating the strength of armstrong 's best -

to - month and a quarter - to - quarter basis .", "in the mineral fiber business , in addition to significant volume declines , we were faced with two unusual mix headwinds that impacted auv or average unit value .", "beginning in the second quarter , we experienced significant negative territory mix as our key seven territories , including the new york metro area , were disproportionately affected by the construction shutdowns .", "this trend moderated and continued to improve in the fourth quarter .", "a compounding auv headwind was channel mix , driven by stronger sales to big - box customers as work from home became a reality for many .", "this was a good result from a volume perspective and reflects the hard work of our teams with these channel partners .", "however , price points in this channel are lower than our overall average and drove a headwind on mix fall through , particularly in the most recent quarter .", "we expect these timing - related trends to normalize beginning in the second quarter of 2021 .", "core product mix , the underlying driver of auv improvement for the past 10 years has continued to be positive in 2020 as our higher -

term priorities while preserving the foundation for longer - term opportunity .", "when the pandemic first hit , our priorities were protecting the health and safety of our people , adapting our business practices to maintain connectivity and collaboration with our customers and continuing to supply essential products with a special emphasis on serving healthcare projects .", "once the immediacy of the crisis passed , we made several strategic decisions based on the belief that the pandemic will end and the innate human desire for connection and community will once again return us all to offices , schools and shops .", "we made decisions to conserve cash and manage expenses , to retain our talent and preserve organizational capability and capacity that we have worked really hard to build over the past several years .", "we remain committed to our digital and m&a initiatives .", "and we pivoted our new product development efforts to meet the need for healthy spaces with an emphasis on improving indoor air quality .", "now sitting here today , i believe those decisions were the right ones and are delivering on our objective of emerging from this crisis a stronger , more capable and competitive company .", "as you recall , when the pandemic hit , we suspended our share repurchase program and trimmed capital expenditures prudently to conserve cash .", "we identified and acted on $ 40 million of temporary cost savings that would not impact our growth and value creation opportunities .", "with the return of some stability in the marketplace , we have resumed our share repurchase program , we are returning our capital expenditures to pre-pandemic levels and we are enhancing our investments in our digital and healthy space initiatives .", "as we have reported , we did not furlough our salespeople .", "we did not lay off resources or slow work on key initiatives .", "in fact , we launched new digital tools , like projectworks , to keep our sales teams better connected to customers .", "and we added resources to our organization in order to accelerate the work around these and other key strategic initiatives .", "specifically , we launched a new digital platform in the fourth quarter that will enable armstrong to drive mineral fiber volume growth .", "i 'm going to provide more details on this in a moment .", "but i believe these actions collectively will further extend armstrong 's leadership position and allow us to accelerate growth as the economy recovers .", "now looking back on 2020 , acquisitions were also a bright spot .", "despite the challenges presented by covid , we were opportunistic and pursued and completed three transactions with turf , moz and arktura .", "these companies each bring unique and exciting capabilities as well as talent that cement armstrong 's leadership in felt products , custom metal capabilities and maybe most importantly bring design and technology capabilities that can be integrated and scaled across our entire company .", "our m&a pipeline remains active .", "and we continue to have the capability to execute additional acquisitions and partnerships .", "in new product introductions , we also had a strong year .", "we launched 35 new products in 2020 .", "that 's a 50 % increase from our normal pace of activity .", "i could not be more proud of our npd team .", "and i know that they are working very hard to develop important , groundbreaking new products and solutions to further contribute to the healthy space demand that we 'll all have in 2021 and beyond .", "several of these new products came about from a pivot that we made when it became apparent that the covid - 19 pathogen was largely transmitted through the air as an aerosol .", "even with enhanced access protocols for our labs and test chambers , our team brought to market at record speed the 24/7 defend portfolio to address the need for healthier , safer spaces and to specifically improve indoor air quality .", "in november , we launched the airassure family of ceiling tiles .", "airassure is a gasketed ceiling solution that forms a tight seal to the grid system .", "it 's designed to reduce air leaks through the ceiling plane by up to four times over standard ceilings .", "reducing air leaks can significantly increase the effectiveness of hvac systems by forcing more air to flow through return air vents , where it can be filtered and purified , therefore , enabling better air quality .", "in addition to allowing more filtering and cleaning of air , airassure can also reduce the risk of pathogens traveling from space - to - space in a building .", "and by doing so , again airassure can protect a greater number of people .", "also in november , we paired the patented vidashield ultraviolet air purification system with armstrong ceiling panels to provide cleaner , safer air in pretty much any commercial space .", "this system , concealed in the ceiling plane , draws air into a chamber integrated into the ceiling tile , exposes the air to uv light to neutralize the harmful pathogens and then returns the cleaner air to the room .", "vidashield can be used with our ceilings as a stand -
