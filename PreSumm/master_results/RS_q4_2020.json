related closures and less shipping days typical of the fourth quarter , we experienced solid demand trends throughout the fourth quarter as the economy continued to regain momentum .", "supported by solid demand and rising input costs , metal pricing improved as mill price increases for many of the products we sell accelerated throughout the fourth quarter with prices for certain carbon steel products almost doubling , which led to our average selling price increasing 4.6 % compared to the third quarter of 2020 , again , exceeding our expectations .", "the favorable demand and pricing conditions in the fourth quarter contributed to our record gross profit margin of 33 % , a 60 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2020 .", "and on a non-gaap fifo basis , which we believe is the best measure of our day - to - day operating performance , our gross profit margin of 33.6 % increased 180 basis points from 31.8 % in the third quarter of 2020 .", "our record gross profit margin reflects the outstanding performance by our managers in the field who effectively implemented price increases at the time of mill announcement prior to receiving the higher - cost metal into inventory , pushing our gross profit margin above already strong levels , resulting from our focus on higher - margin orders .", "while we are very pleased with our record q4 and full year gross profit margin , we continue to believe our estimated sustainable gross profit margin range of 28 % to 30 % is appropriate as we navigate the ongoing covid -

added processing capabilities .", "in fact , one of the key factors contributing to our record gross profit margin for the full year was our value - added processing capabilities , which have increased in recent years as a result of our significant investments in state - of - the - art equipment .", "while the percentage of orders with value - added processing declined to approximately 49 % from 51 % in 2019 due to changes in product mix caused by the pandemic , process orders continue to serve as a stabilizer to our margins in challenging markets with declining demand and pricing trends .", "i 'll now turn to a high - level overview of the conditions in our key end markets .", "demand in nonresidential construction , the largest market we serve , remained relatively steady during the fourth quarter due to ongoing healthy bidding activity for new projects and the restart of projects that had been put on hold earlier in the year .", "we 've been seeing quoting activity in the areas you might expect such as infrastructure projects , schools , utilities , water and power , strip malls and data and distribution centers .", "demand for the toll processing services we provide to the automotive market was strong , with activity back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter as automotive oems and steel and aluminum mills continued to ramp production as a result of reopenings following covid - 19 shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020 .", "we commenced operations at our new facility in kentucky in late november and also recently broke ground on a new greenfield tolling facility in texas , with both focused on carbon steel tolling to support increased capacity of our toll processing customers , who are primarily metal producers and their end users .", "demand in heavy industry for both agricultural and construction equipment rebounded to solid levels in the fourth quarter as production schedules continued to ramp following customer reopenings from covid - 19 - related shutdowns and to meet equipment dealer restocking needs .", "semiconductor demand steadily improved from the third quarter of 2020 , and the market continues to be one of our strongest .", "demand in commercial aerospace further declined in the fourth quarter as a direct result of reduced air travel due to covid - 19 , which has reduced airplane build rates .", "we believe the fourth quarter represented the trough .", "that said , demand in the military , defense and space portions of our aerospace business remained stable at solid levels throughout the fourth quarter .", "finally , demand in the energy sector , which is mainly oil and natural gas , remained under pressure in the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "and throughout 2020 , we took prudent cost - reduction measures , including the closure of certain facilities , which helped strengthen our overall efficiency and position us to support a recovery in this market .", "we are optimistic on both demand and pricing trends in the first quarter of 2021 as we have experienced strength in both so far in the first quarter .", "and arthur will now review our financial results .", "i 'll start with our sales discussion .", "fourth quarter 2020 sales were down 12.8 % from the prior year period as our markets continued to recover following the reopening of the economy .", "approximately half of the decline in our sales can be attributed to our businesses supporting the commercial aerospace and energy end markets , as evidenced by the disproportionately higher declines in our sales of aluminum and alloy products .", "for the full year of 2020 , sales were down 19.7 % from 2019 .", "approximately half of the decline in sales was due to lower shipping volumes across all major end markets we sell to , and the remaining half was due to lower average selling prices .", "however , both recovering demand and pricing from the reopening of the economy in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 helped to mitigate the annual decline in our sales .", "as jim and karla highlighted , we generated a record quarterly gross profit margin of 33 % in the fourth quarter of 2020 , up 60 basis points from both q3 2020 and q4 2019 and a record gross profit margin of 31.5 % for the full year of 2020 , up 120 basis points from our previous annual record of 30.3 % in 2019 .", "our non-gaap fifo gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was up 450 basis points from q4 2019 , and for the full year of 2020 was up to 280 basis points from 2019 .", "we incurred lifo expense of $ 15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to rapidly increasing mill costs for most of our products .", "however , for the full year of 2020 , we still recognized lifo income of $ 22 million as our cost of inventory on hand at the end of the year was still below the levels at the beginning of the year .", "this compares to lifo income in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 of $ 81 million and $ 156 million , respectively .", "we ended 2020 with a lifo reserve of $ 115.6 million on our balance sheet .", "based on current market conditions , we expect to incur an annual lifo expense of $ 340 million in 2021 .", "consistent with our accounting policy , we allocate our annual estimate on a pro rata basis in each quarter .", "as such , our current projected q1 2021 lifo expense is $ 85 million .", "as in prior years , we will update our expectations each quarter based upon our inventory cost and metal pricing trends .", "our fourth quarter non-gaap sg&a expenses decreased $ 51 million or 9.9 % compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on a 7.9 % reduction in shipments .", "for the full year , same - store sg&a expenses declined $ 241 million or 11.5 % on a 10.8 % reduction in shipments .", "the decline in sg&a expenses was due to reduced spend across every major expense category .", "as you 've heard us say before , approximately 60 % to 65 % of our sg&a expenses are people related .", "when looking at the 11.5 % year - over - year decline in same - store sg&a expenses , approximately half of the decrease was people - related as our headcount declined 14 % compared to the prior year .", "in addition , lower incentive pay due to lower gross profit and pre-tax income levels also contributed to the decline in our compensation costs .", "although we are entering the first quarter of 2021 with a more efficient expense structure because of strong volume and pricing trends , we expect our expenses will increase in the first quarter of 2021 from the fourth quarter of 2020 , consistent with seasonal trends .", "i will address our q1 2021 outlook for demand and pricing shortly .", "for the full year of 2020 , our effective income tax rate declined to 22.1 % from 24 % in 2019 mainly due to our lower pre-tax income level in 2020 .", "we currently anticipate our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be 24 % .", "our strong gross profit margin and effective expense management resulted in $ 2.01 of earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2020 , well above our outlook of $ 1.30 to $ 1.40 per diluted share but down 17.6 % from $ 2.44 in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to reduced demand levels related to the pandemic , with commercial aerospace and energy end market sales being significant contributors to the decline in our sales .", "in comparison to the third quarter of 2020 , fourth quarter non-gaap earnings per diluted share of $ 2.01 was up 7.5 % from $ 1.87 due to improved pricing , strong gross profit margin and recovering demand in most end markets .", "turning to our balance sheet and cash flow .", "we generated strong cash flow from operations of $ 230.2 million during the fourth quarter due to our profitable operations and effective working capital management , including our focus on rightsizing our inventory levels .", "at the end of the year , our total debt outstanding was $ 1.66 billion , resulting in net debt -

year unsecured revolving credit facility .", "the facility amendment , combined with the proceeds from the notes offering , provides us with ample liquidity and an improved debt maturity profile .", "i 'll now turn to our outlook .", "while macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from the covid - 19 pandemic continues , favorable market conditions have persisted so far into the first quarter of 2021 , with improving demand and additional mill price increases on many carbon and stainless steel products .", "this environment allows us to maintain higher gross profit margin levels as we increase our selling price prior to receiving the higher - cost metal in our inventory .", "we expect these favorable conditions to continue for the remainder of the first quarter .", "as a result of these favorable conditions and the normal seasonal improvement , we estimate our tons sold will be up 10 % to 12 % in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "we also expect our average selling price in the first quarter of 2021 will be up 12 % to 14 % compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "based on these expectations , we currently anticipate non-gaap earnings per diluted share in the range of $ 3.40 to $ 3.50 for the first quarter of 2021 .", "in closing , we are very pleased with our fourth quarter 2020 financial and operational results .", "outstanding execution by all of our employees greatly contributed to our success in 2020 .", "their efforts , coupled with our resilient business model and disciplined execution of our strategy , resulted in yet another quarter of solid profitability and cash flow , enabling us to continue supporting our growth and stockholder return priorities ."], "summary_gold": "reliance steel & aluminum q4 earnings per share $ 2.01 .<q>q4 non -gaap earnings per share $ 2.01 .<q>qtrly average selling price per ton sold $ 1,683 up 4.6 % versus q3 .<q>sees q1 non -gaap earnings per share $ 3.40 to $ 3.50 .<q>qtrly diluted earnings per share $ 2.01 .<q>experienced ongoing improvements in demand in nearly all of end markets it serves in quarter .<q>cautiously optimistic demand for non-residential construction activity in co's space will continue at q4 levels in q1 .<q>maintains its positive outlook for aerospace defense market .<q>cautiously optimistic that demand in commercial aerospace may begin to slowly recover in latter half of 2021 .<q>demand in energy market remained under pressure in q4 with modest improvement expected in q1 .<q>estimates that tons sold will be up 10 % to 12 % in q1 of 2021 compared to q4 of 2020 .<q>estimates its average selling price per ton sold for q1 of 2021 will be up 12 % to 14 % compared to q4 of 2020 .", "summary_pred": "despite the extraordinary challenges 2020 presented on a global scale , we are extremely pleased with the strong execution of our team -- that our team has shown , not only in the field , but by all of the employees within the family of companies , who demonstrated the true resiliency of the reliance business model .<q>i applaud each and every one of you for your tremendous efforts to quickly and nimbly adapt to the changing environments , ensure our customers were always taken care of , and most importantly , maintain your unwavering commitment to health and safety , our most important core value .<q>working together as one company , we focused on this initiative in 2020 like never before in response to the new and unique challenges presented by the covid -
