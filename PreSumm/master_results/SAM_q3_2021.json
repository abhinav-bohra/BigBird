growing category .", "having said this , we 've updated and evolved our own category growth model and believe the category could be flat to plus 10 % growth in our most likely 2022 scenarios .", "clarity will probably not increase until we start to lap june and july 2021 when the category started to decelerate rapidly especially in the two year volumes stack which we look at closely .", "regardless of which scenarios proved most accurate , we fully intend to extend our streak of outgrowing the category throughout the year driven by innovation , continued brand building and superior retail execution and distributor support .", "as jim mentioned , we have a balanced portfolio of healthy , well -

side projections and resulted in excess capacity and higher - than - planned inventory levels of input materials and finished goods .", "as a result , we have taken $ 102.4 million third quarter charge related to direct costs of the hard seltzer slowdown consisting of inventory obsolescence and destruction -- and related destruction costs of $ 54.3 million ; contract termination costs , primarily for excess third -
