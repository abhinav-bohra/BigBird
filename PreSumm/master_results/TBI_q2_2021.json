over - year revenue growth rates compared to the rest of the customer base , with the q2 2021 growth differential exceeding 40 percentage points on a same customer basis .", "this growth differential is largely driven by wallet share takeaways from competitors as heavy client users tell us a major reason they are moving share to peopleready is due to jobstack 's unique capabilities .", "heavy client users are becoming more material in our overall results as they now account for 46 % of peopleready us on -

positioned to more effectively and efficiently serve clients .", "at the end of the first quarter , we launched two market pilots that utilize centralized service centers responsible for recruiting , onboarding and local delivery .", "the service centers increase our accessibility as they operate 85 hours per week versus 60 hours for a typical branch .", "this enhanced go - to - market approach includes repurposed job roles with the creation of dedicated account managers who are responsible for growing and building client relationships .", "we believe we will be able to use the cost savings from reducing non-client facing roles to more than offset the cost increases from adding more client facing roles such as account managers .", "this fundamental shift in how we deliver our services requires thorough training and change management for our employees .", "while it is still early , we are gathering key learnings that will improve our operating model , leading to higher digital fill rates , increased productivity and higher customer satisfaction .", "we 'll continue to provide updates as the pilots progress .", "turning to peoplemanagement , our strategy is to focus on execution and grow our client base .", "last year , we sharpened our vertical focus to target essential manufacturers , and warehouse and distribution clients , and made investments in our sales teams to enhance productivity .", "with these initiatives implemented , we have broadened the strategy to expand our geographic footprint by targeting more local and underserved markets .", "we are seeing strong results as peoplemanagement secured $ 63 million of annualized new business wins so far this year compared to $ 32 million this time last year .", "finally , we are investing in customer and associate care programs in an effort to better serve our clients ' needs and improve retention .", "turning to peoplescout , the strategy leverages our strong brand reputation to capture opportunities in an industry poised for growth .", "before covid struck , we , along with our competitors , experienced a trend toward more in - sourcing , with some clients bringing more recruitment functions in - house .", "many of the in - house teams were reduced or eliminated during the pandemic , and we are seeing companies return to hybrid and fully outsourced models .", "to capitalize , we have made investments in our sales team .", "we believe there is a big opportunity to increase wallet share at our existing clients and diversify the industry mix within our portfolio by adding new clients .", "these efforts are already delivering results as shown by the $ 33 million of annualized new wins secured by peoplescout so far this year versus $ 9 million this time last year .", "i 'll now pass the call over to derrek who will share greater detail around our financial results .", "total revenue for q2 2021 was $ 516 million , representing growth of 44 % , driven by new business wins and higher existing client volumes .", "we posted net income of $ 16 million , or $ 0.45 per share , an increase of $ 24 million compared to a net loss of $ 8 million in the prior year .", "revenue growth , gross margin expansion , cost management and operating leverage contributed to the net income growth .", "adjusted net income was $ 16 million , or an increase of $ 21 million , which is less than the increase in gaap net income , primarily due to $ 11 million of workforce reduction charges in q2 2020 that are excluded from adjusted net income .", "we delivered adjusted ebitda of $ 25 million , an increase of $ 30 million , and adjusted ebitda margin was up 640 basis points driven by the same items previously mentioned for net income .", "gross margin of 26.4 % was up 320 basis points .", "our staffing segments contributed 70 basis points of margin expansion aided by lower workers ' compensation costs due to favorable development of prior year reserves .", "gross margin also benefited from bill rate inflation that exceeded pay rate inflation but was offset by increased sales mix from our energy and industrial business which has a lower gross margin due to the pass - through of transportation and per diem costs .", "peoplescout contributed 250 basis points of expansion with 170 basis points associated with operating leverage from higher volumes .", "the remaining 80 basis points was due to non-repeating workforce reduction costs incurred in q2 2020 , which are excluded from our adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda calculations .", "turning to sg&a expense , we delivered another quarter of favorable results .", "sg&a was up 14 % but as a percentage of revenue was down 570 basis points .", "excluding the workforce reduction charge in q2 last year , sg&a was up 24 % , which was roughly half the rate of revenue growth , and was down 340 basis points as a percentage of revenue .", "we continue to balance cost discipline with preserving our operational strengths to ensure we are well - positioned for continued growth .", "we are also piloting opportunities to further reduce the costs of our peopleready branch network through greater use of technology , centralizing work activities and repurposing job roles , while maintaining the strength of our geographic footprint .", "these pilots will occur throughout 2021 , and if successful , could lead to additional efficiencies in 2022 .", "our effective income tax rate was 19 % in q2 .", "turning to our segments , peopleready revenue increased 43 % with segment profit margin up 590 basis points .", "trends improved across most geographies and industries .", "year -
