forward of third - dose vaccine administration from 2022 into 2021 .", "this represents 2 % to 5 % growth versus our revised 2021 , adjusted earnings per share baseline of $ 7.92 .", "as you think about the adjusted earnings per share baseline and year - over - year growth , i 'd like to encourage you to keep a few things in mind .", "first , recall that our 2021 baseline of $ 7.92 removes items we do not forecast , prior year 's development , net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains .", "it also includes the annualized impact of our investment in our colleagues through an increase in minimum wage .", "second , it is also important to note that the baseline now includes a net favorable component attributable to covid -
