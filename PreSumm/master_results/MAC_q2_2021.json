to - date , we 've paid down over $ 1.3 billion of debt .", "focusing for a moment now on leasing .", "we are seeing incredible demand for space , including big box space and perimeter locations .", "and that includes multifamily , healthcare fitness , wellness uses , food and beverage and other traditional -- of nontraditional retail uses .", "a great example of the latter is that during this past quarter , we announced a 222,000 square foot scheels sporting goods lease in the former nordstrom 's box at chandler fashion center .", "this store will be their first in the arizona and will feature 16,000 gallons of saltwater aquarium , a wildlife mountain , a restaurant and more .", "nontraditional mall retail demand in smaller format also continues to accelerate with the digitally native brands getting active again on our brick -

center noi rebounded very well in the quarter , increasing 11.5 % relative to the second quarter of 2020 , including our lease termination income .", "given the prevalence of retroactive rent relief adjustments within our 2021 results , we believe it is now an appropriate measure of our 2021 same -

over - quarter , including a $ 40 million bad debt expense incurred during the second quarter of 2020 at the onset of covid and a net $ 10 million bad debt reversal within last quarter , the second quarter of 2021 .", "offsetting these noi factors were : one , $ 46 million or $ 0.21 in reduced minimum rent and recovery income from reduced occupancy as well as approximately $ 15 million retroactive rent abatements and rent relief of primarily 2020 rents .", "to pause on this point , the previously mentioned $ 10 million bad debt reversal in the quarter should be viewed in tandem with a negative $ 15 million impact of rent abatements from our second quarter .", "in other words , the net impact of covid workout deals on same - center noi in the second quarter was a negative $ 5 million when considering both line items .", "and so if you want to normalize same - center noi for what is essentially the majority of the remaining covid workout deals , then add back $ 5 million or 3 % roughly to same - center noi .", "note also that as i mentioned last quarter , we expected a reduced amount of retroactive rent abatements in the second quarter , and that was , in fact , the case .", "i also expect that we are in -- and i also said that we expect a very negligible impact in the second half of the year from such retroactive abatement concessions , and we still expect that to be the case .", "secondly , the shopping center expenses increased by approximately $ 0.06 .", "this is driven by the widespread closures of our center in the second quarter of last year relative to the full operational status of our portfolio throughout the second quarter of 2021 .", "and lastly , a few other factors included : one , second quarter included increases of positive $ 0.09 in valuation adjustments , net of provision for income taxes from our indirect investments in various retailers that we at macerich have previously invested in through a venture capital firm .", "this positive impact shows up in other income from unconsolidated joint ventures , and it is worth noting that this was into thinking when we last updated our guidance at the end of the first quarter .", "and two , the second quarter also included an increase in land sale income totaling approximately $ 0.05 , which was factored into our original guidance and planning as we entered into 2021 .", "2021 ffo is now estimated in the range of $ 1.82 to $ 1.97 per share , which represents a $ 0.03 increase at the midpoint .", "while certain guidance assumptions are provided within our supplemental filing , here are some further anecdotes .", "this guidance range assumes no further government - mandated shutdowns of the retail properties .", "this guidance factors in the issuance of common equity to date , which i will further describe in a few moments , and tom also mentioned previously .", "so as i mentioned during the prior two quarterly calls , we anticipate strong double - digit growth in the second half of 2021 , and we still anticipate that to be the case .", "and in fact , we have increased the midpoint by $ 0.03 per share , which is also $ 0.04 or 2 % greater than consensus estimates .", "this is now due to -- primarily to a much stronger operating environment as reflected within the second - quarter results .", "and then as for our balance sheet , within the first - quarter filings , again , we disclosed that we had sold $ 732 million of common equity through our atm programs again last quarter .", "since then , we sold an additional $ 116 million at an average price of $ 18.20 .", "as part of our continuing commitment to deleveraging our balance sheet , since the end of our first quarter and through today , we have repaid approximately $ 1.3 billion debt .", "sources to accomplish this include common stock sold through our atm programs and dispositions of various assets , including paradise valley at the end of march and some numerous sales of undeveloped land parcels in the phoenix marketplace .", "our ebitda continues to improve .", "and as our deleveraging efforts continued in the second quarter , the company 's debt service coverage ratio improved to two and a half times at the end of the second quarter of ' 21 .", "and as previously stated on many occasions , we still do expect to harvest positive operating cash flow after recurring capex and dividends of well over $ 200 million per year from 2021 through 2023 , which supports a path to continued leverage reduction in the range of 8 x by the end of 2023 .", "this is relative to our leverage in the quarter of mid-11s at the end of 2020 on the heels of covid .", "including undrawn capacity on our revolving line of our credit , of which $ 200 million of the $ 525 million aggregate capacity is currently outstanding , we have approximately $ 500 million of liquidity today .", "so from a secured financing standpoint , we are working on an extension of the loan on danbury fair through the middle of 2022 , and we are currently marketing the shops at atlas park for a refinance loan .", "those are the company 's final two remaining loan leases -- maturities that are within 2021 .", "as the year has progressed and as reported to you last quarter , we continue to see green shoots in the debt capital markets with the execution of a growing number of retail deals on sequentially improving terms .", "the leasing environment continues to improve with leasing productivity outpacing covid 2019 levels .", "and 2019 was our highest leasing volume year since 2015 .", "sales were strong in june , and on top of a very productive april and may .", "june small shop sales were up 15 % when compared to june 2019 .", "most importantly , all categories , including our food and beverage , showed positive comps for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic .", "looking at the quarter , the second - quarter small shop sales were up 13 % over the second quarter of 2019 .", "and year - to - date through june , small shop sales were up 5 % when compared to the same period in 2019 .", "occupancy at the end of the second quarter was 89.4 % .", "this is up 90 basis points from 88.5 % in the first quarter .", "on our last call , we stated that we thought the first quarter would be our trough and we still believe that to be the case , given the healthy retailer environment that exists today , coupled with our strong leasing pipeline , we also anticipate that occupancy to continue to increase throughout the remainder of this year and into 2022 and beyond .", "pace of bankruptcies continues to decrease .", "in fact , year - to - date , bankruptcies within our portfolio are the lowest we 've seen since 2015 .", "and in the second quarter , only two tenants filed for bankruptcy .", "one of the two tenants was a theater chain and had just two locations with us .", "both locations were rejected and one of those locations has already been released .", "the other was a small tenant that had eight locations with us to a total of just 9,000 square feet .", "our trailing 12 -
