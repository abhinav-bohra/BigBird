based care , social determinants of health , affordability and financial protection for beneficiaries , as well as reducing the total cost of care .", "these attributes , along with a deep consumer popularity of medicare advantage are what have enabled it to have a strong bipartisan support with hundreds of members of congress on record supporting the program .", "with medicare advantage serving as a leading example of a successful private - public partnership , i am optimistic we can continue to lead on important healthcare issues facing both individuals and society , including addressing health and equities , improving health outcomes and expanding value - based care .", "today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $ 4.83 for the third quarter and updated full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $ 20.50 to reflect a net unmitigated covid headwind resulting from our current view of utilization levels for the balance of the year .", "i will now walk you through this detail starting with a reminder of our previous commentary .", "as of our second quarter call , full year guidance assumed non-covid medicare advantage utilization was around 2.5 % below baseline in the second half of the year , with a further assumption of minimal covid testing and treatment costs for the same period .", "in september 2021 as a result of the surge in covid cases due to the delta variant , we updated our commentary on full year guidance to indicate we expected non-covid medicare advantage utilization to be 5.5 % below baseline in the back half of the year , while being partially offset by 3 % of covid costs , therefore , again assuming total utilization would be 2.5 % below baseline in the back half of 2021 .", "what we 've seen develop for the third quarter is that total utilization is running 1 % below baseline versus the previously anticipated 2.5 % .", "covid costs have been higher than initially anticipated as the delta variant resulted in hospitalization levels on par with what we experienced in january of 2021 and were overwhelmingly driven by the 20 % of our medicare advantage members believed to be unvaccinated .", "these higher - than - expected covid costs were fully offset by non-covid utilization in the quarter .", "as covid hospitalizations increased or decreased we continue to see an approximate 1 - to - 1 offset in non-covid hospitalization levels .", "we also continue to see significantly reduced non-inpatient utilization when surges occur , offsetting the higher average cost of covid admission .", "however , for the third quarter , in total we saw 1 % incremental reduction in utilization beyond the level needed to offset covid costs versus the 2.5 % contemplated in our previous guide .", "as a result , we have adjusted our full year guide to now reflect the fourth quarter running similarly with total medicare advantage utilization running 1 % below baseline inclusive of estimated covid costs , consistent with what we experienced in the third quarter .", "we realized higher than expected positive current period claims development in medicare advantage in the third quarter as well as other operating outperformance largely mitigating the lower than anticipated depressed medicare advantage utilization allowing us to report results that were slightly favorable to the street estimates .", "our revised guidance does not assume that the higher levels of favorable current period development seen in the third quarter will continue .", "taken together , our updated full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance takes a more conservative posture going into the final months of 2021 , and it 's important to note as we 've consistently shared throughout the year the midpoint of our original guidance range of $ 21.50 remains the correct baseline for 2022 given our approach to pricing .", "i will now briefly touch on operating results across our segments before sharing early thoughts on 2022 performance .", "our medicare advantage growth remains on track and consistent with previous expectations .", "we have refined our full year individual medicare advantage membership guidance to up approximately 450,000 members consistent with the midpoint of our previous guidance of up 425,000 to 475,000 members .", "this outlook represents above market growth with an increase of 11.4 % year - over - year .", "our medicaid results continue to exceed initial expectations due to higher than anticipated membership increases , largely attributable to the extension of the public health emergency .", "we now expect to add 125,000 to 150,000 medicaid members in 2021 , up from our previous expectation of up 100,000 to 125,000 members .", "utilization trends continue to be favorable to initial expectations and the medicaid team is working diligently toward a successful implementation in ohio with go live anticipated in july .", "in our group and specialty segment , fully insured medical results were impacted by higher than expected covid costs in the quarter , while our specialty business results continued to exceed expectations as utilization , particularly for dental services remained lower than previously anticipated .", "recall that our guidance as of second quarter did not contemplate significant covid costs in the back half of the year and the commercial business is not seeing the same level of utilization offset experienced in medicare advantage .", "from a membership perspective , we have increased our expected group medical membership losses from 100,00 to 125,000 reflecting the expectation of additional losses in the fourth quarter as a result of rating actions taken to account for the expected impact of covid in 2022 .", "finally , within our healthcare service of operations , the pharmacy and provider businesses continue to perform slightly better than expected with pharmacy benefiting from increased mail order penetration as a result of customer experience improvements and marketing campaigns and the provider business seeing continued operating improvement at our more mature centers , which are now aligned under the same leadership in our de novo centers .", "as bruce mentioned in his remarks , we are actively integrating the kindred at home operations and results post integration have largely been in line with expectations .", "similar to home health and hospice peers , the business is being impacted by covid and labor shortages .", "for the third quarter , home health admissions grew low single digits year - over - year , while hospice experienced a low single - digit decline year - over - year .", "we will continue to closely monitor trends as we made targeted investments to sustainably improve the recruitment and retention of nurses .", "now , let me take a few moments to share an early outlook for 2022 starting with membership .", "as you 're aware , the overall pdp market continues to decline as more and more beneficiaries including dual eligibles choose medicare advantage .", "in addition , as we 've discussed previously , pdp plans have become a commodity with the low price leader capturing disproportionate growth .", "consistent with 2021 the walmart value plan will offer competitive benefits but will not be the low premium leader in 2022 .", "as a result , we expect a net decline in pdp membership of a few hundred thousand members in 2022 .", "we continue to focus on creating enterprise value for our pdp plans by driving increased mail order penetration and conversions to medicare advantage .", "with respect to group medicare advantage , we expect membership to be generally flat for 2022 as we do not anticipate any large accounts will be gained or lost as we continue to maintain pricing discipline in a highly competitive market .", "moving to individual medicare advantage ; as previously shared , we took a more conservative approach to our 2020 bids , reflecting the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic .", "we expect to grow our individual medicare advantage membership in a range of 325,000 to 375,000 members in 2022 or approximately 8 % year - over - year reflective of our prudent approach we took to pricing for 2022 and the competitive nature of the market .", "it is early in our aep selling season and the outlook we are providing today could change depending on how sales and voluntary disenrollment ultimately commence .", "and consistent with prior years we have very little member disenrollment data at this point in the aep cycle .", "i will now turn to our expected 2022 financial performance .", "as previously mentioned , i want to reiterate that the $ 21.50 midpoint of our original 2021 guide continues to be the appropriate jumping - off point for 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth given our approach to pricing .", "in addition , we feel comfortable that the risk adjusted assumptions and our 2022 pricing are appropriate as providers have been actively engaging with our members to ensure their conditions are fully documented and that care plans are established to address gaps in care .", "provider interactions and documentation of clinical diagnoses that we anticipate will impact 2022 revenue are approximately 92 % complete to - date , in line with both our expectations for 2021 as well as the estimated completion rate for the same time period in 2019 .", "we also assumed medical costs will return to baseline levels reflecting a pre-covid historical trending .", "from an earnings perspective , we believe the conservative approach we took to 2020 pricing struck the appropriate balance between membership and earnings growth .", "given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the covid -

term growth range of 11 % to 15 % .", "we expect that covid will be net neutral to the medicare business in 2022 as we do not anticipate a risk adjustment headwind and expect covid utilization to be offset by a reduction in non-covid utilization .", "however , our initial guide will allow for an explicit covid - related headwinds that we can tolerate , should it emerge similar to the approach some of our peers took in 2021 .", "we believe entering the year with this more conservative approach is prudent in the current environment and sets the company up for success in 2022 .", "we look forward to providing more specific guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in early february .", "in fairness to those waiting in the queue we ask that you limit yourself to one question .", "operator , please introduce the first caller ."], "summary_gold": "sees fy adjusted earnings per share about $ 20.50 .<q>q3 adjusted earnings per share $ 4.83 .<q>confirming $ 21.50 as baseline for 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth .<q>updates fy 2021 expected individual medicare advantage membership growth to 450,000 members .<q>during 3q21 covid costs were higher than previously expected .<q>updating its fy 2021 earnings per share guidance to take a more conservative posture going into final months of 2021 .<q>anticipating total medicare advantage utilization , net of covid costs , will run approximately 1 percent below baseline in q4 .", "summary_pred": "finally , any references to earnings per share or earnings per share made during this conference call refer to diluted earnings per common share .<q>call participants should note that today 's discussion includes financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap .<q>our year -
