digits like clockwork were down mid single - digits for the year tied directly to lower elective procedure volumes and limited hospital capital spending .", "interestingly for neptune , we highlighted municipal budget uncertainty in april .", "this proved generally to be a non-factor , as municipalities budgets were approved and available .", "however , the impact of the lockdowns , especially in the northeast us and canada had a prolonged impact on our customers ' ability to do routine meter replacements .", "as a result , neptune was down low double - digits for the year , slightly worse than our initial expectations .", "finally , for this segment , we expected sharp industrial declines and that is what happened with these businesses being down low - double digits for the year .", "that said , we are seeing sequential quarterly improvements across both neptune and our industrial businesses .", "finally , and as it relates to our process tech segment , we expected to be down 20 % to 25 % , and we were logging in it down 21 % .", "this played out as we anticipated with much lower energy -

on acquisitions .", "our non -software businesses struggled a bit during the year , specifically , rf ideas -- our rf ideas , our multi-protocol credential reader business did well in our healthcare applications , but was hampered by meaningful declines in their secure print market .", "for the full year , transcore pushed about $ 100 million of revenue out of 2020 and to ' 21 associated with their new york project .", "in addition , ebitda margins were pressured due to lower tag shipments and a few non-new york project push outs .", "as we look to the first quarter of 2021 , we see organic revenue , as you can see in the lower right hand box to be down 3 % to 5 % for the quarter .", "an important distinction to highlight , our software businesses will continue to grow in the low single - digit range .", "but our non-software businesses driven by transcore will decline in the high teens range in the first quarter due to much lower anticipated tag shipments and timing of revenue associated with the new york projects .", "as a reminder , the first quarter of this year is coming off a mid-teens growth comp from a year ago .", "now let 's turn to our mas segment , revenues for the year were $ 1.47 billion , up 1 % on an organic basis , with ebitda $ 508 million .", "verathon was awesome in 2020 .", "the business grew substantially based on unprecedented demand for their video intubation product line .", "given verathon 's ability to fulfill this demand , we expect our meaningfully expanded installed base of glidescope is to generate increased levels of reoccurring consumables pull through in the years to come .", "in addition , the first year of their single -
