term care assessments , ves ' expertise will create an opportunity for such growth at the federal level .", "as a result , the independent health and disability assessments and appeals portion of our business will comprise a larger share of our overall portfolio and pipeline , lending further credibility to our organic growth efforts with other federal departments and in nonfederal markets .", "the acquisition comes at an important time for the va as the veterans benefits administration , or vba , has been focused on reducing the inventory of exams that naturally has grown during the pandemic , while preparing for the future needs of veterans with qualifying conditions .", "to that end , and as they 've done periodically in the past , the vba recently launched a market assessment to better understand industry capacity and capabilities .", "through our combination , we believe maximus and ves bring the credibility and quality of an established partner and ability to rapidly add clinical capacity and invest in technology innovation that will benefit veterans and the vba .", "our goal is to both contribute to the timely reduction of pandemic related inventory and be the partner of choice as the mde program continues to develop .", "our acquisitions of attain and ves as well as acentia in 2015 and citizen engagement center operations from gdit in 2018 help us play a more meaningful role in the u.s. federal market as we build scale , expand and diversify our customer base and improve our competitive advantage .", "concurrent with these acquisition efforts , we continue to win covid - 19 related work at the state and federal level , as rick discussed in his remarks .", "this includes the recently posted cdc vaccination hotline award , illustrating the trust that government places in maximus based on our historical performance .", "while covid - 19 work is generally planned to be shorter - term in nature , we remain well positioned to adjust as the pandemic related needs of our customers continue to evolve .", "these efforts also allow us to meet new customers , expand into new areas of service with existing customers , and increase our impact on their behalf .", "through this work , we build longer - term references and past performance credentials that are advantageous in future bidding .", "for instance , in areas like unemployment insurance , the demonstrated value of our model is creating opportunity for longer - term relationships with state departments of labor as they see the benefits of the flexibility and accountability we can provide in delivering outcomes that matter in more routine program areas .", "further , our ability to stand up solutions quickly during challenging times , using effectively our modular capabilities , makes event - driven work , a beneficial element of our business model in response to less predictable but regularly recurring government needs .", "our investment in the digital transformation of citizen services , coupled with our decades - long experience , have been recognized by our government customers during this pandemic as we responded to real - time requests to quickly deliver support and services .", "our outside the u.s. teams are securing some exciting new wins as well .", "as rick mentioned , in the united kingdom , we were recently awarded two prime contracts in our preferred regions to deliver the restart program , which provides 12 months of tailored and community - based support for people that have been unemployed long - term and directly impacted by the pandemic .", "this contract was procured through the cares framework , which i mentioned in my remarks in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year , and is used for contracting national employment support programs .", "adding emphasis to rick 's earlier point , start - up costs are typical with significant new contracts like this one .", "therefore , we anticipate q3 and then q4 earnings will step down sequentially as a result , followed by a subsequent rebound driving earnings estimates upward in fiscal year 2022 .", "these programs create long - term shareholder value and will operate within our expected corporate range of profitability .", "this is not the first time we 've accepted start - up losses for a longer - term and more significant future benefit .", "in total , the two contracts , the maximum that could be won by a single provider , are valued at more than usd960 million , gbp690 million over the base and option periods totaling six years .", "maximus u.k. will be recruiting more than 1,500 people to deliver the program .", "we have a long history of supporting workforce services in the u.k. , establishing our foothold in the u.k. employment and training marketplace in 2008 during the economic recession .", "this solid platform , history of excellent performance and strong client relationships have provided the necessary credentials to expand employment focused programs , as illustrated by this award .", "while this new work has provided some positive offset , our core operations in the u.k. continue to face disruption as a result of the pandemic .", "this negative impact continues to be driven by temporary volume and revenue declines as well as a pause on face - to - face assessments .", "although we continue to face decreased volume across some of our geographies , in australia we are seeing strong volumes as the economy reopens .", "demand is holding more than we anticipated during the holiday season and serves as an example of anticipated volume return as certain countries slowly begin to emerge from the pandemic .", "all in all , we will remain dedicated to addressing covid -
