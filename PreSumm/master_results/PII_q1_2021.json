quarter earnings per share on a gaap basis was $ 2.11 .", "adjusted earnings per share was $ 2.30 , which was up significantly over last year 's first quarter .", "the results were driven by increased volume across the portfolio , lower promotional costs and operating expense leverage during the quarter .", "adjusted gross margins were up 352 basis points year over year primarily due to the lower promotional costs driven by the strong retail demand and lower floor - plan financing costs as a result of the low dealer inventory levels .", "supply chain constraints were an ongoing pressure point to gross margins as logistics and rework remained high .", "and as we previously indicated , tariff costs were higher during the quarter as the onetime exemptions and refunds we saw in 2020 largely ended .", "operating expenses as a percentage of sales were down 584 basis points as we realized leverage from the strong sales growth and the timing of some r&d expenses and stock -

year adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2021 and now expect earnings to be in the range of $ 9 to $ 9.25 per diluted share .", "the increase is driven by higher volume , increased pricing through growth , msrp changes and continued lower promotional spending and floor - plan financing costs in addition to improved foreign exchange rates and operating expense leverage .", "these positives are , however , being partially offset by continued manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics costs in addition to commodity and component pricing pressures driven by supply chain constraints .", "while we are pleased with the strong demand we are experiencing , it continues to stress our supply chain as our supply partners attempt to match our demand trends .", "this is putting additional pressure on gross profit margins for the remainder of the year .", "we now anticipate that gross profit margins will be down 60 to 90 basis points , primarily driven by ongoing negative product mix we saw in the first quarter , along with increased logistics and manufacturing inefficiencies due to the high level of rework in our factories .", "additionally , we are seeing increases in commodity prices that we expect to hit our p&l beginning in the second quarter .", "as a result , we are implementing price increases to help offset these pressures .", "however , we expect it will take several quarters for the two to converge .", "and as mike indicated , our supply chain initiative now in its third year will help offset some of the additional supply chain costs .", "while our gross profit margins are expected to be down for the year , as i stated on our last earnings call , if you exclude the impact of tariffs and supply chain disruptions , our gross profit margin rate would be up over 200 basis points compared to last year .", "adjusted operating expenses are now expected to improve 80 to 100 basis points as a percentage of sales as sales growth outpaces operating expense growth .", "our guidance for operating expenses in dollars for the full year has n't changed .", "the improvement in operating expenses as a percent of sales is entirely driven by the escalating sales growth anticipated this year .", "income from financial services is now expected to be down in the high single digits percent , driven entirely by the expectation that dealer inventory levels will remain low .", "retail financing availability remains at acceptable levels .", "guidance for the remainder of the p&l items remains materially unchanged from our previously issued guidance .", "given our strong performance in q1 , our expectation for sales and earnings per share are relatively consistent across each of the next three quarters .", "seasonality of products will have some impact but , in general , we will produce -- be producing the maximum number of vehicles our supply chain will allow .", "as i mentioned earlier , we expect supplier constraints to continue to negatively impact our sales mix .", "additionally , higher commodity costs will begin to materialize in q2 and are expected to remain for the balance of the year .", "both of these factors will result in lower gross profit margins as compared to the first quarter .", "we expect operating expenses in each of the remaining three quarters to be approximately 10 % to 15 % above q1 given the timing of spending .", "moving on to sales expectations by segment .", "the increase in total company sales is driven by the sales increases in all of our businesses , given the strong first - quarter demand and significant order backlog .", "as we have stated , the gating factor in meeting the current demand and beginning to fill the dealer channel is the ability of our supply chain and the logistics network to be able to deliver materials to the factories .", "our operations and sourcing teams continue to work diligently to maximize production levels .", "first - quarter operating cash flow finished at $ 56 million compared to a negative $ 71 million in the first quarter of last year .", "while our first quarter is typically a heavy cash use quarter given the working capital timing , our strong cash from earnings was able to overcome the cash needs and provide positive cash from operations .", "our cash flow performance expectations for the full year remain unchanged as we work to rebuild dealer and factory inventory to more acceptable levels .", "our bank leverage ratio improved sequentially to approximately 1.3 times as our debt levels continue to decline as anticipated .", "our expectations for use of cash for 2021 , outside investing in the business , remains a combination of debt reduction and share repurchases .", "during the first quarter , we spent almost $ 300 million on share repurchases .", "of the $ 300 million spent , $ 130 million was generated from the exercise of options .", "this helps minimize the dilution of our shares .", "we anticipate continuing to buy back shares throughout the remainder of the year , subject to market conditions and available authorizations .", "our expectations for capital expenditures of approximately $ 250 million remain unchanged .", "and on january 28 , the board of directors approved a 2 % increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend , which is the 26th consecutive year of polaris increasing its dividend .", "during the quarter , we experienced broad -
