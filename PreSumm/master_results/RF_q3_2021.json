term rate environment .", "similar to prior quarters , the impact on nii from historically low long - term interest rates was completely offset by balance sheet management strategies , lower deposit costs and higher hedging income .", "during the third quarter , we repositioned an additional $ 5 billion of receive - fixed swaps .", "we shortened the maturities from 2026 to late 2022 .", "the repositioning locked in the associated gains that will be amortized over the remaining life of the interest rate swaps and will allow for more nii expansion when rates are projected to increase .", "further , with the inclusion of enerbank 's fixed -

over - quarter , primarily due to mortgage servicing rights , valuation adjustments , partially offset by improved secondary market gains .", "service charges remained relatively stable , compared to the prior quarter .", "and we continue to expect they will remain 10 % to 15 % below pre-pandemic levels .", "we attribute the decline to changes in customer behavior as well as customer benefits from enhancements to our overdraft practices , including transaction posting order .", "card and atm fees remained stable compared to the second quarter .", "debit and credit card spend remain above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to benefit from elevated account growth and increased economic activity in our footprint .", "given the timing of interest rate declines in 2020 and excluding the fourth quarter benefit from our enerbank acquisition , we expect 2021 adjusted total revenue to be up modestly compared to the prior year , but this will ultimately be dependent on the timing and amount of ppp loan forgiveness .", "let 's move onto non-interest expense .", "adjusted non-interest expenses increased 3 % in the quarter , as higher salary and benefits and professional and legal fees were offset by decline in marketing expenses .", "salaries and benefits increased 4 % , primarily due to higher variable - based compensation associated with elevated fee income as well as one additional day in the third quarter .", "associate headcount also increased by 149 positions during the quarter with the vast majority of those within revenue producing businesses .", "further , exceptional performance , particularly in credit , is also contributing to higher incentive compensation .", "we will continue to prudently manage expenses , while investing in technology , products and people to grow our business .", "excluding approximately $ 35 million of core run rate expenses associated with our fourth quarter enerbank acquisition , we expect adjusted non-interest expenses to be up modestly compared to 2020 , and we remain committed to generating positive operating leverage over time .", "from an asset quality standpoint , we delivered an exceptionally strong quarter as overall credit continues to perform better than expected , reflecting continued broad -

than - expected credit trends and the continued constructive outlook on the economy .", "the allowance reduction resulted in a $ 155 million benefit to the provision .", "future levels of the allowance will depend on the timing of charge - offs , greater certainty with respect to the resolution of remaining risk to credit losses as well as the integration of enerbank .", "year - to - date net charge - offs are 25 basis points , and we expect full - year 2021 net charge - offs to approximate at same level , which includes the impact of enerbank and excludes the benefit of any future recoveries that may occur .", "with respect to capital , our common equity tier 1 ratio increased approximately 40 basis points to an estimated 10.8 % this quarter .", "as previously noted , we continue to prioritize the utilization of our capital for organic growth and non-bank acquisitions like the enerbank and sabal that propel future growth .", "beyond that , we use share repurchases to manage our capital levels .", "share repurchases were temporarily paused ahead of the enerbank closing , which absorbed approximately $ 1 billion of capital in the fourth quarter .", "we anticipate being back in the repurchase market this quarter and expect to manage common equity tier 1 to the midpoint of our 9.25 % to 9.75 % operating range by year -
