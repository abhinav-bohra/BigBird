term view , and we 're not afraid to think like an activist and recognize the need to reimagine the company from time to time .", "this is one of those times .", "on our last call , i said we 're pursuing five pillars of growth that could double the size of scotts miracle -

leading position and driven strong returns for our retail partners by investing strongly behind innovation as well as sales and marketing support .", "these competitive advantages drove both consumer engagement before and during the covid crisis .", "we did n't outperform our competitors during covid due to dumb luck .", "we won because consumers trusted our brands to deliver the results they are seeking .", "we won because our marketing team created relevant messages that resonated with those consumers and drove them to the stores .", "and we won because retailers knew they could count on our sales force to help manage their lawn and garden departments during the height of the crisis .", "given the current challenges in the labor market , our in -

case scenario for us .", "they remain committed to the category through the fall season and kept appropriate levels of inventory in their stores as we approach the slowest weeks of the year .", "that leaves them well positioned as we pivot into our key selling season , and the shipments we saw through january leave us optimistic .", "the midpoint of our increase in our sales guidance for the segment assumes an eight - point decline in volume for the full year , offset entirely by pricing .", "the trends through four months suggest this might be a conservative estimate .", "but as jim said , were less than 10 % of the way through the year , and it's way too early to predict what will happen in the spring .", "the sales decline was due primarily to the slowness of the broader cannabis market .", "the supply chain challenges we 've mentioned previously are difficult to precisely quantify , but we believe they caused around 5 % of the downward pressure in the quarter .", "those challenges , primarily in the led lighting space , have been remedied and we are back in stock with the components we need to once again be manufacturing and shipping led lights , which remain in strong demand .", "let 's move on to gross margins because this is an area that 's important to understand .", "as you know , q1 results often fall prey to the law of small numbers , and that 's exactly what happened with gross margin .", "the adjusted rate was down 570 basis points in the quarter driven by the year - over - year decline in volume and its impact on manufacturing , distribution , and other fixed costs .", "commodity prices were also a headwind in the quarter but offset by a 400 basis point improvement from pricing actions .", "jim mentioned the importance of looking at the gross margin rate in historical context , and i totally agree .", "the result in the quarter was more than 600 basis points better than in fiscal ' 20 and more than 850 basis points better than fiscal ' 19 .", "over the past several years , we have effectively moved business into q1 to ensure retailers are properly set for the season , which should keep us at a level of profitability that is higher going forward .", "as i look at the balance of the year , we are maintaining our gross margin rate guidance for a decline of 100 to 150 basis points .", "right now , i 'd expect us to be at the lower or worse end of that range .", "margins for the balance of the year should be relatively flat but could vary a bit each quarter , positively or negatively , based primarily on timing and mix .", "in total , we are 70 % locked on commodities for the year , which is slightly behind normal .", "we would normally have all of our costs locked right now on pallets , but we 're only at 30 % because vendors are not currently entering into long -
