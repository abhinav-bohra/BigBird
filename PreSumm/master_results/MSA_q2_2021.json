strengthen throughout the quarter and drove significant increase in backlog .", "our fire service business remains strong , and we 're seeing improved demand for gas detection and industrial products .", "overall , our u.s. business continues to lead the recovery .", "europe is starting to recover as the vaccine situation improves .", "like everyone , we continue to manage through supply chain

indicates we 've done a good job of managing through these issues .", "still , we did have pockets of production starts and stops and extended lead times that contributed to our backlog bill .", "but even with those challenges , i remain very confident in our ability to enhance our market positions as business conditions improve .", "ken will provide more color on the quarter .", "i 'd like to now

from the acquisition while strengthening the brands at both bacharach and msa .", "from a balance sheet perspective , our leverage remains healthy .", "if we add bacharach into our quarter end net

are contributing to the stronger order book .", "that momentum provides confidence around demand for our products as we look at the coming quarters .", "second , our operating margin of 17.2 % showed

the coming years .", "the expenses , noncash and negatively impacted operating margin by approximately 130 basis points in the quarter .", "and third , our cash flow performance was healthy .",

million .", "revenue was up 5 % on a constant currency basis .", "while we saw about a 2.5 % benefit associated with the addition of bristol , our apr business presented a 5 % headwind on a year - over - year basis .", "in constant currency , revenue in the americas was up 6 % , while international revenues were up 3 % .", "the international performance reflects a lag in vaccine deployment and economic recovery , which is tracking a few months behind the u.s. core product revenue was up 12 % on growth across fire service and industrial ppe , partially offsetting a lower fgfd business .",

upwards of 20 % or 30 % compared to 2020 .", "it was also good to see head protection sales back at 2019 levels in the second quarter .", "touching on fire service , backlog remains very healthy , and

pre-pandemic levels heading into the second half .", "for msa overall , quarterly incoming orders surpassed 2019 levels .", "at the same time , supply chain constraints with electronic components are presenting challenges to our ability to deliver in certain areas .", "this has resulted in backlog increasing 15 % from the end of q1 , particularly in gas detection products .", "while it 's difficult to predict how long the supply chain challenges will last , we expect the constraints around electronic components will persist into the second half .", "gross profit was relatively consistent compared to last year .", "pricing and stronger throughput in our factories offset higher material costs .", "despite a number of headwinds in margins associated with input costs , gross margins were roughly in line with prior year levels .", "we have implemented an off - cycle price increase to respond to the inflation that we are seeing in the u.s. across electronic components , resins and other inputs .", "we will continue to evaluate additional pricing opportunities through the second half as we navigate these inflationary pressures .", "sg&a expenses was -- were $ 83

the variable comp resets at the onset of the pandemic .", "this trend played out as expected and impacted the quarterly comparison in sg&a by about $ 3 million .", "quarterly sg&a also includes about $ 8 million of costs related to bacharach and and bristol acquisitions , including the stock compensation of about $ 4 million adjustment that i spoke about previously .", "bacharach transaction costs of about $ 2 million and the remainder being the bristol base sg&a .", "our cost savings from restructuring programs effectively offset discretionary costs coming back into the business .", "we

.", "we invested $ 7 million in restructuring programs in the quarter , primarily in our international segment as we continue to execute on our margin expansion road map .", "our restructuring actions have produced excellent results to date and position us well for the economic recovery .", "together with the programs we had discussed in 2020 , we continue to expect to deliver approximately $ 15 million of savings across the income statement in 2021 and annual savings of $ 25 million thereafter .", "our quarterly adjusted operating margin was down 150 basis points from a year ago .", "the decline reflects the impact of the bristol noncash stock compensation adjustment i mentioned earlier , which is booked in our corporate segment .", "looking at our segment performance .",

basis point decline in the quarter .", "and we continue to navigate the inflationary pressures and are assessing additional levers that will help mitigate these pressures in future quarters .", "our quarterly tax rate was 27.8 % on a gaap basis or 27.4 % on an adjusted basis .", "there were two discrete items that drove the quarterly rate up .", "first , the statutory tax rate increase in the u.k. from 19 % to 25 % drove a onetime adjustment to our deferred taxes .", "second , we incurred higher nondeductible expenses associated with the acquisition of bacharach .", "from a cash flow and

11 million in capex programs .", "since we completed the bacharach acquisition on july 1 , its impact is not yet reflected on our balance sheet .", "on a pro forma basis , following the acquisition , net debt - to - ebitda would be 1.7 times compared to 0.6 times at june 30 .", "we continue to expect bacharach to provide $ 0.10 to $ 0.15 of adjusted earnings per share in the second half of 2021 .", "in line with our existing methodology , adjusted earnings will exclude purchase accounting amortization .", "in connection with the acquisition , we funded $ 200 million of 15 - year senior notes

and flexibility .", "we also included a sustainability - linked pricing structure on our revolver .", "our borrowing cost flexes up or down based on our performance on certain esg metrics .", "with the pro forma debt for bacharach , we 'd expect interest expense to be in the range of $ 3.5 million to $ 4 million in q3 and q4 of this year .", "we also completed a buyout of our minority partner in our china business for about $ 19 million in july .", "china is a key market for us , and it's an important part of our growth strategy moving forward .", "china has consistently been accretive to msa

highly strategic market as well as helping us optimize foreign cash balances .", "before we move on , let 's touch on the adjustment to the product liability reserve , which drove $ 12 million of

continue to monitor development and filing rates .", "we plan to conduct our annual review process later this year , where we will evaluate many factors , including the potential developments in filing trends .", "as we look ahead , we 're operating in a very dynamic environment .", "while the strong rebound in order pace in the second quarter and elevated backlog provide a sense of optimism heading into the second half , the supply chain challenges we are facing are having an impact .", "from where we operate today , the supply chain constraints are the largest variable for us .", "raw
