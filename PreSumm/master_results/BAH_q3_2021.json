19 pandemic .", "let me talk specifically about how those are playing out on the demand front , on the supply front and the impact on revenue and profits .", "underlying demand for our services and solutions remains quite strong .", "in the third quarter , we saw delays in some procurements in the intelligence market , largely due to the pandemic .", "and in the civil market , we saw movement to the write on awards and even some pullback on funding , which we believe is due to the turmoil surrounding the presidential election .", "these shifts in procurements and funding were greater than we anticipated and greater than we normally experience during a change in administrations .", "we expect these dynamics to be temporary with a return to more typical market rhythms over the next six to nine months .", "secondly , on the demand side .", "i 'll note the reduction in billable expenses in comparison to our third quarter last year .", "we have said previously that billable expenses are unpredictable and not a significant source of profitability .", "the third quarter drop - off was partially due to covid and is another dynamic that may last for a couple more quarters .", "turning now to the supply side .", "there were two factors in play .", "the first was a fast return to more historical productivity rates .", "during the first half , we spoke of meaningful jump in productivity because of high retention and low use of paid time off .", "we always knew that was temporary .", "our expectation was that we would see a gradual shift to typical patterns as covid vaccines rolled out .", "instead , we saw a quick snapback to more normal , albeit lower productivity levels in november .", "early indication is that our fourth quarter productivity levels may remain closer to historical norms .", "also in the third quarter , the combination of lower - than - desired recruiting rates and the strategic divestiture of a small defense contract led to a sequential decline in headcount .", "as productivity declined in the first half , we were comfortable with slower headcount growth .", "but with the snap back to normal levels , we need to accelerate recruitment .", "we have already ramped up and expect to see improvement in three to six months .", "shifting to our other key metrics .", "let me highlight the strength of our margins , bottom line and cash flow .", "while the reduction in billable expenses helps margins , our over performance at the bottom line and in cash flows is primarily driven by our strong execution of the business .", "despite the challenges of the past year , our team has remained focused on the fundamentals that drive our performance , high - quality client delivery , smart capture of new business , targeted cost management and continued investment in our differentiators , especially our people .", "as a result , we have made our business leaner and more competitive , enhanced our brand in the market for talent and doubled down on our growth drivers , all while delivering outstanding value to shareholders and strengthening our balance sheet .", "we expect both the headwinds and tailwinds i just described to be with us for the next few months , and that is reflected in our updated full -

over - year , against a challenging third quarter comparable .", "i 'd note that revenue excluding billable expenses , continued to grow strongly , but our defense business carries the bulk of booz allen 's exposure to billable expenses .", "these were lower than expected in the third quarter due to less travel during the pandemic , and they were elevated in the prior year period due to significant materials purchases on aircraft programs .", "as horacio mentioned , underlying long -

over - year .", "the drop was driven by our international business based in part on market dynamics , but also due to our own decision to shift our strategic focus to our cyber business in the us in the port of that , we made a minority investment in tracepoint , a digital forensic rand incident response company serving clients in the public and private sectors .", "we are excited to partner with tracepoint and see a significant opportunity to cross-pollinate with booz allen 's own digital forensics expertise .", "that covers the demand side .", "now let me step through the supply side dynamics as well as our expectations for the rest of the year .", "in the first half of the year , given the limited ability to travel during the pandemic , our employees took very little time off from work .", "we encouraged our people to take pto in the interest of their personal health and expected a gradual return to normal productivity levels as a result .", "instead , pto utilization returned back to historic levels in november , and we believe that trend may continue .", "we note that the timing around the rollout of a covid vaccine could have a material influence on pto utilization .", "regarding headcount , while attrition remained low , we did not add as much headcount in the third quarter as we had planned , in part due to a strategic contract divestiture .", "our hiring needs were somewhat lessened in the first half of the year due to unusually strong staff productivity , but we intend to pick up the pace on recruiting .", "this will take us some time to address , but we expect to be back on track by early next year .", "we ended the quarter with 27,566 employees , an increase of 390 or 1.4 % year - over - year .", "excluding the impact of the 110 - person workforce transferred as a part of the army - related contract divestiture , we would have ended the quarter with 1.8 % headcount growth year -

over - year to $ 144 million and $ 145 million , respectively .", "diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share each increased 30 % to $ 1.03 and $ 1.04 , respectively .", "the increases were due to solid operating performance and the release of a large tax reserve stemming from our previous aquilent acquisition in fiscal year 2017 .", "this reserve release was factored into our previous guidance .", "we generated $ 233 million in operating cash during the third quarter , an increase of 133 % over the prior year .", "cash ended the quarter at $ 1.3 billion .", "exceptional operating cash flow was driven by the overall growth of the business , continued strength in collections and reduced payables attributable to cost management .", "these first three quarters of cash generation represent our strongest year -

19 .", "they break down as follows .", "temporary programmatic shifts of $ 50 million to $ 100 million , $ 50 million of risk tied to a material incremental step down in staff utilization , and lastly , lower than forecast billable expenses of $ 50 million to $ 100 million , largely from lower pandemic -
