zero us franchise store closures , an impressive testament to the continued health of our us system .", "on many occasions , you 've heard me say that net unit growth and by extension store closures are one of the most important ways to measure a brand 's health within our industry .", "a single store closure in the quarter , on a base of over 6,000 units , demonstrates the elite economic proposition that we offer to our franchisees .", "and on that note , i 'm thrilled to report yet another record - setting year of franchisee profitability , with our final 2020 estimated average ebitda number for us franchise stores coming in at just over $ 177,000 ; the highest in our history .", "while this result was certainly aided by the covid demand tailwind , it clearly demonstrates not only the power of the brand , but also the incredible work of our us franchisees and operators , and their relentless efforts throughout an incredibly busy 2020 .", "our fortressing strategy continues to build best - practice case study showcasing franchisee enterprise growth and roi , which is a big part of the momentum and excitement behind the strategy .", "but equally , as important , it sets us up extremely well to compete in 2021 and beyond , as we continue to drive lower relative costs , better service , higher runs per hour , and therefore , better economics for drivers , along with meaningful , incremental carry - out within our stores in fortress territories .", "while our carry - out order count remained pressured in q1 as it was throughout the last year , we continue to grow awareness of domino 's car - side delivery .", "this has created a new option to serve our customers effectively during covid and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carry -

term growth .", "let 's move on now to the international business .", "it was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business .", "our 12.8 % retail sales growth was supported by a very strong 11.8 % comp , continuing the momentum we saw toward the end of last year .", "q1 also marked our 109th consecutive quarter of positive same - store sales and international ; a tremendous accomplishment by our international franchise partners .", "and , in fact , the q1 comp was the strongest result we 've seen in more than a decade in that business .", "as i discussed earlier with our us business , we are also watching the two - year comp stacks for international and we 'll continue to do so throughout 2021 .", "q1 represented a 13.3 % two - year stack , which was a 430 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "we also continue to build momentum on store growth in our international business .", "our 139 net stores in q1 was a 100 - store improvement versus the first quarter of 2020 .", "we expect that covid will continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets for some time to come and will bring ongoing challenges to new store openings .", "but this acceleration in growth speaks to our outstanding unit - level economics and to the perseverance and commitment of our international master franchisees .", "we continue to have temporary store closures around the world , but those have come down dramatically over the last few quarters and were below 100 at the end of the first quarter .", "now , i 'd like to highlight a few markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter .", "india , china , and japan , once again , led our system in net unit growth .", "and i 'd like to highlight another market , guatemala , that also delivered terrific store growth .", "china , japan , turkey , colombia , germany , and france , all drove impressive retail sales growth during the quarter .", "so , once again , i am very proud of our master franchisees and their operators for a great start to 2021 .", "they are the best in the business and that 's why i continue to be bullish about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long term .", "so , in closing , i 'm very pleased with our quarter one results .", "our incredible base of franchisees and operators , combined with outstanding unit -
