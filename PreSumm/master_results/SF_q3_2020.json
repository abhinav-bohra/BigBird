to - date wealth management revenue increased 18 % , driven by strong growth in our brokerage and asset management revenues , both of which reflect strong recruiting end markets .", "in the fourth quarter , we expect another strong quarter for our asset management revenue due to the 8 % sequential increase in fee - based client assets , which totaled $ 115 billion at september 30 .", "i would also note that total client assets reached $ 326 billion at the end of the quarter and are just $ 3 billion below the record level set in the fourth quarter of 2019 .", "as you can see on the wealth management metrics slide , we had another outstanding recruiting quarter as our virtual recruiting strategies continue to produce significant growth in our advisor headcount .", "to put numbers to this , we recruited 45 financial advisors with total trailing 12 -

grade , high - yield rates as well as municipals .", "equity brokerage revenue of $ 54 million was up 32 % year - on - year as activity levels slowed from the record levels in the second quarter as market volatility slowed .", "like our fixed income businesses , we are also having a record year in our institutional equity brokerage business , as through the first nine months , revenues are up 23 % from our previous nine month high recorded in 2014 .", "i would also note that i 'm pleased with the contributions from our international businesses .", "on the following slide , we look at our firmwide investment banking revenue .", "revenue of $ 218 million was relatively flat with the prior quarter and up 10 % year - on - year , driven by record revenue and capital raising .", "overall , the third quarter was our third strongest investment banking quarter .", "much like my comments about our overall institutional business , our investment banking business has not only been sustainable on an annual basis , but has grown at a compound annual rate of 20 % since 2009 and has more than offset industry headwinds in our institutional brokerage business .", "we will continue to invest in this business as we believe that we can continue to take market share and grow as a premier middle market investment bank .", "looking at our capital raising business in the quarter , we generated record revenues in both our equity and fixed income issuance .", "equity underwriting revenue of $ 85 million was up 41 % year - on - year and surpassed our prior record by 20 % as ipo activity was up significantly from the prior quarter .", "the record results in the quarter underscore the diversity of the business we 've built as healthcare and technology were our strongest contributors , while our largest vertical , financials , slowed as clients looked to raise capital in the debt markets .", "our fixed income underwriting revenue of $ 53 million was also a record as our public finance business had a strong quarter and the issuance market continued to improve .", "stifel lead managed 264 negotiated municipal issues and one was again ranked number one nationally in terms of the number of issues managed .", "through the first nine months , we have lead managed 632 municipal issues , which is up 17 % compared to the combined volume of stifel and george k. baum for the same period in 2019 .", "i would also note that although our corporate debt issuance revenues were down from the prior quarter , we continued to benefit from our bankers ' ability to cross -sell services .", "as i mentioned earlier , kbw 's clients continue to benefit from our expertise in the debt issuance markets .", "this again highlights the benefits of our model .", "for our advisory business , revenue of $ 81 million decreased by 23 % year - on - year as we were negatively impacted by the slowdown in bank m&a following a very strong year in 2019 .", "in terms of verticals , the performance of our advisory business was driven by technology , industrials and restructuring .", "the decline in advisory was expected as the market had been impacted by the slowdown in deal announcements earlier this year following the pandemic .", "that said , we continue to see our clients reengage and our pipelines continue to pick up .", "while bank m&a activity continues to lag the robust levels we saw in 2019 , we are starting to see some green shoots as we recently advised cit on their announced sale of first citizens , which will create a bank with $ 100 billion in assets .", "additionally in the fourth quarter , we advised eastern bank on the largest ever first step mutual conversion .", "in terms of our overall pipelines , they continue to build , and i 'm optimistic for our investment banking business overall .", "i would note that the capital raising business is robust yet highly market dependent .", "before i discuss net interest income , i 'll make a few brief comments regarding our gaap earnings .", "i would note that as we successfully integrated all of our recent acquisitions , we 've seen the continued convergence of our gaap and non-gaap results .", "this can be seen in what was our second highest quarterly gaap earnings per share in our history , which resulted in an roe of nearly 13 % , an rotce of more than 20 % .", "similar to last quarter , the strong gaap earnings and the pause in our share buyback program resulted in fairly meaningful increases in book value and tangible book value that i 'll describe in more detail in the following slides .", "and now let 's turn to net interest income .", "for the quarter , net interest income totaled $ 101 million , which was down $ 14 million sequentially .", "our results were impacted by the 0 % interest rate environment and elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet .", "our firmwide net interest margin declined to 190 basis points , which was consistent with the bank 's net interest margin declining to 237 basis points .", "firmwide , average interest - earning assets were relatively flat due to a modest increase in our loan portfolio , primarily due to mortgage loan originations and an 80 % increase in our cash position as a result of the debt and preferred equity issuances earlier this year as well as the elevated cash position held at the bank .", "moving on to the next slide , we review the bank 's loan and investment portfolios .", "we ended the period with total net loans of $ 10.9 billion , which was flat sequentially .", "the breakdown of our portfolio skewed to a greater percentage of consumer loans through the end of the third quarter .", "our mortgage portfolio increased by $ 100 million sequentially as we continue to see demand for residential loans and refinancings from wealth management clients given the decline in interest rates .", "our securities -

adjusted return and an opportunity to have exposure to the underlying loans with structural credit protection .", "we 've not incurred any losses in this portfolio , and even under the most severe stress testing we deploy , we do not anticipate incurring any losses .", "we adopted cecl earlier this year , and in the first half of the year , we incurred $ 35 million of credit loss provisions through the p&l , which does n't include the $ 11 million opening adjustment that ran through equity .", "much of the increase in the first half of the year was driven by changes in macroeconomic scenarios based on the moody 's model , which estimated increasingly severe declines in gdp as well as increasing unemployment .", "as you can see on the slide , while the allowance for credit loss was essentially unchanged , we did see an increase in the allowance and our coverage ratio on our commercial portfolio , which increased to 2.03 % as a result of additional management overlays .", "we continue to see strong credit metrics with nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans at eight basis points .", "while we understand we are still in the early innings of the current credit cycle , we 've yet to see anything but nominal charge - offs over the last several quarters .", "moving to capital and liquidity .", "our capital ratios were relatively stable during the quarter .", "our tier one leverage ratio increased to 11.3 % , primarily on the strength of our earnings and a lack of share repurchases .", "our tier one risk - based capital ratio was 19.2 % , a slight decline from last quarter 's 19.3 % , as we had elevated risk - weighted asset density in our trading portfolio , given some of the volatility we saw earlier in the year .", "this decreased risk - based capital by approximately 90 basis points .", "looking forward to the fourth quarter , we would not anticipate any material changes in our balance sheet .", "as i mentioned earlier , we will pay off our $ 300 million , five year senior notes when they mature in december .", "given the timing of the maturity , we anticipate that interest expenses will be modestly lower in the fourth quarter .", "our book value per share increased to $ 50.95 , an increase of $ 2.11 sequentially and our tangible book value per share increased to $ 32.34 , up from $ 30.16 .", "these increases were driven by strong quarterly earnings and improved marks on our afs portfolio .", "as i noted last quarter , our liquidity position remains strong .", "in addition to the sweep program , the bank has access to off -
