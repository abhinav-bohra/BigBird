year financial objectives .", "adeps nearly doubled over the period to $ 3.90 in fiscal year 2021 .", "average annual revenue growth was above the midpoint of the 6 % to 9 % range we originally provided .", "adjusted ebitda margin was above 10 % in each of the three years and we deployed $ 1.3 billion in capital .", "the majority of which was achieved through increased dividends and a robust share repurchase program .", "during the three -

century pandemic .", "and throughout , we continued to invest in our people , especially when we set aside $ 100 million in response to the pandemic to support our employees and help the most vulnerable in our communities .", "all the while we also continued to invest in our key technologies and develop elements of our option value portfolio .", "so the story of the last three years is certainly of our outstanding financial performance .", "but more importantly , as we look to the future , it is the basis for our optimistic outlook on the business .", "over the last decade , we further differentiated booz allen 's brand and market position to the point that today federal and commercial clients rely on us for advanced technology solutions that deliver both speed and mission scale .", "and our unique combination of consulting expertise , mission knowledge , innovation and technology serves as a strategic accelerator for both our firm and our clients .", "i 've said many times , booz allen learns and evolves continuously .", "our next strategy and long -

end of our 29 % to 31 % range .", "these factors played out in the fourth quarter as expected .", "let me step through the market performance .", "revenue growth for the full - year was led by our defense and civil businesses , which grew 9 % and 8 % , respectively .", "in defense , growth slowed in the second half of the year due to the factors i noted earlier .", "however , underlying long - term demand for our services and solutions remained strong , as evidenced by recent business wins and continued tactical sales execution .", "growth in our civil business also slowed in the second half of the year .", "this was largely related to a pause on a large cyber program due to funding availability , which occurred in the third quarter and continued into the fourth quarter .", "given the importance and criticality of this program for the client , we believe work will ramp up again in the coming quarters .", "revenue from our intelligence business declined 3 % for the full - year .", "our focused effort to reshape that portfolio continues and we are pleased with the results so far .", "we expect to see our intelligence business return to growth in this fiscal year as we ramp up recent contract wins .", "furthermore , the pandemic -
