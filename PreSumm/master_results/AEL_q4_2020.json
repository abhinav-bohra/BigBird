ups had added an additional $ 5 million of reserve increase .", "we said that we thought expected plus or minus $ 10 million would seem reasonable .", "so the fourth quarter of 2020 was a little bit above that range .", "there were pluses and minuses in the fourth quarter , with the biggest differences due to a $ 6 million increase from lower - than - expected decrements on policies with lifetime income benefit riders and a $ 10 million increase as a result of lower caps and par rates due to renewal rate changes and policies having anniversary dates during the quarter .", "we will continue to experience the impacts from the renewal rate changes made in the second quarter of 2020 and the first and second quarters of this year .", "deferred acquisition cost and deferred sales inducement amortization totaled $ 113 million , $ 16 million less than modeled expectations .", "the biggest items driving the positive experience were lower - than - modeled interest and surrender margins , lower - than - expected utilization of lifetime income benefit riders , and the second quarter of 2020 renewal rate changes i spoke about previously .", "the benefit on the combined deferred acquisition costs and deferred sales inducement amortization from the second quarter 2020 renewal rate changes was $ 10 million , effectively offsetting the negative effect on the lifetime income benefit rider reserve .", "other operating costs and expenses increased to $ 55 million from $ 43 million in the third quarter .", "notable items not likely to reoccur in the first quarter of 2021 , primarily advisory fees related to the unsolicited offer for the company in september totaled , approximately , $ 3 million with much of the remaining increase associated with the implementation of ael 2.0 .", "post -
