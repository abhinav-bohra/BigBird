19 pandemic , to almost 10.5 % in canada , one of our most impacted regions where the volume recovery have been remarkably strong , arguably outpacing the reopening activity particularly when considering that many restrictions in canada extended through q2 of this year .", "also noteworthy is our western region , where volumes led our other regions going into the pandemic and continue to be the strongest in the u.s. at about 8.5 % in q2 .", "looking at year - over - year results in the second quarter on a same - store basis , all lines of business increased by double digits commercial collection revenue was up 16 % year - over - year .", "roll - off pulls increased by over 11 % year -

digit percentages year - over - year .", "however , the outsized amount of special waste activity was particularly noteworthy as q2 activity propelled tons back to 13 % above pre-pandemic levels with all regions up year - over - year , perhaps due to a little pull forward from q3 .", "looking at q2 revenues from recovery commodities , that is recycled commodities , landfill gas and renewable energy credits , or rins .", "excluding acquisitions , collectively , they were up about 95 % year - over - year resulting in a combined margin tailwind of about 130 basis points , 90 basis points of which was from recycling and 40 basis points from landfill gas and rins .", "recycling revenue increases were driven by both higher commodity values , including old corrugated containers or occ , up 25 % ; and plastics and metals , both up over 100 % .", "higher volumes also contributed year -

person training , meetings and other activities we consider integral to sustaining our culture and expanding our bench strength ahead of future growth .", "given the challenging labor environment , we have also proactively implemented supplemental wage adjustments in many markets as we anticipate or combat labor constraints .", "these purposeful wage and discretionary cost additions , along with higher incentives , medical and other costs resulting from more typical activity levels , largely replaced last year 's covid - 19 - related frontline support costs , the majority of which did not repeat this year .", "as noted earlier , we 've already implemented incremental price increases to address these higher costs , resulting in full year 2021 price of approximately 5 % , up from 4 % in our original outlook .", "we delivered adjusted free cash flow up 18.5 % year -

average acquisition activity and an increasing return of capital to shareholders .", "we have already returned over $ 400 million to shareholders in 2021 through share repurchases and dividends .", "and we are in the process of renewing our normal course issuer bid , authorizing the repurchase of up to 5 % of our outstanding shares per annum .", "we will continue to approach share repurchases opportunistically and anticipate announcing another double -
