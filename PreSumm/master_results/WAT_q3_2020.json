over - year on a constant currency basis and adjusted earnings per share grew 1 % .", "first , from a customer perspective , our largest segment , pharma , was the primary growth driver in the quarter with 4 % organic growth , followed by industrial , which grew 3 % and academic and government , which declined 7 % .", "from a product perspective , our waters branded products and services grew 3 % organically , while ta declined by 8 % on a constant currency basis .", "improving access to labs , especially in pharma , continued to help drive growth in the recurring revenues .", "services grew 4 % , while consumables business grew approximately 7 % organically , driven largely by pharma .", "consumables remained a growth area for us .", "in fact , earlier this month , we introduced our acquity premier columns , which reduce variability risks and save time when analyzing metal -

digit growth .", "we were encouraged by the demand of our high - resolution mass spec systems in pharma and biomedical research , particularly in the u.s. and europe and the demand for our tandem quad systems in food safety in china .", "bioaccord also grew nicely in the quarter .", "however , it still does not represent a material portion of our revenue .", "with its simplicity and dedicated workflows in peptide mapping , glycan analysis , intact mass and oligonucleotide analysis , we believe it is the right instrument to bring lc - ms into the manufacturing in qa / qc space .", "i have spent time with several of our customers who are using bioaccord instruments and many of them highlighted its ease of use and a robust feature set that can be utilized across multiple lab applications .", "so , i think bioaccord has a good future , but i also think it will take longer than originally anticipated to significantly impact our core growth .", "this is a dynamic waters has seen with prior new product launches , such as acquity , which took almost four years to reach its peak sales .", "lc instruments also saw a better quarter after double - digit declines in the first half of the year with a modest decline in q3 .", "some of this improvement can be directly attributed to arc hplc , which was launched in june .", "finally , to ta , revenues continued to decline in the high - single digits due to constraint capital spending at our industrial customers .", "pharma and electronics revenue saw a nice double - digit increase , but this was not enough to offset the industrial declines .", "turning to our key geographies , both the americas and europe grew mid-single digits , while asia was flat .", "in the u.s. , the growth was driven by pharma , food and academia , partially offset by declines in material science and clinical .", "we saw especially strong engagement with customers who are assisting the fight against the pandemic .", "latin america remained soft , mostly due to the continued impact of closures due to covid -

level software to help them deploy the system seamlessly .", "as you can see , they are near - term actions that are backed by detailed targets and kpis .", "however , i want to be clear , these changes will take time and will not significantly impact our results overnight , especially as we implement these initiatives on the background of covid -

to - date savings against our internal plan to 85 % , with the majority recognized in the second quarter .", "we expect to realize remaining 15 % in the fourth quarter .", "returning to our third quarter non-gaap financial performance , gross margin for the quarter was 55.8 % compared to 58.2 % in the third quarter of 2019 , primarily as a result of unfavorable fx as well as fixed cost absorption and sales mix .", "moving down the third quarter p&l , operating expenses increased by approximately 1 % on a constant currency basis and foreign currency translation increased operating expense growth by approximately 2 % on a reported basis .", "the increase was primarily attributable to the timing of variable costs in the prior year quarter and fx .", "in the quarter , our effective operating tax rate was 15.8 % , which was about flat for the prior year .", "net interest expense was $ 7 million , a decrease of about $ 1 million .", "our average share count came in at 62.3 million shares , a share count reduction of approximately 7 % or about 4 million shares lower than in the third quarter of last year as a result of shares repurchased through the end of the first quarter of 2020 , subsequent to which we paused the share repurchase program .", "our non-gaap earnings per fully diluted share for the third quarter increased to $ 2.16 in comparison to $ 2.13 last year .", "on a gaap basis , our earnings per fully diluted share decreased to $ 2.03 compared to $ 2.07 last year .", "turning to free cash flow , capital deployment and our balance sheet , i 'd like to summarize our third quarter results and activities .", "we define free cash flow as cash from operations , less capital expenditures and excluding special items .", "in the third quarter of 2020 , free cash flow grew 53 % year - over - year to $ 190 million , after funding $ 28 million of capital expenditures .", "excluded from free cash flow was $ 7 million related to the investment in our taunton precision chemistry operation and a $ 38 million transition tax payment related to 2017 u.s. tax reform .", "in the third quarter , this resulted in $ 0.32 of each dollar of sales converted into free cash flow and $ 0.31 year - to - date .", "our increased free cash flow is primarily a result of our cost savings actions and improvements in our cash conversion cycle .", "we continue to make good progress on our working capital improvement plans .", "accounts receivable days sales outstanding came in at 76 days this quarter , down four days compared to the third quarter of last year and down 11 days from the second quarter .", "inventories decreased by $ 42 million in comparison to the prior year quarter , reflecting stronger revenue growth and revised production schedules .", "waters maintains a strong balance sheet , access to liquidity and a well -

end capital budgeting plans for both pharma and industrial customers in the fourth quarter .", "in light of these dynamics , we anticipate that fourth quarter revenue , on a constant currency basis , will most likely decline at a low -
