rate loans and securities .", "these impacts are expected to be more neutral to positive going forward .", "the hedging program contributed meaningfully to net interest income in the fourth quarter .", "the cumulative value created from our hedging program is approximately $ 1.5 billion .", "roughly 90 % of that amount has either been recognized or is locked into future earnings from hedge terminations .", "excluding , ppp net interest income is expected to grow modestly in the first quarter , aided by strong fourth - quarter ending loan growth , as well as continued loan growth in the first quarter , partially offset by day count .", "regions balance sheet is positioned to benefit meaningfully from higher interest rates .", "over the first 100 basis points of rate tightening , each 25 -
