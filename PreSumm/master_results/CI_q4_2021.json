than - expected fourth - quarter costs are attributable to three primary areas : higher stop - loss claims , particularly in policies with lower attachment points that were triggered by the cumulative impact of covid and non-covid costs throughout the year ; continued pressure on our individual business , particularly the special enrollment period customers who were added in mid-2021 ; and higher claim costs in our commercial insured book .", "the elevated medical costs were partly offset by better -

loss , we assume the pressure experienced in the fourth quarter will persist in 2022 , and we will take appropriate future pricing action as this book of business renews throughout the year .", "helping to offset these pressures , as we step into 2022 , our targeted pricing actions we 've taken in our u.s. commercial business as we saw claim costs emerge in 2021 , higher u.s. commercial enrollment and retention than previously expected in our fee - based business and incremental affordability actions , which i 'll elaborate on in just a few moments .", "we ended the year with 17.1 million total medical customers , an increase of approximately 430,000 customers for the full year .", "overall , cigna healthcare supported and delivered for our customers , clients , and partners during a challenging year and is well -
