to - quarter increase in the benefit ratio was largely driven by the impact of rising inflation in the u.k . as we have outlined in previous quarters , the higher benefit payments we make that are linked to inflation are offset with higher income that we received from inflation index - linked yields in the investment portfolio .", "benefits experienced in unum poland continued to trend favorably and adjusted operating income was generally consistent from quarter to quarter .", "the year - over - year premium growth for our international business segment was also strong this quarter .", "on a local currency basis to neutralize the impact from changes in exchange rates , unum uk generated growth of 5.1 % with strong persistency , good sales and the continued successful placement of rate increases on our in -
