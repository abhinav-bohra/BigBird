year levels for the entire quarter as governments gradually ease social and indoor dining restrictions .", "we believe that some of the sales volumes strengthening during the last few weeks of the quarter may reflect distributors ' restocking inventory in anticipation of more governments lifting social restrictions in the spring .", "however , it 's difficult to gauge the extent of that benefit .", "in contrast , shipments to non-commercial customers remained at around 50 % of prior - year levels , with continued strength in healthcare more than offset by weakness in other channels such as travel , hospitality , and education .", "price / mix increased 2 % behind the carryover pricing benefit of pricing actions we took in the second half of fiscal 2020 .", "this was partially offset by unfavorable mix versus the prior year due to lower sales of premium products .", "as we 've discussed in previous earnings calls , we 've regained much of this business since pandemic first struck last spring , but on a year -

margin private label volume , which will continue to be a headwind on volume through the remainder of the fiscal year .", "price / mix increased 10 % , primarily reflecting the favorable mix benefit of selling more of our higher -
