had been previously reserved .", "note that this benefit is excluded from ffo as adjusted .", "lastly , income tax expense was $ 395,000 for the quarter versus $ 18.4 million in the prior year .",

that time .", "now , let 's move to our capital markets and balance sheet .", "with a very productive quarter related to financing activities that resulted in several improvements in our balance sheet

will have total offsetting debt of approximately $ 2.8 billion , all of which will be either fixed rate debt or debt that has been fixed through interest rate swaps with a blended coupon of approximately 4.3 % .", "additionally , our weighted average debt maturity will be approximately 6.5 years with no scheduled debt maturities until 2024 .", "we had $ 144.4 million of cash on hand at quarter end , which is expected to increase by approximately $ 95 million with the issuance of the new 10 - year bonds net of the redemption of the 2023 bonds , and we have nothing drawn on our $ 1

than the high end of the guidance range we had previously provided and was primarily driven by additional collections from cash basis customers .", "during the quarter , we also collected $ 7.7 million of deferred rent and interest from accrual basis tenants and borrowers and the deferred rent and interest receivable on our books at september 30 was $ 40.9 million , which we expect to collect primarily over the next 27 months .", "additionally , during the quarter , we collected $ 3.6 million in deferral repayments from cash basis customers that were recognized as revenue when received .", "at september 30 , we had about $ 126 million of deferred rent and interest owed to us not on the books .", "we anticipate collecting some of this amount over the next two quarters .",

received .", "finally , as discussed previously , we also received a note repayment from a cash basis customer of $ 5.3 million , which resulted in credit loss recovery that is excluded from ffo as adjusted .", "adding this all together , and as you can see on the slide , we collected more than 100 % of contractual cash revenue for the quarter .", "we are pleased to be increasing guidance for 2021 ffo as adjusted per share from a range of $ 2.76 to $ 2.86 to a range of $ 2.95 to $ 3.01 .", "the guidance for 2021 ffo as adjusted per share includes only previously committed additional investment spending of approximately $ 6 million for the last three months of 2021 .", "guidance for disposition proceeds has also been increased from $ 40 million to $ 50 million to $ 93 million to $ 103 million , primarily to reflect the sale of the two ski properties that greg discussed .", "as we have done in previous quarters , we would also like to update you on the expected ranges of contractual cash revenue that we expect to recognize in our financial statements for the fourth quarter of ' 21 , as well as our expected collections that relate to those same periods .", "the range we expect to recognize in q4 of such contractual cash revenue is $ 133 million to $ 138 million or 96 % to 99 % .", "additionally , the expected range we expect to collect of such contractual cash revenue in q4 is $ 131 million to $ 135 million or 95 % to 97 % .", "differences from the full amount of contractual cash revenue related to deferrals granted and the associated accounting .", "please note that the definition of contractual cash revenue continues to exclude percentage rents straight line and other noncash revenue and revenue related to managed properties .", "i would also like to note that beginning in 2022 , we expect both current quarter collections and revenue recognition to be at 100 % of contractual cash revenue , and we expect to continue to collect deferral amounts from prior periods .", "finally , i thought it would be helpful to provide a bridge from the midpoint of our previous ffo as adjusted per share guidance of $ 2.81 to the midpoint of our increased guidance of $ 2.98 .", "as you can see on the slide , the increase is driven by increased revenue recognition and percentage rents , as well as lower interest expense and g&a , partially offset by the impact from increased dispositions and lower operating profit from managed properties .", "details regarding all of our 2021 guidance can be found on page 22 of our supplemental .", "as you 've heard today ,
