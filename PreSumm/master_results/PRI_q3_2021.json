term trends .", "from a p&l perspective , this excess mortality was fully offset by a reduction in the reserves held for policy riders that provide for premiums to be waived if an individual becomes disabled .", "main drivers of the reductions were higher death claims in the waived population , along with expanding our third - party disability claims management to include canada .", "during the third quarter , lapses remained around 25 % to 30 % lower in pre-covid levels for all durations except duration one , which was about 15 % lower .", "compared to the pre-pandemic baseline , dac amortization was favorable by $ 11 million , offset by $ 6 million in higher benefit reserves due to strong persistency for a net favorable impact of $ 5 million to pre-tax income .", "the third quarter of 2020 experienced record persistency with lapses around 35 % lower than pre-covid across all durations , including duration one for a net contribution to pre-tax income of $ 14 million .", "last year , we highlighted that these levels were unsustainable and as such , expected lapses to normalize over time .", "year - over - year dac amortization was higher by $ 11 million and benefit reserves were lower by $ 2 million due to persistency changes with the increase in dac amortization largely driven by duration one .", "given the higher covid - related death claims and lower net contribution provided by persistency , pre-tax income growth was compressed to 2 % year - over - year with margins remaining around 20 % .", "looking to the fourth quarter , we expect adjusted direct premiums to grow by approximately 12 % year - over - year and future growth rates to taper as we layer our new business and transact the pre-pandemic activity levels .", "covid - related deaths are estimated at $ 14 million based on 100,000 projected population deaths in the u.s. and canada .", "we expect strong persistency to continue lapses that are 20 % to 25 % lower than pre-pandemic levels across all durations except duration 1 , where we expect lapses to be around 15 % lower .", "this translates to a similar persistency - related impact as seen this quarter .", "we do not expect the new business assumption review performed annually in the fourth quarter to have a notable impact on earnings .", "overall , we anticipate term life margins in the range of 19 % to 20 % for the fourth quarter .", "turning next to the results of the isp segment on slide 8 .", "operating revenues of $ 233 million increased $ 57 million or 32 % year - over - year .", "our pre-tax income of $ 69 million increased 35 % .", "third quarter results continue to reflect the combined benefit of strong sales volumes across all products and the positive impact of equity market appreciation .", "sales - based revenues increased 45 % , slightly slowed the growth in revenue - generating sales due to a higher proportion of sales volumes in large dollar trades , which have a lower commission rate .", "asset - based revenues increased 31 % , reflecting a similar increase in average client asset value .", "both sales and asset - based commission expenses increased in line with the associated revenue .", "as glenn mentioned , we expect fourth quarter isp sales to grow between 20 % and 25 % year - over - year .", "based on the current sales mix , this would increase sales - based net revenue by approximately $ 4 million over the prior year period .", "assuming no significant market movement during the quarter , average assets under management would be approximately 20 % higher year -

out payments to the term shareholders based on e-telequote 's achieving earnings results as defined in the purchase agreement for the calendar year ending 2021 and 2022 .", "given the substantial earnings required to achieve the earn - out , we do not anticipate nor did we expect many payments will be made .", "as such , we have not recognized the liability for the earnout in our preliminary purchase price allocation and do not anticipate recognizing any expense associated with it .", "we will acquire the remaining 20 % interest at e-telequote , which is held by or for the benefit of e-telequote 's management through a series of puts and calls based on formulaic price defined in the purchase agreement .", "we have recognized the remaining interest outstanding in the preliminary purchase price allocation in 2 categories : redeemable non-controlling interest ; and liability classified share - based compensation based on the terms and conditions of the individual shares .", "and post - acquisition share - based compensation expense for the applicable shares as well as adjustments for change in the fair market value of liability classified shares subsequent to the acquisitions are excluded from our operating results as they represent acquisition - related expenses that will not reoccur subsequent to the exercise of the protocol .", "the key areas of focus as we evaluate senior health performance going forward will be approved policies , commissions and fees , which includes both the lifetime commission revenues recognized at point of sale and any subsequent tail commission adjustments for changes in estimates on policies issued in previous periods and contract acquisition costs .", "other drivers include marketing development revenues reflected in other revenues and other operating expenses .", "each of these items is defined further on page 13 of the financial supplement , where we also highlight the non-controlling interest and other purchase - related accounting items discussed earlier .", "as the post - acquisition business matures , we plan to add cash collections by cohort to track the time it takes for the cohort of approved policies to become cash positive to our quarterly earnings discussion .", "the senior health business experiences some notable seasonality with the fourth quarter being the strongest due to the annual election period or aep , which runs from mid-october early december .", "aep generally has peak levels of demand , and as a result , e-telequote has higher agent count .", "the open enrollment period or oep , during the first quarter is generally another strong period as individuals have an opportunity to switch between medicare advantage plans .", "the second quarter tends to be a period of focus on individual to qualify for both medicare and medicaid , those who are allowed a special enrollment period and those aging into medicare or coming from an employer sponsor plans .", "before of potential sales opportunities in the second quarter decreases relative to oep and aep , however , volumes are adequate to avoid laying off of quality agents .", "the third quarter is typically the weakest quarter of the year financially with growing agent counts leading into aep and lower lead volume , a basic supply and demand imbalance .", "during the quarter , the senior health segment had an adjusted operating loss before taxes of $ 6.6 million , including purchase accounting adjustments .", "as glenn referenced , throughout covid , there has been pressure around hiring and retaining the quality of agents e-telequote typically attracted prior to covid .", "while there are generally third quarter hiring and preparation for aep , heightened turnover early in the year led to higher - than - usual levels of hiring , training and licensing in the third quarter .", "the cost associated with this drove contract acquisition costs per approved policy up to $ 1,287 , which when combined with the low supply of leads typical in the quarter resulted in a loss for the period .", "while staffing challenges remain in the fourth quarter , we believe the lead supply benefits of aep , along the incremental primerica generated leads will provide a positive impact to profitability .", "we anticipate pre-tax operating earnings to be in the $ 20 million range fourth quarter with lifetime value commissions around $ 1,170 and contract acquisition costs around $ 640 per approved policy .", "moving next to slide 10 in our corporate and other distributed products segment , the adjusted operating loss increased by $ 1.5 million year - over - year to $ 13.5 million .", "commissions and fee revenue were higher by $ 6 million , including $ 3.7 million from mortgage sales .", "this was partially offset by $ 3.7 million lower net investment income as portfolio yields were lower and the allocation to the term life segment increased in support of the growing book of business .", "adjusted benefits and expenses increased $ 3.7 million , largely due to the expansion of the mortgage program , including $ 2.6 million higher sales commissions and operating expenses .", "operating results for the corporate and other segment excludes certain costs related to the acquisition of e-telequote , most notably $ 9.6 million in transaction -
