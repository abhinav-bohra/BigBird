over - year foreign currency changes and rising input costs .", "for the aec segment , the gross margin declined from 21.6 % to 16.1 % of net sales caused by a smaller impact from changes in the estimated profitability of long - term contracts , a change in program mix , and lower fixed cost absorption due to the lower 787 and f - 35 revenues , and the impact of sharing with our customer base a portion of the aviation manufacturing jobs protection grant received during the quarter .", "the $ 5.8 million benefit of this grant appears in the corporate portion of the results while the reduced profitability caused by sharing a portion of the grant with our customer base is reported in the segment results .", "during the quarter , we recognized a net favorable change in the estimated profitability of aec 's long -

up of indirect taxes in a foreign jurisdiction .", "net income attributable to the company for the quarter was $ 30.9 million , an increase of over $ 1 million from $ 29.6 million last year .", "the increase was caused primarily by the higher operating profit , partially offset by higher interest expense and the higher tax rate .", "earnings per share were $ 0.95 in this quarter compared to $ 0.92 last year .", "in addition to the normal non-gaap adjustments we typically make to cover the impact of foreign currency revaluation gains and losses , restructuring expenses , and expenses associated with the circomp acquisition and integration , this quarter , we are also adjusting out the impact of the aviation manufacturing jobs protection grant as we do not believe it is reflective of ongoing profitability .", "after making these non-gaap adjustments , adjusted earnings per share was $ 0.83 this quarter compared to $ 0.96 last year .", "adjusted ebitda declined by 2.6 % to $ 60.2 million for the most recent quarter compared to the same period last year .", "machine clothing adjusted ebitda was $ 59.2 million or 38.4 % of net sales , up from $ 52.6 million or 37.9 % of net sales in the prior year quarter .", "aec adjusted ebitda was $ 16.3 million or 20.8 % of net sales , down from last year 's $ 19.5 million or 26.6 % of net sales .", "turning to our debt position .", "total debt , which consists of amounts reported on our balance sheet as long - term debt or current maturities of long - term debt remained steady at $ 350 million .", "we have a floating to fixed interest rate swap in the place of debt level for the life of the current credit agreement and currently , we do not intend to pay down total debt below that level .", "cash increased by about $ 33 million during the quarter resulting in a reduction in net debt by the same $ 33 million .", "capital expenditures in the quarter of about $ 9 million were roughly the same as incurred in the same quarter last year .", "from a capital deployment perspective , as bill mentioned , our priorities are unchanged .", "the first priority is organic investments followed by disciplined and targeted acquisitions followed by returning capital to shareholders .", "our fundamental strategy has not changed .", "however , given our modest leverage and strong free cash flow outlook , the board of directors has authorized a $ 200 million share repurchase program .", "we believe that such a program will be the most efficient , effective and value - additive approach to returning additional capital to our shareholders .", "while there is no guarantee that we will execute all or even any of this authorization , it is the company 's intention to make use of this authorization subject to prevailing market conditions and while recognizing the inherent limitations on how quickly we can execute such a significant program .", "fully executed , the share repurchase program would increase our net leverage a little under one turn of ebitda leaving us with sufficient dry powder for additional strategic actions .", "as we look forward to the balance of 2021 , the outlook for the machine clothing segment remains strong .", "q3 revenues were up over 11 % compared to last year partially aided by some currency tailwinds to revenue , primarily due to strong euro .", "packaging and tissue grades remain the primary drivers of long - term growth .", "while we also saw a nice recovery in publication revenue in the third quarter , driven by a return to office and schools , a continuation of this recovery is in jeopardy as a result of the delta varian surge which at par has paused some return to office efforts .", "also , after we get through the pandemic effects , we do not expect any change in the long - term secular decline in the publication market .", "i would also like to note that the growth rate for the mc segment this quarter was unusually high driven by timing of customer needs .", "segment orders year - to - date are up about 6 % compared to last year and backlog entering q4 is only modestly higher than at the same time last year .", "we typically generate about 23 % to 25 % of the segment 's revenue in the fourth quarter , and we expect this year to be broadly similar to that .", "as a result , we are raising our previously issued guidance of revenue for the segment to between -- to be between $ 600 million and $ 610 million , up from the prior range of $ 585 million to $ 600 million .", "from a margin perspective in machine clothing , we delivered another strong quarter , with adjusted ebitda margins of almost 39 % .", "we are seeing increased pressure from input expenses of all types particularly logistics and expect these pressures to continue to increase through the balance of the year .", "however , as previously discussed , many of these cost increases began in q2 and accelerated in q3 , have yet to materially impact our results due to both the terms of our supply agreements and the roughly six - month lag between procuring raw materials of the higher cost and those cost being reflected in the segment 's cost of goods sold .", "we will see more impact from these cost pressures in q4 , but we will not see the full impact until 2022 .", "in addition , late in the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter , we have seen some relaxation of travel restrictions in certain regions and are beginning to see our level of visits to customers increase , which will result in somewhat higher stg -- oh , sorry .", "sg&a in the fourth quarter .", "driven primarily by the strong revenue performance , we are increasing our adjusted ebitda guidance for the segment to a range of $ 215 million to $ 225 million , up from the prior range of $ 210 million to $ 220 million .", "we delivered a strong quarter , very much in line with expectations .", "last quarter , we indicated that we expected q3 profitability to be similar to that delivered in q1 and it was within a few hundred thousand dollars of that level .", "we were very pleased to be awarded an aviation manufacturing jobs protection grant during the quarter of $ 5.8 million which recognizes the challenges that we , along with the rest of the industry have experienced due to the covid pandemic .", "however , as i already noted , we have adjusted the effects out of both q3 adjusted results and segment guidance for the year as it is not reflective of continuing operational performance .", "while unlikely to have any material impact on the balance of 2021 , we are concerned about the slow recovery of the boeing 787 program where boeing has indicated that they will continue to produce at a low rate for the foreseeable future .", "as of the end of the third quarter , we had the equivalent of about five shipsets of 787 product in either finished goods or wip which is not unusually high .", "however , significant quantities of our finished goods exist in boeing 's overall supply chain , which combined with boeing 's low level of production will likely lead to very low levels of production for us , for the foreseeable future and may even lead to significant production gaps .", "any impact in 2021 would be modest as we are not anticipating any significant recovery on the program this year , but it will likely delay any meaningful recovery on the program until beyond 2022 .", "as you know , our production levels on the f - 35 have been uncertain this year , as our customer has dealt with issues elsewhere in the supply chain over the last 18 months and with lower depot consumption of aftermarket parts .", "we are confident in our outlook for the balance of the year , but i will note that lockheed martin and its government customer have established a new outlook for program production that plateaus at 156 aircraft in 2023 , a lower rate , and an earlier date than the previously planned plateau .", "the f - 35 remains a very good and profitable program for us .", "this programmatic change has no impact on this year , but it will likely temper the revenue upside in the program for us in future years .", "overall for the aec segment , the year is progressing largely as we expected when we last issued guidance , although we are now less concerned about downside risk .", "therefore we are raising the lower end of our guidance range for segment revenues resulting in the range of between $ 310 million , up from the previous range of $ 290 million to $ 310 million .", "from a profitability perspective , given the year is progressing largely as expected , we are maintaining the previously issued guidance range for aec adjusted ebitda of between $ 65 million and $ 70 million .", "we are also updating our previously issued guidance ranges for company -
