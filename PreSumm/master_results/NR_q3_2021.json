end demand for product sales being the greatest variable .", "at that revenue level , we expect segment operating margin to remain relatively stable to q3 primarily impacted by the following factors : first , the significant surge in raw material cost for mats combined with the competitive pricing environment ; second , a change in the mix of rental projects with lower pricing on a few of the larger - scale , longer - duration projects ; and third , the lack of near - term industrial blending production volume .", "with the anticipated q4 performance , the industrial solutions segment is expected to deliver more than $ 190 million of revenues for the full year 2021 , just shy of our 2019 results , while also generating more than $ 60 million of full year ebitda .", "this comparison to 2019 highlights the successful transformation in this segment as the strong revenue growth in the power transmission and other industrial end markets is expected to substantially offset the more than $ 50 million decline in annual revenue derived from the e&p sector as compared to 2019 .", "in fluids systems , we anticipate most regions will continue to strengthen in the near term , benefiting from the strong commodity prices and the gradual easing of covid -

digit percentage in q4 .", "and although the change in shell activity in the gulf of mexico provides an unfavorable headwind , we expect fluids segment operating income will be roughly breakeven for the fourth quarter prior to the cost of any further restructuring , including a solid earnings contribution from our international operations along with improvements in the u.s. looking beyond q4 , with the improving outlook for the oil and gas sector and particularly benefiting from our meaningful international presence combined with the impacts of our ongoing actions to reshape our u.s. operations , we expect revenue growth in 2022 will continue to deliver solid incremental margins and drive further improvements in fluids profitability .", "corporate office expense is expected to remain fairly flat in the near term then decline modestly in the first quarter and beyond .", "also , with the december one maturity of our remaining $ 39 million of convertible bonds , we expect interest expense to step down modestly in q4 then level off at roughly $ 1 million of quarterly interest expense in 2022 .", "with the sequential improvement in both segments and the modest decline in interest , we expect consolidated pre-tax income to be roughly breakeven for q4 prior to restructuring charges .", "with regard to capex , we expect expenditures in the near term will remain fairly limited with investments focused on growth opportunities within the industrial solutions segment .", "total net capex for the full year 2021 is likely to come in around $ 10 million .", "it 's also worth noting that as we look beyond the repayment of our upcoming convertible bond maturity in december , in addition to funding the expansion of our industrial solutions business and working capital needs of the business , we will look to resume returning value to shareholders in 2022 through purchases of outstanding stock under our existing share repurchase program .", "i 'd like to take a moment to elaborate on my recently announced decision to retire as ceo of newpark .", "i have also decided that upon my retirement , i will resign as a member of the board .", "as i reflect on my 15 years as the company 's president and ceo , i 'm extremely proud of all we have accomplished and the unique culture we have created .", "while there is never a perfect time to retire , i believe the time is right , having turned 65 earlier this year and with the executive leadership team in place to continue on newpark 's journey .", "i 'd now like to hand the call over to matthew lanigan , who was recently promoted to president and chief operating officer , and will ultimately succeed me as ceo upon my retirement .", "as many of you know , matthew has been with newpark since 2016 , where he led the transformation and diversification of our industrial solutions business .", "i 'm confident that matthew , along with the rest of the newpark leadership team , will do an outstanding job building upon the platform we have all worked to create and deliver long -
