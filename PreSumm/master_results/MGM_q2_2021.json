quarter levels longer - term as casino spend adjusts over time and as we reintroduce f&b and entertainment , especially in our destination markets .", "we also expect to rightsize labor in the near term , which has certainly had a favorable impact on our margins , but it's also become a bottleneck in certain segments of our operations , negatively impacting our ebitdar .", "still , similar to las vegas , i know that we can achieve regional margins well above 2019 levels longer term .", "our joint venture betmgm is clearly the no .", "i gaming and has solidified its no .", "2 position nationwide in u.s. sports betting and igaming .", "net revenues associated with betmgm operations grew 19 % sequentially from the first quarter to $ 194 million in the second quarter .", "this was driven by growth in both igaming and online sports betting verticals as a result of increased customer acquisition and strong retention that yielded more first -
