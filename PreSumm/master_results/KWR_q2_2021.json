hit from covid .", "on a sequential basis sales were up 1 % from the first quarter with 3 of our 4 segments showing growth , but our asia pacific segment was down 5 % .", "overall sales were great for asia pacific continue to be strong , but did sequentially declined compared to the first quarter due to unusually strong demand in the first quarter in our china metalworking business , but this is largely due to certain customers replenishing their supply chain in the first quarter .", "we are also seeing higher selling prices , which we estimate increased an overall 6 % in the quarter , with increases in all 4 segments .", "i also want to point out that our ability to gain new pieces of the business and take market share also contributed to the strong performance as our analysis shows , we had total organic sales growth due to net share gains of approximately 4 % in the second quarter of 2021 versus the second quarter of 2020 .", "so we continue to feel good about our ability to deliver on our historical performance of consistently growing 2 % to 4 % points above the market due to our share gains .", "and looking forward , we continue to feel good about these levels of share gains given the opportunities we have recently won or or actively working on .", "while strong sales were a positive for us in the quarter , a clear negative was the continued increase in our raw material costs .", "while we knew raw material costs we 're increasing the last time we talked , the increases have continued longer and at a higher level than we expected .", "overall , our cost of raw materials have increased an additional 10 % since our last call in may when our original expectation was that it will begin to stabilize in june .", "this has not been the case , there is tremendous stress on the supply chain of raw materials and logistics .", "further , the availability of raw materials has impacted us at times for i 'm proud to say that we 've navigated this so far and have ensured that all our customers ' businesses continue to operate .", "the increase in raw material costs did put downward pressure on our gross margin in the second quarter and this increase in raw materials will continue into the 3rd quarter , just given the sheer magnitude and duration of the additional increases and the lag effect we experience between the time raw material cost increase and the time we have to fully implement price increases to offset them .", "so overall , we 're very pleased with the quarter given the raw material issues we are facing as we achieved our second highest quarterly adjusted ebitda ever .", "our trailing 12 - month adjusted ebitda is now $ 277 million compared to the $ 222 million in 2020 .", "so we are already experiencing the step change we projected in our profitability .", "synergy achievement also was a factor in our results as we achieved $ 18.5 million in the current quarter compared to $ 12.5 million last year .", "we did increase our net debt in the quarter due to increases in our working capital related to raw material costs and availability .", "however , our leverage ratio of net debt to adjusted ebitda continued to improve from 3.1 at the end of the first quarter to 2.7 now .", "as we look forward to the 3rd quarter , we expect short - term headwinds from higher raw material costs and additional impacts in the automotive market due to the continued semiconductor shortage and some typical seasonality impacts .", "i do now see the 3rd quarter as our lowest quarter of the year , both in terms of gross margin and profitability .", "however , we do expect our margins and profitability to sequentially improve in the 4th quarter .", "we expect raw material prices to stabilize by the end of the 3rd quarter and we expect our product margins to get back to their targeted levels as we exit the year .", "as i think about our full year , we are continuing with our previous guidance , which is the floor or the low end of our expected adjusted ebitda .", "however , a more optimistic on the year than i was several months ago , while we may end up the year in the same place or slightly better based on our strong first half .", "that the shape of our years expected profitability trend has changed .", "essentially , we are seeing higher demand for the year but greater margin pressures in the near term , which is expected to be largely offset this higher demand .", "however , the margin pressures are expected to be short - term in nature once our price increases are fully implemented .", "so we are currently expect to exit the year at a better - than - expected demand for our products and our product margins largely returning to our expected levels .", "so , we now expect the year 's profitability to be in a similar or slightly better place compared to our previous expectations .", "i feel better about the scenario than the already positive one i envisioned a few months ago .", "we will have a step change in our profitability essentially complete our integration cost synergies continue to grow above the market by taking share and reach our targeted net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage of 2.5 % .", "i 'm so proud how our team has performed in servicing our customers , meeting their needs and successfully continuing with our integration execution , which is both critical and difficult for us given the conditions we face .", "people are everything in our business and by far and was valuable asset and ensuring their safety and well - being is and will continue to be a top priority for us .", "so i can't help but reemphasize my pride for our quaker houghton team and what we have and will be able to accomplish for our customers and investors both now and going forward .", "looking at our second quarter performance , we had another strong quarter .", "and as mike mentioned , it was really the story of a positive solid top - line performance but tempered by a negative higher input cost due to the global supply chain disruption that we and the rest of the world are currently facing .", "as i begin to discuss our quarterly performance , i 'll point you to slide 6 , 7 and 8 in our call charts , which provide a further look into our financials .", "and also i want to remind everyone that our prior year comparison was heavily impacted by covid - 19 hitting us the hardest .", "in the second quarter of 2020 .", "our record net sales of $ 435.3 million increased 52 % from the prior year and this was driven by 35 % higher volumes , 8 % from foreign exchange , 5 % percent from acquisitions and 4 % from price and mix .", "when looking sequentially , we were up 1 % from the first quarter as increases from our pricing initiatives offset about 3 % lower volumes quarter - over - quarter .", "as the first quarter enjoyed some additional volumes due to customers replenishing their inventories .", "turning to our gross margin trend , our second quarter margin ended at 35.5 % which as we expected , was down roughly 1 % sequentially due to the pricing lag that mike previously discussed .", "that said we did show improvement compared to 34 % in the prior year , but this 1.5 % improvement year - over - year is really due to the impact of fixed manufacturing costs on prior year volume levels as well as the benefit of strong execution of integration synergies , which offset higher raw material costs in the current quarter .", "we expect 3rd quarter gross margin to be at or somewhat below our second quarter level before beginning to increase in the 4th quarter .", "as we exit the year , we do expect our product pricing to catch up to the current year raw material increases .", "however , the impact of price increases to our top line will naturally impact our overall gross margin levels as we priced to ensure we retain our product margins , at least on a per- kilo basis to ensure we maintain our levels of gross profit in dollars rather than percent .", "sg&a was up $ 22 million compared to the prior year quarter as we had additional direct selling costs due to our increase in sales , higher labor and other costs that were directly impacted by covid last year .", "additional costs associated with our recent acquisitions , and higher sg&a due to the impact of foreign exchange , which were partially offset by additional savings from integration cost synergies .", "the net of this performance resulted in our second highest ever adjusted ebitda of $ 70.1 million for the quarter , up 118 % compared to the prior year covid impacted , $ 32 million .", "as you could see in chart 9 , this increased our trailing 12 - month adjusted ebitda to a record $ 277 million .", "from a segment perspective , these results were really driven by higher operating earnings in each of the company 's segments year - over - year .", "this was certainly attributable to the prior year weak performance due to covid but this quarter also benefited from recent acquisitions higher integration cost synergies as well as the market share gains mike previously mentioned .", "when looking at our segment 's sequential performance each segment 's top line was above the first quarter as global pricing initiatives offset some volume decline quarter - over - quarter with the exception of asia pacific , who had a decline in sales as they experienced a very strong first quarter specifically in certain china metalworking markets .", "each segment 's top line performance drove their sequential operating performance to be relatively consistent compared to the first quarter in the americas , emea and gsp .", "as the pricing initiatives largely offset lower volumes and the impacts of higher raw material costs .", "whereas , asia pacific did have a sequential decline in earnings , which was largely due to the exceptional first quarter that i previously mentioned .", "from a tax perspective , we had an effective tax rate of 32.2 % in the quarter compared to 57.9 % in the prior year .", "excluding various one - time items in each period , our tax rate would have been 24 % for the current quarter compared to 18 % in the prior year , which was a bit low due to the impacts from covid on our effective tax rate .", "to note , we do expect both our 3rd quarter and full - year effective tax rates will be in the range of 24 % to 26 % .", "our non-gaap earnings per share of $ 1.82 grew over 700 % compared to the prior year as our strong operating earnings , coupled with over $ 1 million of interest savings due to lower borrowing rates or partially offset by slightly higher tax expense .", "as we look to the company 's liquidity summarized on chart 10 , our net debt of $ 759.2 million increased about $ 9 million in the quarter , which is primarily driven by $ 7.1 million of dividends paid , $ 6 million of additional investments in normal capex as well as a small acquisition , which were partially offset by $ 3 million of operating cash flow .", "the quarter 's low operating cash flow was driven by further investment in the company 's major working capital requirement .", "specifically , the company had considerable increases in the inventory , which were due to higher raw material costs , restocking of low levels given past impacts of covid as well as bulk purchases to ensure safety stock given the disruption in our global supply chain .", "looking ahead to the second half of the year we believe our operating and free cash flow will return to the typical levels we 've demonstrated in the past , as we do n't believe we will have such dramatic increases in working capital to sustain our day - to - day operating requirements .", "despite an increase in net debt , the company was able to significantly improved our reported leverage ratio to 2.7 times as of q2 2021 compared to 3.1 times at the end of march .", "overall , i want to emphasize we are committed to prudent allocation of our capital .", "this includes prioritizing debt reduction , while continuing to pay our dividends , which we just to get out the 5 % increase as well as investing in acquisitions that provide growth opportunities which make strategic sense .", "and all while remaining committed to reducing our leverage , which we still expect to be at our target of 2.5 times by the end of the year .", "so , to summarize quaker houghton had another strong quarter that was above our expectations due to continued strength in demand , and good market share gains , which partially offset higher input costs .", "our liquidity remains very healthy , and we remain committed to our overall capital allocation and deleveraging strategy ."], "summary_gold": "q2 non -gaap earnings per share $ 1.82 .<q>q2 sales $ 435.3 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $ 392 million .", "summary_pred": "despite the challenging conditions caused by covid as well as the current year global supply chain pressures that have impacted raw material availability .<q>our results for the second quarter were stronger than we expected .<q>all of our plants around the world are operating and we are continuing to meet our customers ' needs .<q>this was primarily being driven by continued strong sales .<q>while sales volumes were down 3 % from the first quarter , the first quarter was unusually strong as we believe some of our customers were replenishing their inventories .<q>so we continue to feel good about our ability to deliver on our historical performance of consistently growing 2 % to 4 % points above the market due to our share gains .<q>we are also seeing higher selling prices , which we estimate increased an overall 6 % in the quarter , with increases in all 4 segments .<q>a great deal has changed over the past year with the covid pandemic for us .<q>we have slides for our conference call , you can find them in the investor relations section of our website at www .<q>looking at our second quarter performance , we had another strong quarter .<q>so i can't help but reemphasize my pride for our quaker houghton team and what we have and will be able to accomplish for our customers and investors both now and going forward .<q>additional costs associated with our recent acquisitions , and higher sg&a due to the impact of foreign exchange , which were partially offset by additional savings from integration cost synergies .<q>i do now see the 3rd quarter as our lowest quarter of the year , both in terms of gross margin and profitability .<q>as i begin to discuss our quarterly performance , i 'll point you to slide 6 , 7 and 8 in our call charts , which provide a further look into our financials .<q>so overall , we 're very pleased with the quarter given the raw material issues we are facing as we achieved our second highest quarterly adjusted ebitda ever .<q>overall , our cost of raw materials have increased an additional 10 % since our last call in may when our original expectation was that it will begin to stabilize in june .", "len_article": 83, "len_summary_gold": 2, "len_summary_pred": 16, "len_sent_scores": 61}
