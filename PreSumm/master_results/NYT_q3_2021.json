per - week promotional subscriptions who have graduated to higher prices , and to a much lesser extent , the impact from our digital subscription price increase .", "digital news subscription arpu for the quarter increased approximately 5 percentage points compared to the prior year and nearly 1 percentage point compared to the prior quarter .", "this improvement in both the year - over - year and sequential result was primarily due to subscriptions graduating from their introductory price to either full price or an intermediate step - up price in the quarter , as well as the continued benefit from price increases on our more tenured , full - price subscriptions .", "arpu related solely to domestic news subscriptions increased 6.5 percentage points versus the prior year and approximately 1.5 percentage points versus the prior quarter .", "we continue to expect the impact from subscriptions graduating from discounted promotions and the price increase on tenured digital subscriptions to provide a tailwind to digital news arpu through the balance of this year .", "print subscription revenues declined 1 % as overall volume declines more than offset the benefit from the first quarter home delivery price increase .", "total daily circulation declined approximately 7 % in the quarter compared with prior year , while sunday circulation declined approximately 5 % .", "compared with 2019 , print subscription revenues declined 5 % , as single - copy and international bulk sale copies declined , while revenue from domestic home - delivery subscriptions grew 1.7 % .", "total advertising revenues increased 40 % in the quarter , as both digital and print advertising grew approximately 40 % , in large part as a result of the impact of the comparison to weak advertising revenues in the third quarter of 2020 .", "digital advertising continued to be buoyed by our proprietary first -
