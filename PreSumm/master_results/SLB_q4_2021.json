year , mid-teens revenue growth ambition and ebitda margin expansion .", "this growth and margin expansion trajectory gives us further confidence that we will reach or exceed our mid-cycle ambition of 25 % adjusted ebitda margin before the end of 2023 , leading to adjusted ebitda that should visibly exceed 2019 levels in dollar terms .", "fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $ 0.41 .", "this represents an increase of $ 0.05 compared to the third quarter of this year and $ 0.19 when compared to the same period of last year .", "in addition , we recorded a net credit of $ 0.01 bringing gaap earnings per share to $ 0.42 .", "this consisted of a $ 0.02 gain relating to the sale of a portion of our shares in liberty oilfield services , offset by a $ 0.01 loss relating to the early repayment of $ 1 billion of notes .", "overall , our fourth quarter revenue of $ 6.2 billion increased 6 % sequentially .", "all divisions posted sequential growth , led by digital and integration .", "from a geographical perspective , international revenue grew 5 % , while north america grew 13 % .", "pretax operating margins improved 31 basis points sequentially to 15.8 % and have increased for six quarters in a row .", "this sequential margin improvement was driven by very strong digital sales , which helped sustain overall margins , despite seasonality effects in the northern hemisphere .", "companywide adjusted ebitda margin remained strong at 22.2 % , which was essentially flat sequentially .", "let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division .", "fourth quarter digital and integration revenue of $ 889 million increased 10 % sequentially with margins growing by 268 basis points to 37.7 % .", "these increases were driven by significantly higher digital and exploration data licensing sales which were partly offset by the effects of a pipeline disruption in ecuador that impacted our aps projects .", "reservoir performance growth further accelerated in the fourth quarter with revenue increasing 8 % sequentially to $ 1.3 billion .", "this growth was primarily due to higher intervention and stimulation activity in the international offshore markets .", "margins were essentially flat at 15.5 % as a result of seasonality effects and technology mix , largely driven by the end of summer exploration campaigns in the northern hemisphere .", "well construction revenue of $ 2.4 billion increased 5 % sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling , both in north america and internationally .", "margins of 15.4 % were essentially flat sequentially as the favorable combination of increased activity and pricing gains was offset by seasonal effects .", "finally , production systems revenue of $ 1.8 billion was up 5 % sequentially , largely from new offshore projects and year - end sales .", "however , margins decreased 85 basis points to 9 % , largely as a result of the impact of delayed deliveries due to global supply and logistic constraints .", "now , turning to our liquidity .", "our cash flow generation during the fourth quarter was outstanding .", "we delivered $ 1.9 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $ 1.3 billion during the quarter .", "this was the result of a very strong working capital performance driven by exceptional cash collections and customer advances .", "cash flows were further enhanced by the sale of a portion of our shares in liberty , generating net proceeds of $ 109 million during the quarter .", "following this transaction , we hold a 31 % interest in liberty .", "on a full year basis , we generated $ 4.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $ 3 billion of free cash flow .", "we generated more free cash in 2021 than in 2019 , despite our revenue being 30 % lower .", "this is largely attributable to our efforts of the last two years relating to the implementation of our capital stewardship program and the high grading of our portfolio .", "as a result of all of this , we ended the year with net debt of $ 11.1 billion .", "this represents an improvement of $ 2.8 billion compared to the end of 2020 .", "we are proud to say that net debt is now at its lowest level of the last five years .", "during the year , we also continued to reduce gross debt by repaying $ 1 billion dollars of notes that were coming due in may of this year .", "in total , our gross debt reduced by $ 2.7 billion in the last twelve months thereby significantly increasing our financial flexibility .", "now , looking ahead to 2022 .", "we expect total capital investments , consisting of capex and investments in aps and exploration data , to be approximately $ 1.9 to $ 2 billion dollars , as compared to just under $ 1.7 billion in 2021 .", "this increase will allow us to fully seize the multiyear growth opportunity ahead of us , while still achieving our double -
