from - home eating for most of the year .", "slide 33 shows the puts and takes of our fourth - quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin .", "as you can see , our team did a great job pulling on our margin levers in the quarter , including taking price increases in several retail categories driving favorable mix throughout the portfolio , capturing $ 20 million of synergies associated with the pinnacle foods acquisition , managing our covid -

than - expected inflation .", "the decline in adjusted operating profit and the impact of last year 's 53rd week affected our results by $ 0.23 and $ 0.05 , respectively , shown here on slide 35 .", "these headwinds were partially offset by strong performance from our ardent mills joint venture , lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count resulting from our q3 share repurchase .", "slide 36 summarizes our net debt at fiscal year end and ebitda and cash flow performance for the fiscal year .", "we ended the year with a net debt to ebitda ratio of 3.6 times , which is in line with our fiscal ' 21 target .", "we took advantage of our strong balance sheet throughout the year to increase our investment in the business and return capital to shareholders .", "during fiscal ' 21 , we increased capex by more than $ 130 million compared to the prior year and funded important capacity and productivity projects .", "we also repurchased nearly $ 300 million worth of shares and paid $ 475 million in dividends in fiscal ' 21 .", "given the timing of the closure , this sale had a minimal impact on our q4 results , but we expect there to be an annualized net sales impact of roughly $ 40 million going forward .", "this will primarily be reflected in our refrigerated and frozen segment with small effects on our international and foodservice segments .", "we estimate that the sale will have a total annualized impact on our earnings per share of approximately $ 0.01 .", "as sean mentioned , we are pleased with our current position in the market and are confident in our ability to continue executing the conagra way to drive profitable growth as we look ahead .", "however , we have experienced an acceleration of inflation since q3 .", "and due to the timing lag between when this inflation hits our p&l and when the benefits of our pricing and productivity actions take effect , we do not expect to fully offset the impact of these cost increases in time to meet our prior fiscal ' 22 earnings per share projections .", "we do expect , however , second - half fiscal ' 22 earnings per share to be in line with what we assumed for the second half in our prior guidance .", "we are therefore updating our guidance as shown on slide 37 .", "for fiscal ' 22 , we now expect organic net sales growth approximately flat to fiscal ' 21 , adjusted operating margin of approximately 16 % , and adjusted earnings per share of approximately $ 2.50 .", "while this guidance is our best estimate of how we will perform in fiscal ' 22 , our ultimate performance will be highly dependent on four critical factors : first , how consumers purchase food as restaurants , offices , and schools continue to reopen ; second , the level of inflation we ultimately experience ; third , the elasticity impact as consumers respond to higher prices ; and finally , the ability of our end - to - end supply chain to continue to operate effectively .", "slide 38 shows the progression of our fiscal ' 22 inflation expectations , the continued acceleration being the biggest driver of the change in our guidance .", "when we initially gave our fiscal ' 22 targets at our investor day in april of 2019 , our models assumed an annual inflation rate of around 3 % .", "at the time of our third - quarter call in april of 2021 , we expected fiscal ' 22 inflation to come in at twice that level around 6 % .", "importantly , as of the q3 call , we still saw a path to deliver our fiscal ' 22 targets .", "not only is our brand health strong as evidenced by the strong consumer demand , we know how to pull on all margin levers .", "that said , there is a limit to how much cost increase we can absorb in the short term given the timing lag that sean and i have discussed .", "and as all of you know , inflation has continued to rise sharply since april .", "we now currently expect fiscal ' 22 inflation to come in around 9 % .", "the difference between the 6 % we expected a few months ago and the 9 % we expect today equates to approximately $ 255 million in additional costs during fiscal ' 22 .", "the bulk of this inflation can be attributed to continued increases in the cost of edible fats and oils , proteins , packaging , and transportation since the timing of our q3 call .", "while we are able to hedge some of our inputs , others , particularly certain proteins , are not easily hedged .", "as sean mentioned , we have various levers at our disposal that we are actively and strategically pulling to manage this inflation , but the profit lag effect is real .", "for example , certain pricing actions can take 90 days to enact or a cost savings initiative may not be actionable until later in the year when a contract is up for review .", "so while we anticipate being able to successfully manage inflation over time , the continued sharp increases to input costs we are currently experiencing will take some time to overcome .", "and given our disciplined approach to managing the business for the long term , we will not reduce investments to meet the guidance target at the expense of the long - term health of our business .", "slide 40 lays out the change in our adjusted earnings per share expectations in a bit more detail .", "we are updating our fiscal ' 22 adjusted earnings per share guidance for three items .", "first , consistent with our prior divestitures , we are removing $ 0.01 for the egg beaters divestiture that we announced today .", "second , the largest driver of the change is the significant $ 0.41 per share increase in inflation since q3 that i just discussed .", "and finally , we have identified many ways to manage and offset this increased inflation , including additional productivity and cost savings initiatives , as well as substantial pricing actions that sean and i have discussed .", "again , the bulk of these margin offsets will start to hit our p&l in the second quarter and continue to increase in the second half , which is why we expect second - half earnings per share to be in line with what we assumed for second - half earnings per share in our prior fiscal ' 22 guidance .", "slide 41 lays out some of the key assumptions that underlie our fiscal ' 22 expectations .", "on the top line , we expect organic net sales growth to be stronger in the second half of the year compared to the first .", "we expect children to return to in -

up to benefit the second half .", "we also expect our second - half operating margins to be better than the first half .", "this is driven by our expectation that q1 will be the most pressured quarter of the year .", "q1 is expected to have the highest inflation rate of the year and benefit the least from pricing .", "at the same time , we have planned strong investments behind a&p and innovation for the first quarter .", "as the year progresses , we expect margins to improve as the inflation rate decelerates and the impacts of our margin lever actions take hold .", "as you heard sean discussed , we also plan to continue maintaining strong brand - building support throughout the year to sustain the long - term health of the business .", "i think it 's important to highlight that we expect the actions we are taking in fiscal ' 22 to create some tailwinds heading into fiscal ' 23 .", "as we mentioned , we expect our second - half earnings per share to be in line with what we assume for second - half earnings per share in our prior guidance .", "so as we head into fiscal ' 23 , we expect our profitability trend to be in line with our prior expectations .", "we expect our brand building and innovation actions to help maintain retail demand above pre-covid -
