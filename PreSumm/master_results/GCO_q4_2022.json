price selling and higher footwear asps .", "j&m 's gross margin was up 420 basis points to fiscal ' 20 , also benefiting from strong full - price selling and price increases , which also drove the release of slow -

over - year performance .", "and comparatively speaking , we had a much lower bonus expense in fiscal year ' 20 q4 than we did this year .", "the other major driver of the deleverage was in marketing expense , which is due to our efforts to drive our digital footprint as well as brand awareness .", "this coincided with price increases and digital marketing costs , including increased cost per click .", "it 's worth mentioning , last year 's sg&a levels were unusually low , benefiting from 10s of millions of dollars of one -

focused strategy as well as our ability to execute our growth algorithm .", "as mimi mentioned , for the fiscal year , we achieved north of a 6 % operating margin , which was an important milestone in our long - range plan .", "for the quarter , our adjusted non-gaap tax rate was 25 % , which compares favorably to the 37 % last year due to the impact of the cares act tax provisions in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ' 21 .", "this resulted in adjusted diluted earnings per share of $ 3.48 for the quarter , which compares to $ 2.76 last year and $ 3.09 in fiscal ' 20 .", "turning now to the balance sheet .", "q4 total ending inventory was down 24 % , compared to fiscal ' 20 on sales that were up 7 % .", "at the end of the quarter , all our business experienced inventory shortfalls versus fiscal ' 20 with the most impacted in journeys and j&m , which were down 20 % and 39 % , respectively .", "our strong net cash position of $ 305 million , an increase of over $ 120 million versus last year , was driven by our strong operating performance .", "additionally , we consolidated operations and sold a warehouse , realizing a sizable gain on the transaction .", "this strong performance and our confidence in the business enabled us to continue to return cash to our shareholders through the repurchase of 840,000 shares of stock for $ 52 million at an average price of $ 62.22 per share during the quarter .", "total fiscal ' 22 share repurchases were approximately 1.36 million shares or 9 % of outstanding shares at a cost of approximately $ 82.8 million and at an average price of $ 60.88 per share , which effectively used up our september 2019 $ 100 million share repurchase authorization .", "as a reminder , to continue to support our capital allocation strategy , we recently announced the approval of an additional $ 100 million repurchase authorization in february of this year , which represents our current availability .", "regarding capital allocation strategy , our immediate priority is to accomplish the substantial task of reinventorying , then invest in the business and continue to return cash to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases .", "capital expenditures were $ 19 million , including our new headquarters , and depreciation and amortization was $ 11 million .", "we opened two stores and closed 11 during the fourth quarter to end the quarter with 1,425 total stores .", "as we look toward fiscal year ' 23 guidance , we are excited about the year ahead and the continued momentum of our business .", "but we recognize that we are faced with supply chain delivery delays , increased product , and logistics costs and the lapping of significant stimulus last year in the first half .", "regarding supply chain delays , we expect inventories to normalize late q2 to early q3 .", "in addition , we expect to experience wage pressures throughout the year .", "after considering these factors , we expect fiscal year ' 23 sales to grow 2 % to 4 % .", "for adjusted earnings per share , we expect a range of $ 7 to $ 7.75 per share with our best current expectation that earnings per share will be near the midpoint of the range .", "note that our full year guidance does not anticipate further significant supply chain disruptions or a more rapid escalation of inflation or geopolitical conflicts .", "regarding our individual businesses , for journeys , we expect first - half sales to be below comparable fiscal year ' 22 levels since journeys benefited considerably from stimulus last year .", "we then expect growth in the back half as we assume inventories will normalize to pre-pandemic levels and would benefit from further price increases .", "for schuh , we expect growth for the year driven by more normalized store openings .", "for j&m , we expect to return to pre-pandemic sales levels , and we expect growth for licensed brands as well .", "regarding gross margins , we expect gross margin rates to come down versus last year by roughly 40 to 50 basis points due mainly to increased markdown activity in the quarters in which markdowns normally occur as compared to essentially no promotional activity last year .", "we expect adjusted sg&a as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the range of 10 to 40 basis points .", "this is driven by leverage from reduced performance - based compensation being offset by anniversarying significant onetime rent abatements , primarily at schuh , and selling salary wage pressure .", "in addition , we will have increased marketing investments to drive our business forward .", "our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases for the fiscal year , which results in fiscal ' 23 average shares outstanding of approximately 13.4 million , but we can repurchase opportunistically with availability under our most recent authorization .", "furthermore , we expect the tax rate to be approximately 28 % .", "in summary , this all results in expected operating margin below fiscal year ' 22 , which beyond cost pressures , in large part , is due to a difficult first quarter and our belief that factors that led to such a strong full - price selling environment will not be sustained .", "while we typically do n't provide quarterly guidance , i want to provide some perspective on q1 .", "as i said , we are lapping the benefits of fiscal year ' 22 stimulus , while at the same time experiencing delivery delays .", "as a result , we expect q1 sales to be below last year , which is the main driver of a good amount of sg&a deleverage in the quarter .", "we are also anniversarying some onetime pickups like rent abatements in q1 last year .", "regarding gross margin , increased air freight logistics costs are driving pressure , particularly at j&m .", "the good news is we expect overall gross margin to be just under last year 's levels .", "with all of this , we expect a small loss in the quarter even as first - half earnings return more to a pre-pandemic cadence .", "also , it is worth noting for q1 , we expect to incur a small amount of tax expense due to our inability to recognize tax credits for our international operations .", "the results tom detailed clearly demonstrate that our footwear -

mall locations , and we 're very pleased with the early sales and four - wall results .", "as such , we are expanding our portfolio of journeys ' non-mall locations and opening up to 30 new locations this year .", "tools like our new real estate analytics platform will allow us to optimize our site selection as we build out this footprint .", "at schuh , we are opening a new distribution center in ireland to better support omnichannel sales there .", "with this new center , we will also increase the efficiency of our irish operations , while reducing costs resulting from new duties imposed post -
