than - normal staff utilization in the comparable prior year period .", "top - line performance for the quarter was in line with our expectations .", "as a reminder , we forecast constrained low single - digit top - line growth in the first half of the year , driven by four dynamics : first , the need to ramp up on contracts and hiring ; second , a more normalized utilization rate in the first half of this fiscal year compared to the high staff utilization in the first half of fiscal year 2021 , which we believe to be worth roughly 300 basis points of growth .", "third , high pto balances coming into the fiscal year with an expectation that our employees will take more time off ; and fourth , minor timing differences in our costing of labor , resulting from implementation of our new financial system .", "as we noted before , we expect growth to accelerate throughout the year .", "now let me step through performance at the market level .", "in defense , revenue grew 4.4 % , with strong growth in revenue ex billable expenses , partially offset by significant materials purchases in the prior year period .", "in civil , revenue grew 6 % , led by strong performance in our health business and the addition of liberty .", "we expect momentum to build throughout the year .", "as more administration priorities ramp up and we continue to capture opportunities , building on our strong win rates .", "revenue from our intelligence business declined 6.4 % this quarter .", "revenue ex-billable expenses grew in line with our expectations , but were more than offset at the top -

related costs noted were primarily driven by operating performance and a lower share count in this quarter due to our share repurchase program .", "turning to cash , cash flow from operations was negative $ 11 million in the first quarter .", "this decline was driven primarily by lower collections largely attributable to timing around receivables associated with the integration of our new enterprise financial system .", "as our employees and clients adapt to the new invoicing system , we expect to return to a more typical collections cadence over the coming months .", "operating cash flow was negatively impacted by approximately $ 67 million of transaction costs paid in the first quarter , which includes approximately $ 56 million of cash payment at closing of the liberty acquisition .", "these cash payments represent a reallocation of a portion of the overall $ 725 million purchase price prior to adjustments from investing cash flows into operating cash flows .", "capital expenditures for the quarter were $ 9 million , down $ 11 million from the prior year period , driven primarily by lower facility expenses .", "we still expect capital expenditures to land within our forecast range for the year .", "during the quarter , we issued $ 500 million of 4 % senior notes due 2029 .", "additionally , we extended the maturity of our term loan a and revolving credit facility to 2026 and increased the size of our revolver by $ 500 million to $ 1 billion of total capacity .", "those moves are in support of our disciplined capital deployment strategy .", "we will continue to use our balance sheet as a strategic asset .", "during the quarter , we paid out $ 52 million for our quarterly dividend and repurchased $ 111 million worth of shares at an average price of $ 83.91 per share .", "in total , including the close of the liberty acquisition , we deployed $ 889 million .", "today , we are announcing that our board has approved a regular dividend of $ 0.37 per share , payable on august 31st to stockholders of record on august 16th .", "as our actions this quarter demonstrate , we remain committed to preserving and maximizing shareholder value through a disciplined balanced capital allocation posture .", "please move to slide seven .", "today , we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2022 guidance .", "as we discussed last quarter , the first half , second half dynamics we laid out are still the guiding framework for our full -
