quarter operating income decreased to 10 % due to lower sales volume and a $ 42 million unfavorable eac adjustment on the f - 35 program .", "the adjustment was driven by labor - related production inefficiencies , reflecting covid -

adjusted earnings per share guidance .", "with this latest increase , our 2021 earnings per share guidance is up by about $ 2 since our initial guidance in the beginning of the year .", "before we move to 2022 , i wanted to give you an update on our cash performance .", "year to date , we 've generated over $ 2.1 billion of transaction - adjusted free cash flow , up 15 % compared to 2020 , and we ended the quarter with over $ 4 billion in cash on the balance sheet .", "keep in mind that we have a roughly $ 200 million payroll tax payment in q4 from the cares act legislation with the second similar payment in 2022 .", "additionally , we expect to pay the balance of our transaction - related tax from the it services divestiture in the fourth quarter .", "our healthy cash position has enabled us to repurchase over $ 2.7 billion of stock so far this year , on track with our full - year target of $ 3 billion or more .", "as we look ahead to 2022 , on slide 12 , our outlook is based on the same set of assumptions that we described for 2021 guidance regarding the covid environment and vaccine mandate .", "it also assumes that the continuing resolution does not extend beyond 2021 .", "and like our 2021 guidance , it assumes that we do not experience a breach of the debt ceiling .", "we expect space to be our fastest - growing segment again in 2022 , driven by gbsd , ngi , and several restricted efforts as they continue to ramp .", "mission systems and defense systems should also produce organic growth .", "regarding aeronautics systems , after several years of strong growth , our latest 2021 sales guidance calls for a mid-single - digit decline , and we see that trend continuing in 2022 .", "we 've talked in recent quarters about the headwinds in our hale portfolio .", "we 're also projecting lower sales on jstars , f - 18 , as well as our restricted portfolio .", "looking further to the future , it 's an exciting decade for defense aerospace .", "rapidly evolving threats are spurring a new wave of autonomous vehicle and sixth - generation fighter development .", "so , the opportunity set in as remains solid , and we will continue to invest in the cutting - edge technologies that allow our customers to stay ahead of the threat environment .", "altogether , we currently expect 2022 sales at the company level to reflect continued organic growth .", "looking at segment margin , we expect the strong results we 've demonstrated in 2021 to continue in 2022 with excellent program performance offsetting a portion of the 20 to 30 basis point benefit we generated from pension - related overhead rate changes in q1 of 2021 .", "while we project higher sales and strong segment operating margin , we expect transaction - adjusted earnings per share to be down next year as a result of several nonoperational headwinds .", "lower cas pension recoveries and higher corporate unallocated expenses are currently projected to create an earnings per share headwind next year of more than $ 2 .", "for fas pension , our outlook for 2022 will depend on our updated actuarial assumptions , including discount rates and plan asset returns , which we will determine at the end of the year .", "earnings per share driven from sales growth , strong operating margin performance , and lower share count will help to offset these nonoperational items .", "next , i 'd like to spend a moment discussing cash .", "we expect relatively stable cash flow at the program level in 2022 , but there are a few temporal items that should be factored into the year - over - year comparison of overall free cash flow .", "first is lower cas pension recoveries .", "as you can see on slide 13 , our cas recoveries are currently expected to be lower by $ 350 million next year .", "the second is cash taxes .", "excluding the impact of the it services transaction , we expect cash taxes to be modestly higher next year .", "in addition , as we 've noted in the past , current tax law would require companies to amortize r&d costs over five years , starting in 2022 , which would increase our cash taxes by around $ 1 billion next year and smaller amounts in subsequent years .", "there continues to be uncertainty in the tax environment with potential new legislation that could change the r&d amortization provision and other provisions .", "we will provide updates on each of these items on our january call .", "taking all of these cash flow factors into consideration , we would expect to decline in 2022 transaction -
