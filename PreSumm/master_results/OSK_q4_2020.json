over - year sales decline to deliver an impressive 8.5 % full year adjusted operating margin .", "our fire & emergency segment delivered two consecutive quarters of record adjusted operating margin percentages to end the year .", "our commercial segment posted a decade -

over - year sales .", "we are early in our discussions with our rental company customers , and we expect to gain more clarity on the second half of the year before our next earnings call .", "finally , just as we discussed last quarter , china 's economy continues to recover , which we believe offers an opportunity for double - digit sales growth in the region for the foreseeable future .", "our defense segment performed well in the quarter but has been dealing with workforce availability issues that i mentioned earlier as the pandemic is having a notable effect on our ability to schedule people and production .", "despite these challenges , which we experienced more intensively late in the fourth quarter and continued to experience earlier this month , our operations teams have delivered solid results for our u.s. government customer and grew revenues in the year by more than 11 % .", "our successful ramp -

over - year adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter despite lower revenues .", "our commercial team posted its highest full year adjusted operating income margin in more than a decade .", "this is particularly impressive , given the market impacts from covid when construction was halted in many areas of the country and shelter - in - place restrictions temporarily reduced demand for waste collection at businesses earlier in the year .", "much of our recent success stems from simplification efforts and disciplined cost management as well as the ramp - up of our new s - series 2.0 front discharge concrete mixer , which is driving a lot of excitement and helping us win new customers .", "on our last call , we announced restructuring plans to transfer rear discharge concrete mixer production from minnesota to ontario , canada as the team simplifies the business with a focused factory approach .", "i 'm pleased to report that the transition is progressing according to schedule , and we anticipate a successful completion over the next several months .", "we believe this will put us in a prime position to drive sustained margin improvements .", "before i leave this segment , i want to mention our commitment to electrification as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide our customers with options as they plan their fleets .", "early in the fourth quarter , there were numerous announcements of plans for electric rcvs in the u.s. market by some companies .", "we are proud to be working on electrification solutions across all of our businesses at oshkosh .", "this is particularly true for rcvs as we are partnering with a chassis oem to deliver five electric rcv units to be used in boise , idaho in the summer of 2021 .", "i 'd like to close with a comment about the culture and positive mindset we see from the team at commercial .", "they have been working very hard driving business and operational improvements , and their efforts and dedication to task are second to none and we can see it in our results .", "this wraps it up for our business segments .", "strong execution allowed us to deliver 19 % adjusted decremental margins on a consolidated basis and 23 % adjusted decremental margins at access equipment in the fourth quarter .", "consolidated net sales for the quarter were $ 1.8 billion , down 18.7 % from the prior year quarter .", "a 39 % decrease in access equipment segment sales was the primary driver of the decrease .", "access equipment sales were negatively impacted by lower customer demand , primarily as a result of covid - 19 .", "as john mentioned , our customers remain cautious with equipment purchases in light of uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and associated softness in nonresidential construction activity .", "consolidated adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $ 124.1 million or 7 % of sales compared to $ 203.1 million or 9.2 % of sales in the prior year quarter .", "access equipment segment adjusted operating income declined on lower sales and unfavorable manufacturing absorption as a result of planned shutdowns during the quarter , offset in part by the benefit of covid - 19 - related temporary cost reduction actions .", "defense segment adjusted operating income increased as a result of improved product mix and higher sales volume , partially offset by less favorable cumulative contract adjustments and higher engineering and proposal spending in the current year quarter .", "fire & emergency segment operating income increased in the current year quarter as a result of improved price cost dynamics and improved absorption , offset in part by lower sales volume .", "and commercial segment fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased due to lower spending in response to the covid -

19 pandemic has continued to drive uncertainty in the cadence of customer demand in both our access equipment and commercial segments .", "conversely , strong backlogs in our defense and fire & emergency segments provide good visibility well into 2021 .", "however , as john mentioned earlier , recent spikes in covid - 19 infection rates are creating workforce availability and supply chain issues , particularly in wisconsin , where a significant portion of the production occurs for our defense and fire & emergency segments .", "the situation is causing production and labor efficiency risks for these two segments and is also likely to impact final truck inspections by customers in the fire & emergency segment .", "taking these factors into account , including the ongoing uncertainty of the pandemic , we 're not in a position to provide quantitative expectations for 2021 at this time .", "we are actively engaged in discussions with our key customers in the access equipment and commercial segments to understand the requirements for 2021 , but we do expect softer year - over - year demand in the first half of 2021 compared to 2020 .", "demand for access equipment remains uncertain for the second half of the year , but we expect to have better clarity during the first quarter earnings call as we gain further insight into the trajectory of the pandemic and our customer requirements for 2021 .", "at access equipment , we are implementing 2 - week production shutdowns per month in the united states in the first quarter of 2021 to better align production with customer requirements .", "in the second quarter of 2020 , we implemented decisive actions which reduced our 2020 pre-tax cost by approximately $ 120 million .", "the reductions were evenly split between three areas : first , salary reductions and furloughs ; second , incentive compensation ; and third , project travel and other discretionary spending .", "as we previously discussed , these cost reductions were largely temporary in nature , and we expect them to return to our expense run rate in 2021 .", "additionally , we discussed permanent cost reduction actions during our last earnings call in the access equipment and commercial segments totaling $ 30 million to $ 35 million once complete .", "we expect these actions will benefit 2021 by approximately $ 20 million .", "recently , we implemented additional permanent cost reductions totaling $ 15 million for 2021 , which reduced corporate and segment operating expenses .", "so we expect to benefit from a total of $ 35 million of permanent cost reductions in 2021 , growing to $ 45 million to $ 50 million by 2022 .", "return of costs that drove the temporary cost reductions in 2020 will be a headwind to margins in 2021 .", "however , we are continuing to manage our business in a disciplined manner and will respond to the ongoing uncertainty with our playbooks .", "our balance sheet remains strong with available liquidity of approximately $ 1.4 billion , consisting of cash of approximately $ 600 million and availability under our revolving line of credit of approximately $ 800 million .", "we expect a modest increase in capital expenditures to approximately $ 120 million in 2021 .", "while we are not providing quantitative financial expectations today , we expect to provide them later in the year .", "we just completed the year in which we delivered nearly $ 5 of adjusted earnings per share in the midst of a global pandemic , and we believe we are in a great position moving into 2021 with our strong balance sheet and cash position .", "our defense and fire & emergency backlogs provide visibility well into 2021 , and we took aggressive actions early during the pandemic to lower our costs .", "our culture at oshkosh is strong , and we have an outstanding group of leaders and team members who have effectively managed production and supply chain disruptions and kept oshkosh on a positive path since the pandemic began .", "we can't let up as the threat is still with us , but i 'm reassured by the strength and resilience of our people and believe we will deliver solid sales and earnings performance over the long term ."], "summary_gold": "q4 adjusted earnings per share $ 1.30 excluding items .<q>compname announces 10 percent increase in quarterly cash dividend to $ 0.33 per share .<q>not providing a quantitative outlook for fiscal 2021 .<q>consolidated net sales in q4 of fiscal 2020 decreased 18.7 percent to $ 1.78 billion .", "summary_pred": "proud oshkosh team members and their commitment to our strong culture allowed us to overcome significant headwinds this past year , including uncertain customer demand , supplier delivery interruptions , workforce availability issues and many others .<q>we 've talked about it before but it bears repeating , our people -
