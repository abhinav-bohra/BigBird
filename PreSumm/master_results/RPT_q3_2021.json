quality acquisitions across all three of our strategic investment platforms , bringing our gross acquisition volume to $ 500 million in 2021 .", "we continue to see strong demand for space in our centers and signed a number of key leases with well -

time shift in our mix not only improves our geographic diversification but also increases our visibility with retailers , brokers and other stakeholders , which is leading to increased deal flow on both the leasing and acquisition fronts .", "to support our data -

quality shopping centers , where cap rates for grocery - anchored centers in top u.s. metros are down approximately 50 basis points over the past few months .", "as a result , we believe the $ 500 million of acquisitions that we closed on so far could be up as much as 10 % relative to our transacted prices .", "despite the recent cap rate compression , our three investment platforms provide us a competitive advantage to acquire at higher returns , allowing us to remain active on the acquisition front in our target markets .", "we continue to work tirelessly , sourcing additional acquisitions , focusing primarily on off -

credit essential tenancy .", "this quarter , we signed a lease with a new investment - grade grocer at our crofton centre in baltimore , which is replacing a shoppers food warehouse .", "in october , we signed an expansion lease with publix at the crossroads in palm beach .", "this will be a brand -

down restaurant at promenade at pleasant hill just outside of atlanta , swapping a high - covid - risk tenant for an essential tenant at a mid-20 % spread to the old brand .", "not only were we able to reduce tenant risk , but we were able to do so at attractive economics .", "lastly , we signed a new deal for a ferguson gallery showroom at providence marketplace in the nashville market .", "this will be ferguson 's first showroom in nashville , which we think will be a premier destination for residents to access the latest concepts in quality home fixtures and appliances .", "with only five to six ferguson showroom openings in a typical year , we think this deal is a testament to the strength of our center .", "for those of you that are not familiar with ferguson , they are a $ 34 billion market cap , bbb + -

price retail as well as several national small shop deals .", "notably , we have seen a major pickup in demand in detroit over the past few quarters and are in negotiations on over half a dozen grocery deals and another eight to 10 box leases with discount apparel , pet , outdoor recreation and homegood retailers .", "today , i 'll discuss our third quarter results , provide an update on our balance sheet and end with commentary on our increased guidance .", "third quarter operating ffo per share of $ 0.27 was up $ 0.05 over last quarter primarily due to about $ 0.04 of higher noi from acquisitions , $ 0.01 from lower rent not probable of collection and about $ 0.01 from higher lease termination fees , partially offset by lower straight - line rent .", "the better - than - expected rent not probable of collection was primarily driven by the reversal of a prior period reserve following an unplanned payment from a theater tenant .", "as we look ahead , we expect bad debt to continue to moderate as our collection rate tracks toward pre-covid levels .", "notably , our collection rate for the third quarter was 98 % as of the end of october .", "as brian mentioned , our operational performance in the quarter remained strong .", "we signed 52 leases totaling 280,000 square feet at a blended comparable releasing spread of 8.2 % , including a 5.2 % renewal and 16 % new lease spread .", "our renewal spread is the highest level it 's been in over a year , and along with the continued strength of our new leasing spreads , is reflective of the increasing demand for our centers and the embedded mark - to - market opportunity within our portfolio .", "these spreads are on a cash basis .", "they do n't capture future contractual rent steps , which were 160 basis points for the leases signed during the quarter .", "leasing activity in the third quarter pushed our signed not opened balance to $ 3.8 million , up 19 % over last quarter 's $ 3.2 million backlog , which we expect to open over the next 15 months .", "on the remerchandising and outlet front , we delivered two projects totaling $ 3.3 million during the quarter at almost a 12 % yield , which was ahead of budget .", "we also added one new project , ferguson gallery showroom at providence marketplace in nashville , totaling $ 1.3 million at an expected yield in the 20 % to 22 % range .", "this brings the active remerchandising and outlet project total to $ 14 million with expected yields in the 10 % to 12 % range .", "we are in active negotiations on a number of other pipeline deals totaling about $ 30 million with strong box demand in boston , florida and detroit .", "turning to the balance sheet .", "we ended the third quarter with net debt to annualized adjusted ebitda of 6.8 times , down from seven times last quarter .", "this is a bit better than expected as a result of the $ 40 million raised through our atm and due to better noi performance .", "we continue to expect our leverage to fall toward our target range of 5.5 to 6.5 times as bad debt and occupancy normalize to pre-covid levels .", "despite the heavy level of acquisition activity in the quarter , our liquidity remains strong .", "we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of approximately $ 10 million and have $ 295 million available on our unsecured line of credit .", "we expect to repay the vast majority of the outstanding balance on the line of credit by the end of the year or shortly thereafter .", "one of the core tenets of our balance sheet strategy , in addition to managing overall leverage , is to proactively address our pending debt maturities .", "during the fourth quarter , we expect to refinance $ 177 million of debt .", "included in this amount are all of our private placement notes that mature in 2023 and 2024 and our bridgewater mortgage that matures in 2022 .", "we expect to use proceeds from our recent private placement of unsecured notes totaling $ 130 million , our share of expected proceeds from mortgages placed on r2g assets that we locked rate on totaling $ 15 million and proceeds from the sale of market plaza totaling $ 30 million to fund these debt repayments .", "following all this activity , we will have reduced debt maturities through 2024 to just 16 % of our debt stack .", "over the next two quarters , we also expect to generate $ 96 million in disposition proceeds from parcel sales to rgmz , including sales from our recently acquired northborough and newnan pavilion assets and the remaining seed portfolio sales .", "these proceeds will effectively be used to fund our share of the debt of acquisition of $ 68 million and to repay amounts outstanding on our revolving line of credit .", "moving to our increased guidance for 2021 .", "we initiated a new range for operating ffo of $ 0.90 to $ 0.94 per share , which is up $ 0.02 or 2 % over prior guidance .", "the primary drivers of the upside were $ 0.01 from a prior period bad debt reversal and about another $ 0.01 of lease termination fees recognized in the third quarter .", "the key factors that would drive results to the high or low end of the range are the timing of closing of the net lease parcel sales and bad debt reserves .", "in addition , our incentive compensation is not finalized until the fourth quarter , which could result in an uptick in g -

time lease termination fee .", "in addition , relative to our third quarter results , 2022 g - and - a is expected to increase by approximately $ 0.01 per quarter related to an uptick in travel - related expenses , similar to 2019 levels , and continued investments in talent to support our growth platforms .", "our framework can be summarized with three questions .", "does the property improve our overall portfolio quality ?", "how much future value -
