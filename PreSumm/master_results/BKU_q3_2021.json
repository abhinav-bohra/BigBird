over - quarter .", "loan growth was ready this quarter , not commercial and we seen more commercial growth as opposed to residential growth we likely would have seen some uptick in that nim .", "the yield on loans decreased to 3.45 % from 3.59 % last quarter , recognition of ppp fees , the differential in that quarter - over - quarter if it had n't been for that the yield on loans would have declined by only 6 basis points for the quarter and most of that 6 basis points really was attributable to the shift from residential to -- from commercial to residential .", "eventually , obviously , we believe that level will swing back the other way .", "i know you 've been asking me , so i 'll answer you now .", "there are still $ 8.1 million worth of deferred fees on ppp loans remaining to be recognized almost all of that $ 8 million relates to the second draw program .", "so i do n't really think we 'll see much of that in the fourth quarter .", "yield on securities declined from 1.56 % to 1.49 % and accelerated prepayments , which we think some day has to come to an end but keeps not coming to an end .", "it just keeps getting faster on that mortgage - backed securities accounted for almost all of that quarterly decline in yields .", "the total cost of deposits declined by 5 basis points quarter - over - quarter .", "the cost of interest bearing deposit is down 6 basis points .", "and our best expectation right now is that nim would remain relatively stable over the fourth quarter , but obviously there are things that contribute to that that are a little bit difficult for us to predict , but that 's our best expectation as of now .", "and we can comfortably say the cost of deposits will continue to grow for at least to one quarter .", "with respect to the allowance and the provision , overall , the provision for credit losses for the quarter was a recovery of $ 11.8 million .", "slide 9 through 11 of our deck provide further details on the acl .", "the acl declined from 77 basis points to 70 basis points over the course of the quarter .", "most significant drivers to that change , $ 2.3 million decrease related to the economic forecast .", "this is becoming less impactful than it has been in prior quarters , which is not surprising as things start to stabilize , a $ 4.5 million decrease due to charge - offs , another $ 3.7 million due to a variety of changes in the portfolio , including the mix of new production and ad bids [ phonetic ] , the further shift to loan segments with lower expected loss rates primarily residential impact on pds of an improving borrower financial performance , risk rating changes , etc , and a $ 5.9 million decrease in the amount of qualitative overlays and this is mainly just a shift things that are now being captured by the models .", "this last quarter , we did n't think the models were adequately capturing .", "the largest component of the reduction in the reserve with the cre portfolio .", "the cre model was particularly sensitive to unemployment , which improved this quarter and the commercial property forecast also improved , particularly for retail and multifamily , where we saw improving forecast in vacancy rates .", "there was also a reduction in criticized , classified pre-loans , which impacts the reserve .", "we also saw the resi reserve come down .", "this was caused by residential loans continuing to come off deferral and resuming payments and changes in the economic forecast related to unemployment and long - term interest rates also had an impact .", "remind you that almost 20 % of the resi both this government insured and actually carries no reserve .", "c&i reserves actually ticked up a little bit as a percentage of loans this quarter .", "with respect to risk rating migration , if you see -- you can see some details on this in slides 23 through 25 of our deck , the total criticized and classified commercial loans declined by $ 240 million this quarter , most of that within the substandard accruing category , which declined by $ 252 million .", "special mention ticked up a little an substandard non-accruing ticked down a little .", "total non-performing loans decreased $ 277 million this quarter from $ 293 million at june 30 .", "the decline in criticized and classified assets really occurred across pretty much all portfolio segments with the largest decline in cre .", "looking at other income and expense , there 's not really anything material to call out this quarter .", "on the year -
