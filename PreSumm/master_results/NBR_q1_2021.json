first quarter of 2020 , we delivered $ 8 million in free cash flow .", "our ebitda in that quarter was almost twice the ebitda of the first quarter of 2021 .", "this improvement in cash flow conversion as compared to a year ago reflects the stain efforts and costs and capital discipline that will continue over the years to come .", "as in the past , the first quarter was marked by the semi-annual interest payments and a senior note of over $ 70 million and by approximately $ 25 million in several annual payments that we incur at the beginning of the year .", "these payments which will not recur during the remainder of the year include property and other taxes , as well as employee incentive bonuses .", "these outflows were offset by strong customer collections in the first quarter , including some catch up from last year end as well as by lower capex and higher asset sales .", "our capital expenditures of $ 40 million in the first quarter included $ 7.5 million in payments related to sanad newbuilds .", "to date , we have been awarded four rigs by saudi aramco .", "during the second quarter , we expect to incur $ 80 million in capex , of which 30 million will

million for this year assuming milestones are met .", "in january , sanad distributed a combined 100 million of the excess cash it had accumulated to its partners .", "half of that amount was paid to a nabors subsidiary , and the other half to saudi aramco .", "on a consolidated basis , the payment to saudi aramco partially offset the free cash flow generation .", "as a result , the net debt reduction for the quarter was limited to $ 6 million .", "nonetheless , with a standard distribution to nabors and other cash regenerated , we continue to reduce our total debt .", "during the quarter , we retired approximately 40 million in senior notes , including convertibles , which resulted in a 30 - meter reduction in our total debt as reported .", "we also reduce the amount of standing on a
