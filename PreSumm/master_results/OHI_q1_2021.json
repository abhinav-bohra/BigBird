term care setting .", "census will take time to rebuild , and reduction in expenses will be gradual over time , all while the ability to scale in place will be reduced with far less covid cases .", "specifically , as it relates to expenses , labor shortages continue to be a huge concern for our operator base .", "prepandemic operators were faced with shortages due to low unemployment rates .", "during the pandemic , the issue has been exacerbated by employees leaving the long - term care space , both permanently and temporarily , as the environment is understandably much tougher since the onset of covid and unemployment benefits have been increased substantially .", "this expected slow , long -

quarter census hitting a low of 80.4 % in early june .", "that said , their portfolio occupancy level had returned to 85.6 % in the month of november .", "census has plateaued at this level for the time being as covid -
