uncertainties that are described in the company 's 2020 10 - k and subsequent sec filings .", "given the impact of the covid - 19 pandemic had on our business in 2020 , we will also present certain comparisons of our operating results in 2021 to 2019 , which we believe , in many cases , provides useful context for our current year results .", "[ technical issues ] on our path to scaling direct ,

market for paid digital journalism and our unique opportunity to meet that demand .", "that milestone follows the second quarter with strong revenue and profit growth , modest net subscription additions and progress on our -- advancing our underlying model .", "total subscription revenue grew 16 % in the quarter , the largest year - on - year subscription revenue gain in more than a decade .", "advertising revenues surged compared with the same period last year .", "the combined strength in these two revenue streams more than offset cost growth , and as a result , we recorded $ 93 million in adjusted operating profit , a 78 % improvement compared to the same quarter in 2020 .", "we saw moderated growth in net subscription additions in the second quarter , which we expected given that q2 is traditionally our softest of the year , and we were comparing against last year 's historic results at the beginning of the covid crisis .", "we added 142,000 net digital subscriptions with roughly half in news and the balance in cooking and games .", "we continue to expect that our total annual net subscription additions will be in the range of 2019 , although that remains difficult to predict with precision .", "our advertising performance was better than expected , with total revenue up 66 % year - on - year .", "as with subscriptions , the biggest factor in the gain in advertising amortize up nearly 80 % year - on - year and more than 22 % over the same period in 2019 .", "it was also another strong quarter for demonstrating the breadth , reach and impact of our journalism with unparalleled coverage of the devastating events in south florida , the political crisis in haiti and the still surging pandemic .", "pulitzer prizes were announced in june and the times was the only news organization to win more than one this year .", "pulitzer writer wesley morris won the pulitzer for commentary for his urgent and moving essays exploring the intersection of race and culture .", "and for the seventh time in our history , the times won the pulitzer prize for public service , journalism 's highest honor , for our coronavirus beverage .", "this body of work is the quintessential example of the expansive journalism the times can uniquely deliver .", "more than 1,000 journalists contributed to our coronavirus reporting , as did many others across the company , including engineers , data scientists , product designers and product managers .", "the work of our data journalism team , in particular , is worth noting .", "the times launched an around - the - clock effort to track every known coronavirus case in the u.s. and made that data publicly available .", "that coverage continues to fill a vacuum that has helped local governments , healthcare workers , businesses and individuals better prepare through each stage of the pandemic and has also brought us new audiences who rely on and return to our products repeatedly .", "demonstrating the strength of our journalism across platforms and subject matters , in mid-july , the times was nominated for the primetime emmy award for best documentary for our film , framing britney spears .", "the film ignited intense scrutiny of court - ordered conservatorships and continues to resonate with audiences globally .", "we produced it as part of our new york times presents series , a partnership with fx that was recently extended .", "i 'll turn now to our underlying revenue drivers in the quarter and share some specifics about the work ahead .", "as we 've said in prior calls , we expect to feel the effects of comparing our results against last year 's heightened news cycle for the remainder of the year .", "and we believe that while the news cycle will continue to have significant effects on our subscription growth , we are increasing our control over the levers of the model .", "our audience in the second quarter was below the historic highs of 2020 , driven largely by declining engagement with the covid story domestically .", "but as we saw last quarter , our average weekly audience was larger than in the same period in 2019 and every prior period .", "for the second quarter in a row , we were also pleased to see readers engage across a broader range of storylines than they did last year .", "we view this as a positive leading indicator of future net subscription additions as we have seen that experiencing the breadth of our report correlates with paying and staying .", "we 're leaning into that breadth both within our core news experience and across our adjacent products like cooking , games and wirecutter , by experimenting more aggressively with programming to expose more of our audience to the full value of the times .", "with sustained strength relative to 2019 and prior years in overall audience and with more than 100 million registered users , we are also experimenting more aggressively and we believe more successfully on our customer journey and access model .", "and as our pace of new registrations continues to be healthy , we have now begun to focus even more on getting registered users to subscribe and to engage more deeply once they do .", "that experimentation with our access model has given us increasing insight into when our readers are ready to subscribe , which in turn is leading to higher conversion rates .", "as a result , our digital monthly net subscription additions have grown each month since lows in march .", "we believe we have additional room to optimize conversion as we strengthen engagement in key areas like newsletters and our growing body of live experiences .", "last quarter , we noted that the newest cohort of news subscriptions appear to be retaining slightly less well than in the past , which contributed to a small increase in overall churn .", "q2 domestic news churn was unchanged from the first quarter and remains at a comfortable level .", "while we experienced an uptick internationally in noncore markets , we believe our churn overall is generally at a healthy level .", "we also believe that our increased focus on subscriber engagement and on making the subscriber experience clearly superior to registered and anonymous experiences will help maintain healthy churn levels .", "and we remain confident in our overarching approach to graduating subscribers from promotional prices to step up and full prices .", "we continued in the last quarter to lay the groundwork for a more strategic bundled subscription offering that has the potential to be more widely appealing and uniquely valuable to millions of people in their daily lives .", "throughout the quarter , we ran tests on our all digital access bundle , which combines news , cooking and games .", "these tests demonstrated that there is meaningful demand for the bundle and that those who choose it are better at retaining than those who subscribe to only one product .", "building on these promising results , we plan to do more testing around pricing , positioning and marketing of the all digital access bundle in the second half of the year .", "and this fall , we plan to launch our paid subscription product for wirecutter and experiment further with audm , both of which over time have the potential to widen the appeal and value of a times bundle .", "given the opportunity we see , an addressable market of at least 100 million people who are expected to pay for english language journalism and a unique moment in which daily habits are up for grabs , we are continuing to invest in the value of our individual products and the broader bundle .", "that includes investing thoughtfully into our news operations to cover the most important stories of our time and to meet more news needs .", "it means investing into our adjacent products to meet a broader array of life needs as we have done with cooking and games , each of which is now closing in on one million subscriptions .", "and it means investing to build the underlying tech product experience and company culture required for us to scale .", "we believe these investments will enable us to grow our market share and also to build a larger and more profitable company over time .", "i 'll turn briefly now to the drivers of advertising growth .", "our ad business is no doubt benefiting from an advertising market recovery , but we also believe we 're seeing the effect of the groundwork we laid to build competitive advantages .", "those advantages include our robust first - party data targeting capabilities , our large and growing suite of hit podcasts and our ability to create unique multi-platform collaborations that help marketers launch new ideas and products into the world .", "now before i turn things over to roland , let me share an update on the company 's ongoing emphasis on an investment in building out a world - class digital product development team .", "as we focus on scaling our strategy of journalism worth paying for , our ability to attract , develop and retain top talent in areas well beyond journalism is paramount .", "this is especially the case in engineering , which is now one of our largest business side functions .", "jason joins our other highly talented times leaders who is steering our digital product development work to its next phase of growth .", "while subscription unit growth was modest in the quarter , substantial growth in both subscription and advertising revenues , which were a result of fundamental strength in the underlying business , delivered strong financial results , especially when compared with the muted results from the second quarter of 2020 .", "adjusted diluted earnings per share was $ 0.36 in the quarter , $ 0.18 higher than the prior year .", "we reported adjusted operating profit of approximately $ 93 million , higher than the same period in 2020 by $ 41 million and higher than 2019 by $ 37 million which is an important comparison point given the impact that the pandemic had on our 2020 results .", "we added 77,000 net new subscriptions to our core digital news product and 65,000 net new subscriptions to our stand - alone digital products for a total of 142,000 net new digital - only subscriptions .", "as of the end of the quarter , we had approximately 930,000 games subscriptions and approximately 830,000 cooking subscriptions .", "the international share of total new subscriptions remained at 18 % as of the end of the quarter .", "total subscription revenues increased 15.7 % in the quarter .", "as meredith said , this is the highest rate of subscription revenue growth in well over a decade , with digital - only subscription revenue growing more than 30 % to $ 190 million .", "digital - only subscription revenue grew as a result of the large number of new subscriptions we have added in the past year , continued strength and retention of the $ 1 per week promotional subscriptions who graduated to higher prices , and finally , the positive impact from our digital subscription price increase , which began late in the first quarter of 2020 .", "digital news subscription arpu for the quarter increased approximately one percentage point compared to the prior year and nearly five percentage points compared to the prior quarter , which marks the first quarter with a positive year - over - year result since 2013 .", "this improvement was primarily a result of subscriptions graduating from their introductory price to either a full price or an intermediate step up price in the quarter as well as the continued benefit from price increases on our more tenured full price subscriptions .", "arpu related solely to domestic news subscriptions increased approximately 1.5 percentage points versus the prior year and nearly five percentage points versus the prior quarter .", "we continue to expect to demonstrate pricing power throughout 2021 as the impact from subscriptions graduating from discounted promotions and the price increase on tenured digital subscription continues to provide a tailwind to digital news arpu throughout the year .", "print subscription revenues increased more than 1 % as home delivery revenues benefited from the first quarter price increase , which more than offset declines in subscription volume .", "total daily circulation declined 4.5 % in the quarter compared with prior year , while sunday circulation declined approximately 1 % , which represents a significant improvement in the recent trend following the steep declines experienced as a result of the widespread business closures and a decrease in commuting of travel as a result of the pandemic .", "as compared with 2019 , print subscription revenues declined 5.5 % , as single - copy and international bulk sale copy declined , while revenue from domestic home delivery subscriptions was flat .", "total advertising revenues increased more than 66 % in the quarter as digital advertising grew nearly 80 % , while print advertising increased by 48 % , largely as a result of the impact of the comparison to weak advertising revenues in the second quarter of 2020 caused by reduced advertising spending during the covid - 19 pandemic .", "digital advertising was also growing by our proprietary first - party targeted ad products and expanded audio product portfolio .", "versus 2019 , digital advertising grew 22 % as a result of higher direct sold advertising , including traditional display and audio .", "second quarter digital advertising revenue exceeded the guidance we gave in early may , largely as a result of better - than - expected performance from larger technology and financial services advertisers spending heavily on our targeted and audio products .", "meanwhile , print advertising increased 48 % as compared with 2020 , primarily driven by growth in the luxury , media , technology and entertainment categories .", "despite this impressive level of year - on - year growth , print advertising revenue lagged 2019 by 33 % .", "other revenues increased nearly 9 % compared with the prior year to $ 47 million , primarily as a result of an increase in wirecutter affiliate referral revenue .", "it 's worth noting that midway through the second quarter , we began printing the wall street journal , barron 's and the new york post out of our college point production facility significantly increasing utilization of the company 's wholly owned printing plant .", "adjusted operating costs were higher in the quarter by approximately 15 % as compared with 2020 and 6.5 % higher than 2019 .", "cost of revenue increased approximately 9 % as a result of growth in the number of newsrooms , games , cooking and audio employees , other costs associated with audio content , a higher incentive compensation accrual and higher subscriber servicing and digital content delivery costs .", "this was partially offset by lower print production and distribution expenses .", "sales and marketing costs increased approximately 35 % , driven primarily by higher media expenses , which has been reduced dramatically last year in light of the historically strong organic subscription demand experienced in the early months of the covid - 19 pandemic .", "when compared to 2019 , sales and marketing costs decreased 14 % as a result of lower advertising sales costs , partially attributable to a workforce reduction that we enacted in the second quarter of 2020 , as well as lower media expenses .", "media expenses in 2021 was 14 % lower than in 2019 .", "it 's worth noting that third quarter 2020 media expenses were also significantly favorable compared to 2019 , which will make for another difficult comparison in the third quarter of 2021 .", "product development costs increased by approximately 28 % , largely due to growth in the number of engineers employed and a higher incentive compensation accrual than we had recorded in the second quarter of 2020 .", "i 'll again reiterate that we plan to continue adding to head count in this area over the foreseeable future , as we expect to continue leaning into investments in product development as well as on our core news and stand - alone products to drive growth .", "general and administrative costs increased by 6 % .", "and when you control for severance and multiemployer pension withdrawal obligation costs , g&a costs would have increased by 19 % , largely due to increased head count in support of employee growth in other areas , higher outside services and a higher incentive compensation accrual .", "our second quarter cost growth came in at the low end of the guidance we issued on our first quarter call in early may , largely as a result of slower - than - expected hiring for our growth initiatives in a tight labor market .", "we had one special item in the quarter and nearly $ 4 million charge resulting from the early termination of one of our tenant 's leases in our headquarters building , as we add space to accommodate growing head count to support our growth initiatives .", "our effective tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25 % .", "as we 've said previously , we expect our tax rate to be approximately 27 % on every dollar of marginal income we record with significant variability around the quarterly effective rate .", "moving to the balance sheet , our cash and marketable securities balance ended the quarter at $ 947 million , an increase of $ 56 million compared to the first quarter of 2021 .", "company remains debt - free with a $ 250 million revolving line of credit available .", "now let me conclude with our outlook for the third quarter of 2021 .", "total subscription revenues are expected to increase approximately 13 % to 15 % compared with the third quarter of 2020 with digital - only subscription revenue expected to increase approximately 25 % to 30 % .", "overall advertising revenues are expected to increase approximately 30 % to 35 % compared with the third quarter of 2020 and digital advertising revenues are expected to increase approximately 40 % to 45 % .", "other revenues are expected to increase approximately 5 % .", "both operating costs and adjusted operating costs are expected to increase approximately 18 % to 20 % compared with the third quarter of 2020 as we continue investment into the drivers of digital subscription growth and comp against another quarter of low spending last year as a result of
