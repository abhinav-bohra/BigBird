over - year .", "those growth rates are dramatic given the strength of our performance last year and all that has transpired this year to impact our business model , a pullback in credit to office , retail and hospitality assets , a prolonged pause in the property sales market , remote work and a dramatic drop in interest rates , which has diminished the returns we earn on escrow deposits and balance sheet loans .", "yet even with those headwinds , our team has found ways to continue growing and gaining market share .", "as shown on slide four , on a year -

year increase in revenue during the quarter to $ 247 million and 19 % growth in diluted earnings per share to $ 1.66 .", "in addition , return on equity for the quarter was 20 % , up from 18 % last year , while operating margin held steady at 28 % .", "q3 adjusted ebitda was $ 45.2 million , down from $ 54.5 million in q3 of last year .", "there is significant upside to ebitda in 2021 and beyond as the cash -

generating businesses can provide , when they are operating with their full capacity as we saw in the first quarter of this year .", "and finally , while we expect interest rates to remain low in the near term , any future increase in short - term rates will have a positive impact on the interest income we earned from our now $ 2.8 billion of escrow deposits , a balance we expect will continue growing as our overall servicing portfolio grows .", "we ended the quarter with close to $ 300 million of cash on the balance sheet , further bolstering our already strong liquidity .", "during the quarter , we repurchased 254,000 shares at an average price of $ 53.12 per share , utilizing $ 13.5 million of our $ 50 million authorization .", "we felt that repurchasing stock at these levels presented a very attractive return for our shareholders .", "based on our future outlook for the business , including our expectations for continued strong earnings growth , the current exceptional credit performance of our portfolio and the significant reserves we 've already taken to cover any future losses .", "we currently have $ 26 million available for share repurchases to use between now and early february of next year .", "and yesterday , our board of directors approved a dividend of $ 0.36 per share payable to shareholders of record as of november 13 .", "i think it is important to point out that many companies have had to eliminate or significantly reduce their dividends during this crisis , while we have been able to maintain ours due to the underlying strength of our business model .", "we fully expect to increase the dividend rate next quarter as we have done each year since we instituted it in 2018 .", "we remain active in seeking out growth opportunities in the market , including recruiting and m&a opportunities as our financial performance and liquidity position give us the ability to take an offensive stance that will let us set us up for continued growth in the future .", "as i mentioned , we continue to see fantastic credit performance in the portfolio .", "at the end of the quarter , we had only one $ 6 million fannie mae loan still in forbearance .", "that is one loan in a portfolio of over 2,500 loans , which , by the way , we believe with our production volumes this year is now the largest fannie mae portfolio in the country .", "third quarter provision expense was $ 3.5 million and included a $ 2.4 million charge related to an increase to the reserve on the one loan in our interim loan portfolio that defaulted in the first quarter of last year .", "the remaining $ 1.1 million of the quarterly provision expense was driven by the growth in the at - risk portfolio during q3 as we did not make any changes to our loan loss assumptions during the quarter .", "there were no other delinquent loans in our at - risk servicing or interim loan portfolios at the end of september .", "this performance is a testament to the durability of the agency model and the strength of multifamily lending .", "as detailed on slide nine , in our portfolio of 5,345 fannie , freddie and hud loans , we had only nine loans in forbearance at september 30 or 0.2 % of the entire agency portfolio .", "and as i noted earlier , we only have credit risk on one of those loans .", "we feel great about the performance of the portfolio so far , but it 's still too early to declare victory .", "the unemployment rate continues to remain at a high level , and the economy is not even close to performing at pre pandemic levels .", "we continue to believe that meaningful jobs gains are necessary to stabilize the economy before we can put credit in the rearview mirror .", "in the meantime , we continue to think the current reserve balance is sufficient to absorb any losses that may come through in the portfolio .", "we had an amazing first three quarters of the year and are carrying a lot of momentum into the fourth quarter .", "the pipeline looks great and includes a continued rebound in both debt brokerage and property sales volumes .", "after posting a gain on sale margin of 223 basis points in q3 , we expect the increase in debt brokerage volumes and continued strong agency originations to deliver a gain on sale margin in the range of 200 to 220 basis points in q4 .", "and with year - to - date earnings - per - share growth of 24 % , we are well on track to delivering double - digit earnings growth for the seventh year of our 10 years as a public company .", "our portfolio is performing extremely well .", "our transaction platform is taking market share from the competition , and we amassed a significant cash position , all of which gives us flexibility to both return capital to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and share buybacks and evaluate market opportunities that will position us for continued growth over the next several years .", "as borne out by the stats that willy went over , related to our historical performance relative to the s&p 600 financials , our business model consistently demonstrates that it is built to sustain market downturns due to our focus on multifamily , access to countercyclical capital , and the strong credit standards that underpin our servicing portfolio ; while our business also performs well when times are good as a result of our great people , strong brand and investments in growth in technology .", "as we close out on 2020 and look ahead , we will continue to leverage this winning formula to power our future success .", "our exceptional performance over the past several years and through the first three quarters of 2020 puts us at the doorstep of achieving almost all of the component parts of the five - year growth plan that we set out at the end of 2015 called vision 2020 .", "our long - standing mission has been to build the premier commercial real estate finance company in the united states .", "and as we have set ambitious growth objectives to bring us closer to achieving that goal , exceptional financial results have followed .", "the first part of vision 2020 was to grow our debt financing volume to over $ 30 billion by the end of 2020 .", "on a trailing 12 - month basis , we are now at $ 31.4 billion of debt financing and are projecting that we end 2020 at a similar annual run rate .", "as you can see on slide 11 , over the past five years , we have grown annual loan originations at a 14 % compound annual growth rate , and we believe we continue that growth trajectory , given the people , brand and technology we have built .", "as the right -
