year period .", "revenue of $ 256 million primarily reflects lower pos installation activity in europe , partially offset by growth in self - checkout hardware and higher software activity .", "both results came in as expected .", "the impact of the pandemic was more acute in this segment , pushing approximately $ 19 million of revenue out of the quarter .", "gross profit increased to $ 60 million , up 11 % in the quarter , and gross margin improved significantly to 23.4 % due to a favorable revenue mix from services software and self -

19 pandemic and related macroeconomic implications .", "this action has almost no impact on our expected cash interest payments of approximately $ 170 million because the incremental interest on the revolver will largely be offset by lower libor rates for other debt instruments .", "an additional $ 89 million reduction of cash is attributed to foreign currency headwinds experienced in the quarter , plus the effect of selling our 68 % stake in the german it outsourcing business called , portavis and one other pending transaction .", "with a cash balance of $ 549 million at the end of march , we believe we have adequate liquidity to fund the seasonal cash flows of our business and our dn now transformation program .", "on slide 14 , we highlight our debt maturities and leverage ratio .", "our contractual debt maturities of $ 98 million for 2020 and $ 26 million for 2021 are manageable under our current liquidity model .", "we continue to monitor the debt markets relative to our strategy to address our 2022 debt maturities .", "at the appropriate time , we will take steps to optimize our capital structure by reducing our weighted average cost of capital , lowering interest rates and extending maturities .", "to the right of the slide , we have provided our net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted ebitda ratio for the past five quarters .", "as you can see , we have steadily improved this metric and we are pleased to maintain the 4.4 times ratio in the first quarter as our adjusted ebitda gains offset the changes to net debt .", "this compares favorably to our bank covenant maximum of 7 times .", "our net debt on 31st march was approximately $ 1.9 billion .", "i will build upon gerrard 's comments about the financial resiliency of our business model and provide a few guideposts for understanding how we expect to perform under challenging macroeconomic conditions .", "for your convenience , we have provided selected financial results from 2019 , including revenue and gross margin for services , products and software .", "we expect our services business to be resilient during this time , with a mild impact to revenue .", "as previously disclosed , we expect to complete two divestitures in 2020 , which generated about $ 110 million of services revenue for the company in 2019 .", "one of these transactions closed in q1 , with the other expected to close in q2 , subject to customary closing conditions .", "additionally , the software we deliver for our customers is critical to their performance , and therefore , we expect a mild impact for covid -
