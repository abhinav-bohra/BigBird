store revenues grew 4.6 % compared to the prior year , the sixth consecutive quarter of positive same - store revenue growth .", "the improvement was primarily driven by an 8.7 % larger lease portfolio size entering the third quarter partially offset by a lower level of customer payment activity compared to the prior year .", "our same - store lease portfolio size continues to grow at a healthy pace ending the third quarter up 6.1 % compared to the prior year .", "we attribute this growth primarily to strong demand for our products , higher average ticket , the favorable impact of centralized lease decisioning and the residual impact of government stimulus on the portfolio .", "as discussed previously , our predictive lease decisioning engine is working very well and enables us to better match the customers ' lease payment with their financial position with the goal of helping more customers achieve ownership and lowering our overall cost to serve .", "in addition , our lease decisioning algorithms allow us to be flexible in responding to changes in the macroeconomic environment and to optimize outcomes that drive profitability .", "as of the end of the third quarter , more than 83 % of our total lease portfolio is comprised of lease agreements that were originated through our centralized decisioning platforms .", "this compares to approximately 60 % at the beginning of 2021 .", "as i mentioned last quarter , lease payment activity in 2021 has exceeded historical levels due to the government stimulus provided to our customer leading to higher lease renewal rates and lower write - offs as we saw in the third quarter and expect to see over the next three to four quarters , customer payment activity continues to normalize .", "because of investments we 've made in centralized decisioning and lease servicing technologies , we expect 2022 lease renewal rates to ultimately settle above pre-pandemic levels but below the level we expect for the full year 2021 .", "we also expect lease merchandise write -

month period ended september 30 , 2021 .", "lease revenues in the third quarter of this year also benefited by an increase in ticket size or monthly rent for agreement , that is offsetting the inflation we are experiencing in the cost of lease merchandise .", "on a same - store basis , lease and retail revenues increased 4.6 % in the third quarter compared to the prior year quarter .", "as douglas mentioned , this is our sixth consecutive positive quarter of same - store revenue growth .", "leases originated in both our e-commerce and in - store channels contributed to our revenue growth , which was primarily driven by a larger same - store lease portfolio size , partially offset by the expected lower customer payment activity in the quarter .", "more specifically , in the third quarter of this year , our customer lease renewal rate was 89.7 % , which was approximately 230 basis points higher than the 3 - year third quarter pre-pandemic average but was approximately 130 basis points lower than the third quarter of last year .", "for any period , the customer lease renewal rate is calculated by dividing the amount of customer payments recorded on an accrual basis as of the end of such period by the amount of total customer lease payments due for renewal during that period .", "as discussed on our last earnings call , the benefits to our customer from government stimulus programs declined in the third quarter and as expected , resulted in lower customer payment activity as compared to the prior year .", "we expect customer payment activity to continue to decline year - over - year for the next three or four quarters .", "and i will point out that a 100 basis point change up or down in customer lease renewal rates or write - offs on a $ 1.6 billion annual portfolio of total collectible customer lease payments results in a $ 16 million change in ebitda .", "additionally , we continue to expect that customer payment activity will benefit from our investments in centralized decisioning .", "we estimate that this technology has improved lease renewal rates by over 100 basis points compared to the pre-pandemic levels , while also materially improving the customer experience and simplifying the day - to - day activities at our stores .", "e-commerce revenues increased 13.3 % versus the third quarter of 2020 and represented 14.3 % of overall lease revenues compared to 13.1 % in the third quarter of the prior year .", "we continue to make investments in this important channel that we believe will continue to drive long -

offs .", "personnel costs increased $ 5.1 million in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the prior year , primarily due to higher wages in our stores , additional personnel to support our key strategic initiatives and higher stand - alone public company costs .", "additionally , personnel costs were lower - than - anticipated during the third quarter this year as staffing levels in our stores remain below our operational targets due to the current challenges in the us labor market for retail - based hourly employees .", "other operating expenses were relatively flat to the prior year period due to higher occupancy , shipping and handling costs , professional services and bank and credit card - related fees .", "these increases were partially offset by lower advertising costs in the third quarter of 2021 versus the prior year period .", "the provision for lease merchandise write - offs as a percentage of lease revenues and fees was 4.9 % for the three months ended september 30 , 2021 , compared to an all - time low of 2.4 % in the comparable period in 2020 .", "the increase in write - offs in the third quarter of this year compared to last year was primarily due to lower customer payment activity following several quarters where our customers received financial assistance in the form of government stimulus payments and supplemental federal unemployment benefits .", "this normalization in write - offs was partially offset by the continued favorable impact of our technology investments , which include decisioning algorithms and customer payment platforms as well as our team 's strong operational execution .", "as we discussed on prior earnings calls , we continue to expect that annual write - offs will be between 4 % to 5 % of lease revenues and fees .", "adjusted ebitda for the company was $ 53.6 million for the third quarter of 2021 compared with $ 64.3 million for the same period in 2020 , a decrease of $ 10.7 million or 16.6 % .", "as a percentage of revenues , adjusted ebitda margin was 11.9 % in the third quarter of 2021 compared to 14.6 % for the same period in 2020 .", "this expected decline in adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin was due to lower customer payment activity , higher lease merchandise write - offs and higher personnel costs compared to the prior year levels .", "on a non-gaap basis , diluted earnings per share were $ 0.83 in the third quarter of 2021 compared with non-gaap diluted earnings per share of $ 1.10 for the same quarter in 2020 .", "cash generated from operating activities was $ 30.2 million for the third quarter of 2021 , a decline of $ 92.6 million compared to the third quarter of 2020 .", "this decline was primarily due to incremental purchases of lease merchandise to meet increased customer demand and to mitigate the impact of anticipated supply chain challenges ahead of the upcoming holiday season .", "in addition , the cost of our lease merchandise was adversely impacted by inflationary pressure .", "during the third quarter , the company purchased approximately 1,333,000 shares of aaron 's common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $ 37.5 million and through a 10b5 -

store revenues outlook from a range of 6 % to 8 % to a range of 7.5 % to 8.5 % .", "this increase is primarily a result of the continued year - over - year growth in our lease portfolio size .", "we have maintained our expected capital expenditure range of $ 90 million to $ 100 million .", "we have reduced our free cash flow outlook for 2021 to $ 30 million to $ 40 million , primarily to reflect the significant investment in lease merchandise inventory the company has made to mitigate the impact of global supply chain challenges and the related inflationary pressures .", "based on our current inventory levels , we do not anticipate any material challenges in meeting our customers ' product demand as we end 2021 and head into 2022 .", "as i have previously described , benefits to our customer from government stimulus programs have moderated in the third quarter .", "our revised outlook continues to assume customer lease payment activity remains higher in the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared to pre covid -
