an impact on net interest income and net interest margin in the first quarter .", "net interest income decreased 12 % from last year , driven by lower finance charges and late fees .", "the net interest margin was 13.98 % compared to last year 's margin of 15.15 % , largely driven by the impact of the pandemic on loan receivables and increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates .",

receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined over 3 percentage points from 81.7 % to 78.6 % , driven by the higher liquidity held during the quarter .", "this accounted for 61 basis points of the net interest margin decline .", "the liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for 23 basis points reduction in our net interest margin .", "these impacts were partially offset by a 93 basis point decrease in the total interest - bearing liabilities costs to 1.57 % , primarily due to lower benchmark rates .", "this provides a 78 basis point increase in our net interest margin .", "we continue to believe that in the second half of the year , excess liquidity will begin to be deployed into asset growth and slowing paying rates should result in higher interest and fee yields leading to increasing net interest margin .", "next , i 'll cover our key credit trends on slide 11 .", "in terms of specific dynamics for the quarter , i saw the delinquency trends .", "our 30 - plus delinquency rate was 2.83 % compared to 4.24 % last year .", "our 90 - plus delinquency rate was 1.52 % compared to 2.10 % last year .", "higher payment rates continue to drive delinquency improvements .", "focusing on net charge - off trends , our net charge - off rate was 3.62 % compared to 5.36 % last year .", "our reduction in net charge - off rate was primarily driven by the improving delinquency trends as customer payment behavior improved over the last several quarters .", "our loss for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.88 % .", "moving to slide 12 , i 'll cover expenses for the quarter .", "overall expenses were down $ 70 million or 7 % from last year to $ 932 million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs .", "specifically , the decrease was driven by lower operational losses and lower marketing and business development costs , partially offset by higher employee costs .", "the efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 36.1 % compared to 32.7 % last year .", "the ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest in the fee yield , which was partially offset by a reduction in expenses .", "given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform , we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity .", "but we believe it 's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods , we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate .", "as a result of this strategy , there is a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter .", "our deposits declined by $ 1.9 billion from last year .", "our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $ 2.1 billion .", "this resulted in deposits being 81 % of our funding compared to 79 % last year .", "the securitized funding comprising 9 % and unsecured funding comprising 10 % of our funding sources at quarter end .", "total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $ 28 billion , which equated to 29.2 % of our total assets , up from 25.3 % last year .", "before i provide details on our capital position , it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies , which has two primary benefits .", "first , it delays the effect of the cecl transition adjustment for an incremental two years .", "and second , it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment .", "with this framework , we ended the quarter at 17.4 % cet1 under the cecl transition rules , 310 basis points above last year 's level of 14.3 % .", "the tier 1 capital ratio was 18.3 % under the cecl transition rules compared to 15.2 % last year .", "the total capital ratio increased 320 basis points to 19.7 % .", "and the tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased in basis increased to 28.7 % compared to 24.1 % last year , reflecting the increase in the reserves as a result of implementing cecl .", "during the quarter , we returned $ 328 million to shareholders , which included $ 200 million of share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of $ 0.22 per share .", "given the continued uncertainty in the operating environment , i thought it'd be helpful to provide color on our current view on the key earnings drivers for 2021 , which we 've laid out on slide 14 .", "our views assume that the pressure from the pandemic and a slower economic recovery continues into the second quarter with the second half seeing the pandemic largely under control and the acceleration of the economic recovery .", "first quarter purchase volume was stronger than anticipated as we entered the year , as local restrictions are lifted with consumer confidence improving so to consumers willingness to spend .", "we currently believe these trends will hold and purchase volume will continue to recover across our platforms .", "in the second quarter , we will be comparing against a period of widespread shutdowns .", "in the second half , we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderates and macroeconomic growth accelerates .", "regarding loan receivable growth , we expect that stimulus will continue to have an impact on payment rates , and therefore , loan receivables into the next quarter .", "in the second half of 2021 , we assume payment rates will moderate as the effects of the stimulus abates and we return to more normalized consumer payment behavior patterns .", "combining this with the expected increase in purchase volume from the improving macroeconomic environment , this should contribute to loan receivable growth .", "for net interest margin , we expect the higher payment rates will continue to pressure on loan receivables and generate excess liquidity , impacting interest and fee yield and asset mix .", "we continue to believe that excess liquidity will be reduced through asset growth and so payment rates in the second half of the year , which will drive improving interest and fee yields and asset mix leading to increase in net interest margin .", "with respect to credit , delinquencies are expect to increase from the current levels .", "so , we now believe the peak will occur later than we anticipated , likely in early 2022 .", "while current delinquencies will result in lower net charge - offs in the second quarter , we expect net charge - offs to rise resulting from the increases in delinquencies as we move through 2021 .", "given the magnitude of the stimulus that was deployed during pandemic , we believe the overall loss curve will be flatter than we initially thought that remains volatile and difficult to forecast due to the effects of the stimulus and industry forbearance has abated .", "we expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth , impacts from any rate changes in credit and in our macroeconomic assumptions and certain combinations of these factors could result in further reserve releases this year .", "we expect rsas to remain elevated into the second quarter , primarily reflecting strong program performance , including an improvement in net charge - offs , partially offset by lower revenue .", "in the second half of the year , we continue to expect low rsas generally , but slightly higher net charge - offs , partially offset by higher revenue .", "as we outlined previously , we 've implemented cost reductions across the organization and i 'm pleased to report that we are in a pace which expense savings target of $ 210 million for the full year .", "partially offsetting these cost reductions will be the expense increases related to growth in addition to anticipated increase in delinquent accounts .", "we will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and to impacting the macroeconomic environment .", "at the foundation is our belief that we position ourselves well for the opportunities that will develop as the economic recovery takes from hold .", "further , we 've made the investments to
