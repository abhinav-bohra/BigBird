that during the course of the call , we will be referring to ebitda , specifically ebitda as defined , adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share , all of which are non-gaap financial measures .", "first , i 'll start off with the usual quick overview of our strategy and then a few comments about the quarter and a discussion of our fiscal 2022 outlook , then jorge and mike will give additional color on the quarter .", "to reiterate , we are unique in the industry in both the consistency of our strategy in good and bad times , as well as our steady focus on intrinsic shareholder value creation through all phases of the aerospace cycle .", "to summarize here are some of the reasons why we believe this .", "about 90 % of our net sales are generated by proprietary products and over three quarters of our net sales come from products , which we believe we are the sole source provider .", "most of our ebitda comes from aftermarket revenues , which generally have significantly higher margins and over any extended period have typically provided relative stability in the downturns .", "we follow a consistent long - term strategy .", "specifically , we own and operate proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content .", "we utilize a simple , well - proven , value - based operating methodology .", "we have a decentralized organization structure and a unique compensation system , closely aligned with shareholders .", "next , we acquire businesses that fit this strategy where we see a clear path to pe - like returns .", "and finally , our capital structure and allocation are a key part of our value creation methodology .", "our long - standing goal is to give our shareholders private equity - like returns with the liquidity of a public market .", "to do this , we stay focused on both the details of value creation , as well as careful allocation of our capital .", "we continue to see recovery in the commercial aerospace market and are encouraged by the trends in air traffic among other factors .", "our q1 fiscal results show positive growth in comparison to the same period in fiscal 2021 as we are lapping the first quarter of 2021 , which was heavily impacted by the pandemic and prior to the widespread availability of vaccines .", "although our results have improved , they continue to be unfavorably affected in comparison to pre-pandemic levels as the demand for air travel remains depressed .", "however , the continued improvement in global air traffic despite emergence of a new covid - 19 variant in late 2021 is encouraging , it further illustrates the pent - up demand for air travel and bodes well for the momentum of the commercial aerospace recovery in 2022 .", "to date , the recovery has remained primarily driven by domestic leisure travel , although we are optimistic for recovery of international travel as many governments across the world have softened travel restrictions .", "even the travel restrictions reimposed by certain governments during the months of december due to the omicron variant are now starting to ease , which is again an encouraging sign .", "in our business , we saw another quarter of sequential improvement in our commercial markets , with total commercial aftermarket revenues up 10 % over q4 of fiscal 2021 and bookings up more than 15 % compared to q4 .", "commercial oem bookings came in even stronger with almost 20 % sequential improvement over q4 .", "i am also very pleased that despite the challenging commercial environment , our ebitda as defined margin was 47.3 % in the quarter .", "contributing to this better - than - expected margin is the continued recovery in our commercial aftermarket revenues , as well as the careful management of our cost structure and focus on our operating strategy .", "this was achieved despite the emergence of the omicron variant during the quarter .", "additionally , we continued to generate significant cash in q1 .", "we had strong operating cash flow generation of almost $ 280 million and closed the quarter with a little over $ 4.8 billion of cash .", "we expect to steadily generate significant additional cash throughout the remainder of 2022 .", "next , an update on our capital allocation activities and priorities .", "we are now at a decision point with regard to our sizable cash balance , which is now approaching $ 5 billion .", "consistent with our history , when we have a significant amount of cash available , we aim to get that back to the shareholders in one form or another .", "at this time , we 're still in the process of evaluating our capital allocation options with regard to any significant acquisitions , share buybacks and dividends .", "all three options are on the table each individually , but then also potentially in some combination over the next 12 months .", "any significant m&a , share buyback and / or dividend activity will still leave the company with substantial liquidity and the financial flexibility to deal with any currently anticipated capital requirements or other opportunities in the readily foreseeable future .", "we continue to look at possible m&a opportunities and are always attentive to our capital allocation .", "both the m&a and capital markets are always difficult to predict , but especially so in these times .", "regarding the current m&a pipeline , we are still actively looking for m&a opportunities that fit our model .", "we continue to see a pickup in acquisition opportunity activity , but it 's still slower than pre-covid .", "we have a decent pipeline of possibilities as usual , mostly in the small , midsized range .", "i cannot predict or comment on possible closings , we remain confident that there is a long runway for acquisitions that fit our portfolio .", "now , moving to our outlook for 2022 .", "we are still not in a position to provide full financial guidance as a result of the continued disruption in our primary commercial end markets .", "we continue to be encouraged by the recovery we have seen in our commercial aftermarket revenues and the strong bookings received for both commercial oem and aftermarket in q1 .", "we will look to reinstitute guidance when we have a clearer picture of the future .", "we continue to expect covid - 19 to have an adverse impact on our financial results compared to pre-pandemic levels throughout the remainder of fiscal 2022 under the assumption that both our commercial oem and aftermarket customer demand will remain depressed due to lower worldwide air travel .", "although recent positive trends in commercial air traffic could impact us favorably .", "to reiterate what we said on the q4 earnings call , our teams are still planning for our commercial aftermarket revenue to grow in the 20 % to 30 % range .", "we expect our commercial oem revenue to grow significantly as well , but at a rate slightly less than the commercial aftermarket .", "as you know , we aim to be conservative and would be happy to have both of these end markets rebound more strongly .", "to reiterate , these are planning assumptions for organizational purposes and not guidance .", "as for the defense market , we still expect defense revenue growth in the low single - digit percent range from fiscal 2022 versus prior year despite the slow start to the year .", "jorge will provide more color on our defense end market .", "we now expect full year fiscal 2022 ebitda margin to be slightly north of 47 % due to the rate of commercial aftermarket recovery .", "please note that our q1 ebitda margin was stronger than anticipated , and we may see less year - over - year margin improvement for q2 and expect margins to move up throughout the second half of the fiscal year .", "as a final note , this margin guidance includes the unfavorable headwind of our cobham acquisition of about 0.5 % .", "we believe we are well positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2022 .", "as usual , we 'll closely watch the aerospace and capital markets as they develop and will react accordingly .", "mike will provide details on other fiscal 2022 financial assumptions and updates .", "now , shifting gears for a moment to nonfinancial matters .", "i 'd like to touch on our dod ig audit report , which was released in mid-december .", "as we expected and communicated , the audit scope and results were similar to prior audits .", "the report found no legal wrongdoing on behalf of transdigm or any of our employees .", "the report asked for a purely voluntary refund of approximately $ 21 million .", "we disagree with many of the implications contained in the report , as well as the methodology used to arrive at many of the report 's conclusions .", "we also disagree with the use of arbitrary standards and analysis , which render many areas of the report inaccurate and misleading .", "additionally , at the request of the house oversight and reform committee , we participated in a hearing on january 19 to discuss the results of the audit .", "going forward , we will continue to work with the ig , the dla and any other relevant parties to evaluate the results of this audit .", "the u.s. government and the u.s. warfighter remained top priorities for transdigm .", "at this time , we are engaged directly with the dla and do not have any further update on whether or not we expect to pay all or a portion of the $ 21 million voluntary refund request .", "finally , i wanted to announce the retirement of our vice chairman , bob henderson .", "he retired at the end of first fiscal quarter .", "bob has been a key member of the transdigm management team for over 25 years and a significant partner in the company 's growth during the entire period .", "he served in a range of roles over his years with transdigm , including as president of several operating units , executive vice president , coo of transdigm 's airframe business group and most recently , vice chairman , where he oversaw the integration of the operating units acquired as part of the esterline transaction .", "we wish bob well in his retirement .", "let me conclude by stating that i 'm pleased with the company 's performance in this challenging time for the commercial aerospace industry and with our commitment to driving value for our stakeholders .", "as always , we remain focused on executing our operating strategy and managing our cost structure as we continue on this journey to a full recovery of the commercial aerospace industry .", "we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2022 and expect that our consistent strategy will continue to provide the value you have come to expect from us .", "now , let me hand it over to jorge to review our performance and a few other items .", "i 'll start with our typical review of results by key market category .", "for the remainder of the call , i 'll provide color commentary on a pro forma basis compared to the prior year period in 2021 .", "that is assuming we own the same mix of businesses in both periods .", "this market discussion includes the acquisition of cobham aero connectivity .", "we began to include cobham in this market analysis discussion in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 .", "this market discussion also removes the impact of any divestitures completed in fiscal 2021 .", "in the commercial market , which typically makes up close to 65 % of our revenue , we will split our discussion into oem and aftermarket .", "our total commercial oem revenue increased approximately 13 % in q1 compared with the prior year period .", "bookings in the quarter were robust compared to the same prior year period and strongly outpaced sales .", "sequentially , the bookings improved almost 20 % compared to q4 .", "we are hopeful that the narrowbody rate ramps disclosed by airbus and boeing will play out as forecasted .", "now , moving on to our commercial aftermarket business discussion .", "total commercial aftermarket revenue increased by approximately 49 % in q1 when compared with prior year period .", "growth in commercial aftermarket revenue was primarily driven by increased demand in our passenger submarket , although all of our commercial aftermarket submarkets were up significantly compared to prior year q1 .", "sequentially , total commercial aftermarket revenues grew approximately 10 % and bookings grew more than 15 % .", "commercial aftermarket bookings are up significantly this quarter compared to the same prior year period and q1 bookings strongly outpaced sales .", "to touch on a few key points of consideration , global revenue passenger miles remained low but continued to modestly improve throughout our q1 .", "iata currently forecasts a 39 % decrease in revenue passenger miles in calendar year 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels .", "within iata 's estimate is the expectation that domestic travel will be back to 93 % of pre-pandemic levels in calendar year 2022 .", "despite the impact of the omicron variant , december global revenue passenger miles still improved month on month , which demonstrates the strong underlying demand and the willingness of passengers to travel .", "countries that reimposed travel restrictions due to this variant are already announcing significant easing of those restrictions .", "the limited impact from the omicron variant on air travel provides optimism for the pace of the recovery of air traffic in 2022 .", "the recovery in domestic travel has been more resilient than international .", "domestic air traffic for calendar 2021 was only down 28 % compared to pre-pandemic versus international , which was still down 75 % .", "as the commercial aerospace recovery has progressed , the u.s. and europe have shown strong demand for domestic travel .", "china has been more volatile due to its zero covid policies , which lead to localized lockdowns and rapid drop - offs in air travel .", "though the pace of the international air traffic recovery has been slow , we are hopeful for improvement in international travel in 2022 as vaccination rates continue to improve globally and many of the government travel restrictions are softening .", "global cargo volumes continue to surpass pre-covid levels and it is generally expected that airfreight demand will remain robust throughout 2022 .", "business jet utilization remained strong .", "commentary from business jet oems and operators have been encouraging and these higher levels of business jet activity may be here to stay , though time will tell .", "now , let me speak about our defense market , which traditionally is at or below 35 % of our total revenue .", "the defense market revenue , which includes both oem and aftermarket revenues , decreased by approximately 12 % in q1 when compared with the prior year period .", "as we have said many times , defense sales and bookings can be lumpy .", "this quarter , cobham was lapping a very tough prior year comparison as cobham 's defense sales accelerated in fiscal q1 2021 , which was the last quarter prior to transdigm 's ownership .", "this was the single largest contributor to the year - over - year decline .", "there are also some supply chain - induced delays in fulfilling orders at certain operating units .", "as kevin mentioned earlier , we continue to expect low single - digit percent range growth in fiscal 2022 for our defense market revenues .", "lastly , i 'd like to wrap up by stating how pleased i am by our operational performance in this first quarter of fiscal 2022 , despite the continued impact of the pandemic .", "we remain focused on our value drivers and executing with operational excellence .", "i 'm going to quickly hit on some additional financial matters for the quarter and then our expectations for the full fiscal year .", "first , in regard to profitability for the quarter , ebitda as defined of about $ 565 million for q1 was up 19 % versus our prior q1 .", "ebitda as defined margin in the quarter was approximately 47.3 % .", "this represents year - over - year improvement in our ebitda as defined margin of about 450 basis points versus q1 of last year .", "sequentially , ebitda as defined margin declined slightly by about 200 basis points during q1 versus q4 of last fiscal year .", "as you know , this is typically the case for us given the higher volume levels in q4 and lower number of working days in our fiscal q1 .", "now , a few quick additional financial data points for the quarter .", "organic growth was 9 % , driven by the rebound in our commercial oem and aftermarket end markets .", "on taxes , the slightly lower - than - expected gaap rate for the quarter was driven by significant tax benefits arising from equity compensation deductions .", "barring some deviations in the rates for this first quarter , our tax rate guidance for the full year is unchanged from what we provided on our last earnings call .", "moving to cash and liquidity .", "we had another nice quarter on free cash flow .", "free cash flow , which we traditionally defined at transdigm as ebitda less cash interest payments , capex and cash taxes , was roughly $ 250 million .", "we ended the quarter with about $ 4.8 billion of cash .", "during q1 , we also paid down our $ 200 million revolver balance , which was drawn at the onset of covid in march of 2020 out of an abundance of caution .", "the $ 200 million revolver paydown is the primary reason that our cash balance ticked up much less than the $ 250 million of free cash flow we generated in q1 .", "our net debt - to - ebitda ratio is now at 6.7 times .", "this ratio is down from 8.2 times , at its peak .", "we expect to continue running free cash flow positive .", "and barring any additional capital markets activities , this ratio would keep coming down as we proceed through our fiscal ' 22 .", "from an overall cash liquidity and balance sheet standpoint , we remain in good position and well prepared to withstand the currently depressed but now rebounding commercial environment for quite some time ."], "summary_gold": "full fiscal 2022 guidance remains suspended at this time .", "summary_pred": "about 90 % of our net sales are generated by proprietary products
