term investments account for the largest portion of the portfolio , generating net investment income of $ 73 million in first quarter 2021 compared with $ 83 million in first quarter 2020 .", "the decrease in net investment income was primarily due to lower average balances in the externally managed fixed maturity investment portfolio , which declined due to dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries that were then used for agl share repurchases , lower short - term interest rates and lower income from our loss mitigation securities .", "equity in earnings of investees primarily include assuredim funds and several other alternative investments managed by third parties .", "the assuredim funds , primarily the clos and asset -
