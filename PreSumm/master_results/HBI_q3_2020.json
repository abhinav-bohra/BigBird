than - anticipated ppe inventory , we continue to expect to generate positive operating cash flow in the second half and for the full year .", "and the fourth takeaway for the quarter , we further strengthened our liquidity , ending the quarter with $ 2 billion of liquidity , which we believe provides us with plenty of operating flexibility in this uncertain environment .", "so in closing , we 're making progress in an increasingly unpredictable environment .", "we 're seeing good revenue momentum in our business .", "we 're moving quickly with our strategic and cost assessment .", "we 're defining our ambition , identifying our opportunities and building our plans to become a more agile , consumer -

of - sale trends and broad - based inventory restocking .", "as expected , margins declined over prior year but less than we were anticipating , and we generated $ 249 million of operating cash flow , further strengthening our liquidity position .", "turning to the details of the results .", "third quarter sales increased 3 % over prior year to $ 1.81 billion , with foreign exchange rates accounting for 80 basis points of the quarter 's growth .", "apparel revenue performed better than our expectation for the quarter .", "excluding $ 179 million of ppe sales , apparel revenue declined 7 % compared to prior year .", "this represents a significant improvement from last quarter 's 40 % decline as each segment experienced a sequential improvement in year - over - year revenue trends .", "adjusted gross margin of 36.7 % decreased approximately 275 basis points over last year due to increased inventory reserves as well as negative manufacturing variances , which were incurred earlier in the year , rolling off the balance sheet and onto the p&l .", "adjusted operating margin declined approximately 170 basis points over prior year to 12.6 % as the gross margin pressure and higher operating costs from covid were partially offset by ongoing sg&a controls as well as benefits from our temporary cost savings initiatives .", "restructuring and other related charges were $ 53 million in the quarter .", "approximately $ 49 million are nonrecurring costs from restarting portions of our manufacturing network that closed for approximately 10 weeks beginning in march due to the covid pandemic .", "we experienced a stronger - than - expected recovery in point - of - sale .", "in an effort to meet demand and best serve our customers , we chose to expedite shipments via airfreight as well as temporarily leverage third - party manufacturing capacity .", "this resulted in short - term incremental cost in the form of freight and sourcing premiums relative to our normal manufacturing cost .", "we believe this was the right long - term business decision .", "and in fact , we are already seeing the benefits in the form of newly captured retail shelf space .", "the remaining $ 4 million of these costs relates to our previously disclosed supply chain restructuring actions and program exit costs .", "these actions and their associated costs are on track and remain unchanged from previous disclosures .", "our tax rate for the quarter was 17.3 % , which was in line with our expectations .", "and adjusted and gaap earnings per share decreased 11 % and 43 % over prior year to $ 0.42 and $ 0.29 , respectively .", "now let me take you through our segment performance .", "for the quarter , u.s. innerwear sales increased 41 % over prior year driven by a 15 % increase in basics , a 7 % increase in intimates and the inclusion of $ 166 million of ppe revenue .", "excluding ppe , u.s. innerwear sales increased 11.5 % over prior year due to the continued positive point - of - sale trends and inventory restocking by retailers .", "in our basics business , we experienced growth in each product category , which drove approximately 170 basis points of market share gains in the quarter .", "within intimates , bra sales increased at a double - digit rate .", "this more than offset the decline in shapewear sales , which is a category that continues to be negatively impacted by the coronavirus pandemic .", "looking forward , we have seen positive point - of - sale and order trends continue through october .", "with these trends , as well as retail inventory that remains below last year , we expect some level of restocking to continue in the fourth quarter .", "for the quarter , innerwear 's operating margin expanded approximately 80 basis points over prior year to 21.7 % driven by fixed cost leverage from higher unit volumes as well as favorable product mix .", "revenue declined 27 % compared to last year , which is an improvement from the second quarter 's 52 % decline .", "the vast majority of the year - over - year decline was from our sports apparel business , which continues to be significantly impacted by covid - related headwinds .", "activewear 's operating margin was 9.1 % for the third quarter .", "as expected , activewear 's margin declined compared to prior year due to the timing of negative manufacturing variances , inventory reserves for some of our non-champion brands as well as sg&a deleverage from lower sales volumes .", "however , i will note that the segment margin improved significantly from last quarter 's operating loss .", "touching briefly on champion , sales of the champion brand within our activewear segment increased approximately 85 % from the second quarter .", "compared to last year , sales declined 27 % , with the vast majority of the decline due to the covid - challenged sports apparel business .", "despite the challenges in sports apparel , we continue to expect sequential improvement in champion 's revenue trends in the fourth quarter driven by continued point - of - sale growth in key channels and online as well as improved product availability .", "switching to our international segment .", "revenue declined 5 % compared to last year on a reported basis and 7 % on a constant currency basis .", "adjusting for ppe sales , core international revenue declined 7 % as compared to prior year , which is a significant improvement from a 44 % decline in the second quarter .", "for the quarter , international champion sales increased 5 % over prior year .", "excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates , we experienced growth in our americas and champion europe businesses .", "this was more than offset by declines in our european innerwear , asia and australia businesses where covid - related challenges have slowed the retail recovery .", "international segment 's operating margin declined approximately 100 basis points over prior year to 15.2 % driven by deleverage from lower sales volumes , which was partially offset by continued tight sg&a cost management .", "we generated $ 249 million of operating cash flows in the quarter .", "looking at our balance sheet , inventory increased 4 % over prior year which was in line with sales growth and includes approximately $ 400 million of ppe inventory .", "excluding ppe , inventory declined 15 % compared to prior year .", "leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.3 times on a net debt to adjusted ebitda basis , which was comparable to last year .", "while liquidity remains our short - term focus in a post -covid environment , our focus would be to return our leverage ratio to below three times .", "we further strengthened our liquidity position in the quarter even while reducing debt by approximately $ 130 million and paying our regular quarterly dividend .", "we ended the quarter with $ 2 billion of liquidity above the $ 1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter .", "we continue to believe we have significant capital cushion in this uncertain environment .", "and now turning to guidance .", "outlook reflects the continued uncertainty due to the covid -

over - year comparisons reference our rebased 2019 results .", "for the fourth quarter , we expect total sales of $ 1.60 billion to $ 1.66 billion , which , at the midpoint , implies a 2 % decline over prior year .", "prior to this week 's european lockdowns , our revenue outlook assumed a low single - digit growth .", "included in our sales outlook is approximately $ 50 million of ppe sales , approximately $ 10 million of foreign exchange benefit and contributions from a 53rd week .", "we expect adjusted operating profit of $ 160 million to $ 180 million , which , at the midpoint , implies an operating margin of 10.4 % .", "expected year - over - year margin pressure is due to the timing of negative manufacturing variances and higher sg&a expense .", "we expect interest and other expense of approximately $ 50 million and a tax rate of approximately 17.5 % .", "our guidance for adjusted and gaap earnings per share range from $ 0.25 to $ 0.30 and $ 0.24 to $ 0.29 , respectively .", "and our guidance for full year 2020 operating cash flow is $ 300 million to $ 400 million , which includes the impact from the higher -
