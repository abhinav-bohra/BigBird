commitment and hard work .", "it has been an extraordinary couple of years , and this team continues to foster a strong culture , deliver exceptional service to our customers and create a bright future for kohl's .", "i want to start by reiterating the three key takeaways from today 's call : one , we have fundamentally restructured our business to be more profitable , and this is showcased by a record year of eps ; two , our strategy is building momentum , and this will continue in 2022 ; and three , we are reinforcing our commitment to driving shareholder value , doubling our dividend and planning to repurchase at least $ 1 billion in shares in 2022 .", "for today 's call , i 'm going to review our fourth - quarter results , discuss our capital allocation plans and then provide details on our 2022 guidance outlook .", "for the fourth quarter , net sales increased 6 % to last year , and other revenue , which is primarily credit revenue , also increased 6 % .", "as michelle indicated , following a strong start to the quarter , the sales trend worsened due to inventory receipt delays and the spread of omicron .", "we estimate that our sales were impacted by approximately 400 basis points in the fourth quarter as a result of supply chain challenges .", "q4 gross margin was 33.2 % , up 124 basis points from last year , driven primarily by higher inventory turns and regular price selling , reduced sourcing costs , and pricing and promotion optimization strategies .", "this was partially offset by higher transportation costs as freight expense was more than 140 basis point headwind to gross margin in q4 and was $ 40 million higher than we expected .", "now let me discuss sg&a .", "in q4 , sg&a expenses increased 5 % to $ 1.7 billion , driven principally by our top - line growth .", "as a percentage of revenue , sg&a expenses leveraged by 15 basis points to last year , with improved store labor productivity and lower technology expenses more than offsetting increased wage investments across our stores and fulfillment centers .", "depreciation expense of $ 207 million was $ 11 million lower than last year due to lower capital spend .", "in total , our q4 operating margin was 6.9 % , representing an increase of 172 basis points to last year .", "last , let me touch on some additional financial items .", "interest expense was $ 5 million lower than last year due to lower average debt outstanding during the quarter based on steps we took in 2021 to return our balance sheet to its healthy prepandemic debt structure .", "net income for the quarter was $ 299 million , and earnings per diluted share was $ 2.20 .", "this compares with last year 's adjusted earnings per share of $ 2.22 , which included $ 1.15 of tax benefits .", "as evident in our performance during 2021 , our strategic actions over the past 18 months to enhance our gross margin and improve the efficiency within our expense structure are working .", "for the full year , we achieved a gross margin of 38.1 % , which exceeded our 36 % target , and we have managed expenses tightly , lowering marketing and technology spend each by more than $ 100 million since 2019 .", "these were key drivers in our ability to deliver an operating margin of 8.6 % in 2021 , exceeding our 2023 target of 7 % to 8 % two years ahead of plan .", "and we reported an all - time record earnings per share of $ 7.33 , well ahead of our prior high of $ 5.60 in 2018 .", "turning to the balance sheet .", "we continue to be in a strong financial position .", "we ended the quarter with $ 1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents .", "as it relates to inventory , we continue to deliver very strong inventory turnover in q4 , resulting in a 4.1 times turn for the year , achieving our goal of four times or more .", "our inventory balance at year end was 13 % lower than 2019 .", "however , this was not reflective of our position during the holiday period .", "we entered the quarter with inventory trending down 25 % to 2019 and slightly worse on an available - for - sale basis , and we expect it to maintain this level through the holiday .", "however , a strong start to november , coupled with unexpected receipt delays , led to significantly less inventory in stores than planned during the key shopping weeks .", "average available - for - sale inventory was down nearly 40 % to 2019 during november and december , and our position in stores was even worse than this .", "in assessing our results , it was clear that our challenged inventory position hindered our ability to drive the intended sales .", "we saw a distinct correlation between inventory and sales growth across our store base and across our categories .", "our inventory position began improving in january as receipts began arriving , though was still down approximately 30 % on average during the month .", "looking ahead , we feel good about our overall inventory composition .", "although certain receipts were late , we do n't believe we have a margin liability as we will continue to work through inventory in q1 in core merchandise items like fleece and use pack and hold strategies on seasonal goods such as sleep sets and pajamas .", "and we 've taken additional proactive steps to ensure we are better positioned .", "we continued our strong cash flow generation with $ 497 million of operating cash flow and $ 296 million of free cash flow in q4 .", "for the full year 2021 , we generated operating cash flow of $ 2.3 billion and free cash flow of $ 1.6 billion .", "capital expenditures for the year were $ 605 million , driven mainly by sephora build - outs , refreshes , and fixtures for new brand launches as well as the completion of our six e-commerce fulfillment centers .", "for 2022 , we are planning capital expenditures of approximately $ 850 million .", "this is higher than 2021 due to our continued investment in enhancing our store experience , including 400 sephora build - outs and store refreshes as well as five new stores and four relocations .", "now let me discuss our capital allocation actions .", "during the fourth quarter , we further accelerated our share repurchase activity , buying over 10 million shares for $ 548 million .", "for the full year , we repurchased 26 million shares for $ 1.35 billion and ended the year with approximately 131.3 million shares outstanding .", "as it relates to our dividend , we paid $ 147 million to shareholders in 2021 .", "in total , we returned $ 1.5 billion to shareholders in 2021 .", "the board has approved a 100 % increase in our dividend , which equates to an annual dividend of $ 2 per share , and a $ 3 billion share repurchase authorization .", "in 2022 , we plan on repurchasing at least $ 1 billion , illustrating the confidence we have in our business and in our key strategic initiatives .", "now let me provide details on our outlook for 2022 .", "as you 've heard today , we are confident in our strategies to continue our growth in 2022 .", "our guidance assumes that our business will strengthen as the year progresses , given the timing of our key strategic growth initiatives , specifically the rollout of our 400 sephora shops .", "for the full year , we currently expect net sales to increase 2 % to 3 % versus 2021 ; operating margins to be in the range of 7.2 % to 7.5 % ; and earnings per share to be in the range of $ 7 to $ 7.50 , excluding any nonrecurring charges .", "let me share some additional guidance details and notes .", "we are expecting higher g&a and interest expense in 2022 due to lease accounting .", "as we have stepped up our investment in stores with sephora and refreshes , it has resulted in a number of leases being reclassified to finance leases from operating leases .", "accounting treatment for finance leases recognizes expense in g&a and interest expense rather than rent expense .", "as a result , we expect g&a to be approximately $ 860 million and interest expense of approximately $ 300 million in 2022 .", "and lastly , we expect a tax rate of approximately 24 % .", "i want to highlight some additional guidance items .", "first , from a net sales perspective , we expect sephora to be a key driver of our growth in 2022 with the opening of another 400 new shops .", "given the timing of the sephora store openings and inventory flow normalizing , we are expecting sales growth to build as the year progresses , with the second half stronger than the first half .", "second , we are expecting significantly higher freight and product cost inflation in 2022 .", "while we will benefit from our ongoing sourcing initiatives and some pricing actions , we do not expect to fully mitigate the headwind .", "as a result , we are planning gross margin to contract by approximately 100 basis points in 2022 relative to 2021 .", "third , from an sg&a expense perspective , we are planning expenses to be higher in q1 and q2 driven by the opening of 400 sephora stores and the related store refresh costs .", "and fourth , our guidance assumes our plan to repurchase at least $ 1 billion of shares in 2022 , of which $ 500 million is expected to be repurchased through open market transactions or an accelerated share repurchase program executed in q2 of 2022 .", "for modeling purposes , please note that we ended 2021 with 131.3 million shares .", "in summary , our business remains financially strong .", "we delivered record earnings per share in 2021 and returned $ 1.5 billion in capital to shareholders .", "we will build on this performance in 2022 as we scale key initiatives and improve our inventory positions .", "i will now hand it back to michelle .", "before we move to q&a , i want to address some of the uninformed and inaccurate commentary regarding the board 's openness to maximizing value .", "we have a strategic and financial plan that will deliver substantial value .", "the board is testing and measuring that plan against other alternatives .", "as we announced on february 4 , the company retained goldman sachs to engage with interested parties .", "that effort continues and has included engaging with unsolicited bidders as well as proactive outreach .", "engagement with those parties is ongoing .", "our proxy , when filed , will provide more detail .", "the board is committed to fulfilling its fiduciary duties and will choose the path it believes will maximize the value to shareholders .", "so contrary to what others might say , the board 's approach is robust and intentional .", "we wo n't
