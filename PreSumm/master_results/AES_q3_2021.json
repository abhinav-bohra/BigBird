to - date total to four gigawatts .", "additionally , we are in very advanced discussions for another 850 megawatts of wind , solar and energy storage .", "based on our current progress , we now expect to sign at least five gigawatts this year versus our prior expectations of four gigawatts .", "this represents the largest addition in our history and 66 % more than in 2020 .", "with our pipeline of 38 gigawatts of potential projects , including 10 gigawatts that are ready to bid in the u.s. , we are well positioned to capitalize on this substantial opportunity .", "our success is a result of our strategy of working with our clients on long - term contracts that provides customized solutions for their specific energy and sustainability goals .", "as such , almost 90 % of our new business has been from bilateral negotiated contracts with corporate customers .", "this allows us to compete on what we do best : providing differentiated , innovative solutions .", "one example of our work with major technology companies to provide competitively priced renewable energy netted on an hour - by - hour basis .", "as we announced earlier this week , we signed a 15 - year agreement to provide around - the - clock renewable energy to power microsoft 's data centers in virginia .", "year - to - date , we have signed almost two gigawatts of similarly structured contracts with a number of tech companies , integrating a mix of renewable sources and energy storage .", "outside the u.s. , we have a similar strategy of focusing on bilateral sales with corporate customers , which has enabled us to sign long - term u.s. dollar - denominated contracts with investment - grade customers .", "for example , in brazil , we see demand for more than 25 gigawatts of renewables , providing a significant opportunity to earn mid- to high - teen returns in u.s. dollars , while at the same time , diversifying our brazilian portfolio of mostly hydro generation .", "to that end , for the first time ever in brazil , we are in very advanced negotiations to design a 300 - megawatt u.s. dollar - denominated contract with a large multinational corporation for 15 years .", "our backlog of 9.2 gigawatts is the largest ever with 60 % in the u.s. these projects represent one of the main drivers for our growth through 2025 and beyond .", "with this pace of growth , we are laser - focused on ensuring that we have adequate and reliable supply chain .", "for several years , we have anticipated a boom in renewable development that could potentially lead to inadequate panel supply .", "and as such , we took pre-emptive measures to ensure supply chain flexibility .", "despite current challenges in the market , we have non-chinese panels secured for the majority of our backlog , which is expected to come online through 2024 .", "we have benefited from a number of strategic relationships with various suppliers and a clear advantage stemming from our scale and visibility of our pipeline .", "more generally , we continue to proactively manage potential macroeconomic headwinds , including inflation and commodity prices .", "as part of our efforts to derisk our portfolio over the past decade , we have taken a systematic approach to risk management .", "in fact , in places where we use fuel , it is mostly a pass -

up phase .", "in 2021 , this drag on earnings is expected to be approximately $ 0.06 per share .", "we assume these losses from aes next in our 2021 guidance and our 7 % to 9 % annualized growth rate through 2025 .", "as you know , last week , fluence , our energy storage joint venture with siemens , which began as a small business within aes , became a publicly listed company with a current valuation of around $ 6 billion .", "similarly , early this year , another aes next business , uplight , received evaluation in a private transaction of $ 1.5 billion .", "the value of our interest in these two businesses is now at least $ 2.5 billion or $ 3 per share compared to the book value of our investments of approximately $ 150 million .", "in my view , this massive shareholder value creation more than justifies the temporary negative impact to earnings .", "in summary , our strategy of being the leading integrator of new technologies on our platform has yielded great results , and we have several other innovations in development under aes next .", "as they mature , we will continue to take actions to accelerate their growth and show their value .", "it 's my pleasure to participate in my first earnings call as chief financial officer of aes .", "i have been at aes for 14 years and feel very fortunate to work at a company that is transforming the electric sector so profoundly along so many talented people in finance and throughout the company .", "with our strategic and financial progress to date , aes is well positioned to continue leading this transformation .", "in my previous role , i led corporate strategy and financial planning where we developed our plan to get to greater than 50 % renewables at least 50 % of our business in the u.s. and to reduce our coal share to less than 10 % by 2025 , all while growing the company 7 % to 9 % .", "we are committed to those goals , and i look forward to continue executing toward them .", "before i dive into our financial performance , i want to discuss the adjustment to our accounting that we made this quarter relating to the treatment of the $ 1 billion in equity units we issued in the first quarter this year .", "our prior guidance assume that the underlying shares would not be included in our fully diluted share count until 2024 upon settlement of the equity units .", "this approach was in line with industry practice and supported by our interpretation of the accounting literature and our external auditors .", "however , we are now subject to an updated interpretation of these instruments , and we are adjusting to include these shares in our fully diluted earnings per share calculations .", "this adjustment results in an annual impact of roughly $ 0.07 this year and $ 0.09 in 2022 and 2023 using a full year of an additional 40 million shares .", "it 's important to keep in mind that this adjustment has no cash impact and has absolutely no impact on our business or longer - term growth rates as we had included the underlying shares in our projections for 2024 and beyond .", "prior to this adjustment , we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range , but we now expect to be at the low end of the range .", "now i 'd like to cover two important topics : our performance during the third quarter and our capital allocation plan .", "you can see the strong performance of our portfolio in this quarter .", "adjusted earnings per share was $ 0.50 for the quarter versus $ 0.42 for the comparable quarter last year .", "this 19 % increase was primarily driven by improvements in our operating businesses , new renewables and parent interest savings .", "these positive drivers were partially offset by lower contributions from south america , largely due to unscheduled outages in chile .", "third quarter results also reflect an approximate $ 0.03 quarter - to - date impact from the higher share count due to the inclusion of 40 million additional weighted average shares relating to the equity units that i just mentioned .", "adjusted pre-tax contribution , or ptc , was $ 428 million for the quarter , an increase of $ 97 million versus third quarter of 2020 .", "i 'll cover our results by strategic business unit over the next four slides , beginning on slide 13 .", "in the us and utilities sbu , ptc increased $ 69 million as a result of our continued progress in growing our u.s. footprint .", "the improvement was largely driven by higher contributions from southland , which benefited from higher contracted prices , new renewables coming online at aes clean energy and higher availability at aes puerto rico .", "in california , our 2.3 gigawatt southland legacy portfolio demonstrated its critical importance by continuing to meet the state 's pressing energy needs and its transition to a more sustainable carbon - free future .", "in fact , as you may have heard , last month , the state water resource control board unanimously approved an extension of our 876 - megawatt redondo beach facility for two years through 2023 to align with our remaining legacy units .", "if the demand / supply situation remains tight , some of our legacy portfolio could be available to meet california 's energy needs beyond 2023 if state energy officials determine a need , although we have not assumed this in our guidance .", "as you can see on slide 14 , at our south america sbu , lower ptc was primarily driven by unscheduled outages in chile due to a blade defect impacting six turbines across our fleet that has now largely been resolved .", "our third quarter results were also driven by lower hydrology in brazil .", "before moving to mcac , i would like to provide an update on 531 - megawatt alto maipo hydro project , owned by a subsidiary of aes andes in chile .", "construction continues to go well , and generation is expected to begin in december of this year , with full commercial operation of the plant expected in the first half of 2022 , in line with our expectations .", "alto maipo is in discussions with its nonrecourse lenders to restructure its debt to achieve a more sustainable and flexible capital structure for the long term .", "aes andes has honored its equity commitment to alto maipo and will not be assuming any additional equity obligations .", "we expect the restructuring to be completed in 2022 .", "and aes andes already assumed zero cash flow from alto maipo , so we do n't see the restructuring impacting our guidance .", "now turning back to our third quarter results on slide 15 .", "the higher ptc at our mcac sbu primarily reflects higher lng sales in dominican republic and demand recovery in panama .", "and finally , in eurasia , as shown on slide 16 , higher results reflect improved operating performance in bulgaria .", "to summarize our performance in the first three quarters of the year , we earned adjusted earnings per share of $ 1.07 versus $ 0.96 last year .", "as i mentioned earlier , in terms of our full year guidance , we are incorporating the $ 0.07 per share noncash impact from the adjustment for the equity units issued earlier this year .", "prior to this adjustment , we had expected to be in the upper half of our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance range , but we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range of $ 1.50 to $ 1.58 .", "it 's important to note that this adjustment does not affect our longer - term growth expectations and has no impact on our cash flow .", "with three quarters of the year behind us , our year - to - go results will benefit from contributions from new renewables , continued demand recovery across our markets , reduced interest expense and our cost savings programs .", "these positive drivers are offset by the impact of the higher share count and the dilution from aes next , as andres discussed earlier .", "now turning to our 2021 parent capital allocation on slide 18 .", "beginning on the left hand of the slide and consistent with our prior disclosure , we expect approximately $ 2 billion of discretionary cash this year .", "we remain confident in our parent free cash flow target midpoint of $ 800 million and the $ 100 million from the sale of itabo , and we received the $ 1 billion of proceeds from the equity units issued in march .", "moving over to the right -
