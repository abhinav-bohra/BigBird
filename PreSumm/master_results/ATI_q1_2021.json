improvement actions continue and they 'll make us a stronger company .", "on an earnings per share basis , as i mentioned earlier , we lost $ 0.06 per share versus our guidance range of a loss between $ 0.23 and $ 0.30 .", "our dedication to more closely aligning capacity with near - term demand was a key contributor to achieving first quarter results that exceeded expectations .", "there were two additional drivers of our financial outperformance , both related to the growing expectation for a global economic recovery .", "first and foremost , raw material prices rose significantly leading up to and within the quarter .", "nickel , ferrochrome and cobalt increases led to higher surcharge pricing and favorable timing between higher selling prices and lower inventory values , largely in our specialty rolled products business .", "these year -

die forgings improving faster than our specialty material .", "although jet engine sales declined significantly versus a robust prior year quarter , they grew nearly 30 % sequentially .", "as a reminder , our forgings are more finished components with shorter lead times compared to our other engine materials .", "forgings demand growth is directly linked to higher jet engine builds and additionally , in our case , to share gains .", "all of this is driven by increasing narrowbody production rates .", "our specialty materials tend to have longer lead times and are delivered to intermediate forgers , both internally and externally .", "inventory levels differ between materials and customers , which leads to today 's multispeed demand recovery .", "with increasing oem production rates , we expect jet engine customer destocking to be largely complete in the second half of the year .", "at that point , we anticipate our forgings and materials growth rates will more closely align with our customers ' requirements .", "we expect our jet engine product sales and related earnings to continue improving across 2021 , again , driven mainly by narrowbody production increases , share gains and our previously implemented margin improvement actions .", "we saw continued lower year - over - year sales , as expected , due to lackluster international travel demand , impacting widebody production rates .", "these planes consume a large percentage of our total airframe titanium sales .", "we expect our primary oem customer to continue to destock across 2021 , with new business from another large global oem , partially offsetting the decline in the second half of the year .", "we agree with industry analysts ' projections that widebody production will remain at low levels for an extended time .", "we 've adjusted our cost structure accordingly .", "we continue to see sales growth adding to our double - digit year - over - year gains in 2020 .", "first quarter sales growth was very robust for military aerospace products , including jet engines , airframes and rotorcraft .", "as expected , this was partially offset by a steep decline in ground vehicle armor plate as our primary customer completed the initial phase of a large product program .", "looking ahead , we expect continued military aerospace growth and ongoing solid demand levels for naval nuclear products .", "we 'll see lower armor sales in the second quarter in advance of a new customer program kicking off later in 2021 .", "in total , we anticipate overall defense market growth in 2021 and beyond as we expand in new applications , materials and customers .", "shifting to our broader energy markets .", "sales declined year - over - year but at a slower pace than in previous quarters .", "sales to our specialty energy markets expanded including robust double - digit growth for nuclear energy and pollution and control material .", "sales to our traditional oil and gas markets declined versus prior year , but at a slower rate than in the most recent quarters .", "improving demand for fuel needed to support travel and commerce is driving an increase in upstream production activity .", "additionally , the market for clad pipe applications continues to gain momentum .", "as i noted earlier , we recently won a contract worth roughly $ 40 million for nickel alloy clad pipe materials to be produced and shipped in the second half of 2021 .", "looking ahead , we expect oil and gas market conditions to continue to improve with the coming economic recovery .", "we anticipate ongoing growth in specialty energy markets , likely at a slower pace as compared to the first quarter .", "in our smaller electronics and medical markets , q1 produced mixed results .", "on the positive side , we saw ongoing strong electronics customer demand for both precision rolled specialty strip in asia and for our growing specialty alloy powders globally .", "the latter materials are used in a wide variety of next - generation consumer products , including 5g networks , autonomous vehicles and advanced computing .", "we expect continued year - over - year electronics market growth in 2021 , but at a slower pace than the first quarter .", "in our medical markets , in the first quarter , both mri and implant material sales continued to be negatively impacted by covid challenges that included restricted access to hospitals and lower elective surgery volume .", "as we enter q2 , we 're seeing increased forward order commitments .", "we expect our sales in the medical market to improve in the second half of this year .", "finally , another potentially significant development is a likely national infrastructure improvement plan currently unfolding in the u.s. ati would indirectly benefit in two ways : first , this program will create jobs , leading to increased discretionary spending for travel and consumer goods .", "the delivery of people , products and materials require airplanes , trucks and cars that consume fuel .", "this will benefit ati 's two largest markets , aerospace and energy .", "second , and opportunistically , ati will indirectly benefit from increased building material consumption .", "while ati does not produce these basic materials , we 're a key link in a cost - effective supply chain for those who do .", "our hrpf is uniquely positioned to generate increased cash flow from rolling carbon steel slabs for domestic producers .", "during the next few minutes , i 'll provide my thoughts in several key areas .", "first , our q1 financial performance ; second , an update on our liquidity levels ; and third , an updated view on our 2021 outlook .", "as a whole , ati lost $ 0.06 per share in q1 , well ahead of our expected loss range heading into the quarter .", "in many ways , our financial performance reflected benefits from our 2020 cost actions .", "the cost reductions have positioned us to take advantage of the coming global economic recovery , particularly within commercial aerospace , our largest end market .", "as bob noted , increased domestic travel rates are giving boeing and airbus the confidence to increase narrowbody production rates .", "in turn , we are seeing early demand signals for our specialty forgings and materials produced by the hpmc segment .", "let me add some color to the q1 results .", "hpmc sales decreased year - over - year compared to a robust prior year pre-pandemic quarter .", "but as an encouraging sign that we have seen the bottom , hpmc sales increased nearly 10 % sequentially .", "this growth was led by nearly 30 % gain in commercial jet engine sales and a 17 % pickup in defense sales .", "within jet engines , we saw a significant sequential uptick in engine forgings demand .", "to that end , we are pleased to note that we have moved from a minority to a majority share on several leap engine isothermal forge components .", "we 're encouraged by these trends and expect them to continue expanding across 2021 , and as domestic travel rates increase .", "in the defense market , our growth was largely attributable to forgings and materials for military jet engines .", "as expected , airframe sales continued to lag due to ongoing customer destocking .", "sequentially , hpmc earnings margins improved significantly due to revenue growth and favorable product mix .", "within our jet engine sales , highly profitable next - generations forgings and materials comprised over 40 % of the q1 total , up from 35 % and 19 % in the prior two quarters , respectively .", "in addition to product mix , margin enhancements included in our renewed ltas provided a tailwind as did transitory benefit from rapidly rising cobalt prices during q1 .", "overall , we 're encouraged by the improving aerospace trends in both hpmc business units and expect to continue to gain momentum as airbus and boeing increase narrowbody production volumes .", "turning to aa&s , segment revenues decreased 16 % year - over - year largely due to a 25 % decrease in specialty rolled products , or srp , business unit sales .", "the decline in srp sales was across all major markets , except automotive .", "sales at our stal jv increased by over 50 % year - over - year , fueled by demand for consumer electronics and elevated automotive production in china .", "looking at the sequential revenue change , aa&s sales improved 4 % , largely due to srp 's 15 % increase in standard value stainless products , which generate minimal profit .", "aa&s segment ebitda improved year - over - year and sequentially , led by record stal earnings .", "our specialty alloys & components , or sa&c , business unit , along with stal continued to generate double - digit percentage margins .", "those business units are also well positioned to take advantage of coming demand in their respective markets .", "srp posted a positive ebitda this quarter .", "it 's important to note that nearly 75 % of the srp q1 ebitda was due to rising nickel and , to a lesser degree , ferrochrome prices in the quarter .", "if this unpredictable benefit is removed , srp earned an ebitda margin of about 2 % and generated a loss after appropriately considering depreciation and interest charges .", "the srp business has the potential to be a solid and consistent contributor to ati 's profitable growth story .", "srp 's first quarter results are a reminder of why a transformation is needed within this business .", "the cost structure does not allow for acceptable returns , and we make far too many products that generate little or no margin .", "the good news is that we know exactly what needs to be done to transform srp into an outstanding business ; exit standard stainless sheet products , consolidate the footprint to streamline product flow , and maximize production capabilities .", "the cost structures in the srp unit need to be fixed and the product mix improved .", "we are hitting the milestones laid out in our transformational plan .", "srp 's performance will look dramatically different in 2022 , no longer dependent on good luck from metal prices to generate meaningful profits .", "we 're optimistic about these changes , and we will keep you in the loop as the transformation unfolds .", "before jumping to the balance sheet , i want to highlight that we 've limited year - over - year decremental margins to 16 % this quarter .", "soon , the conversation should shift from decremental margins to outsized incremental margins , driven by increasing aerospace volumes and ongoing cost structure reductions .", "looking beyond the income statement , 2020 's groundwork to strengthen our balance sheet and generate and preserve cash continues to benefit us .", "we reshaped our debt maturity profile , shifting our next significant maturity to mid-2023 , and we 've lowered our annual interest costs .", "beyond traditional base debt , we made progress on reducing the financial burden from our u.s. defined benefit pension plan in 2020 .", "the combination of strong pension asset returns and 2020 calendar year contributions overcame the decline in discount rates .", "the result , an improved funding status and reduction in required 2021 pension contributions and expense .", "during the market chaos , we 've maintained a strong total liquidity , ending the first quarter with roughly $ 540 million in cash and about $ 360 million of abl availability .", "this is below year -
