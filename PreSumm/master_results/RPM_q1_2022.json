related shutdowns in last year 's first quarter .", "we estimated the negative impact and consolidated sales during this first quarter was about $ 200 million due to these challenges and disruptions .", "over half of which occurred in our consumer segment .", "this was about double the negative sales impact we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal ' 21 .", "sales and earnings for our consumer group decreased during the quarter as a result of these factors , as well as a difficult comparison to the prior - year period when sales increased on an organic basis by 34 % and adjusted ebit was up 122 % .", "these growth rates in the prior - year period were largely driven by extraordinary diy demand during the pandemic .", "all indicators suggest that the underlying demand for our consumer products is still strong and that supply and material disruptions , the segment is currently experiencing are temporary .", "during the first quarter and early in the second quarter we made strategic growth investments in our businesses .", "and as you can see on slide 4 , among these were the recent acquisitions of dudick , pure air , and a recent purchase of a large manufacturing facility in corsicana , texas .", "acquired in june dudick will allow our carboline business to strengthen its position in the secondary containment linings market in established and trusted product lines while simultaneously opening the door to expanded sales and future growth opportunities around the globe .", "pure air was acquired in august and provides indoor air quality service and is complementary to our tremco roofing and tremco wti business .", "we intend to swiftly scale pure air by leveraging tremco 's north america sales force , strategic partnerships , and operational infrastructure .", "also on this slide , you 'll see an image from 178,000 square foot plant we purchased 120 acres in texas .", "this will serve as a manufacturing center of excellence for multiple rpm businesses .", "the plant is fully operational has an experienced operating team that will allow us to add long - term resilience in our supply chain , improve fill rates , and more easily expand production of a number of our high - growth product lines in the coming quarters and years .", "from a more long - term macro viewpoint , there are a number of market opportunities in industry trends that we are well - positioned to capitalize on for continued growth and success among the market opportunities on slide 5 are the following : the increasing need for investment in infrastructure with spending estimated to be $ 2.8 trillion globally .", "our performance coatings group and construction products group have a vast array of products and services to meet this need .", "the new diyers born from the pandemic who continue to tackle home improvement projects with both our core product ranges and expanding sales in relatively new categories like abrasives and architectural coatings .", "the continued growth and more holistic connected building envelopes , such as those provided by our construction products group , which make structures more airtight , weather tight , and energy - efficient .", "and the demand for wall systems like those it can be constructed using insulated concrete forms made by our new nudura business .", "they make building stronger , and more energy - efficient , and reduce construction cycle time and labor .", "industry trends benefiting rpm include nesting by consumers who are making more home improvements , school reopening is requiring more maintenance to repair , a need for building owners and facility managers to consolidate their construction management to a single source , and a greater desire for energy - efficient driven by both the cost benefits as well as a desire to minimize environmental impacts .", "rpm is well - positioned to meet and grow with all of these trends .", "turning to slide 6 , on a consolidated basis , our sales increased to a record $ 1.65 billion up 2.7 % over a strong fiscal 2021 first quarter , which grew 9.1 % .", "largely , due to the unprecedented demand for our consumer groups home improvement products during the pandemic .", "the growth was 2.1 % from recent acquisitions and 1.6 % due to foreign currency translation tailwinds .", "more than offsetting in organic sales declines of 1 % .", "adjusted diluted earnings per share of a dollar rate decreasing 25 % compared to the prior -

line growth largely driven by its businesses providing marine coatings , powder coatings , wood stains and sealers , and disaster restoration equipment .", "earnings increase due to higher sales volumes and incremental operating improvement program savings , which were partially offset by high raw material inflation inefficiencies associated with supply chain disruption and investment and sg&a for future growth initiatives .", "in response , sbd businesses are continuing to institute price increases .", "next on slide 10 , our consumer group faced a tough comparison the prior year for the reasons frank mentioned earlier .", "during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 , this segment experienced a negative sales impact of roughly $ 100 million from production outages due to supply constraints and disruptions .", "however , the consumer groups ' fiscal 2020 to first -

digit decrease in sales due to continued raw materials shortages and a difficult comparison to the prior - year period when pandemic fuels demand rapidly drove organic growth up 15 % .", "however , in a similar manner to the first quarter , we expect the consumer segment 's second - quarter sales to be above its pre-pandemic level , which is a fair comparison .", "while underlying demand remains strong for our products and services , we still face material shortages and inflationary pressures .", "so adjusted ebit is expected to be down 15 % to 25 % .", "the q2 results will be directionally similar to q1 with significant year -
