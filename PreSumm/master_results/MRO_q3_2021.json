year benchmark maintenance scenario and our ongoing pursuit of esg excellence through top quartile safety performance , significant reductions to our ghg intensity and best - in - class corporate governance .", "third quarter operations were again solid , demonstrating that we remain on track to achieve or outperform all of the key 2021 financial , operational and esg -

party midstream outages , strongly well performance and solid base production management .", "we also expect our fourth quarter total company oil equivalent production to be similar to the third quarter at 345,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day , with a sequential increase in the u.s. offsetting a sequential decrease in equatorial guinea associated with the previously referenced outage .", "as i noted last quarter , our financial priorities are clear and unchanged , generate strong corporate returns with significant sustainable free cash flow , all prove our already investment -

leading return of capital commitment .", "it is also competitive with any sector in the s&p 500 .", "our fourth quarter is shaping up to be an exceptionally strong free cash flow quarter due to a combination of higher commodity prices and oil volumes quite a bit stronger than the third quarter .", "at recent strip pricing , this could take our operating cash flow to approximately $ 1.1 billion or about a 25 % sequential increase versus the third quarter .", "add to that an expected increase in dividend distributions from eg and lower capex relative to the third quarter peak and fourth quarter free cash flow could almost double to north of $ 850 million .", "so in q4 , we expect to have lots of flexibility to exceed our 40 % of operating cash flow , a minimum threshold for equity returns .", "in fact , through our base dividend and approximately $ 500 million of share repurchases , we expect to return approximately 50 % of our operating cash flow to investors during the fourth quarter while further improving our cash balance and net debt position .", "as we also mentioned , we believe that buying back our stock in a disciplined fashion makes tremendous sense .", "there are many opportunities in the market right now that provide a sustainable free cash flow yield north of 20 % .", "stepping back , the full year 2021 financial delivery is exceptional , $ 140 million in base dividends , $ 1.4 billion in debt reduction and $ 500 million of share repurchases representing a total return to investors combined debt and equity of over $ 2 billion or over 60 % of our expected full year operating cash flow at strip commodity prices .", "our actions in 2021 have successfully repositioned the balance sheet and kicked off a strong track record of equity returns .", "going forward , we 're going to stay laser - focused on our financial priorities and our return of capital framework , taking into account our cash flow outlook when making return decisions .", "because our framework is based on a minimum percentage of cash flow from operations and not free cash flow , the equity investor will have the first call on cash , not to drill a bit .", "we recently completed our 2021 rex drilling program , which was focused on the continued delineation of our contiguous 50,000 net acre position in our texas delaware oil plant .", "as a reminder , this is a new play concept for both the woodford and meramec that was secured through grassroots leasing at a very low cost of entry and with 100 % working interest .", "this is essentially an exploration bolt - on that is complementary to our already established position in the northern delaware .", "we brought online our first multi-well pad during the third quarter .", "and while it is still very early , initial production rates in both woodford and meramec are exceeding our predrill expectations .", "more specifically , one of the woodford wells achieved an ip30 of almost 2,100 barrels of oil per day at an oil cut of 66 % .", "this appears to be the strongest woodford oil well ever drilled in any basin .", "and while we do n't yet have 30 - day rates for the other two wells , early indicators , including ip24s are all very positive .", "a primary objective of this three - well pad was to execute our first spacing test in the playing .", "to date , we are seeing no evidence of interference between the woodford and meramec , consistent with our expectations due to over 700 feet of vertical separation between the two zones .", "as i stated , it 's still early and we need more production history to draw stronger conclusions , but we are certainly encouraged by the initial results from this first spacing test , including the record woodford productivity .", "the second objective was to continue to progress our learnings and cost improvements and completed well costs .", "we expect to ultimately deliver well costs comparable to those achieved in the scoop and are aggressively leveraging our substantial experience in oklahoma to that end .", "in total , we have now brought online nine wells since play entry that have successfully delineated our position .", "the six wells with longer dated production have collectively demonstrated strong long - term oil productivity .", "oil cuts greater than 60 % , low oil ratios below one and shallow declines .", "looking ahead to 2022 , you should expect us to continue to integrate our learnings and progress our understanding of this promising play .", "however , we will do so in a disciplined manner and within our strict reinvestment rate capital allocation framework .", "i will close with a quick summary of how we have positioned our company for success and a preview of what to expect from us in 2022 .", "spoiler alert , there will be no surprises in 2022 and no compromise with respect to our capital return framework .", "if we focus on the financial benchmarks that matter , we are delivering top - tier capital efficiency , free cash flow yield and balance sheet strength .", "our 2021 capital rate of sub -35 % and capital intensity as measured by capex per barrel of production are both the lowest in our independent e&p peer group , a strong validation of our leading capital and operating efficiency .", "we are also one of the few e&ps expecting to deliver a 2021 reinvestment rate at or below the s&p 500 average .", "we 're also delivering top quartile free cash flow yield this year among our peer group and well above the s&p 500 average .", "and we are doing all of this with an investment - grade balance sheet at sub - onetime net debt to ebitda , a 2021 leverage profile also well below both our peer group and the s&p 500 average .", "in short , we are successfully delivering outsized financial performance versus our peer group and the broader market with the commodity price support we are experiencing this year .", "yet perhaps more importantly , we are well positioned to deliver competitive free cash flow and financial performance versus the broader market at much lower prices than we see today , all the way down to the $ 40 per barrel wti range .", "this is the power of our sustainable cost structure reductions , our capital and operating efficiency improvements and our commitment to capital discipline , all contributing to a sub - $ 35 per barrel breakeven .", "looking ahead to 2022 , our differentiated capital allocation framework that prioritizes the shareholder at the first call on cash flow generation will not change .", "our commitment to capital discipline will not waver with maintenance oil production , the case to beat , as we finalize our 2022 budget .", "we believe the right business model for a mature industry prioritizes sustainable free cash flow , a low reinvestment rate and meaningful returns to equity investors , not growth capital .", "recall that we introduced a unique five - year maintenance scenario earlier this year that featured $ 1 billion to $ 1.1 billion of annual spending , $ 1 billion of annual free cash flow at $ 50 wti and a 50 % reinvestment rate .", "given we are no longer living in a $ 50 per barrel environment and that prices are currently north of $ 80 per barrel , it is both prudent and reasonable to consider some level of limited inflation up to about 10 % that would yield modest pressure on the maintenance scenario capital range .", "yet importantly , this modest level of inflation pales in comparison to the uplift to our financial performance in the current environment , with a 2022 maintenance scenario free cash flow potentially on the order of $ 3 billion at recent strip pricing or nominally three times the $ 50 benchmark outcome .", "and under such a maintenance scenario , we are positioned to lead the peers once again with a 2022 free cash flow yield above 20 % , far in excess of the s&p 500 free cash flow yield of approximately 4 % .", "our minimum 40 % of cash flow target translates to about $ 1.6 billion of equity holder returns next year .", "but that is a minimum and we see significant headroom to drive that number higher .", "at the expected 4q run rate of 50 % of cfo , 2022 equity holder returns would increase to approximately $ 2 billion , while still improving our cash balance and net debt position .", "even at a more conservative $ 60 per barrel oil price environment , our minimum 40 % of cash flow targets still translates to about $ 1.1 billion of equity holder returns in 2022 .", "and applying 2022 consensus estimates to the return frameworks disclosed by our peers , only confirms our leading return of capital profile , with a double - digit cash distribution yield to our equity investors in 2022 .", "the confidence in this outsized delivery is further supported by recent board action to increase our share repurchase authorization to $ 2.5 billion to ensure we have sufficient runway to continue delivering on our return of capital commitment next year .", "to close , our company was among the first to recognize the need to move to a business model that prioritizes returns , sustainable free cash flow , balance sheet improvement and return of capital .", "we have also led the way in better aligning executive compensation to this new model and with investor expectations .", "we are successfully executing on our model today , delivering both financial outcomes and esg excellence that are competitive not just with our direct e&p peers but also the broader market .", "with that , we can open up the line for q&a ."], "summary_gold": "q3 oil -
