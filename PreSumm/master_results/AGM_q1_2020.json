19 on agriculture and rural communities .", "the disruption could significantly alter the trajectory of the related economic cycles .", "fortunately , there exist strong support mechanisms to help augment any financial disruption and give rural communities time to heal .", "farmer mac had a very good start to the year , with our results for the quarter divided into two distinct macroeconomic periods .", "january and february were characterized by rising markets and a stable and positive economic outlook .", "march , however , proved to be unprecedented for everyone .", "as the covid - 19 virus spread globally and shelter - in - place orders became common , we saw significant volatility and market dysfunction in the latter half of march , and this coincided with national and global lockdowns .", "we continue to have , though , strong access to capital markets and were able to issue across various price point and tenors remaining well within gse spread issuances .", "while there was initial strain and widening at the longer end of the curve in the latter half of march , we worked with our existing investor and dealer base and issued bonds in a flexible way that was tailor - made to meet end investor needs .", "during the period through which covid - 19 has been declared a national emergency , we issued long sofr bonds .", "in fact , one of them was the longest gse sofr issuance and $ 285 million in structures , 10 years of greater , with total medium - term note issuances of approximately $ 2.5 billion to date .", "our strong liquidity position , as brad mentioned , and market access also enabled farmer mac to call higher - cost issuances , provide funding to business lines for new assets and add over $ 160 million in high - quality liquid assets to our investment portfolio .", "let me now provide an overview of our financial results .", "core earnings were $ 20.1 million for first quarter 2020 compared to $ 22.2 million in first quarter 2019 .", "net effective spread was $ 44.2 million in first quarter 2020 compared to $ 38.8 million in the same period last year .", "net effective spread in percentage terms remained stable at 89 basis points for both periods .", "the $ 2.1 million year - over - year decrease , though , in core earnings was primarily due to a $ 3.3 million after - tax increase in the total provision for losses and a $ 2.7 million after - tax increase in operating expenses .", "these were partially offset by the higher net effective spread .", "the increase in the total provision for losses reflects the adoption and implementation of the new standard current expected credit losses , or cecl , and the immediate impact of updated economic factor forecast , particularly higher credit spreads and expected higher unemployment as a result of the covid - 19 pandemic and the resulting economic volatility that i mentioned that had an impact on cecl model results .", "of the $ 3.8 million loss provision during the first quarter , approximately $ 3.5 million was attributable to factors related to covid - 19 .", "operating expenses increased by 26 % in first quarter 2020 compared to first quarter 2019 .", "this primarily was due to increased compensation and benefit expenses , including higher cash bonus payments to employees under our short - term annual bonus plan , as well as onetime payments to an executive who resigned during the quarter .", "it 's important to note that these additional compensation expenses are seasonal and they do not reflect a recurring trend for the rest of the year .", "general and administrative expenses also increased compared to the prior year due to farmer mac 's ongoing investment in various growth and strategic initiatives that were highlighted by both zack and brad .", "these ongoing investments in infrastructure will enable farmer mac to more efficiently meet its customer needs and will ultimately enable greater revenue retention over time .", "as of march 31 , 2020 , total allowance for losses were $ 19.1 million , an increase of $ 6.5 million from december 31 , 2019 .", "the total allowance for losses represents 9 basis points of farmer mac's $ 21.5 billion portfolio , and we continue to compare very favorably to industry peers .", "as i previously mentioned , the adoption and implementation of cecl on january 1 , 2020 , as well as the corresponding increase in reserves under these macroeconomic conditions were the primary drivers of this increase .", "before moving on to capital , i did want to note one item regarding the adoption of cecl , which is the impact that it's had on our rural utilities line of business .", "under the previous accounting standard , which estimated incurred losses based on historical loss rates , farmer mac 's rural utilities line of business did not require an allowance as farmer mac had never experienced a loss in its rural utilities line of business .", "however , under the cecl accounting standard , the highly specialized nature of power generation and transmission utilities results in significant losses , given default estimates that drive our model assumptions , even though the actual probability of default remains very low .", "it is therefore important to note that as of march 31 , 2020 , farmer mac's $ 2.4 billion in outstanding rural utilities loan purchases and long - term standby purchase commitments have no historic or current delinquencies .", "turning to capital , we continue to remain very well capitalized , which puts us in a position of strength as we entered this challenging time and will serve us well as we move forward .", "farmer mac's $ 815.1 million of core capital as of march 31 , 2020 exceeded our statutory requirement by $ 165.8 million or 25 % .", "this compares to $ 815.4 million of core capital as of december 31 , 2019 , which exceeded our statutory requirement by $ 196.7 million or 32 % .", "the slight decrease in excess capital from the prior quarter is primarily due to net growth in farmer mac 's outstanding business volume and the coinciding decrease in retained earnings related to various factors .", "however , from an overall liquidity standpoint , we are comfortable with our current cash position , which is hovering around $ 1 billion and which was at $ 1.2 billion on march 31 , 2020 .", "this level resulted in 202 days of liquidity and it's far exceeded our regulatory requirements by approximately 112 days .", "april , likewise , continued to be strong with a daily average cash position also around $ 1 billion , accompanied by strong levels of liquidity , which have continued through today .", "as brad noted , the higher - than - mandated levels of cash and liquidity allow us to weather any unexpected cash flows , adequately fund deferments to meet our customer needs , while retaining the flexibility to maintain low but still ample levels as market conditions change .", "so in conclusion , farmer mac 's underlying financial fundamentals , reflecting a well - capitalized balance sheet , stable core earnings , disciplined asset liability management and strong capital markets access , positions us to continue to successfully deliver upon a critical mission and navigate these uncertain times effectively .", "more complete information about farmer mac 's first quarter 2020 performance is in the 10 -
