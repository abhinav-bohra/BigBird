year basis , our g&a expense was approximately $ 45.3 million lower than last year primarily due to the transition of company - operated salons to franchise , salon closures and furloughs resulting from the covid -

lived asset impairment primarily related to its lease assets during the quarter .", "the impairment was also driven by the impact of the pandemic .", "fourth - quarter consolidated adjusted ebitda loss of $ 34 million was $ 73 million or 186 % unfavorable to the same period last year and was driven primarily by the decrease in the gain associated with the sale of company - owned salons of $ 27 million and the planned elimination of the ebitda that had been generated in the prior - year period from the net 1,448 company - owned salons that have been sold and converted to the franchise portfolio over the past 12 months .", "as we promised , management has taken steps to align the company 's cost structure to materially offset the decline in adjusted ebitda from our company - owned salons .", "we executed workforce reductions in january and june resulting in nearly $ 25 million of annualized savings .", "we have also significantly reduced our marketing spend .", "as i 've already noted , the covid - 19 pandemic also contributed to the decline in the fourth - quarter adjusted ebitda .", "on a year - to - date basis , consolidated adjusted ebitda of $ 20 million was $ 103 million or 84 % unfavorable versus the same period last year .", "the change includes a $ 20 million decrease in the gain excluding noncash goodwill derecognition related to the year - to - date sale and conversion of 1,475 company - owned salons to the franchise portfolio .", "excluding the impact of the gain , fourth - quarter year - to - date adjusted ebitda was a loss of $ 30 million which was $ 82 million unfavorable year over year .", "and like the fourth - quarter results , this unfavorable variance was also largely driven by the elimination of the ebitda related to the sold and transferred company - owned salons over the past 12 months and the covid - 19 pandemic .", "of course , as you know , the elimination of ebitda associated with the sold and transferred company - owned salons was a key element of our strategy and a planned event .", "turning now to segment - specific performance and starting with our franchise segment .", "fourth - quarter franchise royalties and fees of $ 7 million decreased $ 19 million or 72 % versus the same quarter last year .", "product sales to franchisees decreased $ 5 million year over year to $ 7 million .", "both decreases were driven primarily by the covid - 19 pandemic .", "franchise same - store sales were unfavorable 20 % due to a decline in traffic as customers learned to navigate the pandemic .", "as a reminder , same - store sales represents the total change in sales for salons that were open on the same day each year .", "salon closures are not included in the same - store sales .", "so as we 've previously discussed with you , it 'll take some time for the dust to settle and for same - store sales to be an entire reliable metric for our performance .", "let 's hope that by this time next year , we can all rely on these year - over - year comp comparisons as a key indicator of traffic and performance .", "fourth - quarter franchise ebitda of $ 1 million declined approximately $ 9 million year over year driven by reduced royalties and product sales due to the government - mandated salon closures in response to the covid - 19 pandemic partially offset by a decline in g&a .", "year - to - date franchise adjusted ebitda of $ 38 million was flat , decreasing by less than $ 1 million or 2 % year over year .", "adjusted ebitda was favorable year over year until the impact of covid - 19 pandemic hit .", "looking now at the company - owned salon segment .", "fourth - quarter revenue decreased $ 195 million or 93 % versus prior year to $ 15 million .", "covid - 19 was the primary driver along with the year - over - year decrease of approximately 1,476 company - owned salons over the past 12 months which can be bucketed into three main categories .", "first , the conversion of 1,475 company - owned salons to our asset - light franchise platform over the course of the past 12 months , of which 112 were sold during the fourth quarter .", "second , the closure of approximately 250 company - owned salons over the course of the last 12 months , most of which were underperforming salons that we closed at lease expiration and are not essential to our future strategy .", "and third , these net company - owned salon reductions were partially offset by 234 salons that were bought back from franchisees over the last year and 15 new company - owned organic salon openings during the last 12 months which we expect to transition to our franchise portfolio in the months ahead .", "while historically the company has waited until we signed the close underperforming salons , in the current environment , we may utilize our balance sheet to terminate some leases early where the economics justify the decision which will lead to early termination fees .", "however , we believe closing certain salons sooner is in our best interest as we get close to a fully franchise model .", "fourth - quarter company - owned salon segment adjusted ebitda decreased $ 44 million year over year to a loss of $ 22 million .", "consistent with the total company consolidated results , the unfavorable year - over - year variance was driven primarily by covid - 19 and the elimination of the adjusted ebitda that had been generated in the prior - year periods from the company - owned salons that were sold and converted into the franchise platform over the past 12 months .", "on a year - to - date basis , company - owned salon consolidated adjusted ebitda loss of $ 7 million was $ 95 million unfavorable versus the same period last year .", "the unfavorable year - over - year variance is driven by the elimination of the adjusted ebitda related to the sold and transferred salons over the past 12 months and covid - 19 .", "as i mentioned earlier , management has taken significant steps to reduce costs associated with this segment .", "it is important to remember that our company - owned salon performance will continue to be less critical to the future trajectory of our business as we continue our conversion to a capital - light franchise model .", "turning now to corporate overhead .", "fourth - quarter adjusted ebitda loss of $ 14 million increased $ 20 million and is driven primarily by the $ 27 million decline in net gain excluding noncash goodwill derecognition in the prior year from the sale of and conversion of company - owned salons partially offset by the net impact of management initiatives to eliminate non-core non-essential g&a expense .", "vendition cash proceeds during the fourth quarter declined approximately $ 36 million or approximately $ 33,000 per salon compared to $ 49,000 per salon in the third quarter of fiscal ' 20 .", "the company is still committed to its conversion to an asset - light franchise business model and expects to substantially complete with the transition no later than the end of fiscal ' 21 , a few months later than we had originally expected .", "we do believe the economic uncertainty created by the pandemic has and may impact the number of salons to be sold , the pace of sales to franchises , and we expect proceeds per salon to continue to decline .", "however , given the lack of visibility related to the length or severity of the pandemic , it is not possible for us to predict the outcome of our refranchising .", "we do remain confident that we 'll get it done .", "however , the timing and cash proceeds are still uncertain .", "we have tried to be conservative in our estimates , and we 'll keep you posted as we gain more knowledge regarding the impact of the pandemic to refranchising in the months ahead .", "please remember salon proceeds are included in cash from investing activities so they are not included in the reconciliation of operating cash flows to adjusted ebitda .", "as hugh mentioned , in may , we amended our revolving credit facility that expires in march of 2023 .", "the amendment provided relief for the maximum consolidated net leverage covenant and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio .", "our liquidity position as of june 3 was $ 210 million .", "this includes $ 96.5 million of available revolver capacity and $ 114 million of cash .", "this compares to a liquidity position of $ 241.5 million as of march 31 , a reduction of $ 31 million or approximately $ 10 million per month .", "we continue to believe that the successful amendment of our credit facility will provide the long - term flexibility we need to see our strategy through to completion and enable us to successfully navigate the uncertainties caused by this pandemic .", "this is the pivotal event of fiscal ' 20 .", "and in my view , greatly increase the probability of our long - term success in this uncertain environment .", "please be aware that refinancing our credit facility was very challenging , but your management team and the credibility of our strategy both proved equal to the task .", "since the onset of the pandemic , i can report that we have greatly increased our internal focus on all liquidity matters .", "it has not always been easy , but we are being aggressive on all fronts to preserve cash until visibility improves .", "this includes , but is not limited to , an intense review of all company payables on a weekly basis .", "no dollar leaves the company without my personal approval .", "formalizing a company policy for collection of any past due amounts from our franchise partners .", "historically , regis has had very few problems with unpaid rent or royalties from our franchisees .", "however , we recognize that this risk exists in the new normal , and we intend to take appropriate steps to protect the interest of our shareholders .", "ongoing negotiations with our landlords to seek rent abatements , deferrals or permanent rent reductions , this aspect of cash management will not be a short -
