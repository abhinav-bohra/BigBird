leading transaction - based subscription program , movie club , to drive attendance .", "during the third quarter , we completed billing reactivation on all movie club accounts that were proactively paused for the past 1.5 years during the pandemic .", "in doing so , we have been extremely pleased by the minimal amount of churn we 've experienced , which represented only a modest 6 % dip in our pre-pandemic membership base that was largely driven by credit cards that expired during that timeframe .", "this dip was better than expected due to our member - first approach , and we 're already seeing new net positive movie club additions as we actively work to reattain those expired members as well as attract new ones .", "we 've also continued to further enhance movie club and recently introduced movie club platinum , an earned premium tier that provides our most frequent moviegoers with even bigger incentives .", "we expect this heightened tier will serve to further increase loyalty of our most active customers as well as stimulate incremental transactions .", "since we announced the launch of movie club platinum just over a month ago , 64 % of movie club members familiar with the program stated that they have been incentivized to achieve platinum status this year .", "another foray into simplifying and enhancing our customer experience while driving ancillary revenues is snacks in a tap , our recently launched online food and beverage ordering platform .", "this platform enables guests to skip the line and have their concessions ready for pickup upon arrival or delivered to their seats for a nominal fee .", "the added convenience and time savings provided by snacks in a tap have been extremely well received by our moviegoers , and we look forward to continuing to grow the program 's awareness and utilization in the months ahead .", "we 're also continuing our reintroduction of select expanded food and beverage options as a more consistent release cadence of stronger film content takes hold and moviegoer attendance increases .", "another exciting new business venture that we announced last week is our heightened focus on gaming initiatives , including our plan to hire a new vice president to forge strategic relationships and pursue content and licensing agreements in the gaming realm .", "gaming is the latest evolution in our ongoing focus to secure alternative content , further utilizing our auditoriums to supplement hollywood film content , and we have seen several promising indicators with regards to consumer interest in both spectator and participatory gaming events .", "additionally , we 're continuing to explore other alternative content offerings and have seen similar positive results from events such as professional wrestling with aew and wwe , boxing with triller fight club , movie premiers , special live q&a sessions with talent and concerts , all in addition to ongoing events provided by fathom entertainment .", "we 're also continuing to reap benefits from investments we 've made in premium amenities that enrich the moviegoing experience , which movie fans continue to seek out , including reclining seats with approximately 65 % of our entire domestic circuit featuring country loungers , the highest recliner penetration among the major theater operators .", "premium large -

over - quarter domestic attendance growth of 42.4 % to 21.5 million patrons .", "domestic admissions revenues were $ 195.3 million with an average ticket price of $ 9.08 .", "our average ticket price increased 14.1 % versus 3q ' 19 , primarily as a result of price increases and ticket type mix largely on account of fewer matinee and weekday showtimes .", "domestic concessions revenues were $ 142.6 million and yielded another all - time high food and beverage per cap of $ 6.63 .", "our third quarter per cap was roughly flat with 2q accrued 27 % compared to 3q ' 19 as pent - up moviegoing demand continues to drive a heightened indulgence in food and beverage consumption across our core concession categories and operating hours remain concentrated in timeframes that are more conducive to concession purchases .", "our third quarter results also benefited from ongoing strategic promotions and pricing initiatives , the reintroduction of various enhanced food offerings and recognition of previously deferred revenues associated with the issuance of loyalty points .", "domestic other revenues also continued to rebound during the quarter and grew 28.3 % to $ 37.6 million , driven by volume - related increases in screen ads , transaction fees and promotional income .", "altogether , third quarter total domestic revenues were $ 375.5 million , with positive adjusted ebitda of $ 44.8 million .", "internationally , we also continue to see material recovery in latin american box office and operating results during the third quarter .", "driven by expanded theater openings and increased availability of new film -- new commercial film content , our third quarter international attendance grew 128 % versus 2q ' 21 to 9.2 million patrons , which generated $ 30.2 million of admissions revenues and $ 21.6 million in concession revenues .", "total international revenues were $ 59.3 million and yielded adjusted ebitda that was just shy of breaking even for the quarter .", "globally , film rental and advertising expenses were 51.9 % of admissions revenues , which increased 200 basis points compared to 2q ' 21 .", "this increase was expected and resulted from a higher concentration of larger , more successful new film releases .", "that said , compared to the third quarter of 2019 , our film rental rate was still down 420 basis points , predominantly due to reduced film grosses as skew lower on our film rental scales .", "concession costs were 17.2 % of concessions revenues and were in line with both our second quarter results and pre-covid averages .", "third quarter global salaries and wages were $ 67.6 million and increased 34.1 % versus 2q ' 21 .", "this increase was driven by additional theater reopenings , extended operating hours to accommodate growing consumer demand and the reintroduction of select enhanced food and beverage options that require more labor .", "facility lease expenses were $ 68.8 million , and while largely fixed , experienced a modest uptick from the second quarter due to a slight increase in percentage rent in common area maintenance as volumes increased .", "worldwide utilities and other expenses were $ 81.8 million and increased 33.7 % quarter - over - quarter , driven by variable costs that grew in line with volume , such as credit card fees , janitorial expenses and commissions paid to third - party ticket sellers .", "utility expenses also increased as we expanded operating hours while other costs within this category , such as property taxes and property and liability insurance remained predominantly fixed .", "finally , g&a for the quarter was $ 38.6 million and remained considerably lower than pre-pandemic levels as a result of the restructuring actions we pursued in the second quarter of 2020 and our ongoing efforts to minimize nonessential operating expenditures .", "collectively , our worldwide adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was positive $ 44.3 million .", "as mark previously described , this result represents a significant milestone for our company as it was our first quarter of positive total company adjusted ebitda since the onset of the pandemic and our second consecutive quarter of material adjusted ebitda recovery .", "our net loss also materially improved in 3q to $ 77.8 million , reducing by $ 64.7 million quarter -

build projects that had been committed prior to the covid - 19 pandemic and $ 10.8 million was driven by investments and maintenance in our existing theaters .", "our consistent investment in proactively maintaining and enhancing our theaters over the years has enabled us to scale back capital expenditures in the near term without hindering our asset quality or guest satisfaction .", "as such , we continue to anticipate spending a highly reduced level of capex in 2021 relative to pre-pandemic ranges , which we previously estimated at approximately $ 100 million .", "however , due to varied supply chain constraints that have started impacting the delivery timing of certain equipment and supplies , we now anticipate capex may come in slightly below $ 100 million for the full year .", "that said , we do not expect these delays will have any adverse impact on our daily operations .", "in closing , we are thrilled with the positive momentum we continue to experience regarding the rebound of theatrical exhibition and our company 's financial results , and we are optimistic about the robust release calendar that lies ahead in the fourth quarter and beyond as well as further improvements in consumer moviegoing enthusiasm as the pandemic subsides .", "we are proud of the advancements our team has already made to set up cinemark for success in a post -
