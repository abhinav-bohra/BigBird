effective manner given our model .", "and while we are reducing expenses where appropriate , we continue to invest in products and capabilities that will further differentiate global payments in the future .", "there is no question the competitive environment will look different on the other side of this crisis , and we are poised to benefit in the long term due to the distinctiveness of our technology -

basis - point headwind from currency while adjusted operating margin improved 180 basis points to 45.4 % .", "before the spread of covid - 19 , we were experiencing low double - digit adjusted net revenue growth in this segment , excluding the impact of covid - 19 in asia pacific , which negatively impacted results consistent with the $ 15 million drag we had previously disclosed .", "this strength was largely attributable to our technology - enabled businesses , including global payments integrated , which was tracking toward mid-teens growth for the lion 's share of the quarter .", "this business continues to benefit from record new wins , strong same - store sales and low attrition rates driven by our ability to provide a truly integrated ecosystem across more vertical markets and more geographies than our peers .", "we also maintained our consistent track record of strong growth in our vertical market software portfolio ahead of the covid - 19 impact .", "as jeff and cameron indicated , booking trends across the portfolio remained strong with record achievements at several of our businesses during the period .", "our relationship - led businesses were also seeing good momentum outside of asia pacific before the spread of covid -

store volumes came under pressure , our e-commerce and omnichannel businesses served as a partial hedge .", "as cameron noted , we delivered strong growth in online sales at heartland during the quarter while in europe , we saw high single -

year period .", "as jeff mentioned , we saw a substantial benefit in early april from the processing of stimulus payments in this segment .", "in sum , we delivered solid operating performance across all our segments through outstanding execution , and we also benefited from the early and rapid cost actions we took to position our company given the current environment and for the eventual recovery .", "as it relates to cost actions , as jeff highlighted , we have already implemented expense initiatives that will translate to roughly $ 100 million per quarter in incremental cost benefits for the balance of 2020 .", "our focus has been to streamline discretionary spend that includes cuts to g&e and marketing budgets , reductions in executive pay and other salary initiatives and additional targeted actions across the organization .", "we have also been intentional about these measures to allow our strong growth momentum to continue when a more normalized operating environment resumes .", "from a cash flow standpoint for the quarter , we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $ 400 million , which was in line with our expectation .", "we also exited q1 with roughly $ 1.3 billion of available cash , including $ 640 million in excess of our operating cash needs .", "this excess cash increased approximately $ 300 million from year - end .", "we have adjusted our capital spending outlook for the year from the high $ 500 million to low $ 600 million range we talked about on our last call and now expect to be in the $ 400 million to $ 500 million range or roughly $ 100 million less for the year .", "we invested $ 105 million of cash in the first quarter that was focused on new products and technologies to ensure we continue to build upon our leading portfolio of pure -
