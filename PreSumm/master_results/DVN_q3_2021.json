day rates as high as 6,300 boe per day .", "in addition to the strong flow rates , this activity helped us prove the economics of the wolfcamp inventory in this area to further deepening the resource - rich opportunity we hold in the delaware .", "with the strong operating results we delivered this quarter , high - margin oil production in the delaware basin continue to expand and rapidly advance , growing 39 % year over year .", "importantly , the returns on invested capital to deliver this growth were some of the highest i have seen in my career , bolstered by rising strip prices and our capital efficiency improvements we have delivered this year .", "these efficiencies are evidenced on the right -

quality assets in the oil fairway of the u.s. that generates substantial free cash flow .", "while these assets do n't typically grab the headlines , their strong performance is central to this continued success of our strategy .", "these teams are doing great work to improve our environmental footprint , drive the capital program , optimize base production , and hopefully , keeping our cost structure low .", "as an example , williston will generate over $ 700 million of 2021 free cash flow .", "collectively , these assets are on pace to generate nearly $ 1.5 billion of free cash flow this year .", "lastly , on slide 17 , with our diversified portfolio concentrated in the very best u.s. resource plays , we have a deep inventory of opportunities that underpin the long - term sustainability of our business model .", "so , as you may have heard me talk about in prior quarters , we have a brutal capital allocation process in regards to the competitiveness of how we seek the best investment mix for the company .", "this is the first step of this process is to make sure that all the teams are working from the same assumptions and inputs .", "since the close of our merger earlier this year , we have undertaken a very disciplined and rigorous approach to characterize risk , force rank the opportunity set across our portfolio .", "this inventory disclosure is the result of our detailed subsurface work and evaluation across our portfolio that we converted into a single consolidated platform to ensure consistency .", "turning your attention to the middle bar on the chart .", "at the current pace of activity , we possess more than a decade of low - risk and high - return inventory of what we believe to be in a mid-cycle price deck .", "as you would expect , about 70 % of our inventory resides in the delaware basin , providing the depth of inventory to sustain our strong capital efficiency for many years to come .", "and this exercise , we are focused on compiling a very important slice of our total inventory .", "this summary is not meant to convey the full extent of the possible with these incredible resources .", "these are really operated , essentially all long lateral up - spaced wells that deliver competitive returns in a $ 55 oil environment .", "moving to the bar on the far right of the chart , we also expect inventory depth to continue to expand as we capture additional efficiencies , optimize spacing , and further delineate the rich geologic column across our very acreage footprint .", "expect -- we expect a significant portion of the upside opportunities to convert into our derisked inventory over time .", "so the examples of this upside include the massive resource potential in the lower wolfcamp intervals , continued appraisal success in the powder river basin and the significant liquids - rich opportunity we possess in the anadarko basin .", "the bottom line here is that we have that in abundance of high economic opportunity to not only sustain but grow our cash flow per share for many years to come .", "i 'd like to spend my time today discussing the substantial progress we 've made advancing our financial strategy and highlight the next steps we plan to take to increase cash returns to shareholders .", "a good place to start is with the review of devon 's financial performance in the third quarter , where devon 's earnings and our cash flow per share growth rapidly expanded and comfortably exceeded consensus estimates .", "operating cash flow for the third quarter totaled $ 1.6 billion , an impressive increase of 46 % compared to last quarter .", "this level of cash flow generation comfortably funded our capital spending requirements and generated $ 1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter .", "this result represents the highest amount of free cash flow generation devon has ever delivered in a single quarter and is a powerful example of the financial results in our cash return and that the business model can deliver .", "turning your attention to slide 7 .", "with this significant stream of free cash flow , a differentiating component of our financial strategy is our ability and willingness to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders through our fixed plus variable dividend framework .", "this dividend strategy has been uniquely designed to provide us the flexibility to optimize the return of cash to shareholders across a variety of market conditions through the cycle .", "under our framework , we pay a fixed dividend every quarter and evaluate a variable distribution of up to 50 % of the remaining free cash flow .", "so , with the strong financial results we delivered this quarter , the board approved a 71 % increase in our dividend payout versus last quarter to $ 0.84 per share .", "this is the fourth quarter in a row we have increased the dividend and is by far the highest quarterly dividend payout in devon 's 50 - year history .", "as you can see on the chart to the left , at current market prices , we expect our dividend growth story to only strengthen in 2022 .", "in fact , at today 's pricing , we are on pace to nearly double our dividend next year .", "in addition to higher dividends , we 've also returned value to shareholders through our efforts to reduce debt and improve our balance sheet .", "so far this year , we 've made significant progress toward this initiative by retiring over $ 1.2 billion of outstanding notes .", "in conjunction with this absolute debt reduction , we 've also added to our liquidity , building a $ 2.3 billion cash balance at quarter end .", "with this substantial cash build and reduction in debt , we 've reached this debt - to - ebitda leverage target of one turn or less .", "even with this advantaged balance sheet , we 're not done making improvements .", "we have identified additional opportunities to improve our financial strength by retiring approximately $ 1.0 billion of premium -- excuse me , low - premium debt in 2022 and 2023 .", "importantly , devon has the flexibility to then execute on this debt reduction with cash already accumulated on the balance sheet .", "while the top priority for free cash flow remains the funding of our market - leading dividend yield , we also believe that this buyback authorization provides us another excellent capital allocation tool to enhance per share results for shareholders .", "given the cyclical nature of our business , we 'll be very disciplined with this authorization , only transacting when our equity trades at a discounted valuation to historical multiples and in multiple levels of our highest quality peers .", "we believe the double - digit free cash flow yield our equity delivers , as outlined on slide 6 , represents a unique buying opportunity .", "the reduction in outstanding shares further improves our impressive cash flow per share growth and adds to the variable dividend per share for our shareholders .", "with these disciplined criteria , guiding our decision making , we 'll look to opportunistically repurchase our equity in the open market once our corporate blackout expires later this week .", "so in summary , the financial strategy is working well .", "we have excellent liquidity and our business is generating substantial free cash flow .", "we 're positioned to significantly grow our dividend payout to over the next year .", "the go - forward business will have an ultra low leverage ratio of a turn or less , and we 'll look to boost per share results is really opportunistically repurchasing our shares .", "in closing today , i 'd like to highlight a few things .", "number one , devon is meeting the demands of investors with our capital discipline , earnings and cash flow growth , market -
