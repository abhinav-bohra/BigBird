year study .", "the high - level summary of these results were that treating sleep apnea increases patient quality of life and extends quantity of life .", "it also showed the converse side in that not treating sleep apnea leads to a significantly higher incidence of heart attack , type 2 diabetes , and ischemic heart disease , leading to significantly higher healthcare costs treating those diseases and ultimately leading to earlier death .", "let me now turn from sleep apnea to a discussion of our respiratory care business , focusing on our strategy to better serve copd and asthma patients worldwide .", "our goal is to reach more patients in our core respiratory care markets , including non-invasive ventilation , as well as life support ventilation , as well as newer areas , including pharmaceutical drug delivery and high flow therapy .", "we make the smallest , quietest , and most comfortable devices on the market and they are all 100 % cloud connectable .", "we continue to see rapid adoption of the airview for ventilation software solution that we launched in europe in the midst of the peak of the covid -

hospital and out - of - hospital visits has impacted discharge rates that particularly affect the census at skilled nursing facilities and hospice .", "on the other hand , the flow of patients in home medical equipment and home health has been recovering well , even stronger .", "so as we look across our portfolio of out -
