related impacts is roughly $ 80 million , and that includes weaker petroleum products volumes and lower renewal rates on jones act tankers .", "those two items explain about 75 % of the variance , but there are a lot of other moving parts .", "a couple of the other larger items include lower gathering volumes , primarily in the eagle ford , and the impact on dcf of a ruby impairment .", "those two items are roughly offset by positive performance in the co2 segment , from higher co2 and oil volumes and price .", "finally , the sale of our 12.5 % interest on ngpl creates a negative variance versus our budget .", "the difference in that low and the high end of the guidance range primarily relates to assumptions on petroleum products volumes , jones act tanker renewals , natural gas gmp volumes , and the resolution of certain uri contractual disputes .", "i think it 's obvious , but just in case , the lower end of the guidance range assumes a more conservative outcome on these items .", "for example , the high end of the guidance range assumes petroleum products volume 3 % below plan for the balance of the year versus the low end of the guidance assumes they 're about 5 % below plan for the balance of the year .", "so for the first quarter of 2021 , as rich mentioned , we are declaring a dividend of $ 0.27 per share , which is 3 % up from last quarter .", "now looking at the financial performance for the first quarter of this year versus the first quarter of last year , we generated revenues of $ 5.2 billion , up $ 2.1 billion .", "we had partial offsets in our -- a partial offset in our cost of sales with an increase of $ 1.3 billion there .", "so our gross margin was up $ 759 million , mostly driven by our strong performance during the winter storm .", "our o&m costs declined as a result of the co2 segment power load shed that steve walked through .", "and that 's the main item in the $ 106 million favorable o&m amount .", "in the first quarter of 2020 , we also took impairments in our co2 segment of $ 950 million , which explains most of the $ 975 million favorable in the item -- the line item called gain and loss on divestitures and impairments .", "this past quarter , we wrote off the value of our ruby subordinated note , which was a reduction of $ 117 million in the earnings from equity investments .", "and that was driven by greater uncertainty regarding the recoverability of that note receivable .", "we also reflected a $ 206 million gain on the sale of a partial interest in ngpl , and that appears in the other net line item .", "so overall , we generated net income of $ 0.62 per share , which is very favorable versus the $ 0.14 loss in the first quarter of 2020 .", "on an adjusted earnings per share basis , and then that 's where we show earnings per share before certain items , we generated $ 0.60 per share versus $ 0.24 per share a year ago .", "moving to our segment ebda and distributable cash flow performance .", "our natural gas segment was up $ 915 million for the quarter , mostly explained by favorable intrastate margins as well as increased revenue on our tennessee gas pipeline , both as a result of the february winter storm performance .", "we also had favorable contributions from php , which was placed in service at the beginning of the year .", "and these are all partially offset by lower contributions from our fep pipeline resulting from the 2020 contract rollovers .", "product segment was down $ 10 million , driven by lower refined product volumes on sfpp , lower crude oil volumes on kmcc , and lower recontracting rates at hh , partially offset by greater contributions from our transmix business .", "our terminal segment was down $ 30 million .", "and that 's really refined product volumes due to continued pandemic -
