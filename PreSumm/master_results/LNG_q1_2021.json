on - year growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2020 , but net growth was modest as a healthy 17 % growth in u.s. exports was largely offset by declines at several lng facilities around the globe , which were either shut down or underperforming , including facilities in norway , nigeria , australia , trindad , tobago and russia .", "extreme cold weather in asia and then europe during the first quarter , combined with the supply constraints and a tight shipping market , caused unprecedented price spikes in jkm in the early part of the quarter to all -

established gas users with indigenous resources , which are mature and declining .", "data from wood mackenzie suggest that the region could lose more than 20 bcf a day of domestic output by 2040 , and while current upstream developments are considered unlikely to offset more than just a small fraction of that decline .", "in addition , gas demand in the region is currently expected to grow by at least 18 bcf a day during the period to 2040 , creating a gap of more than 35 bcf a day of gas , which we expect to be satisfied in large part by lng .", "again , for reference , 35 bcf a day is equivalent to approximately 250 million tons per annum of lng .", "lng demand growth across the various markets of south and southeast asia is in aggregate very significant .", "lng demand growth in south and southeast asia is expected to accelerate and potentially grow fivefold by 2040 , adding between 160 million and 200 million tons to global trade .", "we believe that over the next two decades , over 20 % of the growth in asian demand will come from china , and approximately 70 % will come from south and southeast asia as these countries prioritize gas over coal to secure economic growth and meet their climate goals .", "this region consumed over 17 % of global coal and was responsible for more than 1/3 of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 .", "while most net zero pledges came from outside the region , we believe that nations in south and southeast asia have been increasingly determined to improve environmental performance and find ways to fuel growth in a more environmentally sustainable manner .", "we see cheniere 's lng as a secure , reliable and cost - effective fuel for the region and which , along with renewables , will displace more polluting fuels .", "jack already touched on our leadership and initiatives in esg and i 'll just add that we are seeing increasing interest and engagement from both existing and potential customers on the environmental opportunities we are developing .", "cheniere stands ready to work with customers in the region and all over the world to create practical solutions that fit their commercial needs and satisfy global environmental imperatives .", "we believe our low emitting lng standards will play a role in supporting the region 's environmental goals and its energy priorities .", "i 'm pleased to be here today to review our first quarter financial results and key financial updates as well as our increased 2021 guidance .", "for the first quarter , we generated net income of $ 393 million , consolidated adjusted ebitda of approximately $ 1.5 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $ 750 million .", "our financial results for the first quarter were positively impacted by increased global lng prices and margins , particularly margins realized on spot and short - term cargoes sold through our marketing affiliate and a higher - than - normal contribution from lng and natural gas portfolio optimization activities due to significant volatility in lng and natural gas markets during the quarter .", "as we have discussed in prior quarters , our ipm agreements , certain gas supply agreements and certain forward sales of lng qualify as derivatives and require mark - to - market accounting meaning that from period to period , we will experience noncash gains and losses as movements occur in the underlying forward commodity curves .", "the impact of shifts in these curves on the fair value of our commodity and fx derivatives , during first quarter 2021 was a net loss of approximately $ 120 million , which was substantially all noncash .", "for the first quarter , we recognized an income 456 tbtu of physical lng , including 442 tbtu from our projects and 14 tbtu from third parties .", "84 % of these lng volumes recognized in income were sold under long -
