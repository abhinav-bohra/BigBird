to - quarter decline of roughly $ 70 million was largely driven by the changing impacts from covid that rick described in his comments .", "we were impacted by the deterioration in covid - related mortality from our reported 52,000 national deaths in the second quarter to approximately 94,000 in the third quarter along with the age demographic shifting to higher impacts on younger working -

to - quarter comparison .", "the uptick in the benefit ratio in the third quarter to 46.6 % from 44.2 % in the second quarter was driven by increased covid - related life insurance claims , which offset generally favorable results in the other vb product lines .", "finally , utilization in the dental and vision line improved , leading to an improvement in the benefit ratio to 75 % this quarter from 77.1 % in the second quarter .", "looking now at premium trends and drivers , total new sales for unum us increased 7.7 % in the third quarter on a year - over - year basis compared to the declines that we experienced in the first half of the year .", "for the employee benefit lines which do include ltd , std , group life , ad&d and stop - loss , total sales declined by 2.5 % this quarter , primarily driven by lower sales in a large case market and generally flat sales in the core market , which are those -- which are those markets under 2,000 [ phonetic ] lines .", "sales trends in our supplemental and voluntary lines rebounded strongly in the quarter , increasing 21.8 % in total when compared to the year ago quarter .", "we saw sharp year -

related claims incidence and higher average size .", "we did not see much impact this quarter from covid in our uk life block .", "benefits experience in unum poland was also favorable this quarter helping generate a slight improvement in adjusted operating income .", "premium growth for our international businesses was also favorable this quarter compared to a year ago .", "looking at the growth on a year - over - year basis and in local currency to neutralize the benefit we saw from the higher exchange rate , unum uk generated growth of 2.9 % with strong persistency and the continued successful placement of rate increases on our in - force block .", "additionally , sales in unum uk rebounded in the third quarter , increasing 40.2 % over last year .", "unum poland also generated growth of 12.5 % , a continuation of the low double -

based life insurance businesses , colonial 's life insurance block was negatively impacted by covid - related mortality , which was the primary driver in pushing the benefit ratio to 55.9 % in the third quarter compared to 51.7 % in the second quarter .", "we estimate that adverse covid - related claims experienced in the life block impacted results by approximately $ 16 million , the worst impact we have seen from covid throughout the pandemic and a level that is likely to persist through the fourth quarter .", "experience in the other lines being accident , sickness and disability and cancer and critical illness remained in line with our expectation and continue to drive strong earnings for this segment .", "additionally , net investment income increased 25 % on a sequential basis in the third quarter , largely reflecting unusually large bond call activity this quarter .", "we do not expect the benefit from bond calls to net investment income to continue at this level in the fourth quarter .", "we were very pleased with the improving trend we are seeing in premium growth for colonial life , which was flat this quarter on a year - over - year basis after showing year - over - year declines in each of the past three quarters .", "driving this improving trend in premiums is a continuing rebound in sales activity at colonial life increasing 28.6 % on a year - over - year basis this quarter and now showing a 21.1 % increase for the first three quarters of 2021 relative to last year .", "persistency for colonial life continues to show an encouraging trend at 78.9 % for the first three quarters of 2021 , more than a point higher than a year ago .", "in the closed block segment , adjusted operating income which does include -- which excludes the reserve assumption updates and the amortization of cost of reinsurance related to the closed block individual disability reinsurance transaction that did fully close earlier this year was $ 109.8 million in the third quarter and $ 111.2 million in the second quarter , both very strong results driven by favorable overall benefits experience in both the long - term care line and closed disability block , and strong levels of investment income to -- due to higher than expected levels of miscellaneous investment income , which i will cover in more detail in a moment .", "looking within the closed block , the ltc block continues to produce results that are quite favorable to our long -

term assumption range , as mortality and incidence trends continue to normalize from the impacts of covid .", "for the closed disability block , the interest adjusted loss ratio was 58.2 % in the third quarter compared to 69.6 % in the second quarter , both very favorable results for this line .", "the underlying experience on the retained block , which largely reflects the active life reserve cohort and certain other smaller claim blocks we retained performed very favorably relative to our expectations , primarily due to lower submitted claims again this quarter .", "so overall , it was a very strong performance again this quarter for the closed block segment .", "higher miscellaneous investment income continues to contribute to the strong adjusted operating income for the segment , driven by both higher than average bond call premiums , as well as strong performance in our alternative asset portfolio .", "looking ahead , we estimate the quarterly adjusted operating income for this segment will over time run within a range of $ 45 million to $ 55 million , assuming more normal trends for investment income and claim results in the ltc and closed disability lines .", "first , we saw a high level of bond calls again this quarter as many companies refinanced higher coupon debt and took advantage of today 's favorable credit market conditions .", "we recorded approximately $ 20 million in higher investment income from bond calls this quarter relative to our historic -- our historical quarterly averages .", "the closed block and colonial life segments were the primary beneficiaries of higher investment income this quarter .", "unum us was in line with historic averages , but lower this quarter than what we received in the second quarter .", "while these calls enhance current period investment income , they are volatile from quarter - to - quarter .", "second , we continue to see strong performance in our alternative investment portfolio , which earned $ 38.2 million in the third quarter , following earnings of $ 51.9 million recorded in the second quarter .", "both quarters are well above the expected quarterly income on the portfolio of $ 12 million to $ 14 million .", "the higher returns this quarter were generated from all three of our main sectors being credit , real estate and private equity , and reflected the strong financial markets and strong economic growth .", "it is hard to predict quarterly returns for miscellaneous investment income , but for the fourth quarter , we believe that they will moderate to our expected quarterly returns .", "moving now to capital , the financial of the company continues to be in great shape , providing a significant financial flexibility .", "the weighted average risk -
