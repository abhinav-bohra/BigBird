over - year pressure of about $ 11 million , in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year .", "even with the incremental spend , supply chain and operational issues that tempered our performance , we still achieved a robust 45 % organic flow - through .", "flow - through is then negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and fx , getting us to our reported flow - through of 39 % .", "as we highlighted , we expect to reinvest aggressively in the business to drive both organic and inorganic opportunities .", "we expect that our level of discretionary spending as well as associated costs from growth initiatives will similarly reduce organic flow -
