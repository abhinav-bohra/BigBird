an annualized basis while balancing our leverage target , growth opportunities and unit buybacks .", "turning to our results by segment and starting with ngl and refined products .", "adjusted ebitda was $ 739 million , compared to $ 703 million for the same period last year .", "this was primarily due to higher transportation and terminal services margins related to increased throughput at our nederland terminal in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as increased fractionation in refinery services margin .", "ngl transportation volumes on our wholly owned and joint venture pipelines increased to a record 1.9 million barrels per day , compared to 1.4 million barrels per day for the same period last year .", "this increase was primarily due to increased export volumes feeding into our nederland terminal from the initiation of service on our propane and ethane export projects , higher volumes from the permian and eagle ford regions as well as increased volumes on our mariner east pipeline system .", "and our fractionators also reached another record for the quarter .", "with average fractionated volumes of 895,000 barrels per day compared to 825,000 barrels per day for the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "for our crude oil segment , adjusted ebitda was $ 533 million , compared to $ 517 million for the same period last year .", "this was primarily due to higher crude oil transportation volumes out of the permian basin improved volumes through our nederland terminal and improved performance on our bakken and bayou bridge pipelines as a result of recovering volumes in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the addition of the enable assets .", "for midstream , adjusted ebitda was $ 547 million , compared to $ 390 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "this was primarily due to a $ 147 million increase related to favorable ngl and natural gas prices .", "in addition , our midstream segment also benefited from growth in the permian , south texas , and northeast , and the acquisition of the enable assets in december 2021 .", "gathered gas volumes were 14.8 million mmbtus per day , compared to 12.6 million mmbtus per day for the same period last year due to higher volumes in the permian , south texas , and northeast regions as well as addition of the enable assets in december of 2021 .", "permian basin volumes continue to be strong and midland volumes remain at or near record highs .", "as a result , we are expanding our permian bridge project and constructing our new grey wolf processing plant in the delaware basin .", "in our interstate segment , adjusted ebitda was $ 397 million , compared to $ 448 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "while volumes are beginning to improve , we did experience contract expirations at the end of 2020 on tiger and fep .", "and due to very mild temperatures throughout the midwest , we experienced lower demand on our panhandle and trunkline systems during the fourth quarter .", "however , these decreases were partially offset by increases on rover and tiger due to more favorable market conditions and to significant volume growth out of the haynesville .", "these results also include the enable assets in december of 2021 .", "we have seen steady growth recently in the interstate segment with the fourth quarter up more than 10 % over the third quarter of 2021 even without the impact of enable .", "for our intrastate segment , adjusted ebitda was $ 274 million , compared to $ 233 million in the fourth quarter of last year .", "this was primarily due to increased firm transportation volumes from the permian and south texas , the recognition of certain revenues related to winter storm uri and an increase in retained fuel revenues due to higher natural gas prices as well as the addition of the enable assets in december of 2021 .", "now turning to our 2022 adjusted ebitda guidance .", "with expectations for continued strong performance from our existing business as well as the addition of the enable assets , we expect our full year 2022 adjusted ebitda to be $ 11.8 billion to $ 12.2 billion .", "and moving to our 2022 growth capital expenditures .", "we expect growth capital expenditures , including expenditures related to the recently acquired enable assets to be between 1.6 billion and $ 1.9 billion , balanced primarily across the midstream ngl refined products and interstate segments .", "this number includes approximately $ 200 million of 2021 planned capital that has been deferred into 2022 as well as growth capital related to the recently acquired enable assets , in particular , gulf run pipeline .", "in addition , this includes newly approved projects in the permian basin that support growing natural gas production through new gathering and processing capacity , improved efficiencies and reduced emissions .", "these projects include construction of a new processing plant optimization of the oasis pipeline and modernization and debottlenecking of the existing system .", "the majority of these new projects are expected to provide strong returns and be completed at a six times multiple on average .", "now looking briefly at our liquidity position .", "as of december 31 , 2021 , total available liquidity under our revolving credit facility was slightly over $ 2 billion , and our leverage ratio was 3.07 % for the credit facility .", "during the fourth quarter , we utilized cash from operations to reduce our outstanding debt for approximately $ 400 million .", "and for full year 2021 , we reduced our long - term debt by approximately $ 6.3 billion .", "we expect to generate a significant amount of cash flow in 2022 , which will be strategically allocated in a manner that best positions us to continue to improve our leverage , invest in the growth of the partnership and return value to our unitholders .", "as we approach our leverage target range , we have taken our first steps toward returning additional capital to our equity holders through distribution growth , which we will continue to evaluate on a quarterly basis .", "in addition , we have increased our growth capital spend , as i mentioned earlier on the call , with this capital focused on strong returning projects that will be in service in less than 12 months .", "and we expect to continue to pay down debt throughout the year with excess cash flow from operations .", "during the fourth quarter , we continue to see volumes recover across many of our systems , including another record quarter for volumes in our ngl and refined

assets .", "and we continue to see growth across our ngl business segment , driven by increasing demand , both domestically and internationally .", "we have entered 2022 with a much stronger balance sheet than 2021 , and we 'll continue to place emphasis on financial flexibility and pay down debt in 2022 while continuing to position ourselves to return value to our unitholders .", "given the volume growth expected out of the permian basin , we have some attractive new projects underway that will address new demand , enhance the efficiency and flexibility of our existing asset base , and
