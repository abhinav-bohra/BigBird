over - year decline primarily reflects our ongoing discipline and controlling cost as well as the benefit of a leaner cost structure following business rationalization executed over the past several years .", "another key driver of sg&a productivity is the efficiency gains we continue to realize from operational excellence initiatives , leverage of our shared services model and technology investments , while t&e , bad debt and amortization expense were also lower year - over - year .", "these dynamics more than offset the elimination during the quarter of various temporary cost actions , which we had implemented this time last year in response to the pandemic .", "overall , our strong cost control , combined with improving sales and gross margin , drove favorable operating leverage in the quarter .", "as a result , adjusted ebitda grew over 14 % year -

to - date , we have generated record free cash of $ 191 million , which is up 25 % from prior year levels and represents 150 % of adjusted net income .", "given the strong cash flow performance of the quarter , we ended march with approximately $ 304 million of cash on hand .", "net leverage stood at 1.9 times adjusted ebitda at quarter end below the prior year level of 2.5 times in fiscal ' 21 second quarter level of 2.1 times .", "in addition , our revolver remains undrawn with approximately $ 250 million of capacity and additional $ 250 million accordion auction .", "combining with incremental capacity on our recently expanded ar securitization facility and uncommitted private placement shelf facility , our liquidity remains strong .", "this provides flexibility to fund incremental working capital requirements in the coming quarters as customer demand continues to improve as well as pursue strategic m&a , fund other growth initiatives and pay down additional debt where appropriate .", "in addition , given our improved outlook and solid liquidity position , we will look to deploy excess cash through opportunistic share buybacks and dividends as the cycle recovery continues to unfold .", "transitioning now to our outlook .", "based on month -

digit to low - teen organic growth in our service center segment and high single - digit to low double - digit organic growth in our fluid power & flow control segment .", "as a reminder , we will be fully lapping prior year weakness from the pandemic , which resulted in an 18.4 % organic sales decline in last year 's fiscal fourth quarter .", "in addition , this direction is meant to provide a starting framework on how fourth quarter sales could shape our trends followed almost seasonality going forward .", "while year - to - date sales trends have exceeded normal seasonality as the recovery has unfolded , we believe a prudent approach remains warranted as we continue to recover from an unprecedented downturn .", "in addition , as neil highlighted earlier , we remain mindful of increasing supply chain constraints across the industrial sector , which could influence the cadence and trajectory of activity near term .", "based on the 12 % to 13 % organic sales growth assumption , we believe a low double - digit to mid-teen incremental margin is an appropriate benchmark to use for our fourth quarter .", "this assumes gross margins moderate slightly on a sequential basis into the fourth quarter but continue to expand year - over - year .", "the sequential moderation primarily reflects considerations throughout service center segment mix as sales from larger strategic accounts continue to recover at a faster pace as compared to local accounts near term as well as slightly higher lifo expense .", "we remain focused on our internal margin initiatives and deploying countermeasures , including pricing actions in response to increasing supplier inflation .", "as it relates to operating expense , we expect sg&a to increase sequentially , reflecting higher incentive compensation , additional growth - related investment and the ongoing normalization of medical cost .", "we also have one additional payroll day in our fiscal fourth quarter this year versus our recent third quarter .", "we continue to take a balanced approach to managing our operating costs .", "our expense margin execution year - to - date is encouraging and provides strong indication of our potential going forward , including our target of mid- to high - teen incremental margins on average over an up cycle .", "that said , keep in mind that our incremental margins could vary over the next several quarters and into fiscal 2022 as we look to support our growth initiatives and we face the ongoing normalization of medical and selling - related expenses .", "lastly , from a cash flow perspective , we expect free cash to moderate into the fourth quarter as ar levels cyclical build and we replenish inventory at a greater pace in support of our growth opportunities and the recovery .", "we remain confident in our cash generation potential and reiterate our normalized annual free cash target reach to 100 % of net income over a cycle .", "as we close out fiscal 2021 , i 'm encouraged by what i see developing across our company .", "our value proposition , technical industry focus and expansion into emerging industrial solutions provides a clear path for favorable growth going forward .", "we have the most comprehensive portfolio and technical service capabilities , premier engineered solution expertise and greatest track record of consistency and commitment to this vital space .", "our local presence and ongoing talent investment provides further support to this foundation .", "now more than ever , these attributes are critical to suppliers and customers as they accelerate growth investments and solidify supply chains ahead of a potential extended up cycle .", "emerging signs of reshoring and investment in industrial infrastructure are promising and could represent notable tailwinds for our business , if they fully materialize , while our expanding automation footprint is presenting new growth opportunities in faster - growing and higher - margin industrial applications .", "and lastly , our cross-selling initiative remains in the early innings , but is gaining momentum with related business wins increasing and broader teams engaged .", "considering our embedded customer base , and addressable market exceeding $ 70 billion and growing , we believe this initiative represents a significant opportunity that should expand our share across both legacy and emerging market verticals in coming years .", "combined with our self -
