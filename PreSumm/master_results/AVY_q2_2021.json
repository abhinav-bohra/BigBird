based demand and the benefit from easier comparisons , given that the pandemic had the biggest impact on our results in q2 of last year .", "compared to 2019 , our growth has also been strong with organic sales up 11 % versus q2 2019 .", "our strong growth , combined with productivity gains , more than offset the headwind of last year 's temporary cost reduction actions as well as an increasing inflation and new organic investments to deliver an adjusted operating margin of 12.8 % , up 210 basis points from last year .", "we realized $ 17 million of net restructuring savings in the quarter , the majority of which represented carryover from projects we have pulled forward into 2020 .", "we also recorded two items , which largely offset each other in our gaap results in the quarter .", "the first is a gain related to the recovery of brazilian indirect taxes paid in previous years , and the second is a liability related to the previously disclosed ruling in the adasa legal matter , which the company disputes and remains confident in the prospects of a more favorable outcome upon appeal .", "now as mitch mentioned , supply chains remained tight and input costs have been increasing .", "both raw material and freight inflation were above our initial expectations , and we have continued to see costs rise as we entered the third quarter with expected sequential inflation in q3 at a mid- to high single - digit rate with variations by region and product category .", "we are addressing the cost increases through a combination of product reengineering and pricing and have announced additional price increases in most of our businesses and regions across the world .", "turning to cash generation and allocation .", "year - to - date , we 've generated $ 388 million of free cash flow with $ 206 million in the second quarter , up significantly compared to previous years .", "in the first half of the year , we paid $ 108 million in dividends and repurchased over 500,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $ 95 million , for a total of $ 203 million returned in cash to shareholders so far this year .", "and as i said earlier , our balance sheet is strong with a net debt -

value product categories and the base business .", "graphics and reflective sales continued to rebound nicely compared to the trough we saw in q2 of last year and were up 49 % organically .", "now similar to last quarter , we do believe that q2 benefited from customers pulling forward some volume from q3 , ahead of new price increases .", "looking at the segment 's organic sales growth in the quarter by region , north america sales were up high single digits .", "in western europe , sales were up mid-teens as demand in both regions increased from q1 .", "and emerging markets overall were up roughly 20 % , continuing their strength from the first quarter .", "the asia pacific region grew roughly 20 % , led by significant growth in india , in the asean region with easier comps , given the pandemic impacts we saw in q2 last year .", "and then low -- and then we had low double - digit growth in china .", "and latin america grew over 30 % with particular strength in brazil .", "and while lgm 's adjusted operating margin remained strong , it decreased slightly from last year to 14.5 % .", "this was partially driven by the impact of supply constraints , which led to both increase in inflation and some incremental costs in the quarter such as expedited freight and overtime to ensure we had supply to service our customers ' needs .", "shifting now to retail branding and information solutions , rbis sales were up 73 % ex currency and 72 % on an organic basis , as growth was strong in both the high - value categories and the base business due in part to lower prior year comps .", "compared to 2019 , organic growth was 14 % .", "the apparel business continued its strength as retailers and brands prepared for increasing demand with particular strength in the value and performance channels and continued double - digit growth in external embellishments .", "intelligent labels sales were up organically roughly 65 % and up 40 % compared to 2019 .", "adjusted operating margin for the segment increased to 13.1 % as the benefits from higher volume and productivity more than offset the headwind from prior year temporary cost reduction actions , higher employee -
