related as some of the overhauls budgeted for late last year and earlier this year took place on a delayed basis this quarter .", "we also had $ 2 million from lower bad debt expense in the second quarter of 2020 due to the recording of year -

term earnings growth .", "that 's because under pbr , earnings growth comes from three main sources : the annual revenue adjustment mechanism , which covers o&m and baseline capex and our ability to manage our spending within that allowance ; separate capex recovery mechanisms , such as eprm , exceptional project recovery mechanism and our renewable energy recovery mechanism ; and performance incentives .", "we still expect to realize 4 % to 5 % utility earnings growth , not including potential upside from pims starting in 2022 , the first full year of pbr .", "recovery of electrification of transportation and resilience projects could drive incremental growth from there .", "asb 's net income for the quarter was $ 30.3 million compared to $ 29.6 million last quarter and $ 14 million in the second quarter of 2020 .", "the negative provision for credit losses was the most significant driver of higher income .", "american grew net interest income , while non-interest income was lower compared to the same quarter last year , where we had higher gains on sale of securities , including a $ 7 million after - tax gain from the sale of visa class b restricted shares .", "now i 'll go through the drivers in more detail .", "on slide 12 , asb 's net interest margin expanded slightly during the quarter to 2.98 % from 2.95 % in the first quarter .", "fees related to ppp loans , lower amortization of investment premiums and a record low cost of funds helped soften the pressure from the low interest rate environment and continued strong deposit growth .", "we recognized $ 5 million in ppp fees in the second quarter as asb continues to actively assist customers through the forgiveness process .", "american anticipates a slight reduction in ppp fee recognition for the second half of the year and continued tapering in 2022 and thereafter .", "total deferred fees as of june 30 were $ 9.6 million .", "lower amortization of investment premiums this quarter was driven by a slower pace of repayments as a result of lower refinance activity .", "this quarter , we continue to see record low cost of funds at 0.07 % , down 1 basis point from the linked quarter and 11 basis points from the prior year .", "overall , we still expect that nim for the year will range from 2.8 % to 3 % .", "however , we anticipate that that balance sheet growth should still lead to net interest income in line with expectations for the year despite the continued low interest rate environment .", "in the second quarter , the allowance for credit losses declined $ 13.5 million , reflecting the improved local economy and credit quality with credit upgrades in the commercial loan portfolio , lower net charge - offs and lower reserve requirements related to the customer unsecured loan portfolio .", "the bank recorded a negative provision for credit losses of $ 12.2 million compared to a negative provision of $ 8.4 million in the first quarter and a provision expense of $ 15.1 million in the second quarter last year .", "asb 's net charge -
