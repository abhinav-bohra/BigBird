property performance , cash net operating income during the second quarter declined 1.6 % compared to last year .", "this was driven by a 4 % decline in revenues and a 7.8 % decline in expenses .", "as richard discussed earlier , we modified leases for certain customers to provide for temporary payment deferrals .", "adjusting for the impact of these deferrals , cash net operating income declined 0.1 % during the second quarter .", "beyond lease deferrals , the largest item driving our same - property performance is the physical occupancy within our buildings which remains significantly below pre-pandemic levels .", "fewer customers coming to the office mean fewer cars and as a result , same - property parking income was down 30 % compared to last year 's second quarter .", "this is comprised of a 12 % decline in contractual parking and a 76 % decline in transient parking .", "adjusting for the impact of both rent deferrals and reduced parking income , same property cash noi was up 3.7 % during the second quarter .", "for the balance of the year we anticipate cash same - property performance will likely stay negative , potentially troughing in the third quarter .", "in addition to continued rent deferrals and reduced parking demand , we are seeing some opportunities to execute lease extensions with existing customers that could pull forward free rent , which would impact cash noi .", "however , we believe these opportunities are positive long - term real estate decisions .", "before moving to external activities , i did want to touch on customer receivables .", "during the second quarter ffo was reduced by approximately $ 400,000 due to a combination of rent write - offs and an increase in our allowance for uncollectible rents .", "the comparable number for the first quarter was approximately $ 500,000 .", "these numbers are tied to specific customers and leases .", "no general covid - 19 reserve has been taken to date .", "to put these numbers in perspective , charges related to collectability averaged approximately $ 170,000 per quarter during 2019 .", "we closed one acquisition during the second quarter , the purchase of 1,550 space parking deck in uptown charlotte for $ 85 million .", "we also closed a one - year extension of the existing construction loan on our carolina square property in north carolina during the second quarter .", "not only did we extend the maturity of this loan , we also reduced the interest spread from 190 basis points to 125 basis points and eliminated our repayment guarantee .", "with this extension we 've no further debt maturities for the remainder of 2020 .", "looking at the balance sheet , we entered this period of volatility with exceptional financial strength , among the very best of our office peers .", "not only do we have low leverage , our liquidity position of over $ 1 billion at the end of the quarter represented over 15 % of our total market cap at quarter - end and is more than enough to fund the remaining $ 160 million necessary to complete our current development pipeline .", "looking forward , our 2020 outlook remains generally in line with the information we gave in our previous earnings call in april .", "assumptions around the impact of covid - 19 on speculative leasing and rent deferrals remains within the ranges we provided .", "first , we currently anticipate the parking deck that we purchased in early may to generate net operating income of between $ 1.5 million and $ 2 million during calendar year 2020 .", "to be clear , this is a pro-rata number and represents just under eight months of our ownership .", "it 's not an annualized number .", "in addition , this number is not a stabilized figure .", "it reflects our current belief that the physical occupancy of our buildings and the commensurate parking income will continue to be significantly impacted by the covid - 19 pandemic through the end of 2020 .", "we anticipate the annual stabilized noi on this parking deck to be between $ 4.5 million and $ 5 million going forward .", "second , we continue to take a hard look at our general and administrative expenses .", "prior to covid - 19 , our g&a load was already exceptionally low and we have taken steps to reduce it even further .", "our current 2020 forecast assumes corporate g&a expenses net of capitalized salaries of between $ 27 million and $ 29 million .", "on both an absolute basis and as a percentage of enterprise value this range represents a very low cost to our shareholders .", "third , when we provided information around parking revenues in april , our range was primarily driven by the duration of the pandemic 's impact on our portfolio's physical occupancy .", "the low end of the range assumed we would start to see an improvement in occupancy beginning early in the third quarter while the high end of the range assumed improvement would n't take place until year - end .", "as we sit here at the end of july at 15 % fiscal occupancy , we clearly need to adjust low end of our range in this metric .", "finally , we have now completed the lease amendment with parsley energy at colorado tower that we discussed in our last earnings call .", "upon finalization of the accounting treatment , the amendment was deemed a lease modification rather than a termination .", "the total earnings impact of the amendment remains unchanged at $ 2.1 million .", "however , it 's the timing of that impact that 's now spread out over the remaining term of parsley 's retained space .", "specifically , instead of recognizing $ 2 million as a termination fee in 2020 and an additional termination fee of $ 100,000 in 2021 , we will recognize $ 300,000 as property level noi in 2020 and $ 1.8 million as property noi over the course of the remaining lease term through mid-2025 .", "when taken together , we anticipate these four changes will net each other out in our 2020 earnings .", "the positive impact of the parking deck purchase of approximately $ 1.7 million , if you use the midpoint of our guidance , combined with a reduction in g&a of $ 1 million equals the negative earnings impact of accounting for the parsley lease as a modification and the commensurate $ 1.7 million reduction and the adjusted range in parking revenue of $ 1 million , again at the midpoint ."], "summary_gold": "cousins properties releases second quarter 2020 results .<q>cousins properties inc quarterly funds from operations per share was $ 0.66 .", "summary_pred": "you will recall that our second quarter leasing activity did include the previously announced 74,000 square foot new lease with dla piper at colorado tower in austin .<q>but we still expect most of our activity in the coming quarters will likely fall into the renewal category .<q>as i mentioned last quarter , this global law firm will occupy space currently leased by parsley energy with planned phased commitment starting early next year .<q>if you did not receive a copy , these documents are available through the quarterly disclosures and supplemental sec information link on the investor relations page of our website .<q>rest assured , we are approaching all new leasing opportunities aggressively and there are some out there .<q>in particular , there are significant risk and uncertainties related to the scope , severity and duration of the covid -
