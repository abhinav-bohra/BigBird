the - line fx impact and certain costs incurred in our debt refinancing .", "during the third quarter , we took advantage of the favorable debt markets to solidify our liquidity and financial flexibility for years ahead by prefunding upcoming debt maturities .", "we amended and restated flowserve 's senior credit facility by extending the maturity of our revolving credit facility by two years and enhancing the financial flexibility we have under it as well as lowering the ongoing commitment fees and including sustainability -

absorption particularly at our engineer - to - order sites in both segments , the other previously mentioned disruptive impacts as well as higher logistics costs , which increased 25 % year - over - year .", "these headwinds were partially offset by a 3 % mix shift toward higher - margin aftermarket sales .", "on a reported basis , the gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 29.3 % was driven by the factors previously mentioned and were partially mitigated by the $ 3 million decrease in realignment charges versus prior year .", "third quarter adjusted sg&a increased $ 7.4 million to $ 200 million versus prior year , primarily due to a $ 3 million increase in expense related to our incurred but not reported potential reserves , increased r&d spending and the return from travel costs which were a temporary benefit in 2020 as well as headwinds from foreign exchange .", "reported sg&a was flat to the prior period , and these increases were offset by a $ 7 million decrease in adjusted items and disciplined cost control offset the return of some of last year 's temporary cost benefits .", "third quarter adjusted operating margins of 7 % decreased 390 basis points year - over - year as did fpd 's adjusted operating margin , primarily due to increased under- absorption related to a 20 % oe revenue decline .", "fpd 's adjusted operating margin decreased 170 basis points year - over - year to 10.5 % due to sales mix and slightly higher sg&a as a percent of sales .", "we expect that sales volume normalize , that margins will improve .", "and to that point , had flowserve not experienced the $ 60 million revenue deferral , our adjusted operating margins would have been flat to modestly up on a sequential basis .", "third quarter reported operating margin decreased 280 basis points year - over - year to 6.6 % , where the previously discussed challenges more than offset the $ 10 million reduction of adjusted items .", "our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 15.2 % was driven by our income mix globally and favorable resolution of certain foreign audits in the quarter .", "the full year adjusted tax rate is expected to normalize in the 20 % range .", "turning to cash and liquidity .", "our third quarter cash balance of $ 1.5 billion reflected the debt refinancing discussed earlier as well as solid cash flow performance in the quarter .", "our net debt position of $ 652 million at the end of the third quarter has declined by over $ 300 million in the last three years .", "we believe a bright spot in our third quarter financial results is our continued progress on cash flow .", "on a year -

to - date .", "and with our typically seasonally strong fourth quarter ahead , we are confident in our ability to stay on pace to deliver a free cash flow conversion of over 100 % of our adjusted net income once again in 2021 .", "working capital was a cash source of $ 56 million in the third quarter and a $ 47 million increase versus last year .", "accrued liabilities , prepaid expense and continued improvements in our accounts receivable process were the major contributors this quarter .", "as a percentage of sales , primary working capital saw a modest 40 basis point sequential increase to 29.8 % due primarily to the market disruptions in the quarter .", "both dso and inventory turns were roughly flat sequentially .", "i would also like to highlight our disciplined inventory management .", "for the third consecutive quarter , our combined balance of inventory and contract assets and liabilities decreased while backlog continued to increase and despite holding elevated work in process and finished goods inventory at quarter end due to the logistics challenges .", "since year - end 2020 , backlog has increased $ 115 million , while inventory and contract assets and liabilities have declined $ 16 million .", "major uses in the third quarter include dividends and capex of $ 26 million and $ 11 million , respectively .", "as i just mentioned , we also contributed $ 20 million to our u.s. cash balance pension plan to keep it largely fully funded .", "in the fourth quarter , major uses expected include the completed retirement of the 2022 and 2023 senior notes , the $ 26 million october dividend and a higher level of capex spend .", "turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2021 .", "based on the supply chain and logistics challenges that arose and accelerated late in the quarter , its impact on our third quarter earnings and the expectations that these conditions will persist , flowserve revised our full year 2021 revenue and earnings per share guidance ranges .", "we now expect a full year revenue decline of 3.5 % to 4.5 % and reported an adjusted full year earnings per share of $ 1.05 to $ 1.10 and $ 1.40 to $ 1.45 , respectively .", "to briefly cover our thought process , we expect the revenues and income that were deferred out of the third quarter to be largely realized in the fourth quarter .", "however , we expect the challenges of the third quarter to continue industrywide for the next few quarters .", "so we are assuming the fourth quarter has a similar deferred revenue impact to what we just experienced .", "this , coupled with the impact of the strengthening dollar on our non-u.s. denominated sales , particularly the euro , resulted in us lowering our expectations for full year 2021 revenue .", "we do expect that the fourth quarter will have the traditional flowserve fourth quarter seasonality with strong revenue conversion .", "however , we do not expect that revenue and the associated profit will be fully caught up at year - end .", "our adjusted earnings per share range continues to exclude expected realignment expenses as well as below - the - line foreign currency effects and the impact of other potential discrete items which may occur during the year , such as the premium and fees incurred to retire the notes .", "in terms of other guidance metrics , our net interest expense remains unchanged at $ 55 million to $ 60 million and we modestly lowered our full year adjusted tax rate guidance to approximately 20 % .", "from a bookings standpoint , we now expect full year 2021 bookings to increase in the 10 % range year - over - year .", "additionally , we continue to expect the majority of this increase will come from our aftermarket and shorter - cycle mro original equipment products .", "the major categories of our full year cash usages include the october debt retirement , dividends and share repurchases of roughly $ 120 million , capital expenditures in the $ 65 million range , the third quarter 's pension contribution and the funding of our now modest realignment programs .", "in conclusion , while our third quarter was impacted by supply chain , logistics and labor headwinds , we view these primarily as transitory .", "the backdrop for our traditional markets looks positive .", "there is an increasing interest in our energy transition offerings , and we continue to build momentum in our operational and cash flow progress .", "with a solid and growing backlog and expected progress by the broader industry in managing the supply chain and logistics headwinds , we believe that flowserve is well positioned to deliver earnings growth in 2022 .", "before addressing our outlook for the remainder of the year and some early thoughts on 2022 , let me first provide an update on our strategic initiatives .", "while current conditions are increasingly favorable for our traditional energy markets , we are taking steps to best position the company for the energy transition that is already underway and which presents a significant long -
