over - year by $ 17 million delivering a $ 0.04 positive impact to adjusted eps , as we have used proceeds from completed divestitures in fiscal 2020 and our strong cash flow to reduce debt .", "the impact from the adjusted tax rate was nominal , completing the bridge to $ 0.84 per share .", "in meals & beverages , net sales increased 6 % to $ 1.3 billion , primarily reflecting strong volume growth , driven by in -

19 related restrictions .", "net sales of u.s. soup , including pacific foods , increased 10 % compared to the prior year , primarily due to volume gains in condensed soups and ready - to - serve soups .", "across the division , we moderated promotional activity in part due to supply constraints , particularly on broth .", "operating earnings for meals & beverages increased 7 % to $ 258 million .", "the increase was primarily driven by sales volume growth , offset partially by a lower gross margin and higher administrative expenses .", "within snacks , net sales increased 4 % driven by volume gains fueled by the majority of our power brands and lower levels of promotional spending on supply constrained brands .", "the sales gains were driven by our salty snacks brands within the power brand portfolio namely kettle brand potato chips , late july snacks , cape cod potato chips and pop secret popcorn as well as our fresh bakery products including pepperidge farm farmhouse products .", "partially offsetting sales gains were declines in partner brands within the snyder 's - lance portfolio as well as declines in lance sandwich crackers , resulting from supply constraints in the quarter .", "operating earnings for snacks increased 6 % driven by sales volume gains and lower selling expenses , partially offset by higher marketing investment , administrative expenses and a lower gross margin .", "i 'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity .", "fiscal year - to - date cash flow from operations decreased from $ 663 million in the prior year to $ 611 million , as changes in working capital were only partially offset by higher cash earnings .", "although we continued to make progress on working capital , we are lapping significant benefits in accounts payable in the prior year .", "our year - to - date cash from investing activities was largely reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $ 132 million , which was $ 35 million lower than the prior year , primarily driven by discontinued operations .", "our year - to - date cash outflows for financing activities were $ 405 million , reflecting cash outlays due to dividends paid of $ 215 million , which were comparable to the prior year , reflecting a quarterly dividend of $ 0.35 per share .", "in december , we announced an increase in the quarterly dividend to $ 0.37 per share or an increase of 6 % , which from a cash flow perspective , will be reflected in the third quarter .", "additionally , we reduced our debt by $ 176 million .", "we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $ 946 million .", "we expect to utilize the majority of this cash during the second half of the fiscal year for repayment of upcoming debt maturities of $ 721 million and $ 200 million in march and may respectively .", "we expect net sales for fiscal 2021 to declined 3.5 % to 2.5 % .", "excluding the impact from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 and impact of the european chips divestiture , we expect organic net sales to decline 1.5 % to 0.5 % .", "we expect adjusted ebit of minus 1 % to plus 1 % as we will lap that initial covid - 19 demand surge in the second half of our fiscal year , combined with headwinds from increased promotional activity , partially offset by lower year - over - year covid - 19 related expenses and last year 's one - time marketing investments .", "we continue to expect net interest expense of $ 215 million to $ 220 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24 % .", "as a result , we expect adjusted earnings per share of $ 3.03 to $ 3.11 per share , representing year - over - year growth of 3 % to 5 % .", "the earnings per share impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 was estimated to be $ 0.04 per share .", "with respect to our guidance , let me add that we expect the third quarter to be somewhat more challenged from a net sales and ebit perspective than q4 , as the before mentioned covid - 19 related demand surge was more pronounced in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 while the benefit from covid - 19 related costs and one - time marketing investments will disproportionately benefit our fourth quarter comparison .", "additionally , we expect our third quarter to be impacted by some isolated supply challenges as we navigate the recent winter storms .", "in particular , we experienced about two weeks of disruption at our paris , texas plant , which produces pace and prego .", "we expect improving momentum as we go forward .", "regarding capital expenditures ; in light of the current operating environment with limited access to our factories , we now expect to spend 10 % below the $ 350 million we had previously indicated for the full year , largely driven by the impacts from covid - 19 on the operating environment .", "we delivered another strong quarter with a return to positive share growth in the majority of our portfolio and growth in all three key financial metrics , despite all the challenges of covid - 19 .", "before we conclude , i want to share my perspective on the key factors underpinning our confidence in our outlook beyond the pandemic .", "by now , i know you 've heard a great deal about the stickiness of all new households gain throughout the pandemic from essentially all of our peers with a wide range of data and facts supporting that thesis .", "we very much agree and we see similar trends in our own research and data .", "i 'd like to conclude today with three critical and differentiating points , key factors that served to underscore campbell 's advantage position going forward and will fuel our future growth trajectory .", "importantly , two of them have very little to do with covid - 19 or the stickiness of new households .", "the first is our snacks business which , as i mentioned earlier , consists of a unique and differentiated portfolio of brands that represent approximately 50 % of the company 's annual revenues .", "this business was growing before and a pandemic and we expect to sustain or exceed those historical growth rates going forward .", "snacks also includes a margin structure , which we believe still has significant opportunity for improvement versus the snacking peer group average , even after we deliver our current value capture .", "we are finalizing our plans to unlock more value and we look forward to sharing more details with you as we move forward .", "second , no matter where you stand on the retention of new households gained during the pandemic , it is undisputable that campbell 's business , particularly our meals & beverages division and especially soup is coming out of this period more advantaged and with renewed relevance .", "nearly 13 million new households purchased campbell soup since the initial peak of the pandemic , of which almost a third are millennials , outpacing both key competitors and the category average .", "we have also seen macro behaviors like quick - scratch cooking take root and our research indicates more than 30 % of the consumers are cooking more with soup since the start of the pandemic .", "additionally , we believe increased at home lunches will endure as many people are expected to work from home more often post pandemic .", "beyond the role that our meals & beverages offerings play in the lunch occasion , snack - foods accompany nearly 30 % of all lunches , which bodes well for our entire portfolio .", "we 've conducted extensive consumer research in an effort to determine sentiment , model consumer behavior exiting the pandemic , and sharpen our plans to ensure the sustainability of our recent gains .", "the consumers who we 've surveyed had an overall high level of satisfaction with campbell 's products in our meals & beverages and snacks portfolio .", "in fact , about four out of five new users surveyed said they were very or extremely satisfied with our brands .", "as a result of this high satisfaction , those surveyed told us they 'll continue to count on our brands going forward , turning to us for things like cooking solutions and quick lunches and meals .", "this gives us every reason to believe consumers will continue to purchase our brands well after the pandemic .", "even more importantly , 70 % of the consumers surveyed told us our brands better met their needs than competitive products .", "these same consumers also told us that taste and convenience of our brands were the top drivers of overall satisfaction .", "we feel this sets us up well for continued share progress going forward .", "the research also has provided us with actionable insights in our opportunities to strengthen the retention of our consumers .", "these include areas such as adding more convenient packaging options and sizes across our portfolio , developing new and inspiring recipes and satisfying consumer 's need for permissible and more intense snacks by providing a variety of flavors and healthier ingredients .", "this specificity will focus our plans and innovation to target the areas with the highest probabilities of retaining these new consumers , particularly younger consumers for our brands .", "for the third and final differentiating point that underscores our strong position going forward , we look to the strength of our balance sheet .", "given the cash generative nature of our business and our reduce leverage , which is now below 3 times , we are well positioned to generate significant cash flow , well above our ongoing commitment to base capital investments and dividends in the next three years .", "this can and will be a source of opportunity that can be invested in high roi initiatives or other actions to drive value creation .", "so to wrap it up .", "number one , sustain or accelerate our historical snacks growth while improving margins ; number 2 , solidify our meals & beverages business as a steady and stable contributor behind recent transformational consumer trends and trial ; and number 3 , deploy what will be significant capital to fuel this growth and create differentiated value .", "we look forward to sharing more in the months ahead about this next chapter as campbell moves from turnaround to sustainable growth ."], "summary_gold": "compname reports q2 adjusted earnings per share $ 0.84 .<q>q2 adjusted earnings per share $ 0.84 from continuing operations excluding items .<q>q2 adjusted earnings per share $ 1.86 excluding items .<q>fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $ 3.03 to $ 3.11 .<q>qtrly net sales , both reported and organic , increased 5 % to $ 2.28 billion .<q>sees fy2021 net sales from continuing operations down 3.5 % to down 2.5 % .<q>sees fy2021 organic net sales from continuing operations down 1.5 % to down 0.5 % .<q>campbell soup -
