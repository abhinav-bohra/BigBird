end active pass base .", "that being said , because we extended our 2020 season passes through the end of 2021 , our active pass base , as of today , is down less than 10 % versus the same day last year , which preceded the pandemic 's impact .", "we believe this represents a more meaningful comparison for our active pass base heading into the 2021 operating season as we believe the season pass holders and members who were extended will visit our parks in 2021 .", "looking ahead , we expect the active pass base trends to continue to improve as we start selling more new passes and memberships .", "deferred revenue as of december 31 , 2020 was $ 205 million , up $ 61 million or 42 % to prior year as we expect to recognize most of this deferred revenue in 2021 .", "the increase was primarily due to the deferral of revenue from members and season pass holders whose benefits were extended through 2021 , partially offset by lower new season pass and membership sales .", "total capital expenditures for the year were $ 98 million , a reduction of 30 % from 2019 .", "we expect our 2021 capital spend to be slightly lower than 2020 due to the carryover of new rides that were delivered and paid for , but not commissioned in 2020 .", "our liquidity position , as of december 31 , was $ 618 million .", "this included $ 460 million of available revolver capacity , net of $ 21 million of letters of credit and $ 158 billion of cash .", "this compares to a liquidity position of $ 673 million as of september 30 , 2020 .", "net cash outflow for the quarter was $ 56 million , representing an average of $ 19 million per month .", "as a reminder , our net cash outflow in the fourth quarter included partnership park distributions that represented an average of $ 7 million per month .", "our fourth quarter cash flow benefited by $ 8 million from the sale of some excess land in new jersey , which was not in our prior estimates .", "without the landfill , our net cash outflow was $ 21 million per month , an improvement from our prior estimates of $ 25 million to $ 30 million .", "we historically experienced significant cash outflow in the first quarter of the year as the majority of our parks are closed , yet , we incurred an elevated operating and capital expenditures to prepare for our parks opening in the spring .", "we estimate that our net cash outflow in the first quarter of 2021 will be higher than normal or approximately $ 53 million to $ 58 million per month .", "this is primarily due to three things .", "first , the normal seasonality of our business .", "second , the timing of interest payments on our newly issued $ 725 million of senior secured debt .", "and , third , the pandemic -
