term trend .", "i am encouraged by the uptick in orders in april and pipeline of new opportunities .", "second , we knew industrial ppe revenue in the quarter would provide a challenging comparison .", "we did not start to see the impact of the pandemic until april a year ago in the industrial ppe lines .", "turning to page and looking at the first quarter of this year , we had a slow start in january and february but we saw return to growth in march and april .", "orders across these areas were up 9 % in march and were up double digits in april versus a year ago .", "we know the pace of deliveries and revenue performance could be impacted by the challenges in our supply chain but i am especially encouraged by the improvement in demand levels across our international or -- i 'm sorry , our industrial -

critical nature of our products provides a healthy outlook for the fire service business .", "gross profit declined 240 basis points from a year ago .", "the decline is related to three primary areas : first , lower demand led to lower throughput in our factories , which drove inefficiencies and inventory charges .", "the inventory charges were primarily related to lower demand for respiratory protection .", "second , a less favorable product mix and higher input costs impacted margins .", "we 've made adjustments to certain pricing actions already , and we will continue to evaluate additional pricing opportunities as we navigate the inflationary pressures .", "and last , our bristol turnout gear business was about 50 basis points dilutive to overall gross profit .", "gross margins for turnout gear are lower than our corporate average .", "and that said , we expect to improve bristol margins as we execute our integration plans .", "now i 'll shift to sg&a expense .", "our expense of $ 75 million was down 6 % or about $ 5 million from a year ago , and this includes $ 2 million of costs associated with the recent acquisition of bristol .", "we delivered $ 7 million to $ 8 million of savings from restructuring programs and discretionary cost savings associated with reduced travel , controlled hiring , professional services and other costs .", "about half of these savings are temporary , and i expect these will return to some extent as the business improve and travel opens up .", "the other half , however , of the savings are structural in nature .", "overall , i remain confident in our ability to deliver the cost savings we 've committed to for 2021 across the income statement .", "in the second quarter , we will continue to manage our cost structure very closely .", "however , we expect the year - over - year sg&a comp to become more difficult .", "i say that because our sg&a in the second quarter of 2020 was $ 69 million , and that number reflects the initial cost reduction activities that occurred at the onset of the pandemic .", "our quarterly adjusted operating margin was down 330 basis points on the gross profit headwinds and overall lower revenue volume .", "looking at our segment performance , international margins were down 270 basis points to about 8.8 % of sales .", "what we 're seeing here is the impact of the lower revenue .", "our cost reductions and pricing programs remain very much on track .", "but it 's difficult to get leverage on the double - digit sales decline .", "bristol , which is our operating -- which is in our international reporting segment , was dilutive to the international margins by about 120 basis points .", "and looking ahead , i know we remain well positioned in this area .", "i say that because i believe we will see continued margin expansion in the international segment as the volume comes back online and covid lockdowns ease .", "americas margins were down about 420 basis points to 21.7 % .", "the gross profit challenges that i mentioned previously drove this decline .", "we are focused on driving improvements in our americas segment margin performance , and i am confident in our ability to drive improvements in this area going forward .", "from a cash flow and capital allocation perspective , quarterly free cash flow conversion was about 100 % of net income .", "in fact , operating cash flow was up more than 200 % compared to a year ago .", "we generated strong cash flow despite the p&l challenges , and i 'm encouraged by the strong performance across working capital , which declined about 100 basis points as a percentage of sales from year - end without the impact of bristol .", "as i 've noted on many different occasions , growth continues to be a top priority in our capital allocation strategies .", "we deployed $ 63 million for the bristol acquisition in the first quarter , and leverage remains very healthy at 0.7 times ebitda on a net basis .", "we remain active in pursuing m&a opportunities as well as funding organic projects that drive long - term growth for msa .", "as we look ahead , we 're operating in a very dynamic environment .", "there are a number of evolving factors that will continue to influence our revenue outlook .", "these factors include , among other things , the effectiveness of the vaccine rollout , risk of additional covid lockdowns , industrial employment rates , the pace of economic recovery and the extent of supply chain challenges as economies open back up .", "collectively , all of these variables make the outcome very hard to predict , but we know our order trends have improved in march and april , and they 've improved across a number of key areas in our business .", "so today , i do have a greater sense of confidence heading into the second quarter .", "to wrap up , my optimism is based upon our march and april order book performance .", "while near -
