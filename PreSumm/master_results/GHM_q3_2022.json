80 work is not a true first article job for us , the lack of process documentation from the previous work combined with severe labor challenges and use of contract welders new to the equipment caused challenges on the carrier work as well .", "even as we work to catch up on hours , our equipment became the pacing item associated with our nation 's most strategic ship and submarine build schedules .", "the pressure to expedite was extreme .", "let 's turn to page 5 .", "the chart on page 5 shows our labor plan with blue bars , our actual labor , application in gray bars , and the resulting deficit of hours caused by actual being less than our planned hourly expenditure .", "the depth of our deficit occurred around may of 2021 .", "in past calls , we talked about redirecting commercial welders to navy and hiring contract welders to address this deficit .", "in third quarter , we redirected even more commercial welders , outsourced more commercial work , hired more contract welders and even added some of our new welders that completed our training programs .", "these actions help to reverse the navy labor deficit , but they came at additional costs .", "outsourcing commercial work results in less margin .", "we also realized less third quarter revenue as the outsourced suppliers were not able to ramp up quickly .", "the contract welder costs were high , the specialized training required by the navy took a long time and retention of the contract welders was poor .", "ultimately , we 've been able to reduce our navy program labor deficit by doubling our navy workforce , mitigating the schedule slips and keeping our customer relationship strong .", "the deficit should be erased in the first half of fiscal ' 23 , but we expect to start reducing high - cost contract welders as we enter the next fiscal year .", "in the end , the actions we took to stay on track in the last quarter resulted in revising estimates on labor hours and material , and we booked loss conversion costs that were recorded in the quarter and impacted our results as well .", "jeff will cover that detail in the financial briefing .", "certainly , we 've learned a lot from this experience and have or will institute corrective and preventative actions to ensure that we continue to grow our navy business and can deliver quality products in a timely fashion and earn a fair return for our efforts .", "our customers have been very appreciative of our efforts and we do not see any negative consequences if we hold current deliveries .", "this equipment is built into the bowels of these ships , and they will never come out .", "thus , quality is paramount and graham has not disappointed .", "as we catch up on these programs and reduce our labor deficit , we can reclaim margins by eliminating contract welders , reassigning our commercial welders back to our commercial product and reduce the outsourcing that we 're doing today .", "our people pipeline continues to be critical , and our welder training program will be continued .", "looking back , we could have done a better job in predicting and mitigating the situation with better developed fp&a , financial planning and analysis , and project management skills .", "we are adding new talent with defense expertise in batavia to better manage these processes .", "in fact , we 're adding a new position and batavia will have a navy business leader beginning february 28 .", "as we look forward , our processes need to advance to enable our ability to document and optimize all of our fabrication processes to prevent a recurrence of this first article issues that we 've seen .", "we see opportunities to increase future profits with investment in time -

to - date , and a year - to - date net loss of $ 0.70 a share and an adjusted loss of $ 0.60 per share .", "barber - nichols again , is a strong positive in the first three quarters .", "in the seven months since the acquisition , bn sales are on track at $ 31.9 million , and ebitda margins are well ahead of expectations .", "i have noted in previous calls , that we were expecting $ 45 million to $ 48 million in sales and low double - digit ebitda margins .", "the sales number is on target , and we are now seeing mid-teen ebitda .", "in fact , through seven months since the acquisition , bn has achieved our targeted ebitda for the full fiscal year .", "so its q4 ebitda will represent overachievement compared with our expectation .", "moving on to slide 8 .", "and given the weak financial performance in the first three quarters , we have failed to meet our debt covenant related to debt - to - ebitda and fixed cost charges .", "this miss was due to the ebitda loss .", "we were given a waiver by our lender for q3 and are proactively in negotiations to amend our existing bank agreement .", "because of the covenant misses , it was necessary to suspend our dividend .", "and as part of the waiver agreement , we have agreed not to utilize more than $ 15 million of our revolver .", "i want to be clear that the issues we are seeing are p&l profit issues and not liquidity issues .", "we have sufficient liquidity from cash we are generating from operations to work through our challenges .", "in fact , in january alone , lowered our revolver debt from $ 9.75 million to $ 6 million .", "we expect to lower it further between now and the end of march .", "conversations with our lender have been very positive .", "i 've been pleased with the bank 's willingness to understand the details and not overreact to the numbers .", "they understand the near - term challenges are primarily related to profitability and delayed revenue .", "while there are certainly some significant cost -- cash cost increases , the costs booked in q3 and the elongation of project revenue and profit recognition into future quarters have doubled down the impact on our year - to - date p&l .", "the bank and i both expect the lending amendment to be completed by the end of q4 .", "onto slide 9 , some very good news on the order front .", "as dan noted , orders in q3 were $ 68 million .", "just over half of this came from barber - nichols , which most of their orders coming from key defense projects .", "they also continue to bring in a nice level and variety of space orders .", "on the commercial side , graham manufacturing saw another strong quarter of aftermarket and short - cycle orders .", "those are promising since historically , an increase in those areas has often been a precursor to a recovery in capital investment by our customers .", "we also booked a significant refinery order in china .", "our backlog at the end of q3 is a record $ 272.6 million , with both barber - nichols and the legacy graham business having a nice step - up in their respective backlogs during the quarter .", "defense represents 77 % of total backlog .", "this defense backlog extends over the next 6 years , though much of it converts in the next three to four years .", "additionally , we are seeing growth in our commercial backlog .", "the commercial backlog was quite low entering the fiscal year .", "it has grown from $ 33 million at the end of march to $ 63 million now .", "about one - fourth of that increase occurred when we added bn , the rest was due to orders received in the first nine months of the year .", "another positive feature of the commercial backlog and its growth is that it has a much shorter conversion cycle than the defense backlog generally 12 to 18 months .", "we 've had a rough fiscal 2022 , but the future looks far better .", "moving on to slide 10 .", "we have lowered our guidance for fiscal 2022 .", "our revenue guidance is now $ 120 million to $ 125 million , which implies $ 37 million to $ 42 million in q4 .", "we expect a breakeven adjusted ebitda in q4 .", "while this is below our prior expectations , it 's far better than q3 results , and we believe we have turned the corner on many of the challenges we have faced this fiscal year .", "i will now pass the call back to dan to talk about our strategy going forward .", "we are now on slide 11 .", "at a high level , we have been talking about a strategic pivot toward defense for many years , and we have been making good progress .", "the long -
