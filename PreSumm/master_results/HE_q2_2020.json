19 - related bad debt expense from the first quarter of 2020 to a regulatory asset as a result of the puc approval to defer these expenses and lower labor costs due to lower staffing levels and reduced over time .", "the lower generation overhauls and station maintenance work represented approximately $ 4 million of the $ 7 million o&m variance and are largely timing related as some of that work will be performed later this year or next year .", "earnings also reflected a $ 5 million revenue increase from $ 4 million higher ram revenues and $ 1 million for recovery of west loch project and grid modernization projects under the mpir mechanism .", "$ 1 million higher net income due to an unfavorable adjustment in 2019 related to reliability performance incentives and $ 1 million lower interest expense due to debt refinancings at lower rates .", "these items were slightly offset by the following after tax items : $ 1 million lower allowance for funds used during construction as we were as there were fewer long - duration projects in construction work in progress ; $ 1 million higher cost savings from erp system implementation to be returned to customers ; and $ 1 million higher depreciation due to increasing investments to integrate more renewable energy , improve customer reliability and strengthen system efficiency .", "turning to the drivers of the utility 's financial performance for the remainder of the year , the public utility commission issued its final decision for our hawaii island utility , confirming hawaii electric 's 9.5 % allowed roe and 58 % equity capitalization with no change to base rates .", "separately , if the puc approves our settlement with the consumer advocate in the hawaiian electric rate case for oahu , we should see a similar outcome , no increase in base rates with 9.5 % allowed roe and 58 % equity capitalization .", "the utility 's multiyear strategy for greater operational efficiency and cost reductions should help offset the lack of base rate increases .", "the puc order approving deferral of covid -

related expenses were largely offset by lower travel , business development and marketing expenses .", "on slide 12 , asb 's net interest margin declined to 3.21 % this quarter from 3.72 % in the first quarter .", "on the upper right , we 've detailed the elements of that decline .", "the lower interest rate environment was the largest driver of the net interest margin compression , comprising 34 basis points of the decline .", "much of this reflected anticipated repricing in q2 of most of our adjustable and floating rate portfolio .", "four basis points was related to low - yielding ppp loans .", "fas 91 amortization was also a large factor , reflecting a faster rate of prepayments due to lower rates at the long end of the curve .", "this accounted for 15 basis points of compression .", "we also realized strong deposit growth from the federal stimulus and unemployment benefits that added to cash deposit balances .", "while bolstering our liquidity and low - cost funding base , these temporary the temporary excess liquidity is low - yielding and pressured margins .", "as noted , we did realize benefit from lower deposit costs , which contributed eight basis points to net interest margin .", "turning to bank drivers for the remainder of the year .", "we expect continued margin pressure , but at a more moderate pace than in the second quarter .", "in the second quarter , nim compression compressed quickly as variable rate loans repriced after the fed lowered its benchmark rate to near 0 in march .", "approximately 93 % of our variable rate portfolio have now repriced and indices to which those variable rates are tied are at or near their floors .", "thus , we do n't expect that part of our loan book to have materially impacted be materially impacted by further nim compression .", "we do expect continued refinancing of our fixed rate loan portfolio , such as home mortgages , as customers take advantage of historically low rates .", "this type of repricing is more gradual .", "aside from continued low interest rates , we expect increased amortization in the investment portfolio to continue to impact net interest margin .", "as a reminder of how that impacts nim , we purchased bonds for the investment portfolio at a premium or discount , and that premium or discount is amortized over the expected life of the bond 's cash flows .", "for mortgage - backed securities , which comprise 90 % of this portfolio , the amortization increases if prepayments accelerate .", "we see this occur in low interest rate environments as refinance activity increases .", "we expect excess liquidity to continue to pressure margins at similar levels to those realized this quarter as well .", "given these factors , we now expect net interest margin to be in the 3.35 % to 3.25 % range for the year .", "as mentioned , we did have an additional provision further in the quarter related to covid - 19 .", "the total provision recognized during the quarter was $ 15.1 million as reflected in our on our income statement , which also included $ 4.3 million allowance related to unfunded commitments .", "as noted on the slide , reserves for unfunded commitments are recorded in other liabilities on the balance sheet rather than the allowance for credit losses .", "we believe we have approximately we have appropriately provided for future credit losses as of june 30 .", "the provision outlook for the balance of the year is dependent on the economic conditions , which at this point remain uncertain .", "we are not currently providing full year bank provision guidance given the uncertainty created by the impacts of covid -
