party delivery apps , the surprise fees that are often charged for service , for small orders or simply because you live in a certain zip code .", "consumers also tell us that they hate the fact that these charges are often confusing , hidden or buried in the receipt .", "domino's and our franchisees never charge surprise fees .", "we charge one transparent delivery fee .", "so , we decided to give our customers surprise frees instead of surprise fees .", "during this campaign , one out of every 14 digital delivery orders receives a free item .", "that item could be a pizza , stuffed cheesy bread , lava cakes or any one of a number of other great items .", "over the course of the campaign , domino 's and our franchisees will give away $ 50 million worth of surprise frees to delivery customers .", "now this campaign supports two of our key brand attributes : value and transparency .", "i 'll also share a few important milestones that occurred in the u.s. during the quarter .", "first , we broke ground .", "just a few weeks ago on a new supply chain center in indiana , which we expect to complete and open by the end of 2022 .", "and second , we are now running a pilot version of our new pulse point -

year outlook range of 6 % to 8 % global net unit growth .", "i was also very pleased to see that we had only nine closures in international and only 10 closures on a global basis during the quarter .", "this low level of store closures is driven by two factors .", "first , our outstanding unit level economics and second and very importantly , the strong commitment of our franchisees across the globe .", "during the quarter , covid continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets and we expect covid to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come .", "at the end of the quarter , we estimate domino 's had fewer than 175 temporary store closures , with many of those located in india and new zealand .", "i 'll highlight a few of the international markets that contributed significantly to our growth during the quarter .", "we successfully converted 52 stores in poland as dominion pizza rebranded to become part of the domino 's family .", "this provides important scale for us in poland , fast -
