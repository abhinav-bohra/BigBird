over - year with april again representing the most difficult demand level .", "as expected , demand trends improved from april -- from the april low , but at a very modest pace , reflective of the significantly challenged industrial markets served and our continuing view of this product line being lower for longer , compared to the more resilient municipal water trend .", "operating profit as a percent of sales was 13.9 % , a 60 basis point decline from the prior year 14.5 % .", "as we discussed on our last call in mid-april , we enacted a number of temporary cost containment measures to mitigate the impact of the rapid sales decline to both profitability and cash flows .", "these included reductions in discretionary spending , a hiring freeze , reduced work hour furloughs and executive salary reductions among others .", "while the reduced work hour and salary reductions were initiated -- initially targeted for five weeks , we did extend those reductions for an additional four weeks through mid-june .", "the combined actions helped to contain the decremental operating margin impact from the rapid sales decline to approximately 20 % in the quarter .", "gross margin for the quarter was 39.3 % , up 40 basis points year -

19 pandemic and the rapid pace of changing government rules and requirements globally .", "once that settled a bit and gradual reopenings occurred , we started to see activity improve off the april bottom .", "i can't say we 're completely back to normal , but activity has steadied on a relative basis .", "customers are requesting in -

at - home orders in the u.s. , various government mandates in mexico related to vulnerable populations and intermittent employee absenteeism , as well as early logistics and supply chain glitches , all of which contributed to slightly lower than expected output at our manufacturing facilities .", "these impacts continue to lessen in severity and we expect them to be behind us shortly , barring any new currently unforeseen developments .", "we previously outlined a series of temporary cost reductions that were instituted in mid-april .", "and as bob mentioned , we did extend the reduced work hour and salary reduction measures into mid-june .", "not surprisingly , we continue to manage hiring and discretionary spending action given continuing market uncertainty .", "while painful in the short term , we believe these steps were both necessary and adequate to responsibly manage the cost structure of the company during the worst of the impact .", "we obviously continue to stay close to the rapidly changing implications of the pandemic and are prepared to take additional actions if they become warranted .", "while the economic environment appears more stable , there is certain market data and sentiment that points to the potential for a protracted recovery from covid -
