year basis .", "our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4 % and compares to 21.5 % in the second quarter last year .", "finally earnings per share for the second quarter decreased 13.8 % to $ 2.69 , which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 27.7 % or 24.3 % compared to q2 2019 adjusted earnings per share over a two -

through rates .", "much like our q2 results , we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the second half , due to a less favorable sales mix compared to prior year , an increase in markdown rates as we cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020 and higher lifo provisions as a result of cost of goods increases .", "we also anticipate higher supply chain costs in the second half compared to our previous expectations .", "like other retailers , our business is seeing the effects of higher cost due to transit and port delays as well as elevated demand for services at third - party carriers .", "however , despite these challenges , our team was able to meet strong customer demand during the quarter and we 're confident in our ability to continue navigating these transitory pressures .", "finally , please keep in mind that the third quarter represents our most challenging lap of the year from a gross profit rate perspective , following an improvement of 178 basis points in q3 2020 .", "with regards to sg&a , we now expect about $ 70 million to $ 80 million of incremental year - over - year investments in our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts .", "this amount includes $ 40 million in incremental investments made during the first half of the year .", "however , in aggregate , we continue to expect our strategic initiatives will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021 driven by nci and dg fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated sg&a expense .", "in closing , we are proud of our second quarter results , which are a testament to the performance and strong execution by the entire team .", "as always we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital with the goal of delivering consistent , strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long -

end , including over 2,100 stores in our light version , with the goal of completing the rollout of nci across nearly the entire chain by year - end 2022 .", "moving to our newer store concept , popshelf , which further builds on our success in learnings with nci .", "popshelf aims to engage customers by offering a fun , affordable and differentiated treasure hunt experience , delivered through continually refreshed merchandise , a differentiated in - store experience and exceptional value with the vast majority of our items priced at $ 5 or less .", "during the quarter we opened eight new popshelf locations , bringing the total number of stores to 16 , including four conversions of a traditional dollar general store into our popshelf concept .", "and while still early , we remain extremely pleased with our results , which continue to exceed our expectations for both sales and gross margin .", "we also recently opened our first two store -

stock levels and the introduction of additional products , including both national and private brands .", "for example , we recently introduced about 25 new and exclusive items under the armor [ phonetic ] brand , as we continue to optimize our assortment , while further differentiating our product offering from others .", "and while produce was not included in our initial rollout plans , we believe dg fresh provides a potential path to accelerating our produce offering in up to 10,000 stores over time as we look to further capitalize on our extensive self - distribution capabilities .", "moving to our cooler expansion program , which continues to be our most impactful merchandising initiative .", "during the first half , we added more than 34,000 cooler doors across our store base and remain on track to install approximately 65,000 cooler doors this year .", "notably , the majority of these doors will be in high capacity coolers , creating additional opportunities to drive higher on -
