supply gap of 6.8 million homes .", "the loss of the existing units through demolition , natural disaster , or functional obsolescence has contributed to this shortfall along with the underproduction of new housing units .", "these intentions , if acted upon , represent upside to our already robust outlook for gypsum wallboard .", "cement demand is driven most heavily by infrastructure .", "implementation will further challenge u.s. cement supply in many parts of the u.s. , which is already straining to meet current demand .", "it is also important to emphasize , as i have in the past , that the lion 's share of funding for infrastructure comes from states , not federal government .", "there was quite a bit of concern about state budgets being impacted by the pandemic , but as we shared in the prior earnings calls , our analysis of sources of state funding suggest the impact would not be as great as some feared , especially in the u.s. heartland states in which we operate .", "as it turned out , state and local revenues are in fact healthy .", "at eagle , we remain virtually sold out of our manufactured cement .", "our entire u.s. heartland system is now starting to tension more than it has over the last decade .", "i 'd emphasize that our cement volumes this quarter were slightly impacted by wet weather and not by the lessening of demand .", "the point of this is that the demand picture is robust today for both of our businesses .", "the factors driving this strength should be sustainable at least through the mid-term .", "that is the demand side .", "now let me spend some time on the supply side .", "i want to start the supply side discussion with some comments i made in the last earnings call as i think they are important to reiterate .", "the first item is around the diminishing supply of synthetic gypsum in the eastern half of the u.s .", "this is due to less burning of coal as power plants change fuel sources from coal to natural gas and from the outright closure of coal - fired power plants .", "with a diminishing supply of synthetic gypsum , existing synthetic wallboard plants will be limited in their ability to fully utilize their current capacity , increase current , or build new capacity .", "conversely , almost all of eagle 's plants have many decades of raw material supply , which are primarily owned natural gypsum deposits .", "we are largely insulated from the direct effects of this diminishing synthetic gypsum trend while our plants are also in a position to indirectly benefit from the supply dynamics that this trend creates .", "and this way , it is notable that the gypsum wallboard industry is increasingly looking more like the cement industry .", "the second point we discussed in the last call was around the significant regulatory and capital barriers to u.s. cement capacity expansion , whether it be existing facilities or through the construction of new ones .", "this is why in the face of increasing demand and with industry capacity now nearing full utilization , clinker capacity in the number of cement kilns has not only not expanded since 2010 but since the clinker capacity and the number of cement kilns has actually been reduced in the u.s. against this backdrop , high - cost imports are increasingly required to serve u.s. coastal markets .", "eagle is well positioned in the heartland of the u.s. away from the coast , and here too eagle will be positively impacted from this trend .", "these imports also carry with them a much larger carbon footprint than even the most inefficient domestic cement producers .", "this carbon footprint is not only from their in - country manufacturing processes but also from the logistics associated with delivering their product to their end - use customer .", "it is worth a reminder that eagle operates some of the most modern and efficient plants in the u.s. and all of our plants operate within established stringent u.s. environmental limits .", "if you 'd like to learn more about our ambitious cementitious materials agenda and our role in creating a net -
