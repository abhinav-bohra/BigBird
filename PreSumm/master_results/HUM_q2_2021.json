19 pandemic , all while staying true to our commitment to delivering the highest quality healthcare experience for members and patients .", "well , we are maintaining our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of approximately $ 21.25 to $ 21.75 at the midpoint , representing full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 16 % above the 2020 baseline of $ 18.50 in excess of our long - term growth target , while acknowledging the continued uncertainty driven by covid - 19 hospitalization trends and the rate at which non-covid cost normalized .", "as susan will describe in more detail , our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance now assumes a $ 600 million covid -

term target of 11 % to 15 % .", "our philosophy regarding 2021 guidance has been to provide transparency into the uncertainty caused by covid - 19 and the ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth with solid underlying core business performance and largely offsetting covid - 19 - related headwinds and tailwinds .", "we have been consistent in and remain committed to this philosophy .", "there is a reasonable path to achieving adjusted earnings per share within our initial guidance range .", "and accordingly , today we are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $ 21.25 to $ 21.75 , while acknowledging the continued uncertainty as it respects to covid hospitalization trends as well as the pace at which non-covid costs bounce back and at what level they ultimately normalize .", "additionally , we expect our third quarter adjusted earnings per share to reflect a low - 20s percentage of our full year adjusted eps .", "as bruce indicated , given our experience to date , together with our current estimates for the back half of 2021 , we have effectively recognized a $ 600 million covid - related headwind for medicare advantage in our full year guide , offset by favorable operating items .", "these favorable items include , among others , higher than initially expected prior year development , the previously discussed better than expected specialty and medicaid results and the expected contribution from kindred at home given the transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks .", "now let me provide an update on the underlying changes since our initial detailed guide in february , articulate key assumptions regarding utilization in the back half of 2021 and expand on the continued pandemic - related uncertainties i described .", "i will begin with medicare advantage revenue .", "as discussed last quarter , given our significant exposure to medicare advantage , we are disproportionately affected by covid 's impact on medicare risk adjustment or mra .", "recall , our risk - adjusted revenue for 2021 is determined by 2020 dates of service , medical utilization and resulting documentation , which as previously discussed , was materially depressed in 2020 .", "as we have indicated since the beginning of the year , the mra headwind we are facing in 2021 is significant , and we have closely monitored it over the course of the year .", "our april guide recognized we had $ 300 million of additional pressure from mra relative to our initial expectations for the full year , which was offset by the net benefit of the extension of sequester relief .", "in july , we received the mid-year mra payment , and it came in modestly lower than expected .", "we are however taking operational steps now to be able to recover some of the mra revenue in the final payment for 2021 .", "accordingly , our ma premium estimates , net of capitation , remained largely in line with our initial expectations when factoring in the net sequestration benefit .", "now turning to benefit expense .", "at the beginning of the year , we indicated that we expected non-covid costs for our medicare business to run 3.6 % to 5.5 % below baseline .", "we define baseline and 2019 experience trended forward based on a normalized trend factor excluding the effects of covid .", "however , that was offset by covid utilization decelerating faster than expected .", "we also recognized , however , visibility into non-inpatient claims were significantly less than inpatient .", "however , at that time , we could still tolerate overall utilization returning to baseline late in the year if the non-inpatient acceleration we were seeing was due to pent - up demand and leveled off in the second and third quarters .", "in the first and second quarters , non-covid costs run approximately 7 % and 3 % below baseline respectively with the bounce back outpacing expectations in the second quarter .", "non-inpatient utilization did not level off and instead continue to increase in the second quarter and was offset by lower than expected covid costs and other business outperformance .", "as the healthcare system has been open for several months and a high rate of the senior population has been vaccinated , our current guidance now assumes that non-covid costs level off and run approximately 2.5 % below baseline levels in the back half of the year .", "consistent with our original forecast , our current guidance assumes minimal covid testing and treatment costs in the back half of the year .", "finally , as it respects to our 2021 guide , for our commercial business , we expect all - in utilization for covid and non-covid to continue to run above baseline as anticipated .", "in summary , i want to emphasize that 2021 is a covid transition year .", "there is a reasonable path to deliver against our guidance expectations .", "however , if non-covid utilization or covid treatment costs increase beyond our expectations in the back half of the year , it will present a headwind to our guide absent offsetting tailwind .", "i also want to reiterate that the $ 21.50 midpoint of our original guide continues to be the right jumping off point for 2022 adjusted earnings per share growth .", "our members continue to engage in routine interactions with their providers , which we anticipate will result in more normalized medicare advantage revenue next year as providers are able to ensure that our members are receiving appropriate care and that their conditions are fully documented .", "during the first half of 2021 , provider interactions and documentation of clinical diagnoses that will impact 2022 revenue outpace those experienced in the first half of 2020 and are approximately 80 % complete in line with the estimated completion rate for the same time period in 2019 .", "lastly , i would remind you that our medicare advantage bids for 2022 reflected the continued uncertainty associated with covid -
