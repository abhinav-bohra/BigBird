end .", "performance on miami beach was also encouraging as the cadillac and the winter haven on south beach each exceeded their third quarter 2019 occupancy , adr and revpar levels .", "even in the more business - oriented submarket of coconut grove , we were able to drive 36 % adr growth during the quarter as we captured local business from a variety of industries , law , universities , financial services , consulting , technology , healthcare and advertising , which is leading to stronger weekday demand post - labor day .", "out in california , the sanctuary beach resort continues to lead our resorts from a rate perspective as a $ 669 adr and 78 % occupancy resulted in 30 % revpar growth versus the third quarter of 2019 .", "the our hotel milo in santa barbara reported 22 % revpar growth this quarter , recording 75 % occupancy at a $ 446 average daily rate .", "both of these hotels set record adr levels under our ownership last quarter during the peak travel season on the california coast , further proving that the leisure traveler is not price - sensitive for high - quality , well - located , differentiated hotels .", "back east , our annapolis waterfront hotel occupies an irreplaceable position on the chesapeake bay and was our strongest performing hotel from an occupancy perspective during the third quarter .", "we recorded an 86 % occupancy and an average daily rate of $ 332 last quarter , which led to a 24 % revpar growth over the period .", "annapolis in the summer was primarily leisure transient but the hotel has seen significant demand continue post -

party data providers indicate that major cities like boston and new york saw a 30 % month - over - month increase in workers returning to the office in september .", "and conversations with our corporate accounts indicate that we should continue to see a resumption in companies opening their doors and encouraging travel through the end of the year .", "but anticipate the first quarter as the next inflection point in demand growth from the business traveler .", "gateway urban markets have been more impacted by this pandemic than any other segment , and offers the longest runway for growth as we look forward to the next several years of this cycle .", "last month , we saw the return of traditional major events in manhattan , the u.s. open , which benefited our assets in the jfk submarket .", "fashion week , which led to the compression at our hilton garden inn tribeca .", "and the un general assembly , we saw increased demand at our hilton garden inn midtown east from foreign delegates and secret service personnel .", "despite attendances below pre-pandemic levels , it was great to have these events back in person as they help drive hotel demand in manhattan to its highest levels since the beginning of the pandemic .", "and new york has more citywides occurring in q4 .", "comic con took place a few weekends ago , the nyu lodging conference and the new york city marathon is resuming next month , and several trade shows and medical conferences remain on schedule .", "pockets of corporate strength remain across our assets in manhattan from the traditional accounts i noted earlier , but we believe they will continue to expand as more corporations reopen their offices .", "with the first mover advantage of remaining open throughout the pandemic , our clustered sales effort in the marketplace should yield additional revenue opportunities .", "new york city has historically been the market leader in occupancy and we remain confident that it will revert back to prior levels over the next few years with our operating and data advantage driving meaningful outperformance throughout the recovery .", "during the last cycle , we had record demand for hotel rooms in new york , but year - over - year mid-single - digit supply growth resulted in a very challenging operating environment for owners .", "although we have seen new hotels open again this year with more on pace to open over the next 12 months , it is important to note that many hotels have permanently closed .", "and although a few have recently reopened following the passage of the severance law in the city , the midterm supply picture looks very encouraging .", "based on our internal projections as well as some recent third - party studies , it is estimated that 10,000 keys may be removed from inventory for the foreseeable future , if not permanently by way of demolition , resizing or alternate use conversions .", "when we factor in this in the analysis and the aforementioned new supply , net supply over the next few years will actually be negative 1 % to 2 % .", "and with the cost of construction financing remaining exorbitantly high and the recent approval by the new york city planning commission of the special permit for all new hotel construction , supply should remain in the low single - digit range for years to come .", "earlier this year , we completed the sale of six noncore hotels that had substantial capital improvements on the horizon .", "and we also took necessary steps to infuse the portfolio with nondilutive equity through our notes placement with goldman sachs merchant bank .", "we believe that our unique collection of hotels and our advantaged operating strategy allow us to manage cash burn in the worst of times and drive out performance early in the recovery .", "we have and continue to actively monitor the capital markets for the best opportunity to increase our operating capital without diluting shareholder valuation .", "the capital markets for almost every level of financing remains extremely competitive .", "and with improving fundamentals in each of our markets , we will remain opportunistic with both asset sales and financing opportunities across the next several quarters .", "at current prices , we see no better value in the marketplace than our existing collection of hotels .", "second quick topic , sustainability , which has been at the core of our strategic operations since we launched our earthview program in 2010 .", "since inception , we have saved over $ 20 million from energy efficiency initiatives that generate recurring savings year -

party management company allows us to run our properties with staffing levels capable of offering our guests a service expected at our hotels , all while continuing to drive gop and ebitda .", "as revpar and out - of - room revenues increasing in 2022 and beyond .", "our current operating model will yield much higher levels of absolute gop dollars and allow us to amortize our fixed operating expenses as well as our property taxes and insurance expenses .", "this provides us confidence in our ability to forecast post - pandemic ebitda margin growth as our ability to drive adr in tandem with applied expense savings initiatives , provides us continued confidence in our ability to generate 150 to 250 basis points of sustainable long -
