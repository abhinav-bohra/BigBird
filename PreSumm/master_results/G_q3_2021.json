over - year compared to $ 0.56 in 2020 .", "this 10 % -- $ 0.10 increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted operating income of $ 0.04 , lower taxes of $ 0.03 , a $ 0.02 impact related to fx remeasurement and a $ 0.01 impact related to lower year - over - year share count .", "our effective tax rate was 17.3 % compared to 22.6 % last year largely due to discrete benefits in the quarter as well as a nonrecurring prior period tax refund - related items .", "excluding this onetime tax benefit that equates to $ 0.03 per share , our effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 21.4 % .", "turning to cash flow and balance sheet .", "during the third quarter , we generated $ 210 million of cash from operation that corresponds to free cash flow being almost two times higher than net income .", "as a reminder , during 2020 , we experienced a lower -
