cycle low cost of supply investments in canada , the montney and in norway .", "since june , we see some inflation pressures , especially in the lower 48 .", "however , at this point , we 'd expect to adjust scope modestly in order -- in response to maintain our base capital at a level that is roughly consistent with our june update .", "and then , of course , we 'll add capex for the shell properties once we 've brought them into the portfolio .", "as we finalize our 2022 plans , we 're watching the macro closely , keeping an eye on inflation and potential obo pressures and undertaking our typical capital high -

than - expected price realizations and lower - than - expected dd&a .", "as for the better realizations , we captured a higher percentage of brent pricing in our overall realized prices .", "and as ryan mentioned , we 're unhedged so we 're getting full exposure to the current higher prices .", "as for dd&a , we 're trending lower compared to the previous guidance as a result of positive reserve revisions due to higher prices .", "you saw in today 's release that we lowered full year 2021 dd&a guidance from $ 7.4 billion to $ 7.1 billion .", "excluding libya , production for the quarter was 1,507,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day , which represents about 2 % underlying growth .", "lower 48 production averaged 790,000 barrels a day , including about 445,000 from the permian , 217,000 from the eagle ford , and 95,000 from the bakken .", "at the end of the quarter , we had 15 operated drilling rigs and seven frac crews working in the lower 48 .", "across the rest of our operations , the business ran extremely well .", "in particular , our planned seasonal turnaround activity across several regions went safely and smoothly .", "this reflects the impact of a decision we 're making to convert concho two stream contracted volumes to a three - stream reporting basis as part of our ongoing efforts to create marketing optionality across the lower 48 .", "we expect to convert the majority of our contracts in the fourth quarter .", "reported production is expected to increase by approximately 40,000 barrels a day , and both revenue and operating costs will increase by roughly $ 70 million .", "in other words , this conversion is earnings neutral .", "besides dd&a and production , there were no other changes to 2021 guidance items .", "now , once we 've closed the shell acquisition and can see where the ongoing us tax legislation conversation lands , we 'll provide an updated earnings and cash flow sensitivities that consider such factors as projected 2022 price ranges and how those ranges might impact our cash taxpaying position in various jurisdictions around the globe .", "coming back to third quarter results .", "cash from operations was $ 4.1 billion , which was reduced by about $ 200 million for nonrecurring items , so a bit higher than the average of external estimates on an underlying basis .", "free cash flow was almost $ 3 billion this quarter , and on a year -
