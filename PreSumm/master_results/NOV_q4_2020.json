called wind belt of the great plains in the united states , for instance .", "more on that in a moment .", "the constraint that wind farm developers begin to run into is the fact that towers become exponentially more expensive to construct and transport with height .", "in 2019 , nov invested in keystone tower systems , a start - up that has developed a patented tapered spiral welding process that enables the automated production of wind tower sections , which can significantly decrease production times and reduce cost by 50 % or more .", "additionally , the technology has the potential to be deployed for infield manufacturing operations , effectively eliminating many of the severe logistical limitations of transporting larger diameter tower sections over the road .", "keystone is currently completing construction of its first commercial line within nov's pampa , texas facility and has an order for 100 tower sections from a major wind turbine manufacturer .", "upon completion , it will have the capacity to deliver hundreds of towers annually .", "another challenge of the taller towers trend is developing cost - effective safe methods of tower erection .", "current predominant construction methods using crawler cranes are quickly reaching their limits for safe and efficient use as wind towers increase in height and weight .", "nov 's system concept , which is built upon the intellectual property control systems and experience developed during the design of mobile desert and arctic drilling rigs , utilizes a tower crane in conjunction with a unique mobility system to provide superior lifting characteristics to -- at taller heights to significantly improve the safety , reliability efficiency of tall wind tower installation techniques .", "such methods are expected to also help reduce the ongoing operating and maintenance costs associated with these assets over their 20 - plus year lives , further improving project economics for wind farm operators .", "the us wind belt runs from north dakota , south to west texas and is defined by the region of the country where the wind resource blows hardest and steadiest , allowing turbines to achieve the highest levels of utilization and electricity output .", "but this picture changes as towers grow taller and the region of economically viable wind resource grows .", "it is conceivable to us that the wind belt area could double or triple as nov and keystone technologies enable towers to grow taller , economically and consequently enable power production closer to prime power consumption markets , thereby lowering transmission costs and total capital investment .", "frankly , we are excited about the growth potential here .", "however , all onshore wind farms require a lot of land and sometimes make their neighbors unhappy by spoiling the view , which leads us to offshore wind .", "generally , offshore wind has several advantages over land : higher capacity factors due to generally steadier wind regimes , the ability to use larger turbines without facing the limitations of over - the - road transportation and an abundance of locations with less not in my backyard political opposition .", "this has led the global wind energy council to forecast 26 % compound annual growth rate for the offshore wind space through this decade .", "considering nearly 40 % of the world 's population , 2.5 billion people , live and consume power within 60 miles of the coast , this makes sense .", "however , similar to offshore oil and gas , offshore wind developments also carry increased complexity , higher execution risk and incremental costs that can challenge project economics .", "again , we view these challenges as opportunities to draw upon nov 's unique offshore expertise and provide value to a burgeoning customer base .", "nov has long been a leader in offshore wind construction vessels , on which we can sell as much as $ 80 million of equipment .", "in fact , the majority of the world 's 30 gigawatts of installed offshore power generation capacity was put in place with nov - designed vessels and nov - supplied equipment .", "we are presently executing on the construction or upgrade of a half dozen wind turbine installation vessels and expect demand to continue due to the growing height of offshore towers for the same reasons that i explained moments ago .", "nov 's proprietary telescoping cranes , jacking systems and deck equipment are all contributing to lower installation costs and better economics for offshore wind farm developers .", "we landed a contract for the first jones act - compliant vessel in the fourth quarter .", "and we have several conversations under way with offshore construction firms for additional capacity globally .", "by year - end , i expect that our business in this area will have doubled to more than $ 200 million annually , and further growth prospects are excellent as the 9.6 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity to be installed in 2021 is forecast to more than double by 2025 to more than 21 gigawatts .", "in order to meet these projections , the world will need to build two to three dozen more installation vessels , capable of installing the new leading - edge 12 - megawatt to 15 - megawatt towers with 500 - foot hub heights over the next decade or so , according to forecast from clarksons .", "nov is also pursuing opportunities in the floating offshore wind space , which will require the cranes , winches , mooring systems , cable - laid ballasting systems , chain connections and tensioners that we design and provide .", "nov has developed a patent - pending tri-floater semi-submersible floating wind foundation , designed to require less steel than competing offerings that should allow for full quayside construction in turbine installation .", "we are engaged in a paid design study now utilizing this proprietary floating wind design for a customer in asia .", "with revenue potential north of $ 25 million per vessel and dozens of vessels required to develop a single gigawatt project , nov 's total addressable market in this area is potentially in the billions .", "so , to summarize our wind initiatives , nov is positioning itself as a value - added partner , capable of meaningfully reducing project execution risk and overall capital costs .", "we have a large and growing base of installed capacity in the fixed offshore wind installation vessel market , which we expect to exceed $ 200 million annually in revenue for us by year - end , along with an ongoing aftermarket opportunity .", "our keystone team secured an order for 100 towers based on its proprietary technology that we are constructing in our plant in texas .", "and nov 's proprietary floating wind technology is under consideration by multiple prospective customers globally , potentially opening up a massive new market in countries lacking expansive shallow waters available for wind development .", "suffice to say , i 'm very optimistic about the opportunity set in the wind area .", "returning to our traditional oil and gas business , despite the near - term challenges we face , i 'm growing more optimistic about 2021 .", "as covid - 19 vaccines proliferate , i expect lockdowns and economic disruptions to subside and a more normalized level of demand for oil and gas to return .", "only then will we realize the true impact of the massive dismantlement that the petroleum industry has undergone : the lack of major project fids , the diminishment of quick -
