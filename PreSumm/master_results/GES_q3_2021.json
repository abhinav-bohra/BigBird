of wholesale shipments in europe for the spring / summer collection into next year .", "in terms of profit , gross margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be slightly down to last year , as imu improvement is expected to be more than offset by deleverage on lower sales .", "given the expected level of revenue , the seasonality of our business , as well as the mix , we expect sg&a as a
