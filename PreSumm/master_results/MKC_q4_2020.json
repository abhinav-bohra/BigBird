per - share growth of approximately 4 % .", "our 2021 adjusted earnings per share expectations reflect strong base business and acquisition performance growth of 9 % to 11 % in constant currency , partially offset by the impact i just mentioned related to covid -

19 cost and brand marketing investments , as well as a low tax rate in the first quarter of last year , we expect our earnings growth to be weighted to the second half of the year .", "we have a strong start to the year and recognize we are lapping a very strong second quarter of 2020 .", "in summary , we are projecting strong underlying base business performance and growth from acquisitions in our 2021 outlook , with earnings growth partially offset by incremental covid -
