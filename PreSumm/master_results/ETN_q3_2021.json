time record and an increase of 230 basis points over prior year .", "on top of record margins , we 're also pleased with our incremental margins , which were 46 % in the quarter , due to actions that we took to mitigate inflationary costs , the portfolio changes that we have undertaken , and savings from restructuring programs .", "we did have a bit of help from favorable mix as well in the quarter .", "and while revenues were lighter than expected in our electrical americas segment , we 're very pleased to see the strength in orders and the growing backlog .", "overall demand remains very strong .", "for the electrical businesses overall , orders were up 17 % on a rolling 12 -

sized pickups and suvs and fewer small cars .", "so good mix , good volume growth and savings from the multiyear restructuring program all contributed to very strong quarterly operating results here .", "you 'll see the financial results of our emobility segment , where revenues increased 6 % organically .", "light vehicle business , customer production levels were reduced by supply chain constraints here as well .", "and given the nature of the products that we sell in this segment , they were more significantly impacted by the semiconductor shortages that we 've all read about .", "as a result , our backlog is up significantly here .", "operating margins were a negative 9.5 % , once again due to heavy r&d investments and start - up costs associated with new programs .", "we continue to be pleased with the progress in this business , which is one program is worth nearly $ 600 million of mature year revenue .", "and we expect to see a significant ramp up in revenues in 2023 , which positions us well to achieve our long - term revenue target of $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion by 2030 .", "on page 10 , we provide an update at our organic growth and operating margins for the year .", "with supply chain constraints in q3 continuing into q4 , we now expect overall organic revenue growth of 9 % to 11 % for 2021 .", "for electrical americas , we expect 5 % to 7 % growth .", "and you 'll note the implied guidance for q4 is actually 7 % to 9 % , which is a solid step - up from the 1 % in q3 .", "organic revenues in aerospace are expected to be roughly flat with strength in commercial markets being offset by weakness in military markets .", "and the other segments had some minor reductions in revenue as well , but just minor .", "despite slightly lower organic revenue growth outlook , we 're increasing our operating margin guidance by 20 basis points from 18.6 % to 19 % .", "and i 'd note that with this guidance , we 're on track to generate strong incremental margins of approximately 40 % for 2021 , which we see naturally is outstanding performance given the current inflationary environment .", "we have the remaining items of our guidance for the year .", "we expect full year adjusted earnings per share between $ 6.59 to $ 6.69 .", "at the midpoint , this represents 35 % growth over 2020 .", "we 're also delivering significant margin improvement , up 240 basis points from last year at the midpoint of our increased margin guidance .", "so i 'm pleased that we have strong operating performance in the face of what we call store supply chain challenges and the businesses are doing well .", "next , given more active m&a activities , we now expect share repurchase to be between $ 375 million and $ 425 million .", "and lastly , our q4 guidance includes earnings between $ 1.68 and $ 1.78 , organic revenue growth between 7 % and 9 % , and segment margins between 18.8 % and 19.2 % , an increase of 160 basis points at the midpoint versus prior year .", "so overall , once again , a strong 2021 with solid revenue growth , strong orders and good execution , allowing us to deliver record margins .", "next , on page 12 , we did want to provide some preliminary assumptions for our end markets for 2022 .", "and as you can see , we 're expecting attractive growth in nearly all of our markets with very good growth in data centers and industrial facilities in our electrical business and our commercial aerospace business , and certainly , in all vehicle markets .", "we 'll provide more detailed color on organic revenue growth assumptions when we provide our 2022 guidance in february , but we did want to share some of our preliminary thinking here .", "we would also expect to see carryover benefits from pricing actions taken , which should also help our year - over - year growth next year .", "and lastly , on page 13 , we provide just some summary thoughts here .", "and i 'd say , first , i 'm proud of the record quarter results and particularly our strong margin performance .", "our team has demonstrated that we can manage through a challenging operating environment , supply chain constraints , inflationary pressures , and still improve margins and eps .", "and the long - term secular growth trends of electrification , energy transition and digitalization are playing out just as we expected or maybe even better .", "we also see 2021 as a transformative year for eaton in terms of portfolio management .", "we 're a higher - growth , higher - margin and less cyclical company today .", "and with strong year - to - date performance , we 're well on our track to deliver a very strong 2021 with double - digit organic revenue growth and 35 % adjusted earnings per share growth .", "and i 'd also add , we have great momentum going into the q4 and into next year .", "we have strong order growth .", "we have a full backlog , and many of our end markets are poised for recovery .", "and you 'll recall that at the beginning of the year , we set medium -
