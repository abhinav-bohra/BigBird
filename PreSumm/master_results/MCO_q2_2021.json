year average as shown on the blue line .", "while the growth in leveraged loans outpaced high - yield bonds , the demand that we saw earlier this year from both asset classes persisted , albeit a bit slower sequentially .", "we also saw increased momentum in the clo market , driven by opportunistic refinancing as spreads remain tight .", "we frequently comment on our revenue relative to issuance levels , which relates to issuance mix .", "and in the second quarter , transactional mis revenue grew 3 % , while mis rated issuance declined 16 % .", "this chart provides an illustration of our second quarter issuance and revenue mix by asset class .", "so for example , the dark green bubble on the bottom left corner represents investment -

as - you - go commercial programs , represented by the dark blue bubble on the far right , saw issuance up over 200 % .", "and that significantly contributed to this quarter 's favorable issuance mix .", "similar to last quarter , favorable market conditions led issuers to access the debt markets for a variety of reasons .", "credit spreads tightened as default rates trended lower , keeping the overall cost of debt low and allowing issuers to opportunistically refinance existing debt .", "and as the economy started to recover and equity markets continued their strong run , we saw an acceleration of m&a as companies use the combination of cash balances and debt financing to acquire growth and position businesses for the post -

grade supply contracted compared to the prior year period , which had seen significant liquidity - driven financing caused by uncertainty over the unfolding pandemic .", "financial institutions revenue rose 6 % , above the 1 % increase in issuance .", "this is due to infrequent emea bank issuers who sought to take advantage of the ongoing attractive rate environment .", "revenue from public , project and infrastructure finance declined 2 % compared to a 45 % decrease in issuance as increased non-u.s. project and infrastructure activity was offset by a reduction in u.s. infrastructure supply .", "structured finance revenue increased 73 % , supported by an over 200 % growth in issuance .", "this is due to approximately 200 clo deals this quarter , our highest on record , predominantly attributable to refinancing activity .", "in addition , cmbs formation further bolstered overall results .", "mis ' adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 66.3 % .", "this was enabled by strong revenue growth , coupled with operating efficiency initiatives and lower legal accruals , partially offset by higher reserves for 2021 incentive compensation .", "second quarter revenue rose 15 % or 13 % on an organic basis .", "in rd&a , revenue increased 19 % or 16 % on an organic basis .", "this is due to robust demand for kyc and compliance solutions as well as strong customer retention rates and double - digit trailing 12 - month sales growth in research and data feeds .", "for ers , recurring revenue rose 16 % , driving overall ers growth of 5 % or 3 % organically .", "this reflected the demand for our insurance and asset management offerings , tools supporting upcoming accounting standards implementations such as ifrs 17 as well as our saas -

19 pandemic ; responses by governments , regulators , businesses and individuals as well as the effects on interest rates , foreign currency exchange rates , capital markets liquidity and activity in different sectors of the debt market .", "our full year 2021 guidance is underpinned by the following macro assumptions : a rise in the 2021 u.s. and euro area gdp to a range of 6 % to 7 % and 4 % to 5 % , respectively ; benchmark interest rates will remain low , with u.s. high - yield spreads remaining below approximately 500 basis points ; the u.s. unemployment rate will decline to under 5 % by year - end ; and the global high - yield default rate will fall below 2 % by year - end .", "our guidance also assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates .", "specifically , our forecast for the balance of 2021 reflects u.s. exchange rates for the british pound of $ 1.38 and $ 1.19 for the euro .", "these assumptions are subject to uncertainties and results for the year could differ materially from our current outlook .", "following our better -

digit percent range as we balance reinvesting the benefits from our cost efficiency programs against the opportunity for future growth - oriented investments .", "given our improved revenue outlook and expense stability , we now project moody 's adjusted operating margin to be approximately 51 % .", "we raised the diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance ranges to $ 10.95 to $ 11.25 and $ 11.55 to $ 11.85 , respectively .", "we increased our free cash flow forecast to be between $ 2.2 billion and $ 2.3 billion .", "and we anticipate full year share repurchases to remain at approximately $ 1.5 billion subject to available cash , market conditions and other ongoing capital allocation .", "on prior earnings calls , rob has detailed our integrated risk assessment strategy , of which investments and acquisitions will play an important role .", "to that end , we are focused on m&a opportunities in our addressable markets that will advance our strategy .", "as always , we do n't comment on any specific potential acquisitions or divestitures , and we wo n't comment on any deals that we are pursuing .", "we have not included the impact of any future acquisitions in our current outlook , but obviously , a transaction could affect our guidance depending on the terms of any deals that we are able to reach .", "under our long - held capital allocation policy , we prioritize organic and inorganic investments into the business before returning any excess cash via share repurchases .", "within mis , following a strong second quarter , we now project aggregate global rated issuance to grow in the low single - digit percent range , up from our previous guidance of a low single - digit percent decline .", "we would like to reiterate that our guidance , similar to last quarter , does not factor in any potential impacts from the u.s. infrastructure bill proposals .", "we are raising our issuance forecast for leveraged loans to be up approximately 75 % and for high - yield bonds to be up approximately 25 % .", "these are meaningful increases compared to our prior outlook of up 55 % and approximately flat , respectively , and is the result of better - than - expected second quarter issuance as well as ongoing favorable refinancing conditions and heightened m&a activity .", "we expect that the increase in leveraged loan supply will continue to drive clo creation and are therefore also improving the structured issuance outlook to be up approximately 75 % .", "following a very active 2020 , full year investment - grade supply is now forecast to decrease by approximately 40 % .", "that 's slightly lower than our previous guidance , which anticipated volumes to decline 30 % .", "also , after a surge in activity in the second quarter , we are increasing our guidance for new mandates to be in the range of 950 to 1,050 .", "while we believe favorable market conditions will persist , we forecast issuance to moderate in the second half of the year to more of a historic sawtooth pattern as we believe many issuers will fulfill the majority of their funding needs early in the year and that liquidity - driven issuance will return to pre-pandemic levels .", "with our improved issuance outlook , we now estimate that mis ' revenue will increase in the high single - digit percent range .", "mis ' adjusted operating margin guidance remains at approximately 61 % as our improved top line outlook is partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals and an acceleration in esg , technology and automation investments in the second half of the year .", "for ma , we are maintaining our low double -
