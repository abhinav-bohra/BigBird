demand products , we continue to make good progress with improving our in - stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels .", "in 2020 , we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $ 3.9 billion , an increase of $ 1.6 billion or 73.2 % .", "total capital expenditures for the year were $ 1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores , remodels and relocations , distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives .", "during the quarter , we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $ 900 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $ 0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $ 87 million .", "with today 's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization , we have remaining authorization of approximately $ 2.4 billion under the repurchase program .", "our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged .", "our first priority is investing in high -

store sales decline of 4 % to 6 % but which reflects growth of approximately 10 % to 12 % on a two - year stack basis ; and earnings per share in the range of $ 8.80 to $ 9.50 , which reflects a compound annual growth rate between 15 % and 20 % or between 14 % and 19 % on an adjusted basis over a two -

margin non-consumable categories , driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories well in excess of our consumables business .", "we expect our sales mix will ultimately shift toward our consumables categories in 2021 , resulting in pressure on our rate .", "however , the timing of when this dynamic may occur and its corresponding impact to gross margin are currently uncertain .", "gross margins in 2020 also benefited from a reduction in markdowns , including the benefit of higher sell - through rates as a result of significant customer demand in seasonal and other clearance - sensitive non-consumable categories .", "in 2021 , we expect our markdown rates will increase somewhat from the abnormally low levels we saw in 2020 , which likely will create some gross margin pressure compared to last year .", "in addition , while we continue to see the effect of higher carrier rates and fuel costs , our ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies and reduce expenses , including further expansion of our private fleet , are expected to help partially mitigate these cost pressures in 2021 .", "also , please keep in mind that the second and third quarters represent the most challenging laps of the year from a gross profit rate perspective , following improvements of 167 basis points in q2 2020 and 178 basis points in q3 2020 .", "in terms of sg&a , while we expect to incur ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021 , overall , we anticipate a meaningful reduction in covid - 19 - related costs compared to last year .", "however , the leverage from these reduced costs is expected to be offset by deleverage associated with lower comp sales and approximately $ 60 million to $ 70 million in incremental year - over - year investments related to our strategic initiatives as we further their rollouts .", "with regard to our strategic initiatives , in aggregate , we anticipate they will positively contribute to operating profit and margin in 2021 , driven by nci and dg fresh as we expect the benefits to gross margin from our initiatives will more than offset the associated expense .", "finally , we estimate operating profit will be negatively impacted by approximately $ 35 million to $ 40 million in q1 as a result of lost sales from storage closures and expenses related to the widespread winter weather that we experienced in february .", "in closing , we are very proud of the team 's execution and performance , which resulted in exceptional fourth quarter and full year results .", "as always , we continue to be disciplined in how we manage expenses and capital , with the goal of delivering consistent , strong financial performance while strategically investing for the long term .", "we remain confident in our business model and our ongoing financial priorities to drive profitable same -

distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods .", "the primary objective of dg fresh is to reduce product costs on our frozen and refrigerated items , and we continue to be very pleased with the product cost savings we are seeing .", "in fact , dg fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases , and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to scale this transformational initiative .", "another important goal of dg fresh is to increase sales in these categories .", "we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front , driven by higher overall in -
