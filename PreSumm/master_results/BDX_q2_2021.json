submission .", "therefore , we would expect that the fda review process will take some time to complete .", "and while we 're not intending to predict the fda - specific time line , we certainly recognize that our stakeholders would like to have some input for modeling purposes and we believe it would be prudent to think about alaris ' clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal year 2022 .", "we plan to update you if there are any significant developments .", "and for now , we expect to continue to ship to our customers who qualify under medical necessity .", "we 've learned

diabetes business to our shareholders which we believe is a value - creating transaction .", "our diabetes care business generated $ 1.1 billion of revenue in fiscal 2020 , is a global leader in insulin injection devices .", "consistent with our continuing focus on delivering shareholder value , we undergo strategic reviews to identify ways to create value and determine that the strategic priorities of bd have diverged from those of our diabetes care business .", "we believe a spin - off will position both companies for long - term growth and success by allowing both to focus on their respective core markets , innovations and customer outcomes .", "each company will be able to more efficiently allocate its resources and capital , best positioning the respective companies for their success and value creation .", "we see tremendous potential to create value for our diabetes care business ahead .", "we see the spin - off as an operating catalyst for our diabetes care business .", "as an independent public company , newco will be able to more effectively allocate its human , operational and financial resources to implement a refined growth strategy that will allow it to focus on innovation , and improving the care of patients living with diabetes .", "being a separate entity , will also better enable newco to attract and retain talent , align management and employee incentives , and have a stock currency that it can use for future acquisitions .", "for remainco bd , we expect the spin - off to strengthen our mid-single - digit fx - neutral revenue growth .", "we estimate the uplift to our revenue growth rate to be about 30 basis points .", "and see this as strengthening our double - digit total return growth profile .", "the spin - off will allow remainco to focus on our r&d tuck - in m&a and customer growth strategies , simplify our overall focus and maintain financial flexibility .", "considering all of these benefits , we believe this transaction has the potential to create value for our shareholders , which will be owners of both companies .", "slide 17 , provides an overview of the relevant transaction details .", "and i 've already covered many of these topics .", "the spin - off is expected to be implemented by a means of a distribution of 100 % of the shares of a newly traded -- publicly traded entity to bd shareholders , and is intended to be tax - free for u.s. federal income tax purposes .", "over the next several months , we 'll be filing our form 10 , which will include the carve - out financial statements .", "again , we expect

all stakeholders .", "i 'm incredibly excited to embark on this journey .", "i see a tremendous opportunity to build shareholder value and advance care for patients who suffer from diabetes .", "i 'm also very humbled , to be leading this amazing organization .", "the diabetes care business has a long history of caring for patients living with the disease , dating back to bd 's introduction of the world 's first specialized insulin syringe , almost 100 years ago in 1924 .", "since then , bd has played a leading role in the delivery of insulin , including helping to drive the adoption of insulin pens , which utilize our pen needle technology , as a leading modality for insulin injection .", "our diabetes care business now reaches more diabetic patients , than any other medical device company in the world today .", "we manufacture eight billion devices per year and are the global leader in insulin injection devices .", "as tom mentioned earlier , the business generated nearly $ 1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020 , derived from the sale of insulin injection devices such as , pen needles and insulin syringes as well as other accessories .", "one factor that attracted me to this opportunity was the global breadth of the business with 48 % of the revenues generated outside the united states , including 17 % in emerging markets .", "and why is this important ?", "as you can see on slide 21 , diabetes is a growing chronic condition across the globe , with some of the higher prevalence rates expected to be in the emerging market regions .", "the international diabetes federation estimates that the number of adults living with diabetes is expected to grow from 463 million in 2019 to 578 million in 2030 and 700 million by 2045 .", "most of these patients will likely continue to rely on traditional injection devices for their insulin needs .", "the rapid growth of the disease will likely place a significant burden on healthcare systems around the world , as patients with diabetes are often afflicted with multiple co-morbidities like cardiovascular disease , hypertension , diabetic retinopathy and lower limb complications .", "while i 've only been with the company for a few months now , i can assure you that my passion and vision for newco is one of growth .", "injection devices like pen needle and syringes are likely to remain a key part of their treatment paradigm for people with diabetes on a global basis for the foreseeable future .", "we will look to leverage our global footprint to capitalize on these demographic trends .", "however , we 'll also look to invest in novel insulin delivery technologies , including our internal type 2 patch technologies .", "we also plan to supplement our internal r&d product development efforts more broadly and accelerate our growth profile through strategic m&a to broaden our product offerings and enter adjacencies on new growth categories .", "let me end by saying how excited and humbled i am to have this opportunity to lead newco .", "i am confident that our team will work tirelessly to advance care for our patients while building shareholder value .", "we see this as a great opportunity for those bd associates that will be part of newco and we 're happy to have you and jake on board .", "i 'd like to provide an update on our esg initiatives across bd .", "over the past quarter , we continued to advance our companywide esg initiatives , including our recent commitment to be carbon neutral across direct operations by 2040 .", "we also continue to make progress toward identifying our 2030 goals and we look forward to sharing more details behind our 2030 sustainability plan with you in future engagements .", "before turning it over to chris , i want to say again how proud i am of the organization for the progress we 've made in advancing the bd 2025 strategy .", "we are purposely shifting our focus to growth opportunities .", "simplifying the organization to remove complexity as i firmly believe complexity gets in the way of growth and we 're empowering our associates with a growth mindset .", "we are committed to doing the right things , the right way and fulfilling our purpose of advancing the world of health .", "i also want to reiterate how excited i am for what 's ahead for both remainco bd and newco .", "bd 's board of directors and management

diabetes care business .", "i see the transaction is a win-win for all stakeholders , our shareholders , our employees , our customers and our patients .", "i 'm confident that we have the right

excluding covid - 19 diagnostic testings were ahead of our expectations across all segments .", "now turning to slide 28 .", "our medical segment delivered 4.7 % fx - neutral revenue growth led by our market leading bd pharmaceutical solutions systems business , which continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10 % .", "we are proceeding with our capacity expansion to support the future growth of this business unit .", "mds grew a solid 8.1 % , which included $ 43 million from covid - 19 vaccination injection device revenues .", "we also benefited from higher patient acuity and

38 % on an fx neutral basis .", "our covid - 19 diagnostic testing revenues totaled $ 480 million and are included in our integrated diagnostics solutions business .", "while bd veritor asps were as expected in the low to mid-teens , the market 's overall demand for symptomatic covid diagnostic testing was lower .", "looking at our ids business excluding covid testing , our routine diagnostic testing has not yet fully recovered to pre-covid - 19 levels .", "there was virtually no traditional flu this year , so we did not have our usual flu test revenues and this impacted our ids growth rate by 540 basis points and our bd life sciences growth rate by 410 basis points .", "the impact to our overall bd growth rate was 110 basis points .", "our biosciences business unit delivered strong growth of over 12 % as research lab activity has recovered nicely .", "we are seeing strong demand for research instruments and reagents as well as from biopharmaceutical companies for vaccine research and development .", "as shown on slide 30 , the bd interventional segment was flat this quarter , which was better than expected given the covid - 19 resurgences .", "the performance in surgery and pi reflected the early impact from the covid resurgence .", "however , we did see recovery in elective procedures as the quarter progressed and this trend has continued into april .", "our urology and critical care franchise continues to deliver solid growth led by our purewick and targeted temperature management product lines .", "turning to our results by geographic regions on slide 31 .", "in the united states , revenues were up 1.9 % .", "as we had discussed on our february earnings call , we did see some early impact from covid - 19 resurgence , which waned as the quarter progressed and we exited march with improved momentum and this continued in april .", "international revenues were up 25.7 % on a currency - neutral basis as we begin to anniversary the initial impact of covid - 19 , particularly in china where our revenues were up 62 % .", "we also benefited from our covid - 19 responses , our diagnostic testing and vaccine injection delivery device revenues .", "now turning to the p&l on slide 32 .", "as expected our gross margin was sequentially lower as compared to our first quarter .", "our gross margin was 53.8 % driven mostly by the lower covid diagnostic testing revenues .", "on a year - over - year basis , the gross margin included a 70 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange and 70 basis points from reinvestment initiatives .", "favorable impacts from our continuous improvement initiatives were offset by product quality - related expenses .", "our ssg&a spending rose 9 % year - over - year on an fx - neutral basis , including a 380 basis point impact from deferred compensation , which as you know is fully offset in other income expense .", "the remaining increase in ssg&a is primarily related to higher shipping costs and investment spending as part of our bd veritor profit reinvestments .", "our r&d spending ramped sequentially as planned as we reinvested some of the bd veritor profits behind new pipeline innovations .", "r&d increased 18.7 % year - over - year on an fx - neutral basis to $ 295 million , representing 6 % of our revenues .", "our operating income grew 14.3 % on a year - over - year

interest and other expenses totaled $ 111 million versus $ 170 million in the year ago period .", "the reduction of interest other net on a year - over - year basis , primarily reflects a decrease in deferred compensation offsetting increases in ssg&a as previously mentioned .", "it also reflects reduced interest expense due to debt repayment and refinancing activities and lower interest rates .", "our tax rate was 12 % lower than expected due to discrete tax items that occurred this quarter .", "our adjusted earnings per share increased 25.1 % over the prior year to $ 3.19 on a reported basis

more balanced than it had been in the past as we were paying down our debt .", "now more of our cash can be deployed to support our growth strategy , tuck - in m&a , maintaining a competitive dividend and returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases .", "as a reminder under the existing share repurchase authorization plan , we have just under 7.9 million shares or roughly $ 2 billion remaining .", "also note that we would expect bd 's dividend to be unaffected by the diabetes spin-off and therefore would increase bd 's payout ratio .", "next i want to address our fiscal

and power .", "our investments continue to put temporary pressure on both our gross and operating margins in 2021 .", "as we mentioned last quarter , we continue to expect our operating margins in the

seeing on our margins to lift next year .", "as you 've seen in the past from time to time there can be some volatility in our tax rate .", "we now expect our fy 2021 tax rate to be slightly lower than fy 2020 's tax rate .", "this helps to offset some gross margin pressure from the lower asps from veritor as pricing is now approaching compared to our flu test price a bit faster than we originally anticipated .", "regarding 2022 given the momentum we are seeing our progress with our r&d pipeline the reinvestments of our bd veritor proceeds and our tuck - in acquisition strategy we have increased confidence in our core outlook .", "in fiscal 2022 , excluding covid - 19 testing and alaris 510 ( k ) clearance , we expect our revenues to grow solidly in the mid-single digits .",
