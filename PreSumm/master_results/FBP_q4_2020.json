'm truly proud of what our team was able to accomplish , overcoming all the many challenges posed by the pandemic in the operating environment .", "it really was a transformational year for our company with the acquisition that closed on september 1 , which has further expanded our market share , solidified our position in puerto rico .", "we have now over 30 % growth in our customer base , reaching 675,000 customers .", "we 're also very pleased with the technological advancements on the year and our data preparedness .", "our clients ' adoption of digital channels continued to improve

planned to be completed by the end of the summer .", "on the economic side , the macro and geopolitical landscape in puerto rico seems -- continue to be improving .", "economic measures stemming from additional stimulus and disaster relief funding will definitely provide additional support to those impacted by the pandemic and the overall environment .", "lockdowns continue at a different layer , but when we look at december activity , it was actually fairly healthy considering the limitations in operating hours .", "most impacted sectors , as we know , continued to be hospitality and retail .", "on the other hand , we are entering 2021 on very solid foot and a fortress balance sheet to support that economic recovery .", "we have very strong liquidity , solid research coverage , and very strong capital to begin the year with .", "for the year , we generated $ 102 million in net income , $ 0.46 per share , shy to the $ 167 million that we generated in 2019 , definitely impacted by the economic effects on the pandemic and the increased provision driven by cecl and the acquisition .", "pre-tax preparation was strong , increasing 6 % to $ 300 million , with actually only four months of our combined company .", "and in spite of covid , actually loan activity -- covid -- loan activity -- which impacted loan activity .", "we 'll cover that later .", "and obviously , in spite of the yield curve that the banks are operating , which definitely impact the topline revenue .", "loan origination and renewal for the year reached $ 4.4 billion , and organic core deposit growth , a record growth of $ 2 billion .", "so , it was really a very positive core year for the company .", "now let 's move to slide 6 to cover the highlights of the quarter .", "this compares to $ 28 million in the past quarter .", "it 's important to highlight that this is the first full quarter of operation of the combined franchise .", "ppnr came in very strong with $ 86 million , up from $ 77 million in the prior quarter .", "and i think importantly , we are past the moratoriums , and we are very closely monitoring asset quality metrics .", "asset quality metrics remain stable .", "and obviously , there is focus on those borrowers negatively impacted by the effects of the pandemic .", "we really say it is early to predict final -- final inflows to npa created by the pandemic , but when we look at initial metrics post - moratorium , delinquency metrics as of year - end still compared better when we look at december ' 19 pre-pandemic levels .", "as i said , we continue to invest in technology to better share our customer .", "during this quarter , we implemented a new online and mobile platform for credit cards .", "we also continue the rollout of our new branch digital one [ phonetic ] platform .", "and then , when we look at capital , cet1 17.3 % , definitely post acquisition impact still very strong and among the highest .", "so please let 's move to slide 7 .", "i 'd like to expand a bit on loans and loan activity and deposits .", "as i say , loan origination activity was robust for the quarter , $ 1.4 billion .", "this excludes credit card activity .", "primarily , growth was in the commercial and the auto portfolio .", "i think we all know that commercial activity is seasonal , and yes we have a very solid quarter of deals that got delayed in the year .", "we also have some volumes on the main street loan programs and ppp .", "so , if we exclude main street and ppp , origination still increased by $ 278 million to $ 1.2 billion , so still strong .", "the overall portfolio , now it's at $ 11.8 billion , declined slightly from prior quarter .", "i will say primarily due to strategic reductions in residential .", "we continue to originate primary conforming loans , which has helped the non-interest income .", "and also we received repayments of about $ 49 million on the ppp loan forgiveness process .", "for this quarter , we anticipate another approximately $ 100 million of repayment in ppp .", "obviously , it depends on the speed that sba process , the forgiveness .", "and we are now , obviously as you know , working in round 2 of ppp , which was recently approved .", "our initial estimates are around $ 250 million in loans during the first half of 2021 on ppp loans .", "we know that this could replace some of the normal commercial volume over the next months , as it happens in the first round of ppp .", "but definitely , this is a great support to small businesses .", "we expect loans -- this loans to be smaller , more granular and to be more focused on the smaller businesses .", "on the deposit front , there is ample liquidity in the market .", "we continue to see inflow of funds .", "we continue to see deposit growth .", "and we expect the year to continue on that trend .", "so , we really focus on increasing loan generation .", "we have excess liquidity that we need to deploy .", "and when we look at the quarter , core deposits were up another $ 257 million .", "obviously , consumer and mortgage trends continue very solid and very consistent .", "and as always , commercial is always model - driven .", "so , we 're working hard to build that pipeline .", "now let 's please move to slide 8 .", "i think it 's important to highlight that the earnings power of our franchise now reach a new high with $ 86 million of ppnr on the combined operation , again being only the first quarter of this .", "the enhanced funding profile of the combined institution will also contribute to mitigating some of the yield curve impact on the overall yield of the portfolios .", "and obviously , now we have more customers to reach -- more customers to go after for loan generation .", "looking into 2021 , obviously , there is going to be some noise still because of the integration .", "the first half of the year is definitely focused on integration .", "we want to finish that by summer .", "so , there is some expenses that are there to be able to achieve the full benefit of integration .", "so , they will be primarily focused in the first half of the year .", "and then on the second half of the year , it 's important to know that as we -- market recovers , everything reopens which is what we expect .", "and as we grow revenue , there is also some variable expense tied to these revenues that could bring some increase .", "we are targeting a long - term efficiency ratio of 55 % following the completion of the integration .", "i want to make comment that we really need to realize that -- recognize that it is challenging for banks to achieve mid-50s in the current yield curve environment .", "so , we also expect hopefully some improvement in the curve at some point in time at the end of the year .", "let 's move to slide 6 to slightly touch on the capital and the balance sheet .", "again liquidity continued to build in the quarter .", "so we have -- we continued to see excess cash , reserve coverage remain at the similar levels of prior quarter , so very strong reserve coverage at 3.3 % .", "and then , capital is again very strong with cet1 at above [ phonetic ] 17 % , after completing the acquisition .", "as i said in the last call , capital deployment opportunities remain a priority and are the focus of management and board .", "last night , we announced the approval to increase the dividend this quarter to $ 0.07 per share , definitely driven by current and predicted earnings .", "and as i commented in the past earnings call , during this quarter , we 're actively working on the data stress test , an updated capital plan to be presented to our board in order to conclude on potential additional capital actions moving forward .", "aurelio mentioned we had a strong quarter , $ 50 million in the quarter , $ 0.23 a share , which compares with $ 28 million last quarter , $ 0.13 a share .", "again , keep in mind that the quarter does reflect the first full quarter effect of the acquired operations .", "we only had one month of those results in the third quarter of 2020 .", "the quarter included still some merger and restructuring costs of $ 12.3 million this quarter compared with $ 10.4 million last quarter .", "and also keep in mind that last quarter , we had a day 1 cecl allowance for the corporation [ phonetic ] of almost $ 39 million and we recognized an $ 8 million reversal -- a partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance , which also reflected on the results .", "net interest income for the quarter , it 's up $ 29 million .", "a lot has to do with the $ 1.7 billion higher average loan balance we have in the quarter , which includes the santander acquisition , obviously the full effect , but also new originations on the commercial and consumer loans for the quarter .", "those were partially offset by , as aurelio made reference to also , the fact that we have continued to reduce the mortgage portfolio , which is down about $ 130 million [ phonetic ] as compared to september 30 , as well as the $ 49 million reduction in ppp loans .", "some loans have been submitted for forgiveness , and they were paid off in the quarter .", "the quarter also -- we recognized $ 1.1 million of interest income we collected on non-accrual loans , mostly charge - off non-accrual loans that were recovered .", "and the repayment of the ppp loans resulted in the acceleration of $ 700,000 of commissions on those loans .", "on the quarter , we also had a reduction of over [ phonetic ] $ 800,000 in interest expense .", "this is even though the overall interest bearing liabilities went up $ 2 billion from the full quarter effect of the transaction and continued increase on deposits .", "we saw an 18 basis points reduction on the funding cost during the quarter as compared to last quarter .", "non-interest income for the quarter is $ 30 million .", "it is up $ 5 million .", "if we consider that last quarter had $ 5 million of gains on loss -- the gain on sales of securities , we did n't have much this quarter .", "so excluding that -- those $ 5 million , non-interest income went up again $ 5 million .", "$ 2.5 million was service charges on deposits , full quarter of santander acquisition plus increases that we are starting to see on volume of transactions .", "the second and third quarter expenses were lower .", "the variable component of the expenses were lower in transaction related fees -- transaction related volume , therefore fees were also down .", "we continue to see strong originations , lot of refinancings .", "significant part of it , it 's a conforming paper that we end up selling .", "so we had $ 500,000 increases in those gains on sales of some of those mortgage loans .", "also during in the quarter , we recognized $ 1.4 million on fees on main street loans we originated during the quarter .", "$ 184 million of loans were originated under the main street lending program .", "and we sold the 95 % participation through the government as tabulated in the program .", "expenses for the quarter were $ 134 million , almost $ 135 million , which is up from $ 107 million ; again full quarter effect .", "those expenses again include the $ 12 million in merger and restructuring costs for the quarter .", "so far from the start of the process , we have incurred approximately $ 36 million in merger and restructuring costs .", "it 's part of the transaction .", "and we expect that there will be an additional somewhere between $ 26 million and $ 30 million happening mostly on the first half of 2021 , as we complete integrations , conversions and a number of other things that are ongoing in the integration process .", "pandemic expenses , again , cleaning cost , additional security and things like that was -- were $ 1.1 million , basically similar to the $ 1 million we had in the third quarter .", "if we exclude all these items , expenses went up $ 25 million , mostly again from having the full quarter of the acquired operations , but also the higher transaction volumes on debit , credit card and some other components increase cost , plus some additional items and some $ 900,000 in incentive compensation increases .", "we had $ 2.3 million in technology fees .", "the increased amortization of the intangibles associated with the transaction was about $ 1.5 million higher for the quarter .", "on the other hand , if we look at credit - related expenses that were slightly down were $ 1.8 million compared to $ 2.2 million last quarter .", "there is one item that has been affected by -- obviously by the moratorium programs and the delays on foreclosures and some other legal processes in the market .", "over the next couple of quarters , we expect some increases in these categories as foreclosures and other legal processes come back to normal levels .", "allowance for credit losses at december was $ 401 million , slightly down from about $ 402.6 million we had at september .", "however , the allowance for credit losses on loans was $ 385 million , $ 386 million almost , which is $ 1.2 million higher than september .", "the ratio of the loans allowance was 3.28 % as compared to 3.25 % in september .", "the provision for the quarter , as you saw on the release , was $ 7.7 million , which compares to almost $ 47 million in the quarter .", "but again , third quarter included the $ 38.9 million provision , day 1 provision we put in to comply with cecl requirements for non-pcd loans on the acquired operations .", "for this quarter , the projected macroeconomic scenarios used for calculations of the allowance for credit losses showed improvements in many of the economic variables , including unemployment , which is a critical driver as compared to what we used in the third quarter .", "however , the cra index shows deterioration in the quarter , mostly due to longer projected recovery time frames , especially on commercial retail real estate .", "as a result of the required provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolios went up and we booked a provision of $ 22.3 million in the fourth quarter and the reserve or the allowance for credit losses increased $ 252.7 million or 2.7 % of loans from our 2.3 % of loans last quarter .", "in the case of residential mortgages on the other hand , the improvement on macroeconomic variables combined with the reduction in the portfolio that i mentioned , the $ 130 million [ phonetic ] reduction , resulted in a release of credit losses of $ 9.8 million for the quarter .", "and same thing on consumer side , the improvement on the macroeconomic variables resulted in a release of $ 2.3 million in reserves requirements .", "if we exclude the ppp loans on a non-gaap basis , the ratio of the allowance to loans would be 3.39 % , which is still very healthy allowance coverage for possible losses at december .", "it was 3.38 % at september , so it stayed very consistent .", "in terms of our asset quality , in non-performing , we 're basically flat from last quarter , $ 294 million .", "non-performing loans increased $ 3.80 million in the quarter , $ 2.6 million of the increase was in residential portfolio and $ 1.4 million in the consumer portfolio .", "on the other hand , the other real estate owned came down by $ 6 million , driven by sales .", "we sold $ 5.8 million of residential real estate , all the real estate that we had on the books .", "with the expiration of the moratoriums , what we did see in this quarter was an increase in inflows .", "inflows of non-performing were $ 32.9 million compared to $ 18.4 million in the third quarter .", "but if you compare the inflow -- this inflow level to pre-pandemic , these were very much in line to what we had -- what we saw in december of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 .", "early delinquency showed similar trends .", "we also saw increases in early delinquency from september levels , but it still at levels that are below what we had at december of last year .", "so , it 's been still very consistent .", "regarding capital ratios , i think that on the non-performing -- before we go to capital , i think that it 's important to mention on the non-performing , the way we see it .", "we do expect that there could be some increases , not major numbers , but some increases in non-performing on the first half of 2021 , as we complete some of this process with the customers and win moratoriums and had impacts associated with the pandemic .", "and then by the second half of the year , those would get back to normal levels .", "so it 's temporary thing .", "we feel it 's going to be seen in the first half of 2021 .", "regarding capital again , aurelio already touched , it 's strong capital ratios .", "i do want to mention that leverage ratio shows a decrease from september , but it 's all related to the fact that september we only had one month of acquired operation .", "therefore , average balance which are used for the leverage were lower .", "the level of leverage resulting of 11.3 % , still very healthy and well in line with what we had expected at completion of the transaction .", "regarding the year , again aurelio touched on this .", "i do n't want to go into a lot of detail , but clearly , the biggest impact was the provision .", "net income for the year was $ 102 million or $ 0.46 a share , but it was affected by $ 130 million increase in provision , which includes pandemic impact and the fact that we did record the day 1 cecl allowance of $ 39 million i mentioned before required for the loans -- the non-pcd loans we obtained under transaction .", "adjusted pre-tax pre-provision for the year was up 6 % to $ 300 million from $ 284 million .", "so , it was a pretty good improvement .", "and that obviously includes some additional months from the acquired santander operation .", "npas year over year decreased $ 24 million to $ 294 million , and we continue to work on the process of getting those numbers down ."], "summary_gold": "compname announces increase in quarterly cash dividend to $ 0.07 per share .",
