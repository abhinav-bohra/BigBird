term value across our portfolio and just demonstrates the benefit of having contiguous blocking acreage to be able to drill that type of laterals .", "really , this just reflects our trend of what we 've accomplished on g&a over the past three years , including the synergies from the acquisitions .", "we are forecasting g&a per boe to be around $ 1.15 to $ 1.20 by year - end .", "and so , i think this is just an example of , really -- and highlights the focus of the company 's had on improving returns and improving our return of capital to shareholders .", "so it 's really lowering our overall cost structure .", "so you 've seen us drive down well costs , lower loe , lower g&a per boe , lower interest per boe , all with the idea of improving our free cash flow profile .", "with that , i 'll turn it to neal to talk about breakevens .", "on slide 13 , you can see how pioneer 's high - quality asset base positions us as the only e&p to realize a corporate breakeven below $ 30 a barrel wti within our peer group .", "as scott stated earlier , it 's this attractive peer - leading breakeven oil price that enables pioneer 's low investment rate and drive significant free cash flow generation and return of capital to our shareholders .", "this low breakeven price reflects the quality and the resilience of pioneer 's portfolio , underpinning our operational and financial strength and flexibility .", "i 'm going to be starting on slide 14 .", "our drilling and completions teams continued their streak of resetting the bar with another great quarter of efficiency gains .", "our simulfrac operations contributed to these gains with the successful execution of four pads in q1 , where we were able to achieve approximately 3,000 feet of completed lateral per day .", "this is greater than a 50 % improvement when compared to our program average .", "it 's still early days , but we estimate savings to be in the range of $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 per well .", "we will continue to refine our simulfrac operations and conduct more trials throughout the second quarter .", "you will note that our wells per pad projection for 2021 is down slightly from last quarter , and this is due to the integration of doublepoint pads into our schedule .", "still , our wells per pad continues to increase , which further contributes to our efficiency gains .", "i know this slide only illustrates improvements in drilling and completions , so i want to emphasize that we are also seeing tremendous performance in our production operations , facilities , construction and water management teams , and none of this would be possible with those that support development planning , our robust supply chain and our expanding use of technology .", "we remain focused on delivering peer leading performance , keeping our people safe and reducing our environmental footprint .", "and so congratulations to all the teams for their contributions to our safe and efficient execution in q1 .", "i 'm now going to go to slide 15 .", "i know that scott covered this in some detail last quarter , so i 'll be brief .", "so this chart represents more than 64 million barrels of hydrocarbon liquids per day , including the largest national oil companies , majors and independents .", "pioneer 's operations produced barrels with one of the lowest associated co2 emissions intensities globally .", "our low -
