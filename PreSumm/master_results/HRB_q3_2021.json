thirds of the decline was related to variable compensation and product expense , which was driven by lower return volume .", "additionally , marketing expenses were lower as we shifted spend to the fourth quarter .", "reductions in travel , legal and occupancy costs account for the remainder of the decrease .", "interest expense declined $ 4 million , which reflects lower draws on our line of credit , as well as a lower interest rate on our debt issuance earlier in the fiscal year .", "the changes in revenue and expenses resulted in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $ 284 million .", "gaap loss per share increased from $ 0.66 to $ 1.27 , while adjusted loss per share increased from $ 0.59 to $ 1.17 .", "though the majority of this change was driven by the increase in pre-tax loss , it was also impacted by lower effective tax rate , as well as lower shares outstanding resulting from repurchases earlier in the year .", "as we 've discussed , while beneficial on a full - year basis , the lower tax rate and share count negatively impacts earnings per share in quarters in which we report a loss .", "in discontinued operations , there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to sand canyon during the quarter .", "turning to our outlook for the fiscal year .", "we expect industry volume to recover in the second half and then relatively flat for the tax season , assuming the deadline remains april 15 .", "based on these expectations and the positive trends jeff mentioned earlier , we continue to expect revenue in the range of $ 3.5 billion to $ 3.6 billion and ebitda of $ 950 million to $ 1 billion .", "we have identified additional favorability in corporate taxes and , as such , now expect our effective tax rate to come in at the low end of our 18 % to 20 % outlook range .", "turning to our strategic imperatives .", "i 'd like to spend some time on the related investments and how we plan to fund them .", "as jeff mentioned , our established operations in small business , financial products , and consumer tax provide a strong base from which to build .", "it 's also important to note that we 're implementing each strategic imperative in phases over the next several years .", "this allows us to take a methodical approach , making modest initial investments with incremental investments being funded through revenue growth .", "in small business , current investments are primarily in technology necessary to develop our capabilities , compensation as we build the team required to provide services , and marketing to acquire customers .", "in financial products , the investment this year is limited and is primarily related to product design and experience .", "this will continue into next year as we invest in technology to support the mobile banking platform .", "and in block experience , we continue to invest in technology and new operating models to deliver expertise and care to consumers however they want to do their taxes .", "all in , these costs total approximately $ 20 million to $ 25 million in fiscal ' 21 .", "we 've done an excellent job this year of finding efficiencies and eliminating unnecessary spend to fund these investments .", "to summarize how we 're thinking about this , our initial investments will be in the tens of millions of dollars , not hundreds of millions .", "we 'll fund them through cost reductions elsewhere in the business .", "additional investments will be funded by incremental revenue growth .", "and as a reminder , m&a is not a core part of our strategy .", "though we 'll remain open to opportunistically investing in external capabilities when we believe they will drive appropriate returns .", "on a related note , following our investor day in december , we received several questions regarding our baseline earnings and expected run rate going forward .", "we understand the importance of providing this perspective and plan to do so following the conclusion of this fiscal year .", "ultimately , our goal is to grow our top line at a rate in which we leverage our fixed cost , which translates to improved earnings and free cash flow .", "this ability to generate a significant amount of cash , while our strategic imperatives provide a platform for accelerated growth , gives us confidence in our future and supports our capital allocation priorities , which remain consistent .", "at the top of the list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality .", "next , we will fund the investments i discussed earlier .", "finally , we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases .", "we 're committed to continuing our dividend with the goal of increasing it over time .", "the health of our business and our outlook for the future have allowed us to increase the dividend in four of the last five years , amounting to a total increase of 30 % during that span .", "we are also committed to repurchasing shares to offset dilution and we 'll opportunistically repurchase shares beyond that .", "this fiscal year , we have repurchased 5 % of shares outstanding .", "and during my tenure as cfo , we have repurchased 19 % of shares outstanding .", "in summary , we 're accomplishing great things in our tax business and are on track to deliver our financial objectives for the fiscal year .", "and our prudent , measured investments and our strategic imperatives are putting us on a path toward long -
