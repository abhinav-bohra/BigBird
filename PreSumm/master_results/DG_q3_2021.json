store sales decline of approximately 3 % to 2.5 % , but which reflects growth of approximately 13 % to 14 % on a two - year stack basis ; and earnings per share in the range of $ 9.90 to $ 10.20 , which reflects a compound annual growth rate in the range of 22 % to 24 % or approximately 21 % to 23 % , compared to 2019 adjusted earnings per share over a two -

through rate .", "consistent with q2 and q3 , we expect continued pressure on our gross margin rate in the fourth quarter , due to a higher lifo provision , as a result of cost of goods increases , a less favorable sales mix , compared to the prior year quarter , and an increase in markdown rates as we continue to cycle the abnormally low levels in 2020 .", "we also anticipate higher supply chain costs in q4 compared to the 2020 period .", "like other retailers our business continues to be impacted by higher costs due to transit and port delays , as well as elevated demand for services at third -
