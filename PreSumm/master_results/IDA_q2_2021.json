to - normal operations for many of our commercial and industrial customers as our service area rebounds from the impact of the covid - 19 pandemic .", "as of the end of june , unemployment in our service area was 3.5 % compared with 6 % in june 2020 and the current mark of 5.9 % nationally .", "total employment in our service area has increased 6 % over the past 12 months .", "moody 's forecasted gdp calls for very strong economic growth of 7.6 % in 2021 and 6.9 % in 2022 .", "as we speak , like many employers in our area , idaho power is in the midst of the return -

over - quarter changes , you 'll see our continuing customer growth added $ 3.9 million to operating income .", "also , increased usage per customer drove operating income higher by $ 22.9 million .", "cooling degree days were nearly double last year 's second quarter and the hot and dry conditions led to significantly higher usage across all customer classes .", "irrigation and residential per customer usage increased 25 % and 10 % , respectively .", "a return to more normal economic conditions combined with the hot weather also drove a respective 12 % and 8 % increase in usage per customer in the commercial and industrial classes .", "continuing down the table , the higher usage for residential and small general service customers was partially offset by $ 5.1 million lower revenues from the pca -- or the fca mechanism .", "the fca mechanism has tempered the effect of the higher usage for these customer classes and could do so again in the third quarter if customer usage continues strong .", "next , you 'll see a decrease in operating income of $ 6.8 million that relates to the change in the per megawatt hour revenue , net of power supply costs and power cost adjustment impacts quarter - to - quarter .", "the primary driver of this decrease relates to the amount of net power supply expenses that were not deferred to idaho power 's power cost adjustment mechanisms .", "recall that idaho customers generally bear 95 % of power supply cost fluctuations .", "and those costs were higher as the heatwave impacted wholesale energy prices at a time of increased energy usage by our customers .", "the heatwave also affected transmission wheeling - related revenues , which increased operating income by $ 3.9 million .", "wheeling volumes increased as utilities work to serve high demand by moving energy across our system throughout the region during the quarter .", "in addition , wheeling customers paid 10 % more for idaho power 's open access transmission tariff rate that increased last october to reflect higher transmission costs .", "next on the table , other operating and maintenance expenses increased by $ 5.3 million .", "this was primarily due to last year 's temporary deferral of certain maintenance projects at idaho power 's jointly owned thermal generation plant as well as higher accruals of performance - based incentives .", "we continue to see decreases in employee travel and training costs related to covid - 19 , while our allowance for bad debt remains above historic levels and it 's taking longer to collect .", "our net covid - 19 recovery deferral impact , however , continue to remain nominal .", "finally , our higher pre-tax earnings led to an increase in income tax expense of $ 4.2 million this quarter .", "the changes collectively resulted in a net increase to idaho power 's net income of $ 9.6 million , or $ 0.19 per share .", "idacorp and idaho power continue to maintain strong balance sheets , including investment - grade credit ratings and sound liquidity , which enable us to fund ongoing capital expenditures and distribute dividends to share owners .", "idacorp 's operating cash flows , along with our liquidity positions as of the end of june 2021 are included on slide 11 .", "cash flows from operations were about $ 39 million higher than the first six months of last year .", "the increase was mostly related to working capital fluctuations and the timing of net collections of regulatory assets and liabilities .", "the liquidity available under idacorp's and idaho power 's credit facilities is shown on the middle of slide 11 .", "at this time , we still do not anticipate raising any equity capital in 2021 .", "our combined liquidity , along with expected regulatory support from our annual adjustment mechanisms , is a substantial backstop to our expected capital and operating needs .", "slide 12 shows our raised full year earnings guidance and our current key financial and operating metrics estimates .", "we now expect idacorp 's 2021 earnings to be in the range of $ 4.70 to $ 4.90 per diluted share .", "this guidance assumes normal weather and operating conditions for the second half of the year , and assumes economic impacts from the pandemic will continue to normalize .", "our guidance still assumes idaho power will use no additional tax credits in 2021 .", "while we do not currently expect to record sharing of excess revenues with idaho customers this year , the upper end of our range approaches that level and the final jurisdictional allocation can adjust on that through year - end .", "recall that above a 10 % return on equity in the idaho jurisdiction , idaho customers would receive 80 % of any excess earnings .", "our expected full year o&m expense guidance remains in the range of $ 345 million to $ 355 million .", "it 's fair to say this goal to keep o&m relatively flat for the ninth straight year is being challenged by the amount of customer and load growth we are experiencing .", "we also reaffirm our capex forecast for this year in the range of $ 320 million to $ 300 million -- $ 330 million , excuse me .", "our expectation of hydropower generation has decreased somewhat given the weather conditions least represented and is now expected to be in the tightened range of five million to six million -
