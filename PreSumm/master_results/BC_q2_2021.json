related plant shutdowns .", "this resulted in the first half of 2021 comparing very favorably to 2020 in all of our businesses due to higher production volumes , with additional earnings tailwinds from improved absorption , favorable foreign currency comparisons and favorable changes in customer mix in our propulsion business .", "these factors far outweighed the headwinds from supply chain challenges , inflationary pressures and higher variable compensation expenses experienced during the first six months of this year .", "our first half performance this year also exceeded 2019 in every metric .", "as we head into the second half of 2021 , we will face more difficult comps to 2020 as the company recorded record - high earnings per share over the same period last year , and we will continue to be challenged with supply chain constraints and increasing input and freight costs .", "although , we are taking price increases across our businesses , we also anticipate moderated sales mix with propulsion sales trending more toward core oem customers , more typical seasonality in the p&a business and a higher percentage of overall growth in the boat business ; increased spending on aces and other growth initiatives ; smaller benefits from currency and absorption ; and a higher tariff impact .", "however , despite more challenging second half comparisons , this continues to be a growth story .", "we anticipate expanding top -
