19 and the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trends , partially offset by an increase in non-cat weather losses including wildfires .", "the expense ratio of 29.3 % is two - tenths of a point favorable to last year 's third quarter results , and reflects our strategic focus over a number of years on improving productivity and efficiency .", "setting aside quarter - to - quarter variability , our year - to - date expense ratio of approximately 30 % is a figure we 're comfortable with .", "our top - line proved to be resilient with a 3 % increase in net written premium , as continued strong renewal rate change and retention , in all three segments , more than offset modestly lower insured exposures in the commercial businesses .", "for the quarter , losses directly related to covid - 19 totaled $ 133 million pre-tax with $ 92 million in business insurance driven primarily by workers ' comp and $ 41 million in our bond & specialty business predominantly driven by management liability .", "more than offsetting those losses were lower levels of auto claims and to a lesser extent , fewer non-covid workers ' comp ngl claims due to lower levels of economic activity .", "the net impact of the covid environment on the consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit of about 2 points , mostly in personal insurance .", "given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment , we continue to take a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of covid - 19 - related losses .", "consistent with my commentary last quarter , the majority of direct covid losses that we booked year - to - date through september is still sitting in ibnr .", "looking at the year - to - date impact of direct covid losses , net of related frequency benefits and other underwriting items , our underwriting results have benefited by a little more than $ 100 million pre-tax or about 0.5 point on a consolidated underlying combined ratio , including the impact of premium refunds to policyholders .", "however , year - to - date net investment income reflects the significant adverse impact on our non-fixed income portfolio .", "turning to prior year reserve development .", "as previously disclosed , third quarter includes approximately $ 400 million of pre-tax benefit from the pg&e subrogation .", "about 80 % of that benefit is reflected in personal insurance , with the remainder reflected in business insurance .", "setting pg&e to the side , qid results in the quarter were as follows .", "in personal insurance , net favorable development of $ 40 million pre-tax was driven by auto results coming in better than expected for recent accident years .", "in bond & specialty insurance , there was no net impact from qid .", "in business insurance , we recognized unfavorable development of $ 295 million pre-tax as a result of our annual asbestos review .", "while there was some slight improvement in several of our asbestos indicators , the overall level of paid losses and general claim activity has persisted at levels higher than we had anticipated .", "this year , as we do every few years , we reviewed certain macro assumptions underlying our actuarial analysis .", "our updated view of ultimate asbestos - related losses resulted in an increase in the low end of the actuarial range .", "this year 's asbestos charge is greater than last year 's charge as a result of our updated view of the range for ultimate losses , not as a result of increases in paid losses or severity .", "there are some indications that the environment is improving in terms of the emergence of new asbestos claims going forward .", "of note , as you can see on the bottom two lines of the table , the decline in mesothelioma deaths was much more pronounced in all of the younger age groups .", "this trend is directionally consistent with our expectation that over time , the high risk group of people actually exposed to asbestos in the workplace prior to the late 1970s will get smaller and will not be replaced by younger people as those who entered the workforce sometime in the 1980s should not have been exposed to asbestos to nearly the same degree as their predecessors .", "excluding the impacts of the pg&e settlement and the annual asbestos review , there was virtually no net prior year reserve development in business insurance .", "favorable development in workers ' comp was offset by an increase to the reserves from legacy liabilities in our run-off book , related to a single insured arising out of policies issued more than 20 years ago .", "after - tax net investment income increased by 7 % from the prior year quarter to $ 566 million .", "the increase was driven by our non-fixed income returns where results for our private equity , hedge funds and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a one quarter lag .", "because of that reporting lag , the recovery experienced in the broader markets during the second quarter benefited our non-fixed income results in the third quarter .", "fixed income returns decreased by $ 31 million after tax as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates , consistent with our comments on last quarter 's call .", "also consistent with our prior commentary , we expect after - tax fixed income nii in the fourth quarter to be down $ 35 million to $ 40 million compared to a year ago .", "looking ahead to 2021 , our current expectation is for after - tax fixed income nii to be between $ 420 million and $ 430 million per quarter .", "operating cash flows for the quarter of $ 2.3 billion were again very strong , all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $ 2.3 billion , well above our target level .", "recall that in april we pre-funded the $ 500 million of debt coming due in november with a new 30 - year $ 500 million debt issuance .", "so our holding company liquidity at september 30 is temporarily elevated by that amount [ phonetic ] .", "investment yields decreased as credit spreads tightened during the third quarter , and accordingly , our net unrealized investment gain increased from $ 3.6 billion after tax as of june 30 to $ 3.8 billion after tax at september 30 .", "adjusted book value per share , which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $ 94.89 at quarter end , up 2 % from year - end of 2019 and up 5 % year - over - year .", "we returned $ 218 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter via dividends .", "we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter .", "looking ahead , there is no change in our approach to capital management .", "until there is more clarity on the state of the economy , we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or we may continue to choose to buy none .", "business insurance produced $ 365 million of segment income for the quarter , a significant increase over the prior year quarter with prior year development , underlying underwriting income and net investment income , all contributing to the year - over - year increase .", "the underlying combined ratio of 94 % improved by almost 2 points , driven by more than 1 point of earned rate in excess of loss trend .", "a modest favorable net impact from the pandemic contributed about 0.5 point to the improvement .", "as for the top - line , net written premiums were 1 % lower than the prior year quarter , with strong rate and high retentions mostly offsetting modestly lower insured exposures and lower levels of new business .", "as alan mentioned , we are very pleased with the resilience of our top- line in the face of the ongoing macroeconomic challenges .", "turning to the domestic production .", "we achieved record renewal rate change of 8.2 % , up 4 points from the third quarter of last year and almost 1 point from the second quarter of this year , while retention remained high at 83 % .", "we feel very good about the headline numbers , but as we 've shared before , the quality of the execution and segmentation underneath the headline numbers are just as important .", "to that point , while we achieved meaningful rate increases in all product lines , set workers ' comp , our underwriters are making deliberate and granular decisions with respect to rate and retention and account - by - account or class - by - class basis .", "new business of $ 505 million was 9 % lower than the prior year quarter .", "we attribute the decline to lower levels of economic activity , as well as careful risk selection by our underwriters .", "in our core middle market business , for example , while submissions are up , our quote ratio is lower as we are taking a disciplined approach , given our view of quality of new business in the market .", "as for the individual businesses , in select , renewal rate change increased to 2.9 % , marking the seventh consecutive quarter in which renewal rate change was higher than the corresponding prior - year quarter .", "retention of 80 % was down a couple of points from recent periods , largely driven by policy cancellations that were deferred to the second quarter due to our pandemic - related billing relief program .", "in middle market , renewal rate change increased to 8.3 % , while retention remained strong at 85 % .", "the 8.3 % was up by more than 4.5 points from the third quarter of 2019 , and we achieved positive rate of more than 80 % of our accounts this quarter , up from about two - thirds in the third quarter of last year .", "to sum up , we feel terrific about our results and execution in a challenging underwriting environment .", "we also feel very good about the investments we 're making for the future and the benefits we 're seeing from those investments .", "those investments include enhancing the experiences for our customers and distribution partners , digitizing the underwriting transaction , and creating efficiencies .", "for example , we 've recently launched multiple pilots to automatically incorporate data from our distribution partners ' agency management systems directly into our systems , substantially reducing the time and friction in the process , while also improving data quality .", "we 're as confident as ever , there are meaningful competitive advantages to position us well for long - term profitable growth .", "bond & specialty delivered solid returns and growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of covid - 19 .", "segment income was $ 115 million , a $ 24 million decrease from the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by a higher underlying combined ratio .", "the underlying combined ratio of 89 % increased 5.4 points , primarily driven by estimated losses from covid - 19 and related economic conditions .", "given the products that we write , we expect the results of the segment to be impacted in times of severe economic downturn .", "we experienced that during the financial crisis and we 're seeing elevated loss activity in the current environment .", "we contemplate economic volatility in our underwriting and in our pricing , and as alan said , in these circumstances , we feel good about the returns we generated in the quarter .", "we expect that the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at around this level over the near term .", "net written premiums grew 4 % for the quarter , reflecting strong growth , driven by improved pricing in our management liability business , partially offset by lower surety production due to the continued economic impact of covid - 19 on public project procurement and related bond demand .", "in our domestic management liability business , we are pleased that the renewal premium increased to 8.1 % , driven by record rate .", "this marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which rpc is higher than the corresponding prior - year quarter .", "retention remained at a historically high 90 % .", "these production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy to pursue rate where needed , while maintaining strong retention of our high quality portfolio .", "we will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted .", "domestic management liability new business for the quarter decreased $ 14 million , primarily reflecting our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment .", "similar to what you heard from greg in business insurance , submissions are up , while quote activity is down .", "so bond & specialty results remained resilient despite the challenges brought on by covid - 19 .", "we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and feel confident about our ability to navigate through this challenging environment and continue to deliver strong returns over time .", "in personal insurance , this quarter , we are very pleased with our continued execution in the marketplace as we delivered excellent profitability and grew net written premiums by 8 % , achieving record levels of domestic policies in force .", "personal insurance segment income for the third quarter was $ 392 million , up $ 261 million from the prior year quarter , driven by the pre-tax impacts of an improvement of $ 163 million in the underlying underwriting gain , and $ 343 million of higher net favorable prior year reserve development , partially offset by $ 174 million of higher catastrophe losses , net of reinsurance .", "our combined ratio for the quarter was 86.4 % , an improvement of 11.6 points from the prior year quarter , driven primarily by the increase in net favorable prior year reserve development .", "higher catastrophe loss experienced in the quarter was largely offset by improvement in the underlying combined ratio .", "the improved underlying combined ratio reflects the continuation of favorable auto loss experience in the quarter , partially offset by higher non-catastrophe weather - related losses .", "i 'll discuss both of these dynamics in a bit more detail next .", "agency automobile profitability was very strong with a combined ratio of approximately 80 % for the quarter .", "the underlying combined ratio of 81 % improved nearly 12 points , continuing to reflect favorable frequency levels .", "approximately 8 of the 12 points of improvement relate to current quarter favorability .", "the remainder results from favorable reestimates of activity in the first half of 2020 .", "we continue to observe lower claim frequency as a result of fewer miles driven in light of the covid -
