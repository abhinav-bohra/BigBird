fashioned focused managerial actions .", "and third , we look for acquisition opportunities where we see a clear combination of bolstering hospital relationships , adding to our patient care and support and a demonstrable growth path within that acquisition .", "acquisitions have n't been a major part of our activity so far this year , but they could play just as important role as organic growth when we do see them strategically .", "the sum of these efforts is continuing to ramp up post -covid .", "and importantly , after all of our reorganization activities , pre-covid .", "for the 2021 year - to - date , we estimate that we have added approximately three percentage points to our adjusted ebitda growth versus 2020 , over and above the pure same - store growth that our affiliated practices have experienced .", "in addition to all this activity , we recently announced our investment in brave care , and i want to explain why this is actually a very key piece of our growth plan .", "we again believe that we are totally uniquely positioned to grow in the combined pediatric and primary emergent care space .", "in our major markets , mednax , under our pediatrics brand alone has the concentration of pediatrician population density , hospital relationships and partnerships and an enormous and growing base of vital patient relationships and our market managerial support that 's already in place in our major markets .", "with our nightlight acquisition in place and in fact , thriving , we have a nucleus from which recent growth .", "but for this to grow , we needed the engine and the talent to enable building something really meaningful .", "brave care brings scalable internal controls and patient -

based side , maternal fetal medicine volume was up 8.6 % , while pediatric cardiology was down 9 % , with this decline likely reflecting some deferrals of appointments during the quarter due to the surge in delta cases .", "turning to g&a , our overall spend in q3 was down about $ 4 million sequentially .", "this primarily reflects sequential reductions in certain operating and legal expenses as well as rcm savings related to our agreement with r1 , which should increase further in q4 .", "in terms of the transition of our revenue cycle activities to r1 , to date , our metrics reflect that there has n't been any disruption in service to our practices .", "dsos and cash collection activity in the third quarter were in line with our expectations and with the prior quarter .", "i 'll also reiterate that under the terms of our agreement , we realized near -

over - year and sequential growth in adjusted ebitda .", "finally , our transformational and restructuring expense in q3 was $ 4.2 million , which predominantly reflects the cost of terminating other third - party agreements as part of the r1 transition .", "all told , within our updated internal expectation of 2021 adjusted ebitda , we expect our fourth quarter g&a expense to be flat to down compared to third quarter , based largely on our expectation of rcm cost savings .", "this reinforces our prior view that the second half g&a will be lower than the $ 137 million we incurred in the first half of the year .", "turning to our capital structure , we continue to improve our leverage position in the third quarter .", "we generated $ 67 million of operating cash flow , which exceeded the investments we made in capex , acquisitions and our brave care transaction .", "based on 9/30 debt of $ 642 million and our 2021 adjusted ebitda expectation , net leverage stands at about 2.5 times .", "and we would anticipate that to decline by year -
