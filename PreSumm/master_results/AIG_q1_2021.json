year development was $ 56 million favorable this quarter , which included $ 58 million of net favorable development in north america , driven by $ 52 million of favorable development from the adc amortization , and $ 2 million of net unfavorable development in international .", "it 's worthwhile to note that general insurance still has $ 6.6 billion remaining of the 80 % quota share adc cover .", "there was also , embedded within these figures , $ 33 million of unfavorable development related to covid - 19 claims that relate back to 2020 loss occurrences or a movement of less than 3 % , emanating primarily from validus re and talbot or lloyd 's syndicate .", "our general insurance business continued to materially improve , driven largely by strong accident year 2021 ex-cat showings in both north america and international commercial lines .", "so , rather than double up on facts that peter has shared , the main drivers of the attrition with underwriting gain improvements were for north america commercial , lexington , financial lines , and excess casualty .", "and from international commercial , the main drivers of improvement stemmed from property , talbot , and financial lines .", "as peter , noted on a global - commercial - lines basis , the accident year combined ratio , excluding cat was 90.4 % , which represents a 440 - basis - point improvement over the prior year 's quarter with 75 % of that improvement attributable to a lower loss ratio and 25 % of the improvement attributable to a lower expense ratio .", "turning to personal insurance , starting in the second quarter of this year , meaning next quarter , our year - over - year comparisons will begin to improve , given the timing of the initial covid - 19 impacts and the formation of syndicate 2019 in may of 2020 .", "although north american personal lines had a 74 % drop in net premiums written as peter highlighted , it 's also important to understand that the other units within the segment which represented nearly 50 % of the quarter 's net written premium is comprised mostly of warranty and personal a&h business had their net premium only fall marginally .", "our international personal lines business , which by size dominates our overall global personal insurance business , continues to perform well with 150 - basis - points improvement in the accident year ex-cat combined ratio , reflecting an improved loss ratio and expense discipline .", "now , to expand on some of peter 's marketplace commentary , various areas continued to accelerate the adequacy of achieved rate beyond that of prior quarters .", "for example , the level of excess casualty rate increases continues and in many units , exceeds prior results such as cat excess coverage out of bermuda , north america corporate , and national admitted excess , and the lexington .", "the increase achieved in the first quarter of 2020 and compounded in the first quarter of 2021 alone , ignoring prior to 2020 rate increases , exceeded 150 % for bermuda - based capacity business , which makes sense given recent years ' price deficiency on these capacity excess layers , and approximately 115 % for the other mentioned units .", "financial lines on the same compound basis has seen in excess of 80 % increases for the staples of d&o and epli .", "internationally , the 14 % first - quarter overall rate increase saw continued rate expansion in key markets , such as the u.k. at plus 23 % , global specialty at plus 15 % , europe and the middle east at 14 % , latin america at 13 % , and asia pacific also at 13 % when excluding the tempering influence of predominantly japan at 3 % .", "lastly cyber achieved our highest rate increase yet at 41 % for the quarter .", "these increases are clearly broad - based by region and line of business all around the world .", "i 'd now like to spend a few minutes on two observations .", "one , the impact of net rate change versus gross rate change .", "and two , some examples of new business rate adequacy relative to a renewal rate adequacy .", "so , first , our achieved north america commercial rate change for the quarter on a net basis is now estimated to be at least 150 basis points stronger than the corresponding growth rate change , largely due to our increased net positions across selected product lines .", "last year much of the achieved growth rate increase was being ceded to reinsurers , where now there is much less so .", "the shift to higher net positions resulted directly from our prior - stated strategy of improving the gross book such that we had increased competence to retain the appropriate amount of net , and because we could not take a higher net position previously because of the legacy imbalance of very large limits written .", "now , moving on to relative rate adequacy , we see continuing indications in north america of new business having stronger relative rate adequacy over renewal rate levels in most lines of business .", "this likely does n't reflect different class mixes , but instead an additional margin for a lesser - known exposure .", "however , this should be expected and is also historically supported given where we are in the underwriting cycle as new business is less established with an insurer versus an existing client renewal relationship .", "a further related item involves renewal retentions .", "as general insurance implemented revised underwriting standards , renewal retentions predictably would have been impacted , especially in the target lines .", "now , even with superior risk selection rate and term condition changes that have been achieved , renewal retentions have improved to the mid-80 % in the aggregate across all commercial lines in both north america and across internationally .", "we also see improvement in the lexington , where e&s has lower industry retentions based on the nature of the business , and this is very positive for the book .", "and we see it across specialty lines and across most admitted retail books .", "this is indicative of the reunderwriting actions being successful , having settled down , and now with general insurance being comfortable with the underlying insured exposures that meet our risk appetite .", "based on current market conditions and our view of the foreseeable future , we continue to anticipate earned margin expansion throughout 2021 and into 2022 resulting from aig 's favorable underwriting actions taken , favorable global market conditions , maturely improved terms and conditions , and a more profitable , less volatile business mix .", "as a result , i would like to reconfirm our outlook for a sub - 90 % accident year combined ratio excluding cat by the end of 2022 .", "global commercial lines are very nearly at the sub - 90 % level now and global personal lines is running at 96 % for the first quarter .", "given our portfolio composition , and market conditions , and our strategic repositioning of north america personal , we anticipate greater continued margin expansion within commercial lines than personal lines .", "we are highly confident that we will achieve our sub - 90 % target and have several pass to help us get there .", "some by a mix , some by a reasonable market conditions persisting , and some via expense levers .", "now , i 'd also like to unpack some of peter 's high - level net written premium growth comments for 2021 with an emphasis here on next quarter , second quarter .", "north america commercial is expecting to see growth of approximately 10 % for the second quarter of 2021 relative to the prior - year quarter , driven mostly from lexington across a host of product lines and admitted casualty both primary and excess .", "this growth will be two - pronged as growth on the front end will be coupled with lower reinsurance sessions , especially from those lines subject to the casualty quota share .", "north america personal is expected to see significant second - quarter 2021 growth , but it is driven by the syndicate 2019 reinsurance session change that we 've been signaling .", "you will recall , north american personal had a negative $ 150 million net written premium in the second quarter of 2020 due to many syndicate 2019 treaties becoming effective , including an unearned premium cover for the pcg high - net - worth book .", "that distortive spike in sessions , which is not repeatable in the second quarter of 2021 will give the appearance of considerable growth , but instead will provide a pcg net premium that is more stable on an ongoing basis .", "so , overall , for north america , both personal and commercial combined , we anticipate net written premium growth between 35 % to 40 % for the second quarter over the second quarter of the prior year .", "international commercial in the second quarter of 2021 is expected to be roughly plus 7 % net written premium growth , driven by global specialty , financial lines , and talbot , and international purpose -- personal is expected to be approximately flat relative to the prior - year quarter .", "now , turning to life and retirement , adjusted pre-tax income increased by 57 % or $ 340 million compared to the first quarter of 2020 with favorable equity markets driving higher private equity returns , lower deferred acquisition and cost amortization , a rebound in most areas of sales , and higher - fee income .", "the increase also reflects favorable short - term impacts from tighter credit spreads driving higher call and tender income and higher fair value option bond returns .", "this increase was partially offset by adverse mortality as u.s. covid - related population death of approximately 205,000 in the first quarter were higher than or earlier anticipated which was also reflected in our own experience .", "in terms of premiums and deposits , we continue to see encouraging improvement in retail sales .", "individual retirement premium and deposits grew 8 % from the prior - year quarter , which we consider a pre-covid quarter as the sales pipeline carried through march of last year with index and variable annuities , both exceeding prior - year levels .", "in group retirement , group acquisition deposits increased significantly from prior year , although both periodic and nonperiodic deposits declined , leading to a marginal reduction in overall gross group premiums and deposits of 2 % .", "in life insurance , premiums and deposits grew 6 % overall with year - over - year growth in both the u.s. and international .", "finally , while institutional markets did not conclude any significant pension risk transfer transactions in the quarter , the pipeline of direct and reinsurance transactions going into the second quarter is very strong , particularly with many defined benefit plans nearing fully funded status .", "turning to net flows and related activity .", "our portfolio reflects the dynamic environment quarter by quarter of the last year .", "individual retirement net flows improved by approximately $ 1 billion over the first quarter of 2020 driven by variable annuities and retail mutual fund .", "and yet when excluding retail mutual funds , net flows were positive , led by index annuities rebounding to be plus 1 billion for the quarter , which is virtually identical to one year ago , but with steady progress from a low of 439 million in the second quarter of 2020 to the plus 1 billion this quarter .", "surrender rates were up slightly over the last few quarters within individual retirement for fixed and index , whereas variable annuity surrender rates have been more comparable as have for group retirement .", "similarly , the life business has seen consistently lower lapse and surrender rates over the last four quarters than prior .", "life and retirement continue to actively manage the impacts from the low - interest rate and tighter credit spread environment , and the previously provided range for expected annual spread compression has not changed .", "new business margins generally remain within our targets at current new money returns due to active product management , disciplined pricing approaches , and our significant asset origination and structuring capabilities .", "adjusted pre-tax loss was 530 million , which was inclusive of 176 million of losses from the consolidation and eliminations line , which principally reflects adjustments , offsetting investment returns in the subsidiaries by being eliminated in other operations .", "so it would n't be double counting .", "before consolidation and eliminations , adjusted pre-tax loss was $ 354 million , which was $ 481 million better than the first quarter of 2020 , which included a $ 317 million adjusted pre-tax loss related to fortitude and a $ 30 million one - time cash grant given to employees to help with unanticipated costs when the global pandemic began last march .", "the first quarter also reflects lower corporate interest expense and lower corporate general expenses , and we expect this to continue throughout 2021 .", "however , one might expect some continued volatility within the consolidation and eliminations line , which can fluctuate based on investment returns .", "now , shifting to investments .", "net investment income on an apti basis was 3.2 billion or 492 million higher than the first quarter of 2020 .", "adjusting first - quarter 2020 for fortitude 's investment income to make the comparison apples to apples , this quarter 's net investment income on an apti basis was actually 611 million higher than the prior year , or plus 23 % , reflecting strong private equity and real estate returns , as well as bond tender and call premiums , which more than offset the lower income on the afs fixed income portfolio .", "we continue to have a high -
