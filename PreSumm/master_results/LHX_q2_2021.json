16 viper shield advanced electronic warfare system .", "operating income was up 7.7 % , and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.7 % as operational excellence , including program performance , increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher r&d investments .", "and funded book -

stage programs .", "from a segment perspective , we 're holding to our prior margin guidance ranges across the board , but we 're expecting ims and sas to be at the upper end of their ranges , given their strong performance to date and are holding as and cs steady at their midpoints given divestiture dilution at as and expected mix pressure at cs .", "on eps , we 're raising our full year guide to a range of $ 12.80 to $ 13 , with the midpoint now toward the upper end of our previous range and reflecting 11 % growth from 2020 , delivering on our double - digit commitment in spite of dilution from divestitures .", "as shown on slide 11 , the increase of $ 0.05 from the prior midpoint is driven by $ 0.13 improvement in operations and synergies and $ 0.19 from a lower share count at 203 million shares , along with a lower tax rate of about 16 % , all of which more than offset divested earnings of $ 0.31 .", "on a stand -
