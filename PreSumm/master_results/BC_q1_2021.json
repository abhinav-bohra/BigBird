over - year comparisons are not particularly helpful given the significant covid impact starting in march of last year , but our performance in the quarter stands on its own against any quarter from the last two decades .", "first quarter net sales were up 48 % , while operating earnings on an as adjusted basis increased by 116 % .", "adjusted operating margins were 17 % and adjusted earnings per share was $ 2.24 , each being the highest mark for any quarter for which we have available records .", "sales in each segment benefited from strong global demand for marine products , with earnings positively impacted by the increased sales , favorable factory absorption from increased production , and favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates , partially offset by higher variable compensation costs .", "finally , we had free cash flow usage of $ 23 million in the first quarter as we built inventory ahead of the prime retail selling season , which is very favorable versus free cash flow usages of $ 144 million in the first quarter of 2020 and $ 159 million in q1 of 2019 .", "revenue in the propulsion business increased 47 % as each product category experienced strong demand and market share gains .", "all customer channels showed growth in the quarter as boat manufacturers continued to ramp up production , and increased capacity enabled continued elevated sales to the independent oem , dealer and international channels .", "operating margins and operating earnings were up significantly in the quarter , benefiting from positive customer mix in addition to the factors positively affecting all our businesses .", "in our parts and accessories segment , revenues increased 52 % and adjusted operating earnings were up 83 % versus first quarter 2020 due to strong sales growth across all product categories .", "adjusted operating margins of 21.3 % were 350 basis points better than the prior year quarter , with strong sales increases , together with favorable sales mix , driving the robust increase in adjusted operating earnings .", "continuing the theme from 2020 , this aftermarket - driven , annuity - based business is benefiting from more boaters on the water , which is being augmented by flexible work schedules allowing for more leisure time , with the oem component of the business leveraging investments in technology to take advantage of strong demand from boat builders as they increase production .", "in our boat segment , sales were up 44 % , with 31 % adjusted operating leverage resulting in 10.9 % margins for the quarter .", "each brand had strong operational performances and contributed to the successful results , with lund and boston whaler leading the gains in the premium brands , and bayliner having another strong quarter as a mid-tier value brand .", "although it 's only one quarter above our stated goal of double - digit margins , this is the third consecutive quarter of margins above 9 % , and we believe that we can continue this trend throughout the year and beyond .", "operating earnings were also positively impacted by the increased sales and the lower retail discount levels versus 2020 .", "freedom boat club , which dave discussed earlier , contributed approximately two percent of the segment 's revenue , at a margin profile that continues to be accretive to the segment .", "our boat production continues to ramp consistent with our plans to produce in excess of 38,000 units during the year .", "despite producing approximately 9,400 units in the quarter , which is up 16 % from the 4th quarter of 2020 , we only added a few hundred units to dealer inventories given the continued robust retail market .", "our boat brands ended march with just under 19 weeks of boats on hand , measured on a trailing twelve - month basis , with units in the field lower by 41 % versus same time last year .", "we continue to believe that our current manufacturing footprint will support the production necessary to satisfy the anticipated 2021 retail demand , but we continue to work with our brands to unlock additional near - term capacity through automation , labor and select capital initiatives , including the capacity actions announced earlier in the year related to our palm coast , reynosa and portugal facilities , which will begin providing benefits by the end of the year .", "as a result of historically low product pipelines and continued very strong boating participation , including in many northern regions in recent weeks due to the early spring , production levels remain elevated across all our businesses to both satisfy retail demand and to rebuild product pipelines .", "these factors , together with our strong pipeline of new products and outstanding operational performance , continue to provide enhanced clarity on our ability to drive growth in upcoming periods , resulting in the following guidance for full - year 2021 .", "we anticipate u.s. marine industry retail unit demand to grow mid-to - high single - digit percent versus 2020 ; net sales between $ 5.4 billion and $ 5.6 billion , adjusted operating margin growth between 130 and 170 basis points , operating expenses as a percent of sales to remain lower than 2020 , free cash flow in excess of $ 425 million ; and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $ 7.30 to $ 7.60 .", "we 're also providing directional guidance regarding the second quarter , where we anticipate revenue growth of approximately 50 % over the second quarter of 2020 , with adjusted operating leverage in the low - 20s percent .", "as we look to the second half of the year , despite extremely challenging comparisons to 2020 , we still believe that we will deliver top - line and earnings growth over the second half of last year .", "i will conclude with an update on certain items that will impact our p&l and cash flow for the remainder of 2021 .", "the only significant update relates to the working capital usage for the year .", "projected increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable are exceeding anticipated increases in accounts receivable , resulting in a lower working capital build throughout the year .", "we now estimate a working capital increase of $ 80 million to $ 100 million for 2021 , which together with the higher anticipated earnings , results in a stronger free cash flow projection of $ 425 million .", "our capital strategy assumptions , however , have been augmented in places to take advantage of our stronger , early year cash position .", "we still plan to retire approximately $ 100 million of our long - term debt obligations , as we repaid $ 9 million in the first quarter and $ 60 million already in april .", "we repurchased $ 16 million of shares in the quarter , and plan to continue our systematic approach throughout the year .", "we anticipate spending $ 250 million to $ 270 million on capital expenditures in the year to support , and in some cases accelerate , growth initiatives throughout our organization .", "this slightly increased spending will be directed to new product investments in all of our businesses , cost reduction and automation projects , and select additional capacity initiatives to support demand and future growth , primarily in the propulsion business .", "we are also raising our dividend , for the ninth straight year , to $ 0.335 cents a share , or a 24 % increase , as our strong cash position enables us to raise our dividend earlier in the year than usual , and keep our payout ratio close to our target 20 % to 25 % range , and continue to provide strong returns to our shareholders .", "finally , we 've had a busy start to the year with m&a activity , primarily in expanding freedom boat club as dave discussed earlier .", "completed deals to date will have an immaterial impact on 2021 results , but we remain active in several areas including p&a , freedom and aces and intend to close additional deals throughout the year .", "as we discussed on our january call , we felt that 2021 was setting up to be an outstanding year for all of our businesses and the first quarter did not disappoint .", "the combination of robust consumer demand during the quarter and solid operational execution by our businesses has us squarely on track to deliver against our operating and strategic priorities .", "our top priority for the propulsion segment continues to be satisfying outboard engine demand from new and existing oem customers and expanding market share , especially in the dealer , saltwater , repower and international channels .", "we are continuing to invest heavily in new product introductions and industry - leading propulsion solutions that we project will enable top - line and earnings growth far into the future .", "our parts and accessories segment remains focused on optimizing its global operating model to leverage its distribution and position of product strength in the areas of advanced battery technology , digital systems , and connected products in support of our aces strategy .", "we will continue to focus our m&a activity in this area as we look for opportunities to further build out our technology and systems portfolio .", "the boat segment will build on its first quarter successes by continuing to focus on operational excellence , improving operating margins , launching new products , executing capacity expansion plans , and refilling pipelines in a very robust retail environment .", "lastly , we remain keenly focused on accelerating the company 's aces strategy , building on our connectivity and shared access initiatives , but also in the areas of autonomy , where we recently announced a new partnership with carnegie robotics , and in marine electrification , where we plan a portfolio of new products .", "we will also continue to advance our esg and dei strategies across the company .", "as we have done with past investor days , we have gathered our business leaders to provide you with an update to our 2022 strategy that was originally presented in february of 2020 in miami , as well as to discuss certain longer -
