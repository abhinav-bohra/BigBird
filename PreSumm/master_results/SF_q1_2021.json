on - year and represented the second highest quarterly earnings per share in our history .", "the investments that we 've made in our business have enabled us to participate to a far greater magnitude than we would have had we not invested in the business .", "our record results were driven by our past recruiting success to growth in our balance sheet and robust capital markets .", "other highlights for the quarter .", "pretax margins of more than 21 % , annualized return on tangible common equity of over 28 % and tangible book value , which increased 32 % .", "turning to the next slide .", "as i stated , our first quarter net revenue increased 24 % to a record surpassing $ 1.1 billion .", "compensation as a percentage of net revenue came in at 60.9 % , which was just above the high end of our annual range , yet is consistent with our policy of accruing for compensation conservatively early in the year .", "our operating expense ratio was about 18 % .", "but excluding credit provision and investment banking gross-ups , our operating expense ratio totaled approximately 16 % .", "this came in below our full year guidance due to the strength of our revenue and strong expense management .", "as the economic outlook improves , we , like other banks , have updated our economic models .", "this , coupled with strong credit performance in our loan portfolio , resulted in a relief of $ 5 million of our credit provisions during the quarter .", "as you recall , our provision expense last year was driven by the adoption of cecl , and more specifically , the negative economic outlook that was a key input into the calculation .", "so neutralizing the impact of credit provisions , stifel 's pre-tax pre-provision income totaled $ 238 million , which increased 61 % from the first quarter of 2020 .", "moving on to our segment results and starting with global wealth management .", "first quarter revenue totaled a record $ 631 million , up 8 % year - on - year .", "while this increase is impressive , i believe it understates the strength of our business as it includes a nearly $ 24 million decline in net interest income at our bank subsidiary .", "excluding the impact of lower bank nii , our private client business improved 13 % , driven by the strength in asset management as well as growth in brokerage revenue , as we benefited from enhanced client activity levels and continued success in recruiting .", "we again finished the quarter with record client asset levels .", "total assets under administration of nearly $ 380 billion increased $ 21 billion from the prior quarter .", "additionally , fee -

related activity within our industry during the first quarter .", "however , spacs accounted for a little more than 15 % of our equity underwriting revenue in the quarter .", "so whether the recent slowdown in spac activity represents a pause or a saturation point , we are confident about the strength of our more traditional pipeline .", "while our equity business was quite robust , we also recorded great results in fixed income .", "our fixed income underwriting revenue of $ 49 million was a record for the first quarter and was up 43 % year - on - year .", "our municipal finance business rebounded from challenging market conditions in the first quarter of 2020 as we lead manage 236 municipal issues , which represented an increase of 42 % .", "while we are off to a strong start for the year , we believe that if congress were to pass an infrastructure bill , we would see additional tailwinds to our public finance business .", "we also continue to see solid contributions from our growing corporate debt issuance business .", "regarding our advisory business , revenue of $ 130 million represented our third highest quarterly revenue and a record by almost 25 % for any first quarter .", "in terms of verticals , we benefited from the expected pickup in financials and continue to see broad - based results from technology , consumer and healthcare .", "looking forward to our second quarter , based upon anticipated closings of some larger previously announced transactions and of course , barring a substantial change in the market or the economy , we expect to see a solid increase in our advisory revenue .", "in terms of our overall pipelines , they are up double digits compared to where we began the year , and i remain very optimistic for our investment banking business in 2021 .", "let me begin by making a few comments regarding our gaap earnings .", "in the quarter , we generated the second highest gaap earnings per share in our history at $ 1.40 , which was only surpassed by the results generated last quarter .", "we again generated strong returns on equity with an roe of 18 % and rotce of nearly 27 % .", "similar to last quarter , the strong gaap earnings resulted in increases in our book value and tangible book value .", "this was accomplished while increasing assets by $ 1.5 billion , resuming our open market share buyback program and given the seasonal impact of stock compensation on equity in the first quarter .", "and now let 's turn to net interest income .", "for the quarter , net interest income totaled $ 113 million , which was up $ 8 million sequentially .", "our firmwide net interest margin increased to 200 basis points , and our bank 's net interest margin improved to 240 basis points .", "both nii and nim benefited from the remix of bank assets out of our securities portfolio and into our loan portfolio as well as growth in our average interest - earning asset levels by 6 % during the quarter .", "i would also note that we did see some more episodic loan fees earned during the quarter that contributed to nii .", "we expect this contribution to decline somewhat in the second quarter , but the loan and securities growth that occurred in the first quarter will more than offset this decline .", "as such , in terms of the second quarter , we expect net interest income to be in a range of $ 110 million to $ 120 million and with a similar nim to the first quarter .", "further , while we have produced a stabilized nim over the last few quarters , we continue to be very asset sensitive .", "as an update to what we discussed last quarter , assuming a 100 basis point increase in rates across the curve and a 30 % deposit beta , we would generate an additional $ 150 million to $ 175 million of pre-tax earnings .", "i would note that our deposit betas have been and will continue to be driven by the competitive environment .", "but for this analysis , we used a 30 % deposit beta .", "this represents an estimate from what actually happened to stifel over the entire last rate cycle , but i would highlight that beta was very much weighted to the latter portion of the cycle .", "moving on to the next slide .", "i 'll go into more detail on the bank 's loan and investment portfolios .", "we ended the period with total net loans of $ 12.2 billion , up approximately $ 1 billion from the prior quarter .", "we saw growth in both the consumer and commercial portfolios .", "our mortgage portfolio increased by $ 200 million sequentially , and as we continue to see demand for residential loans from our wealth management clients despite the increase in interest rates during the quarter .", "our securities -

adjusted return .", "moving to the investment portfolio , which continues to be dominated by aaa and aa clos .", "we 've not seen any material change in the underlying credit subordination provided by these securities and continue to be pleased with their performance .", "this can be seen in the fair value of the portfolio , which was at an average price of 99.9 % of amortized cost at quarter end .", "we increased our clo holdings by 7 % from last quarter in anticipation of some payoffs expected to occur in the second quarter .", "we had a $ 5 million reversal of our allowance through a negative provision expense as additional reserves tied to loan growth were more than offset by the improved economic scenario in our cecl calculation .", "as a result of the reserve release and the composition of our loan growth during the quarter , our ratio of allowance to total loans declined to 118 basis points , excluding ppp loans .", "it is important to look at the level of reserves between our consumer and commercial portfolios given their relative levels of inherent risk .", "at quarter end , the consumer allowance to total loans was 31 basis points , while the commercial portfolio was at 174 basis points .", "we also continue to see strong credit metrics with nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans remaining at seven basis points .", "further , we did take the opportunity to derisk from our commercial book by selling or reducing positions by $ 83 million on five c&i loans , which resulted in less than $ 1 million of charge -

party cash reit program increased by approximately 5 % during the quarter , which was used to fund the aforementioned bank growth .", "i would also highlight that s&p recently improved stifel financial 's outlook to positive based on our strong operating results and overall financial position .", "on the next slide , we go through expenses .", "in the first quarter , our pre-tax margin improved 730 basis points year - on - year to more than 21 % .", "the increase was the result of strong revenue growth , lower compensation accruals and our continued expense discipline .", "our comp - to - revenue ratio of 60.9 % was down 160 basis points from the prior year .", "that ratio came in above our full year range of 58.5 % to 60.5 % and is consistent with our strategy to be conservative in our compensation accruals early in the year given the transactional nature of a large portion of our business .", "that said , assuming market conditions stay strong , we anticipate that our conservative accruals early in the year could lead to added flexibility in the back half of the year .", "noncomp opex , excluding the credit loss provision and expenses related to investment banking transactions , totaled approximately $ 184 million and represented approximately 16 % of net revenue .", "this was also below our recent guidance , primarily due to stronger - than - expected revenue .", "the effective tax rate during the quarter came in at 24.1 % , which was driven by the impact of the excess tax benefit related to stock compensation .", "absent any other discrete items , we would expect to see the effective rate to be in the 25 % to 26 % range in the second and third quarters as we have limited rsu vesting that occurs before the fourth quarter .", "in terms of our share count , our average fully diluted share count was up 1 % primarily as a result of the increase in our share price .", "absent any assumption for additional share repurchases and assuming a stable stock price , we 'd expect the second quarter fully diluted average share count to total 118.7 million shares .", "as i said at the beginning of the call , this year is off to a very strong start .", "looking back at our guidance for 2021 , many of the expectations for economic and market conditions that we then highlighted have not only played out as we expected but in some cases , has happened much faster .", "our business is benefiting from past recruiting success , higher equity markets , increased levels of interest - bearing assets , robust trading activity for debt and equity , record equity issuance , solid credit metrics and a strong investment banking pipeline .", "as vaccinations increase and the economy continues its recovery , we continue to expect a very strong operating environment for the remainder of 2021 .", "additionally , looking forward to our second quarter , for many of the same factors already cited , our business is off to a good start .", "with respect to our full year revenue guidance of $ 3.8 billion to $ 4 billion , based on what i 'm seeing in our outlook , we are tracking above the high end of our full year guidance .", "and if favorable market conditions continue , we see a path to exceed our full year revenue guidance .", "with that said , i 'll make some comments about what we 're seeing so far in the second quarter and our expectations .", "global wealth management is off to a strong start .", "our asset management fees will benefit from the 7 % increase in fee -
