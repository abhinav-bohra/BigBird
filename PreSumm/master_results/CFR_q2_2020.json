interest income as a yield adjustment over the life of those ppp loans .", "excluding the favorable impact of deferring those origination fees related to ppp loans , total non-interest expenses would have been up $ 3.8 million , or 1.9 % , compared to the second quarter last year .", "in addition to the reduced expense run rate during the second quarter , due to the pandemic effect on the business environment , we continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending and looking for ways to operate more efficiently .", "as we look out for the full - year , adding back to $ 7.4 million in
