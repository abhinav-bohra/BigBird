year quarter .", "revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep devices and masks , which was , in turn , driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the covid - 19 - impacted reduced levels in the prior - year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors .", "the increased year - over - year demand for our sleep solutions during q4 was partially offset by a significant decline in covid - 19 - related demand for our ventilators and related accessories .", "in the june quarter , we estimate the incremental revenue from covid - 19 - related demand , primarily in india , was approximately $ 20 million , a decline of $ 105 million compared to the prior -
