tax proceeds and complete the transaction in 2022 following regulatory approvals .", "guided by our strategy and similar to our 2020 divestiture of our group insurance business , this transaction unlocks the value of a best - in - class leading asset , while also enabling us to even more sharply focus our business on health and well - being services .", "so overall , our performance for the quarter reflects our clear strategy and strong execution and delivering attractive results and importantly , our ongoing commitment to prioritize and support the evolving health and well - being needs of those we serve .", "now , i 'll walk through some additional detail for our evernorth in u.s. medical businesses .", "a year ago , we launched evernorth to the marketplace as our health service platform , focused on servicing health plans , employers , government organizations and healthcare providers .", "since that time , evernorth has established itself with unique partnerships and innovative services that are resonating with multiple buyer groups .", "our evernorth pharmacy and our medical offerings through our u.s. medical platform are the two primary gateways through which most of our clients and customers form their base relationship with us .", "wrapping around these two exceptionally strong platforms are our additional suites of innovative health services evernorth , including benefits management , care solutions and intelligent solutions .", "these help us to expand and deepen existing relationships .", "in the third quarter , evernorth retained and expanded our relationship with the department of defense tricare pharmacy program and we did seven -

based arrangements during virtual visits and the live physicians are leveraging our evernorth intelligence capabilities , enabling them to provide more connected and coordinated experience , and we continue to expand our capabilities with mdlive as we recently launched a virtual first health plan for employers .", "another great example of evernorth in u.s. commercial partnering to bring more value to our health plan clients is a new arrangement we have with university of pittsburgh medical center health plan .", "we will make in network care available to upmc customers who live , work or travel outside the network service area .", "upmc has been an evernorth pharmacy client for 16 years and this agreement illustrates how we are collaborating across our enterprise to deliver greater affordability and differentiated value for health plan clients .", "we are pleased how the market continues to recognize the value we 're delivering through our broad suite of solutions and as such , we continue to grow through both our u.s. commercial and evernorth platforms .", "within medicare advantage , consistent with our strategy , we continue to grow in our existing markets and are expanding into new geographies .", "our progress is further supported by our overall value of our offerings .", "for 2022 calendar year , 89 % of our medicare advantage customers will be in four star or greater plans nationally .", "this is the highest level we 've ever achieved and it marks the fifth year in a row we 've improved our stars performance .", "and in our individual and family plan business , we 've driven strong growth in this year , increasing customers by 47 % through the third quarter .", "a substantial portion of this growth did come from the extended special enrollment period .", "and as i previously noted , some of the mcr impact in the third quarter was driven by the medical costs among those we added during the outpaced sep growth .", "we do expect this will moderate in 2022 .", "we are positioning ourselves to build on this momentum in the individual family plan business by expanding our addressable markets , again as we enter in three new states and 93 new counties in 2022 .", "these new markets offer the potential to reach an additional 1.5 million customers .", "the continued strength of our results and the growth we are generating through the execution of our strategy gives us confidence we will deliver against our commitments in 2021 .", "we will deliver earnings per share in line with our long -

year adjusted earnings per share of at least $ 20.35 .", "for full year 2021 , we remain on track for generating at least $ 7.5 billion of cash flow from operations and we expect to return more than $ 7 billion to shareholders in 2021 through dividends and share repurchase .", "looking into 2022 , we expect to grow earnings per share by at least 10 % off of our increased 2021 guidance of at least $ 20.35 per share .", "we anticipate a number of tailwinds , including core growth in our business and additional contribution from margin expansion in our u.s. medical business as we drive pricing actions , execute affordability and efficiency initiatives and benefit from the return of medicare risk adjustment revenue to more normalized levels .", "we 're also expecting year - over - year headwind as we plan for net investment income to be more in line with historical levels .", "and of course , the rate and pace of ongoing strategic investments will vary from year to year .", "in short , 2022 will be another strong year for cigna .", "as we demonstrated through the quarter and throughout 2021 , we are delivering for our customers , patients , clients and provider partners as they experience the ongoing challenges of the pandemic .", "we are also taking significant value - enhancing actions such as divesting a portion of our international business , returning substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders and continuing to strategically invest in our capabilities and strategic partnerships , all of which position us to continue to advance our long - term growth agenda and continue to deliver shareholder value .", "today , i will review key aspects of cigna 's third quarter results , including the ongoing impact of covid - 19 on our business and i will discuss our updated outlook for the full year .", "during the quarter , total medical costs were higher than our expectations within our u.s. medical segment , driven largely by the impact of the delta variant in our u.s. commercial business and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our u.s. individual business .", "importantly , i would remind you that approximately 80 % of our revenues are from service - based businesses that are not significantly exposed to medical cost fluctuations .", "our balanced portfolio and multiple levers for value creation resulted in cigna 's overall revenue and earnings exceeding our third quarter expectations .", "this strong third quarter performance coupled with capital deployment activities led to an increased outlook for full year 2021 , which i will discuss shortly .", "now turning to enterprise results .", "key consolidated financial highlights in third quarter 2021 include adjusted revenue growth of 9 % to $ 44.3 billion , adjusted earnings growth of 20 % to $ 1.9 billion after tax , and adjusted earnings - per - share growth of 30 % to $ 5.73 .", "results in the third quarter reflect strong top and bottom line growth with contributions across all of our businesses with overall performance above our expectations .", "i 'll now discuss our segment level results and will then provide an update on the details of our outlook as well as our capital positioning .", "regarding our segments , i 'll first comment on evernorth .", "third quarter 2021 adjusted revenues grew 13 % to $ 33.6 billion .", "adjusted pharmacy script volume increased 8 % to 411 million scripts and adjusted pre-tax earnings grew 7 % to $ 1.5 billion compared to third quarter 2020 .", "evernorth 's strong results in the quarter were driven by organic growth , including strong volumes in retail and specialty pharmacy along with ongoing efforts to improve affordability for the benefit of our clients , customers and patients and deepening of existing relationships , partially offset by significant strategic investments to support ongoing growth , including our virtual care platform and technology capabilities .", "overall , evernorth continues to create differentiated value for clients and customers , while driving overall revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our original expectations through the first three quarters of 2021 .", "third quarter adjusted revenues were $ 10.5 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were approximately $ 1 billion .", "overall , our u.s. medical earnings exceeded our expectations during the third quarter , reflecting the impact of favorable net investment income and increased specialty contributions , partially offset by higher claim costs due to the net impact of covid - 19 and increased medical costs for special enrollment period customers in our individual business .", "the net effect of these claim cost impacts produced a medical care ratio of 84.4 % in the third quarter .", "looking ahead , we are actively managing overall medical costs and our mcr with the range of actions , including continuing to leverage our insights from our strong data and analytics capabilities to address key drivers and identify opportunities such as guiding customers to more effective and efficient sites of care , continued disciplined in our pricing and rate actions and we 're also continuing to promote preventative care and access to behavioral services to provide meaningful support to patients and moderate overall medical costs over the longer - term .", "turning to membership , w ended the quarter with 17 million total medical customers , an increase of approximately 368,000 customers year - to - date .", "in u.s. medical , the year - to - date customer growth was driven by net growth in select and new markets within u.s. commercial and continued organic growth in medicare advantage and individual within u.s. government .", "in our international markets business , third quarter adjusted revenues were $ 1.6 billion and adjusted pre-tax earnings were $ 250 million .", "these results were in line with our expectations .", "corporate and other operations delivered a third quarter adjusted loss of $ 275 million .", "overall , cigna 's broad portfolio of services continues to serve the needs of our customers and clients .", "cigna remains committed to delivering value for all of our stakeholders , leveraging our well - positioned businesses .", "now turning to our updated outlook for full year 2021 .", "we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for full - year 2021 to at least $ 20.35 per share , reflecting the strength of the quarter , the favorable impact of our year - to - date share repurchase and acknowledgment of the ongoing fluidity of the broader environment .", "this represents earnings per share growth of at least 10 % from 2020 , consistent with our long - term earnings per share growth range of 10 % to 13 % , even with the ongoing challenges associated with covid - 19 and while having significantly increased our dividend in 2021 .", "as we look forward , it is clear that covid - 19 will continue to have an impact in the fourth quarter and in 2022 .", "and as time progresses , covid - related impacts and the ongoing performance of the business are becoming more intertwined .", "therefore , we no longer believe it constructive to continue to quantify the impact of covid - 19 .", "these dynamics are fully contemplated in our 2021 expectation for adjusted earnings per share of at least $ 20.35 and our 2022 expectation for earnings per share growth of at least 10 % off this 2021 guidance .", "we now expect full - year 2021 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least one $ 172 billion , representing growth of at least 11 % from 2020 , when adjusting for the divestiture of our group disability and life business .", "i would note this revenue growth rate significantly exceeds our projected long -

to - date , as of november 3 , 2021 , we have repurchased 26.5 million shares for $ 6.3 billion and we now expect full - year 2021 weighted average shares of approximately 342 million shares .", "this includes the impact of the $ 2 billion accelerated share repurchase that we announced in the third quarter .", "on october 27th , we declared a $ 1 per share dividend payable on december 22nd to shareholders of record as of december 7th .", "our balance sheet and cash flow outlook remains , benefiting from our highly efficient service -
