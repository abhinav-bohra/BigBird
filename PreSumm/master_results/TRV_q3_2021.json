year quarter and the tenure average for the quarter .", "underlying underwriting income of $ 632 million pre-tax was 6 % higher than in the prior - year quarter , driven by record net earned premiums of $ 7.8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4 % .", "we 're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses .", "the underlying combined ratio improved by almost 4 points in business insurance and more than 5 points in bond & specialty insurance .", "as you 'll hear in a few minutes from michael , underlying results in personal insurance were impacted by auto frequency returning to pre-pandemic levels and elevated severity in both auto and property due to higher costs for labor , materials .", "our consolidated results demonstrate the value of having a diversified group of businesses .", "turning to investments , our high quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $ 645 million after -

assisted claim damage detection model was a key part of our ida claim response .", "this model uses ai and high - resolution aerial imagery to detect the extent of damage to individual properties as soon as a day after an event .", "within two days of impact , we were collecting and analyzing aerial imagery of customer properties along ida 's path as it moved across 20 states .", "this enabled us to remotely identify which of our customers properties had sustained exterior damage and effectively organize our claim response .", "in some cases , we can use this technology to adjust and pay total losses before the customer has even been able to return to their home .", "we also utilized other virtual capabilities in our ida response , such as image share and live video capture , on a majority of claims with interior damage .", "these leading edge capabilities , enhanced the claim experience for our customers by cutting significant time out of the claim process , expediting an accurate loss assessment and in many cases , eliminating the need for physical inspection .", "again , with ida , we successfully closed 90 % of all homeowners plans within 30 days .", "all of this also results in a more efficient outcome for our shareholders .", "as strategic as the data and analytics are , maybe even more important is the culture that brings it all together .", "our collaborative approach to developing a holistic , 360 -

year quarter .", "for the quarter , core return on equity was 10.1 % and on a year - to - date basis , core roe was 11.6 % .", "the decline in core income was driven by prior - year reserve development and catastrophe losses .", "recall that last year 's pyd benefited by approximately $ 400 million of subrogation recoveries from pg&e .", "those unfavorable year - over - year comparisons were partially offset by increased investment income and a higher level of underlying underwriting income .", "underlying underwriting income increased 6 % to $ 632 million pre-tax , reflecting a higher level of earned premium in all three segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4 % .", "improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both business insurance and bond & specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in personal insurance .", "business insurance and bond & specialty results both reflected the benefit of our pricing efforts , as earned price continues to exceed loss trend .", "we expected a higher underlying combined ratio in personal insurance given that last year 's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses related to the pandemic .", "as alan mentioned , the underlying combined ratio in pi was further impacted by higher severity in both the auto and homeowners products .", "greg , jeff and michael will provide more detail on each segment results in a few minutes .", "on a consolidated basis , the underlying loss ratio for the quarter improved slightly to 62 % compared with last year 's 62.2 % .", "the expense ratio of 29.4 % was in line with the prior -

year reserve development .", "in personal insurance , $ 30 million of pre-tax net favorable pyd resulted from better - than - expected experience from recent years in the property line .", "in bond & specialty insurance , $ 22 million of pre-tax net favorable pyd was driven by favorable loss experience in the surety product line for recent accident years .", "in business insurance , net unfavorable pyd was $ 108 million pre-tax .", "our annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $ 225 million as the level of claim activity did not decline as much as we had assumed in our previous estimate .", "excluding asbestos charge , business insurance had net favorable prior -

tax this quarter .", "our non-fixed income portfolio delivered another strong results contributing $ 224 million after - tax .", "consistent with our expectations , fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior -

time record .", "all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $ 2 billion .", "the market value of the bonds in our fixed income portfolio declined as u.s. treasury yields increased and credit spreads widened during the quarter , and accordingly our after -

year quarter , driven by the impact of higher net earned premium , a significantly improved underlying underwriting margin and favorable prior - year reserve development .", "the underlying combined ratio of 83.4 % improved by 5.5 points from the prior -

line results were impacted by weather , our return to pre-pandemic claim frequency in auto and higher loss severity impacting both auto and home results .", "segment income declined by $ 394 million than the prior - year quarter .", "$ 262 million of that decline is attributable to lower favorable prior - year reserve development as the prior - year quarter benefited from the pg&e settlement dan referenced .", "the remaining unfavorable variance was primarily driven by lower underlying underwriting results .", "our underlying combined ratio increased by 6.5 points to 95.2 % .", "we were pleased to see our top line momentum continue in the quarter , with net -

end .", "in homeowners and other , the third quarter combined ratio increased by 16 points from the prior - year quarter to 109.3 % , driven by a 24 point reduction in net favorable prior - year reserve development primarily related to the pg&e recovery from last year .", "the combined ratio included 17.6 points of catastrophe losses , mostly from hurricane ida .", "homeowner 's catastrophe losses were 4.7 points below a very active prior - year quarter .", "the underlying combined ratio was 93.3 % , an improvement of 3.5 points over the prior - year quarter , which experienced a very high level of loss activities .", "that said , the underlying combined ratio was above our expectations , reflecting elevated non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss activity , both of which included higher severity related to a combination of labor and materials price increases .", "again , we believe these trends are environmental and we continue to seek price increases in response .", "before i shift to discussing production , i 'll remind you that looking ahead to the fourth quarter , there tends to be a good amount of seasonality in our combined ratio results by line of business , with the fourth quarter auto losses typically higher and fourth quarter homeowners losses typically lower than their annual average levels .", "turning to production , we were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both auto and home .", "automobile policies in force grew 5 % to a record level , driven by strong retention at 85 % and continued growth in new business which increased by 8 % .", "renewal premium change was essentially flat reflecting the continued impact of the rate increases we filed in response to the pandemic .", "domestic homeowners and other delivered another excellent quarter with policies in force up 7 % also to a record level , driven by retention of 85 % and new business growth of 5 % .", "renewal premium change increased to 8.8 % .", "in the quarter , we continued to deliver solutions that meet customers where they are , give them what they need and serve them how they want .", "a couple of highlights from the quarter include : our new digital self -
