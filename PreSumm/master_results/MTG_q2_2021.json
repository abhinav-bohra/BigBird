2007 cycle .", "so while we do not expect broad declines in home prices we do expect that the rate of increase will slow .", "these conditions along with increasing annual persistency should allow our insurance in force to continue to grow , although perhaps at a slower annual rate than we have been enjoying in recent quarters .", "taking a look at our insurance and force portfolio our loss ratio was a low 11.6 % in the quarter .", "this result primarily reflects the improving economic conditions , the quality of our existing book of business and the low number of new delinquency notices received .", "i continue to be encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing in credit performance , which continued through july .", "at quarter end , we maintained a $ 2.3 billion excess over pmiers minimum required assets and our pmiers efficiency ratio was 167 % at the end of the second quarter .", "reflecting our capital position and long -

19 and the associated increase in net losses incurred .", "during the quarter , total revenues were $ 298 million compared to $ 294 million last year , with the increase primarily due to higher net premiums earned .", "the main driver of the increase in net premiums earned , the higher profit commission earned through our quota share reinsurance transactions in the current quarter compared to the second quarter of last year , mainly due to the lower level of losses ceded in the current period compared to last year .", "the net premium yield for the second quarter was 39.1 basis points , which was down 1.8 basis points compared to last quarter .", "the decrease was primarily a result in the decline in in - force premium yield with the runoff through attrition of the older policies , which generally have higher premium rates .", "as refinance activity decreased , we also realized less benefit from accelerated premiums earned from single premium policy cancellations .", "during the quarter , they totaled $ 20 million compared to $ 28 million last quarter and $ 33 million in the second quarter of 2020 .", "net losses incurred were $ 29 million in the second quarter compared to $ 217 million in the same period last year and $ 40 million last quarter .", "in the second quarter , we received approximately 9,000 new delinquency notices , which represents less than 1 % of the number of loans insured as of the start of the quarter and is 30 % less than the number of notices received last quarter .", "we are encouraged by the credit trends we are experiencing , including the low level of early payment defaults and believe they are good indicators of near -

term value of both the writing company and the holding company .", "as tim mentioned , this value can be created by writing more primary mortgage insurance , pursuing new business opportunities , retiring debt , paying dividends or repurchasing stock .", "our goal is to maintain financial flexibility at both the holding company and the writing company .", "at the holding company , this means maintaining a target level of liquidity well in excess of our near -

term maturing debt principal , strategic growth opportunities and our quarterly common stock dividend .", "the holding company liquidity is above our current target levels , which supported the 33 % increase in the common stock dividend .", "additionally , in the third quarter we intend to resume our share repurchase program and we expect that we will fully use the remaining $ 291 million repurchase authorization prior to its expiration at year - end 2021 .", "taking a closer look at the writing company .", "it is a $ 2.3 billion excess to the pmiers requirement as of june 30 , or 167 % pmiers sufficiency ratio , which was above our current target level and supported the $ 150 million dividend from mgic to our holding company .", "going forward , we will continue to assess mgic 's capital position and we 'll continue discussions with the oci about additional dividends to our holding company , as appropriate .", "as tim mentioned we feel we are well positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities that a robust housing market should make available to us .", "given our strong market presence , a growing in - force book of business that is currently generating a low level of delinquencies , a comprehensive reinsurance program and the quality of the new business being written , we believe that our holding company and writing company capital management strategy will create long - term value for shareholders , while allowing us to continue to be a well - capitalized counterparty for our customers .", "before moving to questions , let me address a few additional topics .", "the early indications from the biden administration that it is going to focus its housing policy efforts on access to sustainable and affordable housing for closure and eviction mitigation for homeowners impacted by covid -
