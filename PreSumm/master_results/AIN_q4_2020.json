19 pandemic , we incurred a significantly lower level of travel expense in the segment than in prior years .", "while this helped the bottom line to the tune of about $ 6 million , this was not ideal from a business perspective , as we depend on strong customer relationships to develop insight into customer needs and to drive product development and support .", "we are expecting to resume our prior level of travel during 2021 , although in q1 , travel will likely continue to suffer from some covid effects .", "third , we continue to see pressure on input costs , particularly right now with respect to logistics where sea , rail and air freight costs are all considerably higher than they were 12 months ago .", "in the typical year , we see over $ 4 million of input cost pressure , and there is reason to believe that in 2021 , this could be higher .", "while as is typical , we believe that we will be unlikely to be able to recover all of that increased cost through pricing increases .", "we will , of course , work to implement cost improvement initiatives to offset as much of the remainder as possible .", "notwithstanding these three pressures on profitability , we expect the machine clothing segment to deliver another strong year of profit performance and are providing initial adjusted ebitda guidance for the segment of $ 195 million to $ 205 million .", "turning to engineered composites , 2020 was a challenging year for the segment from a revenue perspective .", "overall , revenue in the segment declined by about $ 125 million in 2020 compared to 2019 , driven principally by lower sales on leap , 787 and other commercial programs , offset by growth in military programs .", "unfortunately , in 2021 , we are going to see a continuation of some of the same trends with 2021 shaping up to be a year of finished goods inventory destocking across our customers ' supply chains .", "on the asc leap program , we expect to continue to produce components for the leap - 1b variant , which powers the 737 max , at very low levels .", "while the 737 max is now reentering service , there is considerable finished goods inventory in the channel at boeing , at safran and in our own facilities on which we have already recognized revenue as we recognize revenue at the time of production , not delivery .", "in 2021 , we currently expect to make components for fewer than 150 leap - 1b engines , far below the 1,000 - plus engine shipsets we would expect to deliver annually in the long term .", "on leap - 1a , there is a much lower level of finished goods inventory in the channel , and we expect to produce components for well over 500 engine shipsets in 2021 .", "overall , while the total number of asc leap engine shipsets produced in 2021 is expected to be somewhat higher than that produced in 2020 , this is offset by the absence of certain recoverable nonrecurring expenses that were recognized as revenue in 2020 , resulting in roughly flat revenues for asc from 2020 to 2021 .", "our next largest commercial program to produce frames for the boeing 787 also has finished goods inventory destocking challenges .", "in 2020 , we had already seen some effect from boeing 's decision to reduce the 787 build rate , and our revenues from the program in 2020 were down over 20 % from 2019 .", "however , as boeing reduced the 787 build rate further , there has been an increased buildup of our finished goods in boeing supply chain , resulting in drastic reductions in order quantities for delivery in 2021 .", "in addition , we expect our start - up of production of the 787 aft fuselage frames will now shift from late 2021 into mid- 2022 as it will take longer to consume the parts already in the supply chain that were produced by the previous supplier .", "overall , in 2021 , we expect our revenues on the 787 frames program to be $ 30 million to $ 35 million lower than we recognized in 2020 .", "on the military side , we support the lockheed martin f - 35 through several contracts for different parts , including wing skins , edge seals and engine components at both our salt lake city and boerne locations .", "f - 35 has been and remains a very important platform for us .", "in 2020 , we recognized over $ 85 million of revenue on the platform overall , up more than 25 % from what was recognized in 2019 .", "however , during 2020 , lockheed martin produced finished f - 35s at a rate lower than they had originally predicted due to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic and consumed fewer sustainment parts .", "as a result , during 2020 , there was a buildup of our finished goods in the f - 35 supply chain ; a situation that we expect will reverse itself in 2021 .", "this year , to rebalance the supply chain , we expect that our build rate will be lower than the rate at which lockheed martin is completing aircraft .", "we now expect our f - 35 revenues in 2021 to be more than $ 15 million lower than we recognized in 2020 .", "we see similar patterns in several smaller commercial programs across the segment where the revenue on those programs in 2021 will be close to $ 15 million lower than recognized in 2020 .", "all of these reductions will be offset by growth on other programs , most notably on the ch - 53k .", "overall for the engineered composites segment , we are providing initial guidance for net sales of $ 275 million to $ 295 million .", "turning to the engineered composites segment profitability , 2020 was a strong year with adjusted ebitda margins of over 26 % , largely enabled by three factors : one , strong operating performance in the period as evidenced by about $ 10 million in net favorable adjustment to long - term contract profitability ; two , a sales mix benefit as the majority of the revenue declined from 2019 to 2020 was on the asc leap program , which is a lower than average profit margin ; and 3 , despite the decline in revenue , there was limited loss of fixed cost absorption as the cost - plus nature of the asc leap program allowed us to still recover all of the fixed costs of operating our three asc facilities .", "unfortunately , those factors will not help us again in 2021 .", "first , the lower revenue in 2021 at our non-asc facilities , most notably our salt lake city operation where all of our 787 work and the bulk of our f - 35 work is performed , will create upward pressure on plant overhead rates .", "while , as bill mentioned , we have announced a workforce reduction of our salt lake city facility , that alone will not offset these rate pressures .", "in such an environment , it will be difficult for us to achieve the lower unit production costs required to deliver significant improvements to long - term contract profitability .", "this is a change from the past few years when a growing revenue base at our non-asc facilities created a tailwind to long - term contract profitability .", "second , in 2021 , we will see a product mix hit as a roughly $ 40 million to $ 50 million revenue decline we expect this year is on fixed price programs , which have a higher than average profit margin .", "and third , unlike 2020 , we will suffer from a loss of fixed cost absorption due to the fixed price nature of the programs with declining revenues .", "as a result , the decremental margins will be much larger than the average margins on those programs .", "in fact , it is not atypical for our fixed price programs to have ebitda contribution margins in the 30 % to 40 % range .", "as a result of the impact of those three factors in 2021 , not only do we expect the top line reduction i discussed earlier , but we also expect the ebitda margins for the segment to fall from the 26.1 % level delivered in 2020 into the low 20s .", "therefore , we are providing initial 2021 guidance for engineered composites adjusted ebitda of $ 55 million to $ 65 million .", "at the total company level , we are providing initial 2021 guidance as follows : revenue of between $ 850 million and $ 890 million ; effective income tax rate of 28 % to 30 % ; depreciation and amortization of between $ 70 million and $ 75 million ; capital expenditures in the range of $ 50 million to $ 60 million ; gaap and adjusted earnings per share of between $ 2.40 and $ 2.80 ; and adjusted ebitda of between $ 195 million and $ 220 million .", "while we are not providing explicit cash flow guidance for 2021 , we do expect that the free cash flow we generate in 2021 will be well above the roughly $ 100 million generated in 2020 .", "i would also like to note that in 2021 , we expect r&d expenses to be more than 25 % higher than they were in 2020 , reflecting the ongoing investments in both segments that bill referenced earlier .", "returning to the present , we are very pleased with how the company performed in 2020 overall .", "despite the challenging operating environments , both segments met our customers ' needs and delivered outstanding performance , all while maintaining a safe working environment .", "while it does appear that we have one more year of channel destocking ahead of us before we return to growth in the engineered composites segment , we remain very excited about the future prospects for both segments ."], "summary_gold": "q4 earnings per share $ 0.85 .<q>q4 sales fell 12 percent to $ 226.9 million .<q>q4 adjusted earnings per share $ 0.89 .<q>sees fy 2021 revenue $ 850 million to $ 890 million .<q>sees 2021 gaap and adjusted earnings per share of between $ 2.40 and $ 2.80 .<q>sees 2021 capital expenditures in range of $ 50 million to $ 60 million .", "summary_pred": "let me provide highlights on our 2020 performance , share my expectations for 2021 and comment on our strategy going forward .<q>and then stephen will cover our fourth quarter results and guidance for 2021 in more depth .<q>we delivered another solid quarter in a pandemic year that was challenging and unpredictable .<q>our operations demonstrated agility and a relentless focus to deliver great bottom line results , despite pressure on the top line and downturns in some of the end markets that we serve .<q>and this was our story throughout the year .<q>beginning in early 2020 , we took swift action to ensure the safety and well -
