19 , which really started impacting us in february .", "but in the second half of march , we began experiencing impacts everywhere around the world .", "and toward the end of march , many of our customers had significantly reduced production or shut down altogether , especially in the automotive sector .", "overall , we estimate that covid -

19 impact .", "our first quarter pro forma adjusted ebitda grew 10 % versus last year due to our integration savings , the impact of the norman hay acquisition last quarter , and the additional cost control measures we put in place to combat the global effect of covid - 19 on our volumes .", "this event has been similar in many ways to what we went through in late 2008 .", "just like then , we took fast action to save cost in numerous ways .", "essentially , all discretionary expenses have been eliminated .", "we stopped new hires , executive pay cuts were implemented , some positions were furloughed , and our planned capital expenditures have been cut by over 30 % .", "and very importantly , we reviewed our integration 's synergy plans in light of this situation and took additional actions as well as accelerated other synergies where possible .", "we have now increased our guidance on synergy achievement .", "for 2020 , our new estimate is $ 53 million of cost synergies achieved versus our previous estimate of $ 35 million .", "and the total synergies that we estimate will be achieved by 2022 have been raised from $ 60 million to $ 75 million .", "one question we have been asked about is if this pandemic has impacted our integration .", "and the answer is that it really has n't negatively impacted our integration in any way , especially in the timing .", "i give our people a tremendous amount of credit for being able to do plant shutdowns , product manufacturing site transfers , and erp implementations during these challenging work conditions that we 're currently operating under .", "for instance , we successfully implemented our [ indecipherable ] at two sites recently and has done such all remotely due to the current working conditions .", "our two years of planning are paying off and we 're fortunate that we had this integration execution ongoing during this period of time to help us offset the volume impacts that we 're experiencing .", "even with these additional cost synergies , we have not done anything that will impact our business execution or strategic initiatives , including our ability to service our customers well , continue to grow above the market into the future , and further develop and execute on our strategic platform .", "looking forward to the rest of the year , we expect the second quarter to be the most challenging quarter .", "many of our customers has significantly reduced production or shut down .", "for example , our april revenues were down in the order of 30 % .", "we do anticipate that in the second half of the year , we will begin to see a gradual sequential improvement in business through the rest of the year .", "however , we do not expect our business to return to the levels expected pre-covid - 19 by the end of the year .", "given how clouded the economic environment is to the covid - 19 , we will not be providing specific guidance at this time .", "however , in order to try to give some direction for the remainder of the year , i can say that we 're currently see that the second quarter 's adjusted ebitda could be down by nearly half of the first quarter 's adjusted ebitda .", "for the full year , we expect our adjusted ebitda to be more than $ 200 million .", "and we do not expect to have any liquidity or bank covenant issues .", "overall , our higher expected synergies , additional cost saving actions , the improvement in our gross margins , and the expected release in cash via working capital reductions are expected to continue to help us during this period of time when our volumes are down .", "and if we look forward to 2021 and 2022 , i continue to be optimistic in our future , and i do expect us to achieve significant increases in our adjusted ebitda , as we complete our integration cost synergies , continue to take share in the marketplace , and benefit from a projected gradual rebound in demand in our end markets over this period of time .", "i am so proud of how our team has performed in servicing our customers , meeting their needs , and successfully continuing on with our execution of our integration , which is so critical for us this year .", "people are everything in our business and by far our most valuable asset , and ensuring their safety and well -

q to address covid - 19 - related issues and these risk factors should be reviewed along with those in our 2019 form 10 - k .", "reconciliations are provided in the appendix of this investor deck .", "we followed a similar review format for this deck as the one we used for our last couple of calls post combination , where our comparison periods show actual and non-gaap results as well as pro forma sales and pro forma adjusted ebitda as if we 've been combined with houghton throughout the periods presented .", "so please see slides 6 and 7 and also the chart on slide 8 , while i review some highlights .", "when we had our q4 earnings call in early march , we noted that we continued to face strong headwinds from global automotive and general industrial weakness that surfaced the latter half of 2019 , as well as a stronger u.s. dollar .", "covid - 19 at that point was generally considered a china issue .", "as march unfolded , covid - 19 became a global pandemic as mike noted , significantly exacerbating the auto and industrial weakness already seen .", "so , while our actual sales are up significantly to $ 378.6 million in q1 , this is due to the inclusion of houghton and norman hay .", "on a pro forma basis , as if houghton was also in q1 of 2019 , net sales were down 3 % , which reflects negative impacts from lower volumes and foreign exchange , partially offset by additional sales from norman hay .", "despite the challenges we faced in q1 , the company generated good cash flow and adjusted ebitda , which was up 10 % on a pro forma basis and non-gaap earnings per share of $ 1.38 was well above consensus of $ 1 .", "gross margin of 35.4 % for q1 was down from 35.9 % q1 of last year , which is in line with our expectations and communication .", "we previously noted that somewhat lower gross margins in the legacy houghton business due in part to the accounting treatment for fluidcare , the chemical management business .", "if houghton was included in the prior year , we estimate that our prior year gross margin would have been approximately 1 % lower .", "this indicates improvement in the current quarter 's gross margin , which largely reflects the procurement savings related to the combination that mike mentioned .", "in the table on slide 8 , you can see a reported operating loss of $ 12.4 million in the gaap section but in non-gaap operating income of $ 36 million in the middle section .", "the main non-gaap adjustments are combination and restructuring charges totaling about $ 10 million and a $ 38 million non-cash impairment charge in q1 to reflect the writedown of our houghton trademark indefinite - lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value .", "these were recorded at fair value at close of the combination on august 1 , 2019 and tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2019 .", "however , given the recent changes in business conditions as a result of covid - 19 , we determined that these assets needed to be tested again and confirm their carrying value exceeded their current estimated fair value by approximately $ 38 million .", "as we noted in our 10 - q , as business conditions evolve , we will continue to reevaluate all our long - lived assets as necessary .", "in non-operating items , we reported a non-cash charge of $ 22.7 million for final settlement and termination of legacy quaker 's u.s. defined benefit pension plan , a process we previously disclosed .", "the offset is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income / loss account in the equity section of the balance sheet .", "concurrent with this termination , the company paid approximately $ 1.8 million , subject to final adjustment .", "our reported effective tax rate was a benefit of 31.1 % in q1 2020 versus an expense of 26.8 % in q1 of last year .", "adjusting for all one - time charges and benefits , we estimate our etr would have been 22 % this q1 and 24 % in q1 last year .", "we currently expect our full - year etr , excluding all one - time charges and benefits , to be between 22 % and 24 % .", "our non-gaap earnings per share of $ 1.38 is down from $ 1.41 in q1 last year , due primarily to the additional shares issued in the combination , partially offset by the inclusion of houghton and norman hay .", "sequentially , non-gaap earnings per share is up from $ 1.34 in q4 of 2019 , which included houghton and norman hay and the additional shares .", "on slide 9 , we show the trend in pro forma trailing 12 months adjusted ebitda , which reached $ 239 million as of q1 , up from $ 234 million at the end of 2019 .", "this increase reflects the strong adjusted ebitda performance in q1 of $ 60 million , up 10 % from pro forma q1 last year of $ 55 million due to the inclusion of norman hay and the benefits of cost savings realized in the quarter from the combination .", "on slide 10 , we provide an update on our leverage and liquidity .", "please note that we drew down most of the available liquidity on our revolving credit facility in march in an abundance of caution as covid - 19 went global and created significant uncertainty and volatility in all global markets .", "this drop was leverage neutral as the additional cash in our balance sheet is a direct offset to our debt .", "in fact , our reported net debt to adjusted ebitda declined to 3.40 times from our year - end level of 3.47 times as a result of good cash flow and the cost savings mentioned earlier .", "our bank covenant ratio also improved from about 2.94 at year - end to 2.76 at the end of this quarter per the definitions in our borrowing agreement .", "we expect to continue to be in compliance with our bank covenants and we have strong liquidity to support these uncertain times .", "our capital allocation decisions reflect these priorities , including an approximately 30 % reduction in previously planned capex .", "as you know , we have a very asset - light business model and we also expect a release of working capital at sales decline to generate good cash flow similar to the global crisis in 2008 / 2009 .", "our cost of debt continues to benefit from declining interest rates and was estimated at approximately 2.4 % at march 31 versus about 3 % at year - end .", "as mike mentioned , we 're encouraged by the additional cost synergies realized to date and expected to be achieved overall .", "the increase in expected realized synergies this year from $ 35 million to $ 53 million in addition to the cost reduction actions we have taken to address the global crisis and our history of generating good cash flow in downturn all give us confidence in our ability to weather this storm ."], "summary_gold": "q1 non -gaap earnings per share $ 1.38 .<q>q1 sales $ 378.6 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $ 362.8 million .<q>quaker chemical -
