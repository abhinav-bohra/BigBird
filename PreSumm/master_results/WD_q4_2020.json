digit growth in both earnings per share and adjusted ebitda in 2021 .", "though we did not grow adjusted ebitda at this rate in 2020 , the increase in our servicing portfolio and average servicing fee during 2020 and our expectations for stronger debt brokerage and property sales volumes in 2021 should positively impact ebitda .", "and while we believe the fed is likely to keep short - term interest rates low for the foreseeable future , if there is any increase in short - term rates , our adjusted ebitda will benefit from the increased interest we would earn from our escrow deposits .", "we 're raising our operating margin target range to 29 % to 32 % for 2021 and our return on equity range to 19 % to 22 % for the year .", "during 2020 , we saw operating margin and roe expansion in our business as we realized economies of scale and continue to closely manage our people and expenses , even while some parts of our business were not operating at full efficiency .", "as a result , we raised the range for both metrics due to our expectations for continued growth in transaction volumes and particularly a return to normalcy in both debt brokerage and investment sales in 2021 .", "with respect to the first quarter of 2021 , remember that last year included $ 2.1 billion of the southern management transaction .", "absent that , our pipeline compares favorably to q1 of 2020 and the expected size of the market this year has us poised for another year of growth and financial success in 2021 .", "i 'm extremely pleased with our financial performance this year and our team 's ability to come together during a difficult year to generate incredible results .", "we are moving into 2021 with a renewed sense of energy and purpose as we drive toward our five -
