digit growth .", "we have experienced challenges -- experienced challenges in our flavors segment in latin america and greater asia due to the ongoing pandemic , while our eame performance was challenged by weakness in savory solutions , specifically driven by the food services market .", "so returning to profitable growth in our taste division will remain a top priority in 2021 .", "and we fully expect to deliver improved results and enhanced profitability as we emerge from the pandemic .", "now turning to slide 13 .", "i 'd like to spend some time on our cash flow .", "iff has always been a strong generator of cash , but given our 2020 starting leverage and the fact that n&b was coming along in early 2021 bringing additional debt , it was even more critical that we focus our people on the importance of cash generation across the company .", "so capex and working capital targets were both included in our annual incentives , we launched specific initiatives and we tracked progress throughout the year .", "as you will see , operating cash flow for the full year was up from $ 699 million in 2019 to $ 714 million this year , an increase of 2 % .", "net income was lower as a function of operating profit but also higher year - over - year transaction and integration - related costs .", "however , this headwind was more than offset by lower incentive compensation payments in 2020 as a result of our 2019 performance as well as by the timing of payments on some integration - related costs .", "core working capital was a modest use of cash , driven primarily by timing related to accounts receivable , where q4 2019 was favorably impacted by the 53rd week .", "collections in that extra week ending in january helped 2019's cash flow , and this was always going to be very hard to fully offset this q4 .", "overall , we 're satisfied with the 2020 trajectory of our 5 - quarter average cash conversion cycle , which improved six days year - over - year .", "and this was despite holding additional inventory to avoid any customer disruption due to covid - 19 - related supply chain issues .", "we also reduced our capex to 3.8 % of sales versus 4.6 % of sales in the prior year period as we prioritized spending more than ever to manage and preserve cash through the pandemic .", "and travel and on - site work restrictions also helped lower 2020 capex .", "all this led to a significant 13 % increase in free cash flow compared to 2020's $ 522 million .", "and we will be equally focused in 2021 in cash generation and on reducing our overall level of net debt .", "i would like to address the key assumptions behind our full year 2021 expectations .", "while we were certainly encouraged by our business trends in the fourth quarter and in january 2021 , we expect covid -
