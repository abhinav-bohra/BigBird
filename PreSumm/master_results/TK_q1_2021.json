digit increase to the partnership 's common unit distribution .", "this distribution level , which is supported by a large and diversified portfolio of long - term contracts , enables teekay lng to continue delevering its balance sheet , which provides financial flexibility to optimally allocate capital as the global demand for lng continues to grow while adding $ 6 million per year to tk parent 's free cash flow for a total of $ 43 million per year in cash distributions from tgp .", "lastly , teekay tankers recorded an adjusted net loss of $ 22 million or , $ 0.65 per share , which is an improvement of $ 19 million , or $ 0.56 per share compared to last quarter .", "although the near - term outlook is uncertain due to the continued impact of covid - 19 , we are seeing positive indicators that point toward an anticipated tanker market recovery , including improvements in the global economy , a continued decline in global oil inventories , an upcoming increase in opec + production and positive tanker fleet supply fundamentals .", "teekay tankers is also maintaining its strong balance sheet with healthy liquidity and low leverage , which enables teekay tankers to continue reducing its overall cost of capital by unwinding expensive sale leasebacks and replacing them with lower -
