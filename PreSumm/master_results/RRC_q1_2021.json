on - year gains as storage balances of these ngls are much tighter relative to last year .", "this past winter , propane posted its largest seasonal withdrawal and well over a decade , leaving the end of march propane stocks at a 33 % deficit to last year and a 17 % deficit to the five - year average .", "given the strong international demand that we are seeing with new chemical capacity coming online and recovering global economies , we believe it will be challenging for propane to replenish us stocks to a comfortable level by fall .", "as a result , we expect propane prices to transact at levels at or above 60 % of wti crude this fall and the upcoming winter .", "on the commercial side , beginning april 1st , range entered into a set of new and diverse lpg export -
