reduction efforts in north america or ordering slightly less product against future demand based on the brand and margin benefits that we realized in 2020 , we are confident that this focus will help elevate our premium positioning with consumers and , therefore , driving better profitability .", "carrying forward into 2021 , there are four areas of focus that we laid out on our last call .", "first is continuing to strengthen the brand through increased engagement and consideration with the focused performer .", "second is continuous improvement within our operating model to drive even greater efficiency across all end -

digit operating margin over the long term .", "in this spirit , we 've been asked many times if we 've reached an optimal cost structure for under armour or where our general breakeven ratio lies .", "at 2.2 billion of sg&a in 2020 , our cost structure is not meant to support the 4.5 billion revenue that we realized last year , but instead , a larger top line business where we can begin to leverage some of the foundational investments necessary for our growth expectations .", "therefore , our breakeven is somewhere around the 4.7 billion mark .", "with our cost structure now appropriately rebased , it 's important to understand a few elements of how we 're thinking about sg&a expenses and investments moving forward .", "when considering our restructuring efforts and how they 've impacted or will continue to affect our overall cost structure , it 's essential to remember that most of these efforts have been related to future cost avoidance versus current cost reductions .", "that said , we had realized underlying sg&a benefits in certain areas .", "however , it 's not as simple as cutting cost to gain leverage .", "as we mentioned early within our restructuring efforts , our main objective was to unburden ourselves of decisions and commitments made when we expected to be a much larger company than we are now .", "within those scenarios , there was also an expected level of productivity that was never realized .", "as a business in pursuit of brand - right growth , we will continue to invest in driving that growth .", "and for us specifically , that means marketing , it and elevating our international and d2c footprints .", "more simply put , while the absolute sg&a dollars may not change much in the near term , i 'd underscore that productivity and return on the investments that we are making are appropriately greater than just a few years ago .", "and should market factors impact our growth track in the near term , we 're now also capable of flexing and managing our costs with greater discipline and optionality to maintain a more consistent profitability trajectory .", "these factors , along with improved visibility and tighter alignment of our demand and supply planning functions , have afforded us greater flexibility with our customers and our ability to service higher - than - planned demand .", "this is especially evident in our year - end inventory position , which was at the same level that we ended 2019 .", "in 2021 , we plan to manage this even more tightly , helping us drive fuller price selling across all distribution points while keeping an eye on increasing our productivity and therefore , turns .", "moving to our third priority , elevating a d2c - focused approach , and the pandemic has certainly magnified and accelerated digital adoption rates worldwide .", "with e-commerce up 40 % in 2020 and representing nearly half of our total d2c business for the full year , we are hyper - focused on better understanding the consumer journey and building greater personalization capabilities to unlock even deeper connections with athletes .", "in our retail stores , we are working to evolve concepts to drive more profitable formats , particularly for our full -

elevating strategies to our tighter inventory management and a rebased cost structure , it 's well understood across the enterprise what we must do as we work to deliver greater leverage and sustainable profitable growth over the long term .", "so to wrap up , i am proud of what under armour has accomplished in the last year , particularly our ability to efficiently navigate an incredible amount of marketplace variability while continuing to advance our transformation .", "building on this demonstrated proficiency , as we move into 2021 amid uncertainty that has carried over from last year , i am confident about our ability to meet near - term challenges , accomplish our goals , and balance them with our long - term objectives .", "and with that , i 'll hand it over to dave .", "in the fourth quarter and for the full year , we delivered stronger - than - expected results , a performance to be proud of , especially during a global business environment that faced significant macro and micro challenges .", "over the past few years , the work we 've accomplished created the space and optionality necessary to work through these challenging conditions .", "from industry - leading product innovations to connecting consumers through fantastic brand stories and improved shopping experiences to deliver decisions to ensure liquidity , along with executing the divestiture of myfitnesspal , i 'm pleased with the way we closed out 2020 .", "with that said , let 's dive into our fourth - quarter results starting with revenue , which was down 3 % to 1.4 billion compared to the prior year .", "this was better than we had expected due to higher - than - anticipated demand across our wholesale and dtc businesses .", "from a channel perspective , our wholesale revenue was down 12 % .", "keep in mind , about 130 million in orders shifted out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2021 due to timing impacts from covid - 19 related to customer order flow and changes in supply chain timing that we discussed on our last call .", "relative to our plan , we experienced stronger sell - through and higher demand from our customers .", "our direct - to - consumer business increased 11 % driven by 25 % growth in our e-commerce business .", "relative to our plan , we experienced better - than - expected traffic trends in our retail business .", "our licensing business was down 12 % driven primarily by lapping one - time settlements in the prior year with two of our north american partners and lower minimum royalty payments .", "this result was better than expected driven primarily by our japanese partner .", "by product type , apparel revenue was down 4 % driven by declines in our train and team sports categories .", "footwear was down 7 % mainly driven by declines in our team sports category .", "and finally , our accessories business was up 32 % , with all of the growth being driven by sportsmask .", "from a regional and segment perspective , fourth - quarter revenue in north america was down 6 % , negatively impacted by the covid - 19 timing impacts , i previously mentioned , as well as reduced off - price sales .", "these headwinds were partially offset by strength in e-commerce within our dtc business in the quarter .", "in emea , revenue was down 11 % , also negatively impacted by covid - 19 timing impacts , partially offset by solid growth within our dtc business , primarily due to e-commerce .", "revenue in asia pacific was up 26 % driven by growth across all channels , partially offset by timing impacts from covid - 19 .", "in latin america , revenue was up 2 % driven by dtc growth , which included strength in our e-commerce business , partially offset by impacts from covid - 19 .", "and finally , our connected fitness business was down 5 % due to the sale of the myfitnesspal platform in the quarter , which was completed in mid-december .", "it is important to note that following this sale , we will no longer be reporting the connected fitness segment .", "starting with the first quarter of 2021 , the remaining mapmy business will be consolidated within our corporate other segment .", "fourth - quarter gross margin increased 210 basis points to 49.4 % , including a 12 million impact related to restructuring efforts .", "excluding restructuring charges , adjusted gross margin increased 300 basis points to 50.3 % driven by approximately 150 basis points of positive channel mix benefiting from lower year - over - year distributor and off - price sales , which carry a lower gross margin and a heavier mix toward dtc , which included strong e-commerce growth .", "additional year - over - year increases included 90 basis points of supply chain benefits primarily driven by product costing improvements and 30 basis points of positive regional mix driven by apac growth in the quarter .", "relative to our previous expectations for gross margin in the fourth quarter , our results were significantly better than expected as we experienced higher - than - anticipated demand , which allowed us to sell in and sell through with considerably less discounting and markdowns than we had initially anticipated .", "sg&a expense decreased 4 % to $ 586 million due to our restructuring efforts and tighter spend management .", "in the fourth quarter , we recorded 52 million of restructuring charges and certain impairments related to long - lived assets .", "as a reminder , we expect to incur total estimated pre-tax restructuring and related charges under this plan in the range of 550 to 600 million .", "for the full year , we realized 473 million in restructuring and related impairment charges and 141 million from impairments of long - lived assets and goodwill .", "we expect to complete our restructuring charges within the first half of 2021 with most of the remaining charges coming in the first quarter .", "our fourth - quarter operating income was 56 million .", "excluding restructuring and impairment charges , adjusted operating income was 120 million .", "after tax , we realized net income of 184 million or $ 0.40 of diluted earnings per share during the quarter .", "excluding restructuring charges , as well as the noncash amortization of debt discount on our senior convertible notes and the gain in deal - related costs associated with the sale of myfitnesspal , our adjusted net income was 55 million or $ 0.12 of adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter .", "from a balance sheet perspective , i am pleased to report we ended the fourth quarter with 1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents , inclusive of 199 million related to the sale of myfitnesspal .", "we also had no borrowings outstanding under our 1.1 billion revolver .", "and finally , inventory for the fourth quarter was 896 million , relatively unchanged compared to the prior year .", "concerning our 2021 outlook , while recent consumer trends have been more positive than we anticipated , we remain cautious in planning our business given the continued uncertainties with respect to demand and the overall marketplace due to the covid - 19 pandemic .", "therefore , the outlook we are providing today is predicated on our business continuing in the near term with the same general macros that we 've seen most recently followed by moderate improvements within the greater retail landscape as the year progresses , meaning we 're assuming no major retail or other business shutdowns or other new significant adverse economic impacts due to covid - 19 .", "that said , i will provide some high - level color on how we are thinking about our business for 2021 .", "relative to revenue , we expect a high single - digit rate increase for the full year compared to 2020 , reflecting a high single - digit increase in north america and a high - teens growth rate in our international business .", "looking at 2021 , some of the things included within our outlook that we anticipate will serve as revenue headwinds include the following .", "first would be the absence of myfitnesspal .", "second , to patrick 's earlier point about maintaining our current supply and demand planning and inventory management discipline , we plan to constrain orders against expected demand .", "third , as previously discussed , we will begin to exit certain undifferentiated wholesale distribution , primarily in north america , starting in the back half of 2021 with a plan to close about 2,000 to 3,000 wholesale partner doors , thereby expecting to win closer to 10,000 doors by the end of 2022 .", "and finally , we 're making several changes to our operating model in latin america , including shifting certain countries to strategic distributorship models , which will negatively impact revenue but should help improve operating margins .", "from a channel perspective , within wholesale , it 's important to keep in mind that we are just now finalizing our third - quarter bookings and have only recently started to take orders for the fourth quarter .", "therefore , we have limited visibility into the back half of the year .", "and as patrik mentioned , we will look to manage our inventory tightly , and in some instances , constrain demand continue to return to more premium revenue growth .", "all of this means we are taking a prudent approach to forecasting and managing our business this year .", "from a dtc perspective , we expect retail to outpace e-commerce 's growth as our digital business is up against strong comps from 2020 .", "for gross margin on a gaap basis , we expect the full - year rate to be up slightly against our 2020 adjusted gross margin of 48.6 % , with benefits from pricing and supply chain efficiency being largely offset by the sale of myfitnesspal , which was a high gross margin business .", "from an sg&a perspective , as patrik detailed , we believe we have appropriately rebased our cost structure .", "and we believe the improved discipline and processes we currently have in place have instilled a more return - based approach to our investments that should drive greater prioritization into the areas that deliver the highest return and support our long - term growth opportunities .", "however , critical areas like dtc , international and marketing will require us to continue investments to support our growth expectations .", "therefore , we are planning on slight sg&a growth for the year .", "with all of that considered , we expect reported operating income to reach approximately 5 to 25 million and adjusted operating income to be approximately 130 to 150 million , which will take us to a reported diluted loss per share of about $ 0.18 to $ 0.20 or adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $ 0.12 to $ 0.14 .", "now to provide a little bit more color on the first quarter of 2021 .", "we are currently planning for first - quarter revenue to be up approximately 20 % .", "this expectation includes about 130 million of orders that shifted out of the fourth quarter of 2020 into the first quarter of 2021 due to timing impacts from covid - 19 related to customer order flow and changes in supply chain timing that we discussed earlier .", "next , we expect gross margin to be up about 180 to 200 basis points compared to the prior year driven primarily by pricing benefits related to lower promotions , primarily in dtc compared to the prior year , and continued supply chain benefits related to product costing improvements .", "we expect these benefits will be partially offset by the absence of myfitnesspal .", "bringing this to the bottom line , we expect a first quarter operating loss of approximately 55 to 70 million .", "excluding planned restructuring impacts , we expect adjusted operating income to be approximately 30 to 35 million .", "excluding restructuring , we expect about $ 0.03 of adjusted diluted earnings per share .", "this will become effective on april 1st , 2022 .", "based on our revenue being more heavily weighted in the second half of the calendar year , we believe this change , namely putting those two quarters in the middle of our new fiscal year , will provide us with greater visibility and subsequent forecast accuracy as it relates to strategic business decisions and providing our initial annual outlook .", "mechanically , nothing changes this year for fiscal 2021 .", "next year , in 2022 , we will have a three -
