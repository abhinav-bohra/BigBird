quarter net sales growth .", "as you can see , the 8.1 % increase in organic net sales was primarily driven by a 6.6 % increase in volume related to the growth of at - home food consumption .", "the favorable impact of price mix which was evenly driven by favorable sales mix and less trade merchandising also contributed to our growth .", "the strong organic net sales growth was partially offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and a 1.7 % net decrease associated with divestitures .", "the peter pan peanut butter business is still part of conagra brands and thus included in our organic results .", "we expect the sale of peter pan to be completed in q3 at which point it will be removed from organic net sales growth .", "i will discuss the estimated impact of this divestiture shortly .", "slide 24 summarizes our net sales by segment for the second quarter .", "on both the reported and organic basis , we saw continued significant growth in each of our three retail segments : grocery and snacks , refrigerated and frozen , and international .", "the net sales increase was primarily driven by the increase of at - home food consumption as a result of covid - 19 , which benefited our retail segments but negatively impacted our food service segment .", "the grocery and snack segment experienced strong organic net sales growth of 15.3 % in the quarter .", "the segments we 're getting net sales growth outpaced its growth in consumption as retailers continued to rebuild inventories .", "our refrigerated and frozen segment delivered organic net sales growth of 7.8 % .", "this growth is a testament to our continued modernization and innovation efforts and illustrates the increasingly important role refrigerated and frozen products play in meeting the evolving needs of today 's consumers .", "turning to the international segment .", "quarterly organic net sales increased 9.1 % .", "this segment experienced particularly strong growth in both canada and mexico .", "this quarter , our food service segment reported a 21.4 % organic net sales decline , primarily driven by a volume decrease of 25.3 % due to less restaurant traffic as a result of covid - 19 .", "slide 25 outlines the adjusted operating margin bridge for the quarter versus the prior - year period .", "as you can see , in the second quarter , our adjusted operating margin increased 250 basis points to 19.6 % .", "strong supply chain realized productivity , favorable price mix , cost synergies associated with pinnacle foods acquisition , and fixed cost leverage combined to drive 440 basis points in adjusted operating margin improvement more than offsetting the impact of cost of goods sold inflation and covid - related costs in the quarter .", "collectively , these drivers resulted in a 139 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin versus the same period a year ago .", "a&p increased 4.7 % on a dollar basis primarily due to increases in e-commerce marketing a&p was flat on a percentage - of - sales basis this quarter versus q2 a year ago .", "finally , our adjusted sg&a rate was favorable by 110 basis points primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage on higher net sales , the pinnacle cost synergies , and temporarily reduced spending as employees work from home and significantly reduce their travel .", "i want to give you some additional perspective on our margin expansion .", "as i just mentioned , operating margin expanded 250 basis points for the quarter well ahead of our expectations .", "of this 250 basis point expansion in operating margin this quarter , approximately 60 basis points reflects our ongoing progress toward achieving our fiscal ' 22 margin target of 18 % to 19 % .", "we also saw an approximate 180 basis point margin benefit from price mix in the quarter primarily driven by mix , and to a lesser extent , favorable pricing in lower - trade merchandising .", "we expect to retain some of this benefit going forward , but exactly how much remains uncertain at this point .", "additional 10 basis points of net margin expansion came from favorable fixed cost leverage across the entire p&l and covid - related sg&a benefits , mostly offset by covid - related cost of goods sold .", "we do not expect this net benefit to repeat next year .", "slide 26 summarizes our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment for the second quarter .", "our three retail segments , all operating profits increased by double - digit percentages versus the same period a year ago .", "each retail segment benefited from higher organic net sales and strong supply chain - realized productivity .", "in the foodservice segment , however , operating profit decreased due to the covid - related impacts of lower organic net sales and higher input costs that more than offset the impacts of favorable supply chain - realized productivity and cost synergies .", "overall , we 're pleased with the continuation of the strong q1 margin results into the second quarter which are anchored by core productivity and benefits from the pinnacle acquisition we expected to see .", "we 've outlined the drivers of our second - quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share growth versus the same period a year ago .", "eps increased 28.6 % to $ 0.81 .", "the growth in the quarter was primarily driven by the increase in adjusted operating profit associated with the net sales increase and margin expansion , and also benefited from a decrease in net interest expense as we 've continued to reduce debt as prioritized .", "slide 28 highlights our significant progress on the overall synergy capture since the close of the pinnacle foods acquisition during the second quarter of fiscal ' 19 .", "we captured an incremental $ 27 million in savings during the most recent quarter bringing total cumulative synergies to $ 246 million .", "as a reminder , the majority of total synergy to date have been in sg&a .", "cost -
