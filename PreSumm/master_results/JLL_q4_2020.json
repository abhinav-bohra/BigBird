hff capital markets platform .", "the sale and financing of the iconic transamerica pyramid center in san francisco for $ 650 million and $ 390 million respectively during the fourth quarter .", "despite the pandemic , the expanded jll -

based tightening of the bid-ask spreads than the prior quarter , particularly for higher quality assets and resilient sectors , such as industrial and logistics and the u.s. multifamily .", "turning to our 2021 capital markets outlook .", "our pipeline is reasonably consistent with our 2020 capital markets geographic fee revenue mix , and is well distributed across sectors .", "we see a high degree of resilience in residential , and industrial and logistics , which are expected to continue that momentum in 2021 .", "our pipeline coupled with improving liquidity in the market gives us confidence in generating growth in capital markets fee revenue in 2021 .", "the renewed lockdowns and economic uncertainty do present headwinds , particularly for the first half of the year .", "consolidated leasing fee revenue declined 28 % compared with the prior year quarter , a slight improvement from the 30 % decline in the third quarter as clients continue to delay significant decisions regarding future real estate strategies .", "our investments in the higher growth asset classes of industrial , supply chain , life sciences and data centers continue to provide partial offset to ongoing softness in the office sector .", "looking at the leasing market environment , global activity continued to modestly recover from mid-year lows , driven mostly by smaller transactions .", "global office leasing volumes declined 43 % in the fourth quarter compared with the 46 % decline in the third quarter .", "in the u.s. office market shorter terms and renewals have been preferred by occupiers .", "in offices across major u.s. cities , we saw continued declines in net effective rents , which may eventually spur activity .", "our u.s. gross leasing pipeline has improved from mid-year lows and is up 5 % year - over - year , though we emphasize closing rates and timing remain highly uncertain .", "based on our leasing pipeline and our overall view of the market , we expect leasing activity to remain tempered in the first half of the year before gradually starting to recover in the back half of the year .", "property and facility management remains a growth area , driven largely by new business wins and contract expansions in the americas as corporate occupiers and investors seek our services due to increased building management standards .", "our corporate solutions business fee revenue declined 7 % in the quarter , a strong growth in americas facility management was more than offset by ongoing headwinds in our project and development services and u.k. mobile engineering businesses .", "we continue to be encouraged by the secular outsourcing trend , especially as clients increasingly seek our sustainability consulting services .", "lasalle 's quarterly and full - year comparisons were impacted by outsized incentive and transaction fees in 2019 .", "advisory fees were resilient for the full year within a backdrop of continued capital raising .", "coming off a record $ 8 billion of capital raised in 2019 , lasalle raised $ 6.1 billion in 2020 demonstrating that capital continues to flow to investment managers with proven track records .", "lasalle 's assets under management grew about $ 3 billion from the prior quarter to $ 69 billion .", "for 2021 , we anticipate around $ 25 million of incentive fees with very little in the first quarter .", "now , i 'll provide some details around our cost mitigation actions .", "consistent with my statements on the third quarter call , we expect $ 135 million of annualized fixed cost savings from actions taken in 2020 .", "it is important to note that we see opportunities in the current environment and we will continue to invest for growth .", "for the full year 2020 , non-permanent cost savings totaled about $ 330 million , including about $ 85 million in the fourth quarter .", "major items that benefited our full - year profitability included approximately $ 250 million of cost mitigation savings in t&e , marketing and other expense areas and $ 80 million of government covid relief programs .", "just under half of the $ 330 million of savings will not be repeated in 2021 , as they represent finite actions , including government programs and temporary reductions to compensation and benefits .", "the remainder of the non-permanent savings in 2020 are likely to return gradually as business volumes recover , and will often precede the revenue generation , for example , marketing expenses .", "considering our cost saving initiatives , business mix and growth initiatives , we expect to operate within our 14 % to 16 % long - term adjusted ebitda margin target range in 2021 and the years ahead .", "however , due to timing of expenses and the length of the sales cycle , particularly in the more transactional businesses , we expect adjusted ebitda growth to lag fee revenue growth this year .", "as we gain more visibility into the trajectory of the recovery as the year unfolds , we will provide more details on our 2021 expectations .", "shifting now to an update on our balance sheet and our thoughts on capital structure and efficiency .", "the sequential improvement in earnings , our enhanced focus on improving asset efficiency and modest capex and investment spending allowed us to reduce net debt by $ 560 million in the quarter , which ended the year at $ 192 million .", "at the end of december , reported leverage was 0.2 times , down from 0.8 times at the end of september and we had $ 3.3 billion of liquidity , including full availability of our $ 2.7 billion revolving credit facility .", "as christian mentioned , we are targeting reported net leverage ratio of 0.5 to 1.25 times over the long term , though there may be variances due to operational seasonality as well as timing of business reinvestment , m&a and share repurchases .", "we are very focused on continuing to improve our capital efficiency , which was a key factor in our strong cash generation and debt reduction in the quarter and full year despite the operating environment .", "looking ahead to the full year 2021 , we are encouraged by our pipelines and the momentum in our business and anticipate our business will grow this year .", "however , the seasonality of our business and the recent renewed lockdowns across the world , create considerable uncertainty across the entire industry , making it premature to provide fee revenue and profitability targets for the year at this time .", "we currently anticipate progressive improvement in the second half of the year , but much will depend on the evolution of the pandemic , the pace of vaccinations and economic activity globally .", "long - term , we remain focused on achieving our 2025 beyond targets , we have a steadfast commitment to meeting the evolving needs of our clients , people and broader community .", "this coupled with our constant efforts to improve both , our operating and capital efficiency , positions us to improve our returns and free cash flow , consequently , generating significant stakeholder value in the years ahead .", "back to christian for further remarks .", "with the distribution of vaccines , the general sentiment supports a meaningful recovery in 2021 , with some analysts forecasting global economic growth in excess of 5 % , much of it coming in the second half of the year .", "our people are committed to aligning with our clients ' objectives and providing advice about how to navigate the transitions ahead .", "as corporate occupiers begin to reimagine the future of work , they will rely on best -
