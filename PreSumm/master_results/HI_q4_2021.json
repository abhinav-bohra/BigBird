we are all facing .", "during these times , it 's critical that we remain focused on executing our strategy to drive long - term shareholder value .", "and i believe our performance demonstrated that throughout the year .", "as you know , our strategy is comprised of four pillars .", "the first strategic pillar is to strengthen and build business platforms , both organically and through m&a .", "over the past 12 months , we completed the divestitures of three businesses from our aps segment .", "this enables us to focus our capital allocation toward driving growth in our large industrial platform where we partner with our customers to develop highly engineered equipment and solutions that optimize quality , output and energy efficiency to achieve a lower total cost of ownership .",

backlog that positions us well for growth in fiscal 2022 and beyond .", "we continue to see significant opportunity in several areas of strategic focus , such as food , including texturized proteins , recycling , biopolymers and batteries , which tend to be less cyclical than our other industrial end markets and have attractive long - term growth prospects .", "as customer needs in these markets evolve toward higher output and more technically demanding applications , we are confident in our ability to win due to three key factors , our leading product offerings , our application engineering expertise , and finally , our global service network .", "additionally , the opportunities we see in these end markets aligned with our purpose of shaping a more sustainable future .", "we are making organic investments to better position ourselves to win in these end markets , while also evaluating strategic acquisitions to accelerate our growth .", "in recycling , for example , our investments have resulted in the introduction of several new products , the establishment of reference sites across all three recycling processes and key strategic partnerships that position us well for our future in this exciting area of opportunity .", "our next strategic pillar is to manage batesville for cash .", "as we continue to grow our industrial product platforms , batesville is becoming a smaller part of the portfolio , now comprising only about 20 % of the company revenues .", "throughout this unfortunate and unprecedented pandemic , the batesville team has remained relentlessly focused on serving our customers and living up to their mission of helping families honor the lives of those they love .", "batesville 's strong execution over the last two years has delivered over $

shareholders .", "our third strategic pillar is to build scalable foundations for growth using the hillenbrand operating model .", "the hillenbrand operating model is at the core of how we run and grow our businesses .", "during joe 's tenure , the hillenbrand operating model evolved from a lean manufacturing system to a full operating model that enables continuous improvement across all aspects of the business , including operations , supply chain , global support functions and strategy .", "i 've been fortunate to partner with the leadership team and the development of the operating model , while also experiencing firsthand the benefits of its deployment during my time as president of coperion and through my involvement in the integration of milacron .", "the hillenbrand operating model is a key enabler of the success we 've seen so far in the milacron integration , but the benefits will go far beyond the synergies realized from this particular acquisition .", "we are confident that the capabilities we have developed and the organizational structures we have established will enable us to accelerate the integration and synergy realization of future acquisitions .",

around innovation , digitization and commercial excellence .", "our fourth and final pillar is to effectively deploy strong free cash flow .", "we generated record cash flow in fiscal 2021 .", "this allowed us to reinvest in the business for growth and productivity to strengthen our balance sheet and to return over $ 180 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly dividends .", "since acquiring milacron two years ago , we 've reduced our leverage by nearly 2.5 turns .", "we have a healthy and flexible balance sheet enabling us to further accelerate our growth

efforts based on the feedback of our stakeholders .", "we also aligned our reporting framework to the united nations sustainable development goals and the global reporting initiative .", "we believe sustainability is a source of opportunity , innovation and competitive advantage for hillenbrand , which will ultimately drive long - term profitable growth and shareholder value .", "this is a priority of mine , and i 'm excited to continue sharing our progress with you over the quarters and years to come .", "throughout my section , i will be referencing year - over - year comparisons on a pro forma basis , which are adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures .", "we believe these pro forma comparisons provide a better assessment of our ongoing operations .", "and you will find a reconciliation of reported and pro forma results in the appendix of the earnings slide deck .", "during the fiscal fourth quarter , we delivered total revenue in the quarter of $ 755 million , an increase of 12 % on a pro forma basis or a 11 % excluding the impact of foreign currency .", "we saw year - over - year increases in all three segments , led by volume growth in the injection molding product line within mts .", "adjusted ebitda of $ 140 million increased 2 % , while adjusted ebitda margin of 18.5 % decreased 180 basis points , as cost inflation , unfavorable mix and an increase in strategic investments more than offset operating leverage from higher volume , favorable pricing and productivity improvements , including approximately $ 7 million of year - over - year synergies realized in the quarter .", "despite the decline compared to prior year , adjusted ebitda margins in the quarter exceeded our expectations for all three segments .", "as communicated last quarter , we have been actively taking pricing actions to help mitigate the impact of rising inflation .", "we had approximately 70 % price / cost coverage in the quarter , which was more favorable than we had expected , primarily due to better pricing realization in some of our shorter cycle injection molding products and in batesville .", "however , we expect to see continued price / cost pressure in the first half of fiscal ' 22 , due -- in part due to the delivery of longer lead time injection molding equipment from the backlog that was priced at pre-inflationary levels .", "additionally , we expect our primary commodity costs of steel , electrical components , wood and fuel to remain elevated through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 .", "we will continue to monitor our pricing structures and take further action as appropriate .", "we reported gaap net income of $ 55 million , or $ 0.74 per share , which increased from a loss of $ 0.09 per share in the prior year .", "adjusted net

inflation was largely offset by price , but the impact of unfavorable mix from a higher proportion of large plastics projects and strategic investments for growth more than offset operating leverage from higher volume and productivity improvements .", "order backlog of $ 1.3 billion increased 41 % year - over - year on a pro forma basis , primarily driven by large plastics projects .", "while backlog declined 2 % sequentially , it remains at a high level , providing us a strong foundation for growth in fiscal ' 22 and beyond .", "the pipeline for large plastics projects continues to be healthy , particularly in asia .", "and as kim mentioned , we have made solid advances in our product innovations and strategic partnerships in recycling as well as food , biopolymers and batteries .", "although these areas are not significant portions of our revenue today , we are focused on building our capabilities to win in these end markets in the future through strategic partnerships and

growth for injection molding equipment .", "both revenue and margins exceeded our expectations coming into the quarter .", "revenue of $ 260 million increased 20 % compared to the prior year .", "the team executed well in the quarter and was able to largely mitigate the impact of a chip shortage that we communicated coming into the quarter .", "adjusted ebitda of $ 54 million increased 6 % , while adjusted ebitda margin of 20.6 % decreased 270 basis points , as higher volume and productivity were more than offset by unfavorable mix due to an increased proportion of injection molding equipment , which comes at a lower margin compared to hot runners , cost inflation , not fully offset by price , and higher labor and manufacturing premiums , including outsourcing .", "we continue to deploy the hillenbrand operating model in the mts segment , particularly in injection molding where we expect to achieve sustained margin improvement over the coming years .", "order backlog of $ 366 million increased 51 % compared to the prior year and decreased 6 % sequentially as order volumes normalized , in line with our expectations .", "batesville performed above our expectations for both revenue and margin given the unfortunate circumstances with the delta variant .", "revenue of $ 155 million increased 5 % , due to higher average selling price and an estimated increase in deaths associated with the pandemic .", "while we are closely monitoring the continued impact of covid - 19 , we expect deaths to normalize as we progress through fiscal year 2022 .", "adjusted ebitda margin of 21.6 % declined 270 basis points compared to the prior year , primarily due to cost inflation and higher transportation and manufacturing cost premiums required to respond to the increased demand driven by the ongoing covid - 19 pandemic .", "as we 've discussed before , the batesville team has been fully focused on meeting the elevated demand needs of their customers throughout the pandemic .", "when

.", "pro forma adjusted ebitda of $ 534 million increased 20 % compared to the prior year , while pro forma adjusted ebitda margin of 18.8 % improved 100 basis points , primarily driven by operating leverage from higher volume in batesville and mts and productivity improvements , including synergies .", "we accelerated the timing of our synergy capture in the year , realizing approximately $ 30 million of incremental cost savings , which exceeded our target of $ 20 million to $ 25 million , and we remain on track to achieve our three - year run rate synergy target of $ 75 million .", "gaap net income of $ 250 million resulted in gaap earnings per share of $ 3.31 .", "adjusted net income of $ 286 million resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $ 3.79 , an increase of $ 0.60 , or 19 %

earnings per share in the range of $ 0.87 to $ 0.94 , down versus the prior year , primarily due to lower volume in batesville , higher inflation and supply chain costs , and the impact of the

.", "turning to advanced process solutions , we expect full - year revenue to be up 8 % to 12 % , primarily due to continued strength in large plastics projects as well as solid growth in aftermarket

in the second half .", "for q1 , we expect revenue to be modestly higher than prior year , but down sequentially .", "and we anticipate modest year - over - year margin pressure , due to inflation and unfavorable mix from a higher proportion of injection molding equipment , which comes at a lower margin .", "finally , with batesville , we expect revenue to be down 11 % to 13 % , due to an anticipated decline in burial demand as just normalized during the year .", "we expect covid - related volumes to be significantly lower than the prior year , in line with external estimates .",
