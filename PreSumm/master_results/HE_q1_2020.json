funding and we do n't expect it to need capital from the holding company under any scenario including very severe stress scenarios that we 've refreshed during the quarter .", "we expect asb 's dividend to the holding company this year will be reduced as we expect asb to focus on retaining capital to support loan growth and important customer programs such as such as ppp and to cover higher credit costs during this period .", "on slide 14 we do n't expect our dividend from the utility to change meaningfully from the level previously communicated .", "although the dividend from asb is lower we expect that its profitable operations will continue to contribute to earnings .", "we remain committed to investment - grade rating and can turn on our dividend reinvestment program if needed which can cost effectively generate about $ 30 million of cash and incremental equity annually based on historical levels .", "however we do n't currently believe we have a need to issue equity this year .", "we expect to maintain our external dividend while growing the dividend in line with longer -

19 impacts were mainly in the latter half of march as stay - at - home orders and air travel quarantines went into effect .", "while we are insulated from the impacts of lower load on revenue we do n't get true - ups for incremental bad debt expense which was up considerably in march versus last year .", "we have had an unprecedented level of federal stimulus coming into the states including funds loan through the paycheck protection program .", "and we expect that this will provide some upside as customers get more breathing room to pay bills .", "the lower fuel prices are also bright spot for our customers .", "we are now approximately we now forecast approximately $ 330 million to $ 360 million of capex in 2020 .", "as we see about $ 30 million of potential downside due to covid related delays .", "as i mentioned we 've delayed some scheduled maintenance to avoid outages for residential customers now working from home .", "however we 're maintaining our longer -

19 will impact asset quality until we have a better sense about the timing and manner in which our local economy will reopen .", "given that uncertainty it is too early to provide guidance on provision .", "and consequently we are unable to provide earnings per share or return on asset guidance as well for the bank .", "however we do have sufficient visibility to provide guidance on a pre-tax pre-provision level which is comprised of net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense which also provides you a snapshot of the continuing profitable operation of the bank in this economic environment excluding the credit impacts of covid - 19 .", "we estimate the pre-tax provision income range to be from $ 90 million to $ 110 million for 2020 .", "that income along with our existing bank reserves and strong capital position gives us significant headroom to absorb the uncertainty of covid related credit impacts .", "while rate moves by the fed in march had a modest impact in the first quarter we expect the low interest rate environment to have a greater impact on asset yields in q2 .", "and thus further pressure in net interest margins .", "floating rate debt such as libor - based and prime linked loans repriced based on the change in the benchmark to which they are tied .", "we saw some effect in q1 from lower libor rates on our commercial portfolios and expect to see the full impact in q2 .", "we also saw some q1 impact from the lower prime rate to which our home equity line of credit those lines of credit are now at their floor price .", "and consequently we do not expect we would expect minimal incremental impact from further repricing of that portfolio .", "fixed rate debt such as 30 - year fixed rate mortgages were really priced at a much more slowly through refinancing of existing mortgages .", "given our already very low - cost of funds at 24 basis points in the first quarter there is little room to move lower and improve to improve net interest margins .", "asb 's net charge - offs have consistently been below the national average .", "this was true during the financial crisis as hawaii 's residents continue to pay their mortgages and other loans .", "if you look at the 2008 through 2011 period our provision expense averaged 0.52 % of our loan portfolio and peaked at 0.81 % .", "if you apply that to a portfolio of our size today you 'd have approximately you'd have an average credit cost of $ 27 million and a peak of $ 42 million .", "we 've walked through each of the key drivers for our utility and bank .", "so now i 'll bring it all together .", "at the utility we are reaffirming our guidance range and we currently expect the utility to be at or below the midpoint .", "this assumes the deferral of covid - 19 related cost is granted during 2020 for later recovery at the bank because provision is tied to uncertainties regarding impacts of covid - 19 and the economic recovery we are providing guidance at the pre-tax pre-provision line .", "we expect pre-tax pre-provision income which includes net interest income noninterest income and noninterest expense to range from $ 90 million to $ 110 million .", "we continue to expect low to mid- single -
