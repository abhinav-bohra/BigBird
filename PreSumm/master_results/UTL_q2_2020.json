to - date decrease in earnings is primarily due to the warmer - than - normal winter weather in q1 , which unfavorably affected net income by approximately $ 3.1 million or $ 0.20 per share .", "similar to last quarter , i 'd like to recap the company 's covid - 19 pandemic response .", "our highest priority continues to be the safety of our customers and of our employees .", "in response to the covid - 19 emergency , we implemented our crisis response plan in order to execute preventive and proactive measures during this unprecedented time , and we 've also enacted a phased opening plan .", "the company is currently operating in its limited reopening phase under which most office employees are continuing to work from home when possible .", "in addition , we continue to require social distancing as well as masks , hygiene , travel limitations and other measures to protect our employees and prevent the spread of the covid virus .", "operationally , the company has continued to provide safe and reliable service through the covid -

19 pandemic .", "unfortunately , many parts of the country have experienced an acceleration in the rate of new covid - 19 cases and consequently , reopening plans are being rolled back in some places .", "however , in new england , we remain cautiously optimistic that testing , tracing , masks , social distancing and other measures have successfully slowed the spread of covid - 19 as the new case counts across our territories appear to have leveled off .", "the percentage of positive covid - 19 tests in our service areas also have stabilized at rates considerably lower than the national average .", "as the number of new covid - 19 cases have slowed , emergency orders have been moderately relaxed as part of a phased reopening plan in the states where we operate .", "as outlined on this slide , many businesses , including retail , restaurants and personal services , began reopening during q2 .", "i would also note that most of the major development projects that we have discussed in the past continue to proceed in our service areas , which should contribute to our expanding customer base .", "on slide eight , we 've again summarized our 5 -

to - date sales margin was lower by $ 2.7 million due to warmer weather , partially offset by customer growth .", "we also estimate that the covid - 19 emergency unfavorably impacted margin by $ 0.8 million due to lower c&i usage .", "these volume variances were partially offset by higher natural gas distribution rates of $ 2.0 million in 2020 .", "through the first six months of 2020 , natural gas therm sales decreased 7.5 % compared to 2019 .", "we attribute the decline in gas sales to the historically warm winter weather in the first quarter of 2020 and the ongoing covid -

19 emergency and warmer early summer weather , partially offset by increased sales to residential customers due to the covid - 19 pandemic stay - at - home orders and the increased use of air conditioning during the warmer early summer period .", "in total , the company estimates that normal electric kilowatt hour sales , excluding decoupled sales , were down 4.9 % .", "commercial and industrial sales were down 11 % and residential usage was up 12.8 % in the quarter .", "on a weather -

19 emergency also negatively impacted margin by $ 0.4 million .", "through the first six months of 2020 , electric kilowatt hour sales decreased 0.5 % compared to 2019 .", "we attribute the decline in electric sales principally to the lower average usage by c&i customers as a result of the ongoing covid - 19 emergency and warmer winter weather , which adversely impacted the usage of electricity for heating purposes .", "this was partially offset by increased sales to residential customers due to warmer early summer temperatures and the fact that people spent more time at home than usual during the covid - 19 stay - at - home orders .", "the company estimates that weather normal electric kilowatt sales , excluding decoupled sales , were down 1.1 % in the period .", "the number of electric customers being served has increased by 755 or 0.7 % compared to the prior year .", "next , on slide 14 , we 'll discuss the financial impact on unitil of the covid -

19 emergency , earnings per share were negatively impacted by $ 0.03 in the second quarter of 2020 .", "as we just discussed , the combined impact on gas electric sales margin from the covid - 19 emergency was $ 1.2 million in the second quarter of 2020 .", "however , this was somewhat offset by net lower o&m expenses of approximately $ 0.6 million that the company identified to be related to the covid - 19 emergency .", "the lower o&m related to the covid - 19 was due to lower employee benefit costs , primarily lower health insurance claims incurred in the second quarter of $ 1.0 million , partially offset by net $ 0.4 million higher other pandemic - related costs related to the purchasing of ppe supplies , facility cleaning , higher bad debt provisions and other expenses .", "overall , o&m was down by $ 1.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 , and the remaining decrease is primarily due to lower utility operating costs in the period .", "the company is also working closely with our regulators and local utility working groups to develop reporting mechanisms to respond to requests from our regulators about the financial impacts of the covid - 19 emergency .", "due to the ongoing moratorium on service disconnections , the company expects to incur higher levels of customer arrears , which could translate to higher bad debt expense .", "we 'll be tracking the activity , and we are exploring potential options to recover expenses related to the emergency through the regulatory process .", "i 'd like to point out that supply related bad debt , which is historically approximately 45 % of all write - off activity , is tracked and recovered in reconciling mechanisms and does not impact the company 's earnings .", "also , as i mentioned last call , the company has no intention to alter staffing levels as a result of the covid - 19 emergency .", "in order to help stakeholders gauge the potential impact of covid - 19 on sales margin , the company has provided sensitivities between usage and margin for the third and fourth quarters of 2020 .", "turning to the balance sheet .", "in the second quarter , the company successfully priced $ 95 million of long - term debt through the private placement market .", "the debt was priced at competitive investment - grade rates , and we anticipate the transaction to close in quarter 3 .", "the capital will be used to refinance existing and maturing debt , fund our investment programs and for other general corporate purposes .", "with the company 's existing credit facility , which has a borrowing limit of $ 120 million , and the proceeds recently of the recently priced debt , the company has ample liquidity to execute our growth plans .", "moving on to slide 15 .", "we provide an earnings bridge analysis comparing 2020 results to 2019 for the 6 - month period ended june 30 .", "i 'd like to note that this layout is slightly different from the form 10 - q as we isolate the impact of the 2019 usource divestiture and related revenues and expenses .", "as discussed , 2020 year - to - date gross margin is lower than 2019 by $ 1.5 million , largely due to the warmer winter weather .", "core operation and maintenance expenses decreased $ 1.5 million compared to the same period in 2019 .", "this decrease is primarily driven by lower employee benefit costs of $ 1.1 million as well as lower maintenance and storm expenses of $ 1.0 million , partially offset by higher bad debt expense and higher professional fees of a net $ 0.6 million .", "depreciation and amortization was higher by $ 0.8 million , reflecting higher levels of utility plant in service .", "taxes other than income taxes increased by $ 1.1 million , reflecting higher levels of net plant in service as well as a nonrecurring tax abatement realized in 2019 of $ 0.6 million .", "interest expense was flat , reflecting interest on higher interest on long - term debt , offset by lower interest on short - term borrowings .", "other expense increased $ 0.3 million due to higher retirement benefit costs .", "next , we 've isolated the full usource impact of $ 10.3 million , which was realized in 2019 .", "this includes the after - tax gain on the divestiture of $ 9.8 million , in addition to $ 0.5 million , which is the net of revenues and expenses realized through usource operations in 2019 .", "lastly , income taxes decreased $ 0.3 million , reflecting lower pre-tax earnings in the period .", "so this bridge analysis shows the net changes to reconcile our 2019 net income of $ 30.5 million to our 2020 earnings of $ 18.3 million for the first six months of the year .", "on slide 16 , we 'll begin our discussion of rate case activity in 2020 .", "as we announced last quarter , our base rate cases in maine and massachusetts have concluded .", "we received an order from the maine puc , approving an increase to base revenue of $ 3.6 million .", "in massachusetts , the gas settlement approved has a total distribution revenue increase of $ 4.6 million , which will be phased in over two years .", "we began collecting the majority of this revenue award on march 1 , 2020 , while $ 0.9 million of the award will be included in rates starting march 1 , 2021 .", "the gas settlement was lower as a result of $ 1.8 million lower expenses related to the pass back of excess deferred income taxes , lower depreciation and a removal of retirement costs from base distribution rates .", "the massachusetts electric settlement allows for a distribution increase of $ 0.9 million to become effective november of 2020 .", "the electric settlement was lower by $ 1.1 million as a result of lower expenses related to the pass back of excess deferred income taxes and the removal of retirement costs from base distribution rates .", "the electric settlement also allows for the implementation of a new major storm reserve fund , which will help mitigate expense volatility related to future storms .", "the company was planning to file the ues rate case during 2020 with the test year 2019 , but we expect to defer the filing until the first half of 2021 .", "and i 'd point out that both ues and northern new hampshire are required by the new hampshire puc to propose revenue decoupling in their next rate case to be filed 2021 or later .", "over on slide 17 , we have provided a summary of significant distribution rate changes in 2020 .", "in 2020 , we have been awarded over $ 7 million of rate relief .", "as i mentioned last slide , the fitchburg rate case awards would have been a combined $ 2.9 million higher if not for lower depreciation and amortization expenses and the removal of retirement costs from base rates .", "on slide 17 , the negative amounts for the fitchburg capital trackers reflect the transfer of collections from the tracker mechanisms and into base distribution rates .", "also , we have precedent for long -
