year outlook for our end markets remains largely consistent with our view from last quarter with some positive evolution as a few end markets are showing even faster recovery .", "in utilities , demand continues to be strong in both wastewater and clean water , affirming our anticipated growth of mid- to - high single digits .", "on the wastewater side , we have seen steady demand in western europe and north america as operators continue to focus on mission - critical applications while also investing in larger scale upgrades on affordable funding from capital markets .", "bid activity and long - term capital spending outlook in emerging markets remains solid , though some covid concerns linger in certain markets .", "on the clean water side , demand for smart water solutions and digital offerings continues to be robust as utilities increasingly turn their focus to more resilient infrastructure and affordable water delivery .", "consistent with other technology companies , the connected nature of our solutions raises some risk in the second half , given prolonged supply chain constraints for electronic components .", "our teams are working closely with our suppliers and manufacturing partners to optimize deliveries .", "looking at the industrial end market , where we had expected mid-single digits growth for the year , we are now anticipated growing in the high single digits .", "the growth is broad - based with rebounding industrial activity across all segments and regions .", "we 're seeing upticks in demand , particularly in our industrial dewatering business in emerging markets .", "we 're also seeing higher demand in marine and food and beverage , driven by recovery in outdoor recreation and the hospitality sector .", "we are increasing our outlook in the commercial end market as well .", "the u.s. replacement business is growing at a first pace .", "new commercial building is expected to lag the recovery somewhat , but key leading indicators reflect optimism for late 2021 recovery in the institutional sector .", "with growth in western europe and china sustained through the second half , along with modest share gains and supply chain resiliency , we now expect the commercial end market to be up mid- to - high single digits , up from the low single digits previously .", "in residential , we now anticipate low teens growth for the full year , up modestly from our previous expectations of high single - digit to low double - digit growth .", "we do expect growth will moderate through the second half , due largely to a more difficult year - over - year comparisons .", "as you can see , we are further raising our previous annual guidance .", "for xylem overall , we now see full year organic revenue growth in the range of 6 to 8 % , up from our previous guidance range of 5 to 7 % .", "this confidence is based on clear demand recovery , combined with the pricing actions we are taking to offset inflation .", "this revenue guidance breaks down by segment as follows .", "for water infrastructure , we expect mid-single - digit growth from a previous expectation of mid- to - high single digits .", "we expect low double - digit growth in applied water , up from mid- to - high single digits .", "and in measurement & control solutions , we expect mid-single - digit growth .", "we also expect ebitda margins in the range of 17.2 to 17.7 % .", "this guidance represents full - year margin expansion of 120 basis points at the midpoint .", "that 's grounded in a strong first - half performance with 300 basis points of expansion from restructuring savings on actions we took late last year , as well as volume leverage from the top line growth .", "the third quarter is more challenging , primarily driven by the timing of inflation and price realization .", "however , price realization will increase into the fourth quarter as we work through the large backlog built over the last several quarters .", "overall , we expect strong second - half margins compared to the first half of the year .", "this yields an adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $ 2.55 to $ 2.70 , reflecting increased confidence in our ability to lift the bottom end of the range while still managing through inflation and supply chain challenges .", "that range now reflects a 28 % increase in earnings per share guidance at the midpoint over last year .", "we continue to expect full - year 2021 free cash flow conversion of 80 to 90 % as previously guided , putting our three - year average right around 130 % .", "we have provided you with a number of other full - year assumptions to supplement your models .", "those assumptions are largely unchanged from our original guidance .", "however , one item worth noting is our updated assumption on foreign exchange for the second half of the year .", "because of the recent dip in the euro and the disproportionate effect it had on our results , we 've updated our euro to dollar conversion rate assumption for the second half from 1.22 to 1.18 .", "this change , along with some other currency movements has a $ 0.04 negative impact on our second - half outlook .", "as you know , foreign exchange can be volatile , so we 've included our typical foreign exchange sensitivity table in the appendix .", "also , we are making an adjustment to our restructuring and realignment guidance from 50 to 60 million to now 30 to 40 million , while still expecting to realize similar restructuring savings due to high natural attrition and the timing of actions .", "and now before wrapping up , let me share some thoughts on our third - quarter outlook .", "we anticipate total company organic revenues will grow in the range of 5 to 7 % .", "this includes mid-single - digit growth in water infrastructure , high single - digit growth in applied water , and low single - digit growth in m&cs .", "we expect third - quarter adjusted - ebitda margin to be in the range of 16.7 to 17.2 % , largely in line with our strong second quarter .", "while inflation and component supply are likely to present some headwinds in the third quarter , we are addressing them with the pricing and supply chain actions previously mentioned .", "the team has been doing an outstanding job capturing market demand , giving us exceptional orders and backlog growth .", "we expect to continue capitalizing on that underlying demand .", "and the team will manage through the near - term supply chain environment with the same spirit and discipline they 've demonstrated through the many external challenges of the past year .", "looking forward , trends toward new investment in infrastructure and particularly in the modernization of infrastructure are accelerating hand - in - hand with demand to make communities more resilient to climate change and to do it in a more affordable way .", "those trends only reinforce the strength of our investment thesis , that our differentiated portfolio of leading technologies , addressing scarcity , resilience , and affordability will drive increased revenue growth and margins , and sustainable growth with strong cash flow generation and increased opportunity for capital deployment .", "this puts us in a privileged position to create both economic and social value for our stakeholders now and over the medium and long term .", "we are genuinely excited about providing an update on our strategy and long - term plans at our upcoming investor day , which is scheduled for september 30th .", "it will be the first opportunity for many of you to meet all of our business leaders and our entire senior leadership team , especially those who joined us over the past year .", "so it 's a great chance to provide a full - strategic update , including our long - term financial targets , and a deep dive into our vision of how digital solutions are transforming outcomes for our customers , including discussions with a few of those customers who 've deployed some of our most advanced technologies .", "matt and the team will follow up with invitations and logistical details in the coming days ."], "summary_gold": "compname posts q2 adjusted earnings per share $ 0.66 .<q>sees fy adjusted earnings per share $ 2.55 to $ 2.70 .<q>q2 adjusted earnings per share $ 0.66 .<q>raises full -
