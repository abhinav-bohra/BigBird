19 for the second quarter continued to run about $ 200,000 a quarter .", "so we 're up to about $ 1.3 million total since the beginning of the pandemic .", "that 's being captured in a memo account .", "it 's interesting to note that water sales in california are at 103 % of the adopted numbers that were approved in the last general rate case .", "and year - over - year , residential consumption is up 4 % and that 's been offset by lower business in industrial sales and , of course , as the economy was slowed and stalled out there for a little bit .", "but as businesses come back , we expect to see the business in residential sales to continue to climb .", "liquidity remained strong at the end of the quarter with over $ 66 million cash on hand and additional borrowing capacity of $ 405 million on the line of credit , subject to various borrowing conditions , but liquidity remained strong , as we move into the warmer summer months .", "california water service group has been busy in the business development area .", "in may , we announced our establishment of texas water service and our entry into the fast -
