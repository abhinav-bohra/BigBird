million .", "this was excluding the costs associated with our financing initiatives are approximately $ 25 million per month .", "this represented an improvement compared to the previously projected net cash outflow of $ 30 million to $ 35 million per month during the last nine months of 2020 .", "the improvement was driven by discipline cost management , higher active pass base retention due to the lower than anticipated membership cancellations and season pass refund requests , as well as positive cash flow from our parks that have reopened .", "total attendance for the quarter was 433,000 , half of which came from our drive thru safari and our park in new jersey , which was our first attraction to open .", "as a result , revenue declined by $ 458 million or 96 % to $ 19 million .",

when our members entered a 13 month membership , we recognize the revenue on a monthly basis , according to their cash payments .", "however , as part of our retention efforts , we offer an additional monster our members for every month they could not use their home park .", "as a result , for those members who have completed their initial 12 month commitment period , we will recognize revenue at the end of their membership term , whenever those members utilize their additional months .", "the decrease in revenue was also partially attributable , to a $ 29 million reduction in sponsorship , international agreements and accommodations revenue .", "this reduction was driven by three things , determination of the company 's international contracts in china and dubai , resulting in no revenues from those contracts in 2020 .", "before most sponsorship revenues , while the parks were not operating , the suspension of almost all accommodations operations .", "we recognized little

there is no opportunity for in park spending .", "on the cost side , cash operating an sga expenses , increased by $ 141 million or 60 % , primarily due to proceedings measures we took , after we suspended operations .", "these savings were partially offset by costs incurred to open and operate our park toward the end of the quarter , including increased costs related to enhanced standardization and additional prevalent preventative measures to help minimize the spread of covid - 19 .", "in addition we increased our legal reserves by $ 8 in the quarter .", "these expenses associated with several unrelated legal claims .", "adjusted ebitda for the quarter was a loss of $ 96 million , compared to income of $ 180 million in the prior period .", "we now have 14 of 26 parks open .", "these parks generated more than 50 % of our 2019 attendance on a full year basis .", "month to - date in july , we are averaging approximately 30 % of prior attendance at the parks that are open .", "we are holding steadily in certain states , but are doing much better and improving in states and i experienced of covid - 19 trends .", "this gives us confidence that we will see a rebound once the virus has abated .", "in the near - term it is unclear if we will be able to open any of the remaining parks this year , or whether we will close any of the open parks , earlier than prior years .", "at this time we are evaluating a modified version of our popular fright fest and holiday in the park events .", "turing to our active pass base , which represents the total number of guests enrolled in the company 's membership program all that have season pass .", "as anticipated , we lost a significant season -- we lost significant season pass and membership sales while our parks were not operating .", "our active pass base as of the end of the second quarter was down 38 % and compared to the prior year quarter .", "this includes 2.1 million members compared to 2.6 million at the end of calendar year 2019 and 2.4 million at the end of the first quarter 2020 .", "customers typically purchase new season passes or memberships when they are planning to visit a park .", "for that reason , the temporary closure of our park had a temporary but large impact on our ability to sell new season passes and memberships .", "however , we were pleased with the retention of our existing members as we retained 81 % of our members since the start of the year through the second quarter .", "since we opened our parks , we have begun to sell new memberships and season passes .", "we are proactively working to retain our existing members and season pass holders in several ways .", "first , we offer day - to - day extensions for our season pass holders for each operating day their home park is closed and extended our members by one month for each month that their home park is closed .", "second , we offer to automatically upgrade memberships to the next tier level for the rest of the 2020 season for members who continue to make payments until the parks reopen .", "and third , we offer the pause payments for any member requesting to do so .", "we are taking members on pause as we open our parks , and we anticipate that most of our pause members will return to active paying members once we reopen our remaining parks .", "in addition , we are actively recruiting our cancelled members back to our programs now that park operations are beginning to resume .", "we have received very few refund requests of season passes to date .", "while we have no contractual obligation to make a refund , and almost all of our existing pass holders have used their pass at least once , the satisfaction of our guests is very important to us .", "we are actively engaged in conversations with them to ensure a continued loyalty .", "in response to our curtailed operations , we continued to take actions to reduce operating expenses and to defer or eliminate at least $ 50 million to $ 60 million of capital expenditures .", "we now expect to spend $ 80 million to $ 90 million on capital expenditures in 2020 , $ 10 million lower than our previous projections .", "we have kept our full - time team members on the payroll and maintain their benefits at the same cost .", "we believe this has left us in the best position to open our parks quickly .", "however , we will continue to evaluate all options in the future , given the fluidity of the virus and any associated impacts on park operating calendars .", "based on all the cost savings measures we have implemented , the retention of most of our membership base and positive cash flow from the parks that are currently open , we estimate that our net cash outflows will average between $ 25 million to $ 30 million per month through the end of 2020 .", "this includes all operating expenditures and capital expenditures relating to our parks along with contractual rent , interest and partnership park distributions .", "note that partnership park distributions occur only in the back half of the year and represent an average run rate of $ 7 million per month for the last six months of the year .", "we believe we have adequate liquidity to the end of 2021 even if we need to close our parks .", "however , if operations remain curtailed , we will likely need a further amendment to our senior secured leverage ratio covenant .", "we also incurred approximately $ 6 million of costs on the strategic work related to the transformation initiative that mike will discuss .", "costs in future periods are included in our net cash outflow estimates .", "however , we will not finalize the cost of associated savings until we complete the work .", "we anticipate that a portion of the work will be completed by the fourth quarter of 2020 , and the remaining portion will be completed when the parts are again operating at more normal capacity .", "deferred revenue of $ 182 million was down $ 53 million or 22 % to prior year , driven by fewer membership and season pass sales , while our parks have been closed .", "these lower sales were partially offset by the deferral of revenue out of the quarter from our members who have completed their initial 12 - month commitment period and extension of visitation privileges into the 2021 season for our season pass holders and members in the initial 12 - month commitment period .", "our liquidity position as of june 30 was $ 756 million .", "this included $ 460 million of available revolver capacity , net of $ 21 million of letters of credit and $ 296 million of cash .", "this compares to a pro forma liquidity position of $ 832 million as of march 31 , 2020 , a reduction of $ 76 million or approximately $ 25 million per month .", "we do not expect to draw on our revolver until q1 , 2021 .", "i now would like to turn to our immediate priorities for the company .", "first , reopen with caution and prioritize the health of our employees and guests .", "second , focus on liquidity and minimizing cash expenditure while we go through this period of uncertainty .", "third , be conservative with capex , ensuring we only invest in projects with a good return of investment .", "and finally , continue building business and team capability .", "we have withdrawn guidance due to the uncertain trajectory of the virus .", "however , like mike , i am committed to providing additional disclosures when feasible and being as transparent as possible .", "our capital allocation strategy will be focused on growing the base business and paying down debt to return our net leverage ratio to between three and four times adjusted ebitda .", "we have suspended our dividend and share repurchases for the foreseeable future , and we believe targeting the low end of the range is appropriate given the new environment .", "in summary , despite the challenges our entire industry is facing , we have adapted our operations in response to the crisis , and we remain a healthy company with a bright future .", "we will not let these difficulties slow down our efforts to build new business capabilities and prepare the company for its next phase of profitable growth

element is about improving the end - to - end guest experience , starting with price and simplicity , website redesign and a compelling value proposition for food and beverage .", "one focus area that we previously highlighted was the recapture of lost single day guests .", "we already saw progress in this area through our focus and targeted offers prior to the covid - 19 crisis and it will continue to be a major focus going forward .", "the second element is organizational design .", "the purpose of this element is to enhance the guest and team member experience while creating cost efficiencies .", "we will reexamine what work belongs in the parks versus headquarters and eliminate any redundancy while being careful to protect the guest and team member experience .", "this
