tested client - first strategy and providing outstanding service to our advisors and their clients will guide us through uncertain economic and global conditions , in this case , in record - setting fashion .", "the record results we generated would not have been possible without everyone 's contribution .", "starting on slide four with our quarterly results .", "the fiscal fourth quarter capped off what was a record fiscal year on a number of fronts .", "the firm reported record quarterly net revenues of $ 2.7 billion and record quarterly net income of $ 429 million , or earnings per diluted share of $ 2.02 , which reflects the impact of the three for two stock split in september .", "excluding the $ 10 million of acquisition - related expenses , quarterly adjusted net income was $ 437 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share equaled $ 2.06 .", "the increase in quarterly net revenues was largely driven by record investment banking revenues and record assets under management and related administrative fees , primarily due to higher private client group assets and fee - based accounts .", "annualized return on equity for the quarter was 21.3 % and adjusted annualized return on tangible common equity was 24.1 % , a very impressive result , especially in the near zero -rate environment and given our strong capital position .", "we ended the quarter with record total client assets under administration of $ 1.18 trillion , up 27 % on a year -

over - year compression in the bank 's net interest margin .", "sequentially , net revenues grew 4 % due to higher asset balances during the quarter .", "the pre-tax income growth year - over - year was due to the aforementioned revenue growth and lower bank loan provision for credit losses in the current quarter .", "compared to the preceding quarter , the bank 's pre-tax income declined largely due to a reserve release in the preceding quarter compared to a loan loss provision , primarily associated with the strong loan growth during the fiscal fourth quarter .", "looking at the fiscal year 2021 results on slide seven , we generated record net revenues of $ 9.76 billion , up 22 % over fiscal year 2020 and record net income of $ 1.4 billion , up 73 % over fiscal 2020 .", "excluding losses on the extinguishment of debt and acquisition -

over - year and 6 % sequentially , largely due to higher average mutual fund assets driving higher associated service fees .", "paul already discussed our record investment banking results this quarter .", "so let me touch on other revenues .", "other revenues of $ 74 million were up 35 % sequentially , primarily due to higher tax credit funds revenues .", "we also had $ 18 million of private equity valuation gains during the quarter of which approximately $ 5 million were attributable to non-controlling interest reflected in other expenses .", "clients ' domestic cash sweep balances , which are the primary source of funding for our interest - earning assets and the balances with third - party banks that generate rjbdp fees ended the quarter at a record $ 66.7 billion , up 6 % over the preceding quarter and representing 6.3 % of domestic pcg client assets .", "as we continue to experience growing cash balances and less demand from third - party banks during fiscal 2021 , $ 10.8 billion of client cash is being held in the client interest program at the broker dealer .", "over time that cash could be redeployed to our bank or third - party banks as capacity becomes available , which would hopefully earn a higher spread than we currently earn on short - term treasuries .", "on slide 12 , it was great to see an 8 % sequential increase in the combined net interest income and bdp fees from third - party banks to $ 198 million .", "this growth was largely attributable to strong asset growth and a resilient net interest margin at raymond james bank , which remained right at 1.92 % for the quarter .", "we expect the bank 's nim to settle right around 1.9 % over the next couple of quarters .", "the average yield on rjbdp balances with third - party banks remained flat at 29 basis points in the quarter .", "if banks demand for deposits does n't improve from current levels , we believe there will be downward pressure on this yield in fiscal 2022 , especially in the back half of the fiscal year , which is why we have been so focused on generating on - balance sheet growth in assets that could deliver good risk - adjusted returns .", "moving to consolidated expenses on slide 13 .", "first our largest expense compensation .", "the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from 67.2 % to 65.8 % largely due to record revenues in the capital markets segment , which had a very low 52 % compensation ratio during the quarter .", "given our current revenue mix and disciplined management of expenses , we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of 70 % or lower in this near - zero short - term interest rate environment .", "and as we experienced in fiscal 2021 , we can do meaningfully better than 70 % with capital markets revenues at or near these record levels , which is our expectation for at least the next quarter or two .", "non-compensation expenses of $ 361 million decreased 15 % sequentially , primarily driven by the $ 98 million loss , on extinguishment of debt in the fiscal third quarter .", "somewhat offsetting this favorable variance , we had a modest provision for credit losses during the quarter , compared with a bank loan loss reserve release in the fiscal third quarter .", "overall , our results in fiscal 2021 show , we have remained focused on managing controllable expenses , while still investing in growth and ensuring high service levels for advisors and their clients .", "while we are still finalizing our fiscal 2022 budget , we do expect expenses to increase meaningfully in fiscal 2022 , for a variety of reasons .", "first and foremost , we are going to continue investing in people and technology , to support the phenomenal growth of our business over the past year , ensuring we maintain very high service levels and leading technology solutions for advisors and their clients .", "we also expect business development expenses to pick - up , as travel recognition trips and conferences have already started resuming in the fiscal first quarter , which our advisors and associates are really excited about .", "just as a reminder , business development expenses totaled about $ 200 million in fiscal 2019 , before the start of the pandemic .", "additionally , whereas we had a $ 32 million net benefit for credit losses in fiscal 2021 , we would expect bank loan loss provisions for credit losses associated with net loan growth , in fiscal 2022 .", "slide 14 shows the pre-tax margin trend over the past five quarters .", "pre-tax margin was 20.8 % in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 .", "and adjusted pre-tax margin was 21.2 % , which was boosted by record revenues and still relatively subdued business development expenses .", "at our analyst and investor day in june , we outlined a pre-tax margin target of 15 % to 16 % in this near - zero interest rate environments .", "and right now , we believe , the top end of that range is an appropriate target given the aforementioned expense growth , we currently expect in fiscal 2022 .", "but , as we experienced during the fiscal year , there is a meaningful upside to our margins , when capital markets revenues are as strong as they have been in fiscal 2021 .", "on slide 15 , at the end of the quarter , total assets were approximately $ 61.9 billion an 8 % sequential increase , reflecting solid growth of loans at raymond james bank as well as a substantial increase in client cash balances being held on the balance sheet .", "liquidity and capital remained very strong .", "the total capital ratio of 26.2 % and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.6 % are both over double the regulatory requirements to be well capitalized , giving us significant flexibility to continue being opportunistic and grow the business .", "you can see that rjf corporate cash at the parent ended the quarter at $ 1.15 billion , decreasing 26 % during the quarter , as we have restricted the cash that we plan on using to close on the charles stanley acquisition , which we currently expect to close in the first or second quarter of fiscal 2022 , for as soon as we receive the requisite regulatory approvals .", "slide 16 provides a summary of our capital actions , over the past five quarters .", "during the fiscal year , we repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares , split adjusted for $ 118 million .", "as of october 27th , $ 632 million remained under the current share repurchase authorization .", "due to the restrictions following our announced acquisition of tristate capital holdings , we do not expect to repurchase common shares until after closing .", "lastly , on slide 17 , we provide key credit metrics for raymond james bank .", "the credit quality of the bank 's loan portfolio remains healthy with most trends continuing to improve .", "criticized loans declined and non-performing assets remain low at just 20 basis points .", "the bank loan loss provision of $ 5 million was primarily driven by strong loan growth during the quarter .", "the bank loan allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans held for investment , declined from 1.34 % in the preceding quarter to 1.27 % at quarter end .", "for the corporate portfolios these allowances are higher at around 2.25 % .", "overall , i 'm very pleased with our fantastic results for this quarter and the fiscal year , which exceeded many records .", "as for our outlook , we are well positioned entering fiscal 2022 with strong capital ratios , quarter -
