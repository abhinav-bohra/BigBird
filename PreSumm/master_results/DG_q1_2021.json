over - year growth in nonconsumable sales moderated in comparison to march , they were positive overall despite a more challenging lap .", "overall , each of our three nonconsumable categories delivered a comp sales increase for the quarter .", "of note , comp sales growth of 11.3 % in our combined nonconsumable categories and 29.8 % on a comparable 2 - year stack basis significantly exceeded our expectation and speaks to the continued strength and sustained momentum in these product categories , enhanced by the benefit from stimulus .", "once again this quarter , we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales as measured by syndicated data .", "importantly , we continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers acquired over the past several quarters and are working hard to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives .", "in addition , we recently published our third annual serving others report , which provides context related to our ongoing esg efforts as well as new and updated performance metrics , and we look forward to continued progress on our journey as we move ahead .", "collectively , our first quarter results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long -

over - year gross margin rate expansion .", "this increase was primarily attributable to : higher initial markups on inventory purchases , a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales , a greater proportion of sales coming from our nonconsumables categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales .", "these factors were partially offset by increased transportation costs , which were primarily driven by higher rates .", "sg&a as a percentage of sales was 22 % , an increase of 152 basis points .", "this increase was driven by expenses that were greater as a percentage of net sales , the most significant of which were store occupancy costs , disaster expenses related to winter storm uri , retail labor and depreciation and amortization .", "moving down the income statement .", "operating profit for the first quarter increased 4.9 % to $ 908.9 million .", "as a percentage of sales , operating profit was 10.8 % , an increase of 56 basis points .", "our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22 % and compares to 22.2 % in the first quarter last year .", "finally , earnings per share for the first quarter increased 10.2 % to $ 2.82 , which reflects a compound annual growth rate of 38 % over a 2 -

through rates in more clear and sensitive nonconsumables categories .", "as we move through 2021 , we expect pressure in our gross margin rate as we anticipate a less favorable sales mix , an increase in markdown rates as we cycle abnormally low levels we saw in 2020 and higher fuel and transportation costs .", "also , please keep in mind the second and third quarters represent our most challenging laps of the year from a gross margin rate perspective , following improvements of 167 basis points in q2 2020 and 178 basis points in q3 2020 .", "with regards to sg&a , while we continue to expect ongoing expenses related to the pandemic in 2021 , overall , we currently anticipate a significant reduction in covid -

distribution of frozen and refrigerated products .", "the primary objective of dg fresh is to reduce product cost on these items , and we continue to be very pleased with the savings we are seeing .", "in fact , dc fresh continues to be the largest contributor to the gross margin benefit we are realizing from higher initial markups on inventory purchases .", "and we expect this benefit to grow as we continue to optimize our network and further leverage our scale .", "another important goal of dg fresh is to increase sales in these categories , and we are pleased with the success we are seeing on this front , driven by higher overall in -

capacity cooler counts , an extended queue line and a broader product assortment , including nci , a larger health and beauty section with about 30 % more feet of selling space and produce in select stores .", "we are especially pleased with the sales productivity of these larger formats as average sales per square foot are currently trending about 15 % above an average traditional store , which bodes well for the future as we look to grow these unit counts in the years ahead .", "in total , we expect more than 550 of our real estate projects this year will be in these formats as we look to further enhance our value and convenience proposition while driving additional growth .", "next , our digital initiative , which is an important complement to our brick -
