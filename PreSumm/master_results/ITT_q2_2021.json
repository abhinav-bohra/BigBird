time non-recurring item , adjusted free cash flow was $ 131 million .", "the decline compared to prior year was the result of higher operating income generation in the segments that was more than offset by strategic investments in working capital to support growing customer demand .", "wrapping up , our ittans [ phonetic ] around the world delivered another outstanding performance in q2 .", "organic growth was strong across all three segments and we converted to higher sales at good margins .", "we generated over 400 basis points of productivity while investing for future growth and successfully navigated challenging market conditions ; and our nearly 50 % organic growth in orders position itt for a strong second half .", "motion technologies ' q2 organic revenue growth of 64 % was primarily driven by strength in auto .", "as you know , the second quarter of last year was down significantly , due to the pandemic .", "however , friction continued to outperform global auto production by a very wide margin .", "and from an operating standpoint , our oe business performed very well , with 99 % - plus on - time performance .", "this was a key reason mt 's revenue eclipsed pre-covid levels in the second quarter of 2019 by 8 % .", "the strong orders growth in mt , this quarter , was a combination of both auto and valve , where we continue to gain share .", "segment margin expanded 660 basis points versus prior year to 18.8 % , mainly due to higher volumes and productivity , offset by the impact of higher raw material costs for steel , tin , and copper .", "as we indicated last year , mt 's margins declined sequentially in the second quarter , given the increasing commodities pressure .", "however , mt delivered almost 30 % incremental margin , in spite of these headwinds .", "wolverine sales growth was over 60 % , driven by oe shims in north america and europe , and in sealings , while koni grew by double digits organically .", "margins in wolverine , koni and axtone were all double digits in the quarter .", "for industrial process , revenue was up 8 % organically .", "this was driven partially by an easy prior - year comparison , stemming from steep declines in project shipments , which resulted in over 50 % revenue growth this quarter .", "we also saw minor short - cycle declines , driven by lower service sales and flat growth in baseline pumps , due to the materials ' shortage .", "as we have indicated , given the order trends we see across ip , we continue to expect the short - cycle businesses to accelerate in the second half .", "from an end market perspective , growth was spread across general industrial , oil and gas , and chemical markets .", "ip grew 18 % organically and 7 % sequentially , due to the short cycle ; namely , parts , valves and service .", "our daily order rates continue to be strong into the third quarter .", "orders in all product categories , except baseline pumps , were above 2019 levels , and the month of june was our largest month of project orders since 2015 .", "we believe this positions us well for the remainder of 2021 .", "ip 's margin expanded 100 basis points to 14.7 % , with an incremental margin of 24 % .", "this was partially impacted by unfavorable mix , given the higher proportion of project versus short - cycle sales .", "we expect the mix to improve from here as short cycle continues to recover .", "lastly , in connect and control technologies , we continued to turn the corner with incremental margins of 37 % this quarter .", "this was the result of continued volume leverage and strong productivity , despite inflationary headwinds and continued declines in commercial aerospace , while oe production continues to improve our largest aerospace customers and managing through elevated inventory levels on key platforms which will delay a significant recovery in aero components demand until 2022 .", "similar to the rest of itt , orders growth was incredibly strong , driven by our connector business , with continued north american distribution strength and growth in aerospace oe and aftermarket .", "the book to bill was largely above 1 and backlog was up 16 % compared to year - end 2020 , which again position us well heading into 2022 .", "before we move on , just a few additional comments on earnings per share for the quarter .", "as you can see on the q2 adjusted earnings per share walk on slide 11 , the year - over - year comparisons were negatively impacted by prior - year benefits , related to environmental , temporary cost actions , and cares act credits .", "partially offsetting these items was a roughly $ 0.03 benefit from foreign currency , consistent with our outlook , and a roughly $ 0.01 benefit from a lower - than - planned effective tax rate of 21.5 % .", "on july 1 , itt divested 100 % of its equity of a subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets to delticus , a portfolio company of warburg pincus .", "at closing , itt contributed $ 398 million in cash and delticus contributed $ 60 million in cash to intelco .", "as a result of the transaction , itt removed all asbestos obligations , related insurance assets , and associated deferred tax assets from our consolidated balance sheet as of the second quarter .", "the benefits of this transaction include the indemnification for all legacy asbestos liabilities and stronger free cash flow generation in the absence of asbestos - related payments that we previously estimated at $ 20 million to $ 30 million per year on average over the next 10 years , prior to the divestiture .", "additionally , the transaction freeze up management time and resources to focus more on growing the core business and executing other more strategic initiatives , including esg and m&a .", "coupled with our successful u.s. pension plans transfer executed in october 2020 , we are well positioned to grow with a flexible balance sheet and without the risks and uncertainty of managing these legacy liabilities .", "as we saw in friction 's results , global auto production is increasing , albeit constrained by the global semiconductor shortage which is causing inventory levels to remain low .", "and while we expect demand will remain strong throughout 2021 , the impact of higher raw material prices will weigh on margins and adjusted earnings per share during the second half .", "the growth we 're seeing in ip orders is mainly in short cycle .", "on projects , however , we continue to expect the large project spend , particularly in oil and gas , will not fully recover until 2022 .", "in the meantime , we 're seeing continued momentum in weekly run rates in our short - cycle businesses in industrial process and connectors , which we believe will drive organic revenue growth to a new range of 8 % to 10 % for the year .", "our assumption regarding commercial aerospace is that a substantial recovery will not occur until early 2022 , given the level of inventory at our largest oe customers .", "however , we see encouraging signs in orders , as production levels continue to increase .", "our outlook for adjusted segment margin remains at approximately 17.1 % at the midpoint .", "we expect a pronounced impact from raw material inflation , mainly in motion technologies .", "however , our teams are driving commercial actions and additional productivity to minimize the impact .", "we 're planning for raw materials to remain at these elevated levels throughout 2021 .", "as you will see on slide 7 , our revised guidance assuming the incremental impact from this trend will be $ 0.09 at the high - end for the remainder of 2021 .", "our revised adjusted earnings per share guidance reflects an $ 0.08 improvement at the midpoint of our range , eclipsing 2019 levels and our previous high end .", "the net impact of all other items is roughly $ 0.01 benefit to full - year adjusted eps , including a slightly lower - than - planned effective tax rate .", "foreign currency and other items will be a minor benefit , compared to our previous guidance .", "and we continue to expect a 1 % reduction in the weighted average share count , given our share repurchases to date .", "additionally , we are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $ 5 million at the low - and high - ends of our previous range to reflect the higher operating income generated in the first half , offset by further working capital investments to support future growth , especially given the supply chain disruptions we are experiencing today .", "in summary , we are again raising our outlook for 2021 across sales , earnings and free cash flow .", "and with this raise , we now expect to eclipse 2019 levels in terms of adjusted segment margin and adjusted earnings per share .", "as you can see , the majority of the improvement in adjusted earnings per share is operational in nature .", "the higher volumes will likely be partially offset by incremental headwinds from rising raw material costs , which we have already discussed ; the remaining changes to our outlook are rather immaterial .", "from an end market perspective , the trends we saw in the second quarter have remained largely consistent throughout july .", "auto and the short cycle businesses in ip continue to perform well and cct remains comfortably on path to recovery from both a sales and margin perspective .", "on the other hand , our outlook reflects increased commodity pressure and we do not see any near - term improvements related to the supply chain .", "organic sales growth is expected to be in the mid-teens range , driven by growth across the portfolio and led by mp 's strong performance .", "ip and cct should both improve to approximately high - single - digit organic growth , driven by short cycle .", "segment margin should be approximately flat sequentially to q2 and above prior year , even with the significant raw material headwinds we anticipate primarily in mt . this negative impact on mt 's margin will largely be offset by margin improvements in cct , followed by industrial process .", "despite the margin challenges in q3 , we still expect all three businesses to be up over 100 basis points for the full year , which will eclipse itt 's segment margin for 2019 .", "the combined impact of higher sales and strong productivity will drive adjusted earnings -
