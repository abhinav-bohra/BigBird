day strike in the srp business .", "it should be noted that while we removed strike - related costs from segment earnings , segment revenues also declined nearly $ 140 million versus the first quarter due to plant outages and resulting production declines .", "no adjustments were made for these revenue headwinds .", "despite the short - term impacts to 2021 performance , we achieved the needed long - term cost structure changes that will help srp compete more effectively in the specialty materials marketplace .", "sticking with the aa&s segment , our precision rolled strip business in asia continues to operate at robust levels with revenues in line with its record -

end holiday season .", "our sa&c business will likely have marginally lower sequential earnings due to its traditional third quarter preventive maintenance outages .", "it 's worth noting that second quarter corporate costs and closed company expenses were elevated compared to prior year and prior quarter .", "corporate costs were above prior year largely due to incentive compensation accruals and higher than the prior quarter , mainly due to foreign exchange losses .", "closed company expenses were above first quarter and prior year , primarily due to nonrepeating benefits in both prior periods .", "as we 've discussed over the past several quarters , our decisive 2020 cost actions continue to benefit the business .", "they serve to limit decremental margins while year - over - year revenues declined .", "we fully expect them to benefit the bottom line when revenues return to year - over - year growth .", "the hpmc segment 's second quarter results offer a preview of what is expected in future quarters .", "while hpmc revenues were flat versus prior year , earnings grew 30 % .", "we achieved this earnings growth largely as a result of increasing production rates at many segment facilities coupled with streamlined cost structures .", "however , we still have room to improve .", "some facilities such as our nickel powder operations at bakers , north carolina , continue to operate on limited schedules due to low demand levels .", "while others still produce large quantities of lower -
