much as things change , one thing stays consistent , year in and year out we have and we 'll continue to deliver .", "2020 proved this , 2021 will be no different marking 19 years of consistent , predictable financial performance .", "as garrick highlighted , we 're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2021 .", "in summary , we delivered adjusted net income of $ 348 million or $ 1.21 per share .", "for comparative purposes , our first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $ 0.35 above our q1 , 2020 results , largely driven by rate relief , net of investment - related expenses , better weather and sustained cost performance from our 2020 efforts at the utility .", "our enterprises and parent and other segments were slightly down as planned due to the absence of a one - time cost reduction item in 2020 and higher funded -- funding related costs respectively .", "this modest negative variance was more than offset by strong origination growth at enerbank , which exceeded its q1 , 2020 earnings per share contribution by $ 0.06 in 2021 as planned and is tracking toward the high end of our guidance for the year of $ 0.22 per share .", "the waterfall chart on slide 10 provides more detail on the key year - to - date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 and highlights our latest estimates for the major year - to - go drivers to meet our 2021 earnings per share guidance range .", "to elaborate on the year - to - date performance , while weather in the first quarter of 2020 has been below normal to - date , which has led to lower volumetric gas sales , it has been better than the historically warm winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2020 .", "and the absence of that weather has led to $ 0.08 per share of positive variance period - over - period .", "from a rates perspective , given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses , we 're seeing $ 0.26 per share of positive variance .", "as a reminder , our rate relief estimates are stated net of investment related costs , such as depreciation and amortization , property taxes and funding costs .", "it is also worth noting that our 2021 financials reflect the accelerated amortization of deferred taxes , as part of our 2020 gas rate order settlement .", "on the cost side as noted during our fourth quarter earnings call , we budgeted substantial increases in our operating and maintenance expenses in 2021 versus the prior year to fund key initiatives around safety , reliability , customer experience and decarbonization and in alignment with our recent rate orders .", "as you can see , we 're $ 0.02 per share above our spend rate in the first quarter of 2020 as planned , and i 'm pleased to report that we 're seeing sustained cost performance from 2020 , as well as increased productivity in 2021 , largely attributable to the ce way .", "that said , we do expect to see the bulk of the planned o&m increases to materialize later in the year .", "the balance of our year - to - date performance is driven by the aforementioned drivers at our non-utility segment and non-weather sales , which though slightly down at about 1 % below the first quarter 2020 continue to exhibit favorable mix with the higher margin residential class , up 2 % versus q1 of 2020 .", "and i 'll remind you that our total electric sales exclude one large low margin customer .", "as we look ahead to the remaining nine months of 2021 , we are cautiously optimistic about the glide path illustrated on this slide to achieve our full year earnings per share guidance .", "as always , we plan for normal weather , which in this case translates to $ 0.12 per share of negative variance given the above normal weather experienced in the second and third quarters of 2020 .", "the residual impact of the aforementioned rate relief , which equates to $ 0.22 per share of pickup and is not subject to any further mpsc actions .", "and the continued execution of our operational and customer - related projects , which we estimate as an incremental $ 0.18 per share of spend versus the comparable period in 2020 .", "we have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility , non-weather sales and our non-utility segments .", "all in , we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the remaining three quarters of 2021 .", "and needless to say , we will be prepared to flex costs up or down , as the fact pattern evolves over the course of the year .", "as we look out over the long term , we are in the early stages of executing our $ 13.2 billion five - year customer investment plan at the utility , which is highlighted on slide 11 and will provide significant benefits for our customers , the communities we serve and our investors .", "as a reminder , we have budgeted over $ 2.5 billion of investments in 2021 .", "the vast majority of which is earmarked for safety , reliability and clean energy projects .", "we are on track thus far , and recently filed an electric rate case in march that enumerate our customer investment priorities for the 2022 test year , which are summarized on the right hand side of the page among other key details related to the filing .", "we expect an order from the commission by the end of the year .", "despite the substantial customer investments that we intend to make on our electric and gas system over the next several years , as you know we take great pride in taking out costs in a sustainable way to maintain affordable bills for our customers , and we have the track record to prove it .", "the left hand side of slide 12 summarizes the key components of our cost structure , which we have successfully managed over the past several years , while investing significant capital on behalf of customers .", "in fact from 2017 to 2019 , we reduced utility bills , as a percentage of customer wallet by 1 % , while investing roughly $ 19 billion of capital in the utility over that timeframe .", "as we look ahead , we have several highly actionable event driven cost reduction opportunities , which will provide substantial savings in the years to come .", "the planned expiration of our palisades power purchase agreement and the recently approved amendment to our mcv ppa will collectively generate roughly $ 150 million of power supply cost recovery savings .", "and as you 'll note , our initial estimates for the potential savings for the mcv contract amendment of approximately $ 50 million proved conservative with the revised estimate of over $ 60 million in savings , per the commission 's order in march .", "also the planned retirements of our five remaining coal unit should provide another $ 90 million of savings in aggregate , exclusive of any potential fuel cost savings , which will create meaningful headroom and bills for future customer investments .", "lastly , i 'd be remiss if i did n't mention our annual o&m productivity delivered through the ce way , which last year generated roughly $ 45 million of savings and serves as a critical tool to our long term and intra-year financial planning .", "to that end , many of you 've asked about proposed changes in corporate tax policy and its potential impact to our plan .", "though at this point , the final details remain unclear , trust that we are evaluating the potential effects and we 'll leverage the ce way and other cost reduction opportunities , including potential offsetting tax credits that are also being proposed , as part of the legislation to minimize the impact to customers , while executing our capital plan .", "as we 've said before , it is our job to do the warring for you , and we are uniquely positioned over the next several years to manage any potential headwinds .", "with our unparalleled track record on cost management , driven by our highly engaged workforce coupled with a robust customer investment backlog and top tier regulatory construct , we are confident that we can deliver on our ambitious , operational , customer and financial objectives for the foreseeable future .", "and with that we 'll move to q&a .", "mr. racho , please open the lines ."], "summary_gold": "compname announces first quarter earnings results of $ 1.21 per share , reaffirms 2021
