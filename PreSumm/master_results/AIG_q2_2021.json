income securities .", "the fee structure is 30 basis points on the initial $ 50 billion of aum , increasing to 45 basis points for the annual new aum of $ 8.5 billion , starting four quarters later as well as for the reinvested run-off aum .", "therefore , fee should rise from 30 basis points initially toward 43 basis points by the end of the initial six - year contractor for blackstone 's share of the assets .", "for this part of our portfolio , it 's fair to expect that fees will somewhat precede the benefits of the impact of enhanced origination and differentiated asset classes and recognition of related yield uplift .", "we believe this sma arrangement is unique and that l&r maintains control over its overall asset allocation , asset liability management , liquidity and credit profile , and the nature of individual investment structures .", "in addition , life and retirement has the opportunity to enhance overall investment management , focusing on improving efficiencies and asset classes that are not part of the sma as well as optimizing performance across our whole portfolio .", "we believe the combination of these efficiencies , together with the blackstone focus on maximizing the performance of sma assets and growth opportunities on the overall aum , should drive net yield uplift .", "before leaving the blackstone transaction , i want to note that a gaap loss on sale is anticipated with a 9.9 % equity purchase by blackstone as well as with subsequent ipo sell - downs due to the inclusion of oci and gaap book value .", "given that oci in future periods is also subject to some market fluctuations , the impact cannot be fully estimated at this time .", "as respects affordable housing , note that the $ 5.1 billion purchase price translates to an approximate $ 3 billion after -

basis - point improvement in the accident year ex cat combined ratio over the prior - year quarter .", "the international commercial segment has continued to improve profitability with 370 basis points improvement compared to the prior - year quarter .", "this shows demonstrable margin improvement stemming from the totality of the actions enumerated earlier .", "and this level of global commercial improvement is also noteworthy global commercial made of 71 % of worldwide net premiums written through the first half of 2021 .", "additionally , the global commercial book is increasingly becoming a global specialty book comprised of below - frequency , high - severity coverages .", "as a result , general insurance commercial , although large and global in scope , it 's not a mere index of the market , but instead an underwriting company , where risk selection and business mix are important factors in achieving profit and growth while mitigating volatility .", "as we noted on our first quarter earnings call , our year - over - year net premium written comparison for the second quarter would improve , given the timing of the initial covid - 19 impact and distortions from syndicate 2019 that 's being reflected also during the second quarter of 2020 .", "global personal lines net premiums written grew by approximately 45 % or 41 % on a constant dollar basis , aided by the syndicate 2019 comparison .", "elsewhere within this segment , the second quarter of 2021 north america personal insurance saw premiums in travel and warranty business increase .", "this was driven by a rebound in travel activity and increased consumer spending but not yet back to the pre-pandemic levels .", "our outlook for net premiums written for the next six months in north america personal insurance is between the $ 450 million and $ 500 million per quarter .", "we continue to anticipate earned margin expansion throughout 2021 and into 2022 , resulting from aig 's favorable underwriting actions we 've taken in global market conditions involving the strong rate increases well above loss trend , improved terms and conditions and a more profitable , less volatile mix .", "given the specific market dynamics of where we choose to play , we do n't foresee any material slowing - down in the cheaper rate levels throughout the balance of the year .", "and now i 'd like to comment a bit on inflation , which one needs to think about in terms of both economic and social inflation .", "based on the consumer price index and the producer price index , headline inflation that indicates an annualized runrate of about 5.5 % to 7.5 % , which has accelerated in march .", "some components of the indices have become worrisome , such as used cars and trucks being up about 45 % and energy commodities being north of 40 % .", "but medical care services , whose impact now stretches across most casualty , auto , workers ' compensation and excess placements , although higher , are much more tame than the headline inflation that would indicate with physician services up about 4 % recently and hospital services up about 2.5 % .", "costs involving labor , materials , construction and related services are up and will impact property coverages and cat claim costs in the near term .", "these indications demonstrate that the inflationary impact on any given insurer is a direct function of the products and the mix they write and where they play within our insurance program .", "social inflation , however , is much more of a u.s. - centric phenomenon , driven by a highly litigious culture .", "some social inflation also has correlations to the social change initiatives that are -- including income inequality and changing sentiments toward business , to name a few .", "being further away from risk though is a meaningful inflation counter .", "and aig 's general insurance has taken strong pre-emptive action in that regard by minimizing lead umbrellas in favor of higher positions within insurance programs .", "for example , our excess casualty average attachment points for national and corporate u.s. accounts have also increased approximately 3.5 times and 5.5 times , respectively , since 2018 .", "this significantly increased distance from attaching is a key overall portfolio benefit .", "view toward the total inflation rate of 4 % to 5 % is arguably reasonable for the near to medium term .", "our second - quarter rate increases , together with our view of pricing for the rest of the year provide continued margin in excess of this loss cost trend .", "now turning to life and retirement .", "when compared with the prior year , favorable equity markets drove higher alternative investment returns , principally higher than private equity returns , which reflect the impact of the one quarter lag on the period .", "life insurance continues to reflect the covid -
