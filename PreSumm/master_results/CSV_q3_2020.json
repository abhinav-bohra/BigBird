size - fits - all scripts to follow but rather trust in our people to generate good ideas and then go out and perform .", "the results from that approach are often viewed in terms of financial metrics , like ebitda and eps .", "however , behind those numbers and trends is a team of uniquely talented individuals .", "managing partners and their teams , who we reference often , absolutely lead that performance .", "and whatever they -- and what they do in the non-pandemic environment is special to watch .", "now behind the scenes , supporting those managing partners and their teams is an equally impressive group , who have also risen to numerous challenges this year .", "whether it's our it team quickly rolling out live streaming tools and remote document execution options to help keep our families and employees safe ; or our field operations support team , jumping in to assist our businesses with around - the - clock administrative support when those businesses become shorthanded ; or our hr , risk management and legal professionals , partnering together to oversee and manage a 24 - hour hotline to ensure any question our frontline professionals have had during this pandemic is answered immediately , the collaboration , selflessness and problem solving demonstrated by these teams have put the work of each one of these behind - the - scenes professionals front and center within carriage .", "now most public companies have some version of a support center .", "whether it 's referred to as headquarters or simply corporate , the idea of a single location , where traditional back - office functions take place , is certainly not a novel one .", "with that said , what makes carriage 's support team stand out is the fact that the same philosophy of entrepreneurship and autonomy that drives our decentralized model and the approach and success of our managing partners extends to our support center teams .", "the formula is simple , find the very best talent and then put them in a position to do what they do best .", "this includes allowing leaders at all levels to act quickly with authority and without the need for time - consuming meetings and layers of approvals , which , at best , delay and , at worst , destroy progress , improvement and growth .", "as it relates to our legal team , i have the privilege to work with professionals who bring much more than impressive and diverse legal backgrounds to the table .", "i often tell mel that our in - house attorneys take great pride in being consulted on business matters , not just legal issues .", "we intentionally provide our attorneys with financials , weekly performance updates by business , weekly cash debt balance activity and other critical financial metrics .", "the goal behind providing all this data , that some may believe is reserved for operations , finance and accounting teams , is so our attorneys can continuously dig deeper into learning more about our businesses and understand what ultimately drives the results we release each quarter and then apply that knowledge to how they provide guidance and make decisions .", "that purposeful financial focus and ownership mindset truly result in our attorneys serving much more as business partners , who just happen to have a legal background , than simply as lawyers .", "we frequently have discussions about big - picture strategic objectives and capital deployment .", "and their feedback and thinking not only contribute to ultimate decision - making , but just as importantly further enhance and guide the support they provide each day .", "our legal team and many of their support center colleagues invest a significant amount of time in proactive , continuous learning about not only the business but the financial drivers .", "and as a result , they have great awareness and ownership in the financial health and growth of their company .", "for example , in explaining the financial impact of a proactive matter one of our attorneys has been working on for some time , he recently briefed me by saying , \" steve , that recovery is going to come in around $ 0.01 a share \" .", "his reference to our earnings per share metric was not unusual , it 's a language and a perspective that is used often .", "and it 's a great example of the work they do to understand our financials in the mindset applied to spending and decision - making throughout our company .", "now i share all of this regarding the carriage entrepreneurial philosophy and ownership mindset extending to our support teams to tie back to the incredible work performed during this pandemic for a couple of reasons .", "first , when things initially became uncertain and the challenges unprecedented back in march , our teams in the field and here at the support center were already well - equipped , prepared and most importantly empowered to act quickly , responsibly and wisely .", "and second , the ownership mindset shared by leaders here in the support center creates an environment where they 're encouraged to not just fill a function but to ask questions , think strategically and act confidently when a time - sensitive pivot may be called for .", "this pandemic has required the full complement of collective talent within our team .", "and they have exceeded the already high expectations that they set for themselves .", "as a company , we talk a lot about the entrepreneurial spirit that drives our business .", "and i have the good fortune to see it in action every day , not only in the work performed by our frontline professionals but also by our support center team .", "i know i speak for our legal team as well as our support center colleagues when i say it is an absolute privilege for all of us to have the opportunity to work with and support our managing partners and each of the frontline leaders who serve our families every day during the most challenging of circumstances .", "so if anybody out there takes ben up on his invitation to come and visit , we 'll introduce you to some of steve 's dragon slayers .", "and you 'll see exactly what we mean by that .", "so two days ago , shawn phillips and i got an email .", "we got that email from dewayne cain .", "dewayne is the founder of rest haven in dallas .", "and it reads as follows , \" wednesday , october 28 , marks our one year anniversary \" .", "so he 's referencing one year ago today , when we closed the day before the acquisition of rest haven , which was founded 50 years ago by dewayne .", "the email said as follows , \" my decision to form a partnership with carriage was the third -
