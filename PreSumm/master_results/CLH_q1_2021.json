kleen branches into the legacy environmental services sales and service regions .", "we expect this change to strengthen our allocation of resources , whether that is people , trucks or equipment .", "we also expect this to reduce third - party spend , generate even greater cross-selling opportunities across all our environmental lines of business and it also enables efficiency gains in routing and network consolidation .", "the second change we made was to combine all the pieces of our sustainable lubricants business .", "our newly formed safety -
