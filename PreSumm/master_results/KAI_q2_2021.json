the following : $ 1.15 due to higher revenue , $ 0.08 due to higher gross margin percentage and $ 0.05 due to lower interest expense .", "these increases were partially offset by $ 0.27 due to higher operating expenses , $ 0.04 due to a decrease in the amounts received from government assistance programs and $ 0.02 due to higher weighted average shares outstanding .", "collectively , included in all the categories i just mentioned , was a favorable foreign currency translation effect of $ 0.16 in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of last year due to the weakening of

730 million .", "the majority of this increase is organic with approximately 1/3 of the revenue range increase related to the addition of clouth .", "we anticipate that revenue in the fourth quarter will be the strongest for the year due to both strong capital project activity and our recent acquisition .", "for the third quarter , we anticipate revenue between $ 195 million to $ 200 million and for the fourth quarter revenue of $ 220 million to $ 225 million .", "for the third quarter , if we exclude the additional revenue from clouth , we anticipate revenue will be down compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to the projected timing of revenue recognition on capital projects .", "as mentioned earlier , this guidance is , of course , predicated on the pandemic and supply chain issues having little impact on our customers ' activities or the delivery of shipments to them .", "we now anticipate gross margins for the year will come in at approximately 42.5 % , down from our prior estimate of 43 % , principally , as a result of including the amortization of the acquired profit and inventory related to our clouth acquisition .", "as i have noted on the last two calls , the mix will be more weighted toward capital in the second half of the year , especially in the fourth quarter .", "as a result , we anticipate gross margins will be 42 % in the second half of the year ,

fourth quarter .", "we now anticipate that sg&a expenses as a percentage of revenue will be lower than we projected at the beginning of the year and will be approximately 26 % of revenue for the full year 2021 .", "this includes backlog amortization expense of approximately $ 400,000 or $ 0.03 in the third quarter .", "our interest expense will be approximately $ 1.3 million per quarter in the second half of 2021 due to the incremental borrowings related to our recent acquisition .", "we anticipate the tax rate for the year will be approximately 28 % and the third and fourth quarter of ' 21 , approximately 28.5 % to 29 % .", "we anticipate that our adjusted earnings per share will be lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021 due to several factors , including a lower anticipated gross margin percentage versus the second quarter and the lack of payments received from government programs that contributed $ 0.10 to the second quarter results .", "i hope these directional comments will help provide insight into how we see our current business environment .", "before concluding my remarks , i wanted to comment on our first quarter 2021 results .", "we have
