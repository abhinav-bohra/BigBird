term incentive compensation reversals in the third quarter of 2019 .", "this was largely offset by revitalization cost savings and lower discretionary spend .", "as a result , underlying ebitda grew 0.5 % on a constant currency basis .", "underlying free cash flow of $ 1.160 million for the nine months ended september 30 , 2020 , was $ 275 million favorable to the prior year period driven by favorable working capital .", "the working capital benefit was driven by the deferral of over $ 200 million in tax payments from various government - sponsored payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic , of which we currently anticipate approximately half to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2020 , while the remaining amount to be paid beyond this fiscal year .", "in north america , net sales revenue decreased 0.8 % in constant currency , driven by financial volume declines of 4 % , reflecting lower brand volume .", "north america brand volumes decreased 5.2 % as the on- premise closures or limited capacity reopenings during the quarter more than offset the strength in both the u.s. and canada in the off - premise .", "also contributing to the decline was packaging constraints , which primarily impacted the economy and premium segments as we prioritize higher - margin skus .", "in the u.s. , brand volumes decreased 5.3 % compared to domestic shipment declines of 3.9 % in our efforts to address the year - to - date under shipment positions attributed to the aluminum can supply constraints .", "net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.6 % in constant currency , driven by net pricing increases in the u.s. and canada and favorable brand and package mix in the u.s. , partially offset by negative brand and channel mix in canada , attributed to the shift of volume from the on- premise to the off -

term compensation reversals in the third quarter of 2019 , as mentioned earlier .", "for europe , which is more heavily skewed toward the on- premise , net sales on a reported basis decreased 15.3 % in constant currency due to lower volumes and lower net sales per hectoliter , reflecting the impact from the coronavirus .", "net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis declined 5.9 % in constant currency , driven by unfavorable channel , brand and geographic mix , particularly in the high - margin u.k. business , partially offset by slightly higher net pricing .", "financial volumes decreased 7.7 % and brand volumes decreased 5.4 % , a significant improvement from the year - on - year declines experienced in the second quarter as more on -

premise .", "europe 's underlying ebitda decreased 8 % on a constant currency basis versus the prior year , driven by gross margin impact of volume declines and unfavorable geographic and channel mix , partially offset by lower mg&a expenses as a result of cost mitigation actions to navigate the coronavirus pandemic .", "which takes me to our financial outlook .", "on march 27 , we withdrew our guidance due to the uncertainty driven by the pandemic .", "with the rise in the new virus cases in both north america and europe , governments are mandating new closures , were imposing lockdowns to varying degrees , and thus , set uncertainty remains .", "as a result , we have not reinstated guidance but are providing additional visibility on forward trends and a perspective on how we believe we will be impacted by the coronavirus .", "we do not expect to continue to give this visibility once conditions have stabilized or we resume guidance .", "and we are very proud of our performance and agility in navigating the coronavirus pandemic and executing against our revitalization plan , but recognizing there are still headwinds ahead .", "the pandemic continues to impact our businesses due to on -
