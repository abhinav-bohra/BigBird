term transformational metrology deals , leveraging our differentiated platform , particularly in advanced metering infrastructure .", "in addition to big wins with england and in winston - salem which we mentioned last quarter , the team recently won another marquee project in columbus , ohio , worth $ 94 million .", "this customer is a combined utility , meaning we will provide both water and electricity meters plus advanced software and services .", "it 's worth noting how compelling our value proposition is for combined utilities , addressing both water and energy applications with one portfolio and leveraging our unique flexnet communication capability across both platforms to achieve economies of scale .", "the columbus , winston - salem and england deals have together added about $ 250 million to xylem 's backlog .", "our metrology and communications offerings are clearly differentiated in their own rights , but we also have the advantage of delivering unique value by combining infrastructure platforms with complementary digital solutions .", "each value proposition enhances the other .", "as anticipated , covid impacts are causing delays in some metrology projects where time lines have shifted to the right .", "and in parts of the u.s. , replacement meter installations have been pushed out in the short term .", "pipeline assessment services , a business that requires putting people on - site , has been affected by covid - driven restrictions on travel and field work .", "at the same time , the pace of interest in digital solutions for remote monitoring and automated operations has accelerated .", "the pandemic has not only spot - led essential services , it has also eliminated utilities need for much greater operational and financial resilience which is now at the top of every utility operators ' agenda .", "digital transformation has gone from being attractive to becoming an imperative , and that 's reflected in strong quoting activity in our digital solutions business which has also increased by 50 % its number of revenue - generating clients .", "the revenues are still a small part of our top line , but the acceleration of interest further strengthens our view on digital adoption in this sector .", "and as the number and size of those projects grow , we are seeing a broadening scope of opportunities across software , services and infrastructure products .", "while we do n't expect this to be a straight -

quarter performance .", "so mark , over to you .", "revenue declined 7 % which was better - than - anticipated as we entered the third quarter .", "we had strong performance in our wastewater utility businesses and the residential end market , both of which grew mid-single digits in the quarter .", "the return to growth in these markets was offset by the expected declines in our metrology project deployments and industrial and commercial businesses which continue to be impacted by project delays and site restrictions .", "geographically , as various countries have reopened and recovered , so has our business .", "in china , for example , we saw a very strong performance with double -

thirds weighted toward repair and replacement work which held up relatively well in the quarter despite shutdowns in some regions .", "industrial was affected by similar regional dynamics including site access restrictions and declined 7 % .", "a bright spot in the quarter was residential which grew 4 % .", "we saw a particularly strong growth across western europe and from china .", "overall , emerging markets declined 8 % in the quarter .", "china had a very strong performance , growing 23 % as the team executed well , delivering on pent -

19 restrictions push out our project revenues in our pipeline assessment services business .", "in metrology , we 've seen relative stability in our opex replacement business from water metrology products .", "as a reminder , our opex exposure accounts for about 70 % of our revenues .", "we 've seen much more variability in the 30 % of our metrology business that 's tied to large project deployments or capex , particularly in our gas segment , where project revenues were down 60 % in the quarter .", "here , we 've been significantly impacted by project timing , particularly from lapping a large gas metrology project deployment which was largely completed at the end of last year and delays in another large gas project this year due to home access restrictions .", "despite these challenges , our underlying north american water metrology book and bill business has remained relatively stable and commercial momentum in winning new projects remains robust .", "this is highlighted by the large contract wins we had in the first half of the year and continued into the third quarter with the columbus , ohio and winston - salem , north carolina wins .", "patrick already covered columbus , but i 'll quickly highlight a couple of important points on the winston - salem win .", "this is a $ 60 million contract to provide water metrology products under our network as a service offering , leveraging our flexnet communications network .", "importantly , our teams differentiated the value of our offering by introducing several components from our digital solutions platform , enabling our customer to also seamlessly address critical needs around non-revenue water and the wastewater network .", "our pipeline assessment services business has also been subject to significant near - term delays in project revenues driven by covid - 19 travel restrictions and site closures .", "as a reminder , there are two businesses within aia , digital solutions and pipeline assessment services .", "it 's in the latter business where we 've experienced deferrals of pipe inspection work .", "and we expect those pushouts to continue into early 2021 .", "as a result , we booked an accounting charge to reflect the impacts of those delays .", "we continue to strongly believe that the medium and long - term value proposition of this business is compelling , particularly as utilities move to address budget challenges by using pipeline assessment services to reduce future spend on pipe replacement .", "we expect the project timing for deploying new metrology projects and the covid - 19 - related delays in pipeline assessment services to continue to impact us through the fourth quarter .", "this is reflected in our fourth quarter guidance which sandy will cover later , as shippable backlog for the fourth quarter is down roughly 25 % .", "that said , it 's significant that we 've not had any project cancellations .", "rather , we 're seeing an acceleration of growth in our project pipelines , and we continue to win large new contracts .", "as a result , mcs shippable backlog in 2021 and beyond is up over 30 % which is a pretty good indication of the power we 're seeing with our digital platform .", "so while these projects are n't currently reflected in the orders metric , they are the latest in a series of important wins that give us confidence in the medium and long - term growth profile of this segment .", "ebitda margin in the segment was 14.8 % .", "the year - over - year margin decline was driven by lower revenues of high - margin north american metrology and pipeline assessment services due to project timing and covid - 19 .", "this impact was partially offset by 630 basis points of cost reduction in the quarter .", "we ended the quarter with approximately $ 1.6 billion of cash and short - term investments and $ 2.4 billion of liquidity driven by our very successful green bond issuance last quarter , combined with our strong cash flow performance throughout the year .", "in the face of substantial challenges presented by the pandemic , i 'm very proud of the work of our teams in managing all aspects of our working capital performance .", "at quarter end , working capital was 20.3 % of sales , representing an improvement of 30 basis points versus this time last year .", "the team 's focus on working capital , disciplined capex spending and cost control through the quarter have continued to pay off , enabling us to generate free cash flow of $ 234 million , a conversion rate of over 200 % in the quarter which did see some benefit from favorable timing on payments primarily related to taxes and interest .", "having worked with sandy previously , i was n't at all surprised by how quickly she 's come up to speed on our businesses and our markets and the pace with which she 's developed relationships , all virtually , and taken on the leadership of the global finance team over the past month .", "i could n't be more confident about the future of xylem or in sandy 's capability to help patrick and the team accomplish our mission and take the company 's performance to the next level .", "so with that , i 'll hand it back to patrick for the last time .", "before turning to our outlook , i just want to take a moment to reiterate two overall trends we 're seeing as we look forward .", "the first is the influence of regional differences around the world .", "so long as the impact of covid - 19 continues to influence demand , we believe those geographic effects will be considerable to at least the end of the year .", "xylem 's global diversification puts us in a strong position as we serve the international markets that are furthest along in the recovery curve .", "the second overall trend to highlight is a shift of attention from reactive operational imperatives to medium and longer - term resilience .", "the pressured utility space at the beginning of the pandemic are well known .", "you simply can't stop providing an essential service , even if you 're struggling to put crews in the field , and more end users than usual are having trouble paying their bills .", "our customers have come through the most intense part of the crisis serving their communities heroically .", "it 's also been a wake - up call for the sector .", "utilities leaders and operators have become acutely aware of the pressing need to invest in greater operational and financial resilience .", "part of that investment will go to conventional infrastructure .", "that will have to be combined with new approaches if utilities are to address their overarching challenges , making the cost of infrastructure more affordable , extending asset life and dramatically increasing labor efficiencies while maintaining safety .", "so we 've seen interest continue to ramp - up in digital transformation , remote monitoring , automated operations and smart infrastructure , more broadly .", "of course , the implications of digitizing utility network goes deeper than the software platforms in our digital solutions business .", "beyond software and end points , transformation also requires the digitally enabled pumps and drives that make up the backbone of a smarter network which is why we are implementing an integrated digital strategy across our entire portfolio .", "we 're very excited about the opportunity of working with our customers to build the digital water and energy networks that will carry their communities into the future .", "turning from those trends to outlook .", "in general , we have a much clearer view on q4 than we had on q3 .", "we were seeing stabilization in a number of markets .", "we have even greater supply chain confidence , and we 're executing well on cost , all of which leads us to expect quarter sequential improvement in margins .", "so by end market , i 'll start with our outlook for utilities .", "the wastewater side has been exceptionally resilient .", "we expect opex to continue holding up well given the need to service mission - critical applications .", "and capital projects with secured funding continue to move forward .", "on the clean water side , as i mentioned , we have strong commercial momentum with multiyear projects like anglin , winston - salem and columbus , setting us up for healthy growth in 2021 and beyond .", "in the short term , we expect performance to trail wastewater due to more pronounced covid impacts , but we 're not seeing structural changes in demand , and the growth profile of this segment is expected to remain highly attractive .", "we simply anticipate some continuing covid impacts on deployment timing .", "and standard meter replacements are likely to remain soft until physical distancing eases .", "looking at industrial and commercial end markets , the accessibility of industrial sites varies widely by region .", "where covid response has lagged , there have been site access restrictions , and work has been deferred .", "so we 're still anticipating softness to the fourth quarter , especially in north america construction and industrial markets , affecting our dewatering business .", "and in commercial , it 's a mixed picture that varies by end customer .", "demand in hospitals , data centers and apartment buildings , for example , is very different than for offices and hotels .", "but less building use overall and soft north america construction suggest continued softness in the near term .", "now , i have the great pleasure of turning over to sandy for the first time so she can provide some more specifics on our q4 guidance .", "i just want to kick off by expressing how excited i am to have joined the xylem team .", "i joined xylem because of the unique combination of strong commercial opportunities for growth and the compelling mission of the company .", "xylem is also complementary to my previous experiences which has included bringing together cutting - edge technologies with industrial products .", "i spent the last month getting up to speed with the team alongside mark , and i look forward to all we have ahead of us , rounding out 2020 and beyond .", "with that , let 's get into a few more details on our fourth - quarter guidance .", "on the top line , we expect organic revenues in the range of down 6 % to down 8 % .", "this is a modest improvement in sequential performance versus the third quarter .", "as we break it down by segment , we anticipate being down low - single digits in water infrastructure , down mid-single digits in applied water and down mid-teens in measurement and control solutions reflecting the project deployment delays we have continued to see through october .", "operating margin in the quarter is expected to be in the range of 13 to 13 and a half percent .", "also , a modest quarter sequential improvement .", "i also want to highlight a few full - year items .", "we expect to end 2020 with free cash flow conversion of greater than 100 % for the full year .", "restructuring and realignment costs are now expected to be between $ 75 million and $ 85 million , slightly lower than our previous guidance , while structural annual cost savings remain unchanged at approximately $ 70 million .", "we are lowering our estimated tax rate this year to 18 and a half percent to reflect our updated mix of earnings .", "having worked with mark before , i know he and i bring similar perspectives and share a common approach to operational excellence and driving investment in innovation to support sustainable growth .", "mark has built a great team , and i 'm confident we have the organizational capability to focus to deliver .", "it 's great to have you on the team .", "and we will execute from a position of competitive strength , even in the more challenging environments .", "our discipline on cost and cash will continue to pay off , both in the coming quarter and through 2021 .", "looking ahead , that quality of operational execution will enable us to continue driving sustainable margin expansion .", "our robust financial health which gives our customers confidence that they can rely on us in uncertain times , is built on the foundations of a strong balance sheet and cash generation .", "our leading market positions are paired with a differentiated product portfolio and a durable business model at the heart of essential services .", "and our strategy places xylem in the lead as the water sector 's digital adoption curve accelerates , providing a multiyear runway of attractive growth .", "we will deploy capital to continue strengthening our portfolio , investing in the solutions and services that anticipate our customers ' needs .", "both the economic and the social returns of those investments will be attractive over the medium and long terms .", "and our commitment to create value for all our stakeholders will continue to underpin the sustainability and resilience of our company , our customers and our communities .", "so let me take this opportunity to say once again , as i 've said before , that all of xylem stakeholders have benefit profoundly from mark 's leadership and tenure at xylem , but none more than me , as i have benefited tremendously from his counsel .", "so operator , pleased to listen to q&a ."], "summary_gold": "q3 adjusted earnings per share $ 0.62 .", "summary_pred": "the commercial end market declined 5 % in the quarter .<q>they will provide their perspective on xylem 's third -
