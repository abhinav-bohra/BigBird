through and minimal seasonal write - offs in q4 .", "these benefits to adjusted gross margin were offset by 40 basis points of pressure from inventory shrink , 40 basis points of pressure from supply chain cost , 35 basis points of pressure from lumber installation and 20 basis points of pressure from lower credit revenue .", "adjusted sg&a of 22.3 % levered 42 basis points to 2019 .", "as we anticipated , we incurred approximately $ 165 million of covid -

term growth .", "in addition , increasing investments in short - lived technology and store fixture assets is resulting in higher levels of depreciation versus our historical run rate .", "the adjusted effective tax was 25.8 % .", "the tax rate was slightly lower than expected due to better -

adjusted home improvement market might perform , be it weak , moderate or robust performance levels .", "keep in mind that our business is more heavily weighted in diy and less penetrated in online than the broader market , both of which create modest downward pressure on the lowe 's home improvement market outlook .", "these three market scenarios would result in total sales expectations ranging from $ 82 billion to $ 86 billion for the year .", "while each scenario represents a top line decline from 2020 as we cycle this unprecedented industry growth , we continue to expect that our sales result will outperform the market as our initiatives are focused on delivering market share gains .", "additionally , in each scenario , we expect our adjusted operating margin to increase year over year , ranging from 11.2 % to 12 % , depending upon the demand environment .", "and consistent with my comments at the investor update in december , embedded in each of these scenarios are the incremental investments in frontline associate wages and equity programs that totaled $ 1.4 billion through 2019 and 2020 .", "at the same time , we have implemented a slate of perpetual productivity initiatives that joe mentioned earlier .", "and we are investing to drive operational efficiencies in our business .", "we will also lap significant nonrecurring spend from 2020 .", "while it 's still very early in the year , we are seeing market trends essentially in line with the robust market scenario .", "this scenario assumes the relevant home improvement market will experience a modest contraction this year , and our sales would approach $ 86 billion .", "we will remain agile to react rapidly to any changes in the market , and we are able to quickly flex store labor , advertising and incentive comp expenses .", "and consistent with what we outlined at investor day , we are expecting $ 9 billion in share repurchases this year .", "our repurchases activity should be roughly ratable by quarter but a little more concentrated in the first half of the year , given the robust cash flow generation driven by our spring selling season .", "and we are planning for approximately $ 2 billion in capital expenditures in ' 21 .", "so in closing , we remain extremely excited about the future of our business and its ability to continue to deliver sustainable shareholder value ."], "summary_gold": "q4 adjusted earnings per share $ 1.33 .<q>q4 earnings per share $ 1.32 .<q>q4 sales $ 20.3 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $ 19.48 billion .<q>' delivered very strong financial results in q4 of 2020 , with continued sales momentum in february ' .<q>reiterating perspectives provided at december 9 , 2020 investor update .<q>planning for $ 9 billion in share repurchases and $ 2 billion in capital expenditures in 2021 .<q>qtrly total comparable sales increased 28.1 percent . comparable sales for u.s. home improvement business increased 28.6 percent for q4 .", "summary_pred": "and in the quarter , we invested $ 65 million in support of store safety protocols and our communities .<q>now turning to our results .<q>we remain laser -
