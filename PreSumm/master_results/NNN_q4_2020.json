tenant retail properties ; consistency of people and culture ; consistently raising the dividend for 31 consecutive years ; consistent conservative balance sheet philosophy that maintains flexibility and dry powder ; consistent long - term tenant relationships .", "and although our long - term track record of consistent per-share growth was disrupted in 2020 due to the pandemic , we remain committed to our multiyear business plan .", "highlights for national retail properties in 2020 include : increasing the common stock dividend for the 31st consecutive year , a feat matched by only two other reits and by less than 1 % of all u.s. public companies ; raising $ 700 million of well - priced debt capital early in the year , which put us in a strong liquidity position as the pandemic began to spread and enabled us to end 2020 with $ 267 million of cash in the bank and nothing drawn on our $ 900 million line of credit ; reaching collaborative rent deferral agreements during the early stages of the pandemic with a number of our relationship tenants , which solidified our relationships and set us up for future acquisition business ; collecting 95.7 % of our rents due for the fourth quarter and 89.7 % of our annual base rent for the year 2020 ; supporting our associates and our community with programs and activities to advance associate well -
