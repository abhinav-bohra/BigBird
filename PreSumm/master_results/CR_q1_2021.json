digit range .", "our original guidance for favorable foreign exchange of 2 % is now running closer to 4 % , and we still expect an incremental acquisition benefit of approximately $ 5 million this year from i&s .", "margins should also exceed our original 12.5 % guidance .", "however , remember , we told you last quarter that while we expect really solid operating leverage this year , the strongest leverage wo n't occur until our longer and later cycle process business picks up a few quarters from now .", "leverage is also temporarily muted by positive fx movements that we saw in the quarter .", "at payment & merchandising technologies , sales of $ 338 million in the quarter increased 13 % compared to the prior year , driven by 8 % core sales growth and a 4 % benefit from favorable foreign exchange .", "segment operating profit increased 176 % to $ 85 million .", "adjusted operating margins increased 1,500 basis points to 25.3 % .", "and while currency core sales increased 52 % , our high - margin payment business core sales declined 12 % and is still several quarters away from a full recovery .", "we do believe the first quarter will be the best of the year for the segment and for crane currency , and volume and mix certainly did help margins somewhat in the quarter .", "however , i think it is also really important to remember several other factors here .", "first , we have more than doubled international margins at crane currency , even after the significant intangible amortization that comes with purchase accounting .", "and while volume helped , the execution at crane currency has consistently and steadily improved over the last four years .", "quality , delivery and cost metrics are in a completely different range than they were pre-acquisition and we continue to see improvements every day .", "and while broad - based , i would highlight particularly notable improvement in our international operations .", "the volume we saw in the quarter was also broad - based across the u.s. , the international markets as well as across security , substrate and banknote printing .", "and lastly , we are meeting our customers ' needs better than ever before , and we are being paid for the value that we are providing .", "and that 's where we will remain focused , providing our customers a level of service and quality of products that they can't obtain anywhere else .", "at crane payment innovations , we continue to see improving trends across the business .", "we continue to expect the greatest medium -

over - year sales declines before sales growth inflects given the long and late cycle nature of this business .", "on a full year basis , the core sales decline should be a couple of points better than the 8 % decline we guided to earlier this year .", "we still expect segment margins to recover back to north of 20 % fairly quickly after 2021 as the commercial markets continue to recover on a substantially lower cost base .", "for this year , we expect margins modestly better than the 15 % that we guided to in january .", "engineered materials sales increased 6 % in the quarter to $ 54 million with 11.8 % margins .", "sales strength was led by recreational vehicle demand , and we have good indications that building products demand is poised for a strong recovery in the coming quarters .", "margins in the quarter were impacted by rising resin prices .", "the cost pressure on resin was exasperated by the storms in texas that disrupted operations for several of our suppliers .", "the resin supply is recovering quickly and we expect that to result in resin costs reverting to more normal levels in the next several months .", "we have quickly implemented surcharges on our customer base and on a full year basis , we will fully offset the higher input costs with pricing .", "consequently , we are on track to meet or exceed our original 2021 guidance for this segment .", "turning now to more detail on our total company results and guidance .", "we had very strong cash flow performance in the quarter , generating $ 45 million in free cash flow compared to negative $ 43 million in the first quarter of last year .", "during the quarter , we also received $ 15 million from the sale of a property in long beach , california that is excluded from free cash flow given required classification of an investing activity .", "however , this sale was directly enabled by our ongoing restructuring efforts as we moved operations from this facility to other locations .", "since 2017 , we have received proceeds from real estate and other asset sales made possible by restructuring activities of approximately $ 47 million , which means that much of our restructuring has actually been self - funded .", "we also continue to further improve our strong balance sheet .", "subsequent to the quarter end , on april 15 , we repaid the term loan originated in april of 2020 in full using cash on hand and some commercial paper .", "at investor day in february , i told you that we had very limited acquisition capacity today growing to about $ 750 million by the end of this year .", "given our revised outlook , that number is going to be somewhat higher .", "we will remain disciplined , but i am confident we will continue to find attractive transactions where we can deploy our capital to create value for shareholders .", "the adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 22.2 % .", "for the full year , we now expect an adjusted tax rate of 21 % rather than the 21.5 % prior guidance with the fourth quarter tax rate likely the lowest of the year .", "as max explained , we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $ 0.65 to a range of $ 5.65 to $ 5.85 , reflecting the strong first quarter performance and our expectation that end markets and execution will be ahead of where we forecast them earlier this year .", "that said , there is still some uncertainty in many of our markets as well as challenges in certain areas of the supply chain .", "but again , this guidance appropriately balances our performance and the market environment .", "for core sales , we now expect core growth of 4 % to 6 % , up two points from our prior guidance .", "foreign exchange has also become more favorable over the last several weeks , and we now expect favorable foreign exchange translation of 2.5 % , up from 1.5 % in our prior guidance .", "free cash flow guidance was increased to $ 300 million to $ 330 million , up $ 35 million from prior guidance , reflecting higher earnings .", "corporate expense is now expected to be $ 77 million , up $ 12 million compared to the prior guidance , reflecting a number of changes , including some timing items , some legal fees and higher bonus accruals .", "regarding the cadence of our earnings through the year .", "remember , last quarter , we discussed about $ 0.06 of earnings that we shifted from the end of last year into our first quarter given timing and logistics issues .", "we also had some favorable timing and mix in the first quarter .", "we expect a step -
