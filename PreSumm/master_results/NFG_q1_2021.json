tax gain of $ 37 million .", "we made the decision to divest substantially all of these properties to fund a portion of our appalachian acquisition .", "the timing of the sale allowed us to structure the transaction as a like kind of exchange , which defers a relatively sizable tax gain over the life of the appalachian reserves that we acquired last year .", "the other large item impacting comparability during the quarter was the $ 55 million after -
