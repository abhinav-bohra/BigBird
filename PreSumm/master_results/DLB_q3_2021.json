like to hand it over to lewis to take us through the financials .", "and as kevin said in his opening comments , we did have another solid quarter .", "so let me go through the q3 numbers , and then i 'll walk you through the outlook for q4 .", "so starting off with revenue .", "revenue in the third quarter was $ 287 million , which was at the higher end of our guidance range and included a true - up of about $ 14 million for q2 shipments reported that were above the original estimates , and that item is not uncommon .", "on a year - over - year basis , third quarter revenue was about $ 40 million above last year 's q3 as we benefited from higher market tams , along with greater adoption of our dolby technologies .", "and then on a sequential basis , revenue was down from q2 , mainly due to timing of revenues from contracts and from patent licensing programs , and both of these topics were anticipated when we gave guidance .", "so q3 revenue was comprised of $ 272 million in licensing and $ 15 million in products and services .", "so let 's discuss the trends in licensing revenue by end market , starting with broadcast .", "broadcast represented about 46 % of total licensing in the third quarter .", "broadcast revenues increased by about 40 % year - over - year , and that was driven by higher market volume , higher recoveries and higher adoption of our dolby technologies .", "and then on a sequential basis , broadcast increased by about 18 % , and that was due mostly to higher recoveries .", "in the mobile space , mobile represented about 18 % of total licensing in q3 .", "mobile declined by about 36 % year - over - year , mainly due to lower recoveries , and that was offset partially by higher market volume .", "and then on a sequential basis , mobile was down by about 24 % , due mostly to timing of revenue under contracts , and we did anticipate that .", "consumer electronics represented about 14 % of total licensing in q3 .", "and on a year - over - year basis , ce licensing increased by about 86 % , driven by higher market volume , higher adoption of dolby and higher recoveries .", "on a sequential basis , ce went down by about 22 % , and that was due mainly to timing of revenue under contracts .", "pc represented about 9 % of total licensing in the third quarter .", "pc was higher than last year by about 6 % , due to higher market volume , along with increased adoption of dolby vision and dolby atmos , offset partially by lower recoveries .", "and sequentially , pc was down by about 51 % , due mostly to timing of revenue , and that lines up with some of the comments i made last quarter about its increase that quarter because of timing .", "other markets represented about 13 % of total licensing in the third quarter .", "they were up about 42 % year - over - year , and that was driven by higher revenue from dolby cinema , via admin fees and gaming .", "and on a sequential basis , other markets increased by about 4 % due mostly to dolby cinema and to gaming .", "so if i go beyond licensing , our products and services revenue was about $ 15.2 million in q3 compared to $ 16 million in q2 and $ 11.8 million in last year of q3 .", "the year - over - year increase reflects just modestly higher demand in the cinema industry .", "so now i 'd like to discuss q3 margins and our operating expenses .", "total gross margin in the third quarter was 89 % on a gaap basis and 89.7 % on a non-gaap basis .", "products and services gross margin on a gaap basis was minus $ 3.9 million in q3 compared to minus $ 345,000 in the second quarter , and products and services gross margin on a non-gaap basis was minus $ 2.6 million in q3 compared to a positive $ 1.1 million in the second quarter .", "both gaap and non-gaap product gross margins were lower than what i had guided , and that was due to write - downs we took during the third quarter for conferencing hardware .", "operating expenses in the third quarter on a gaap basis were $ 199.1 million compared to $ 204 million in q2 , and our operating expenses in the third quarter on a non-gaap basis were $ 173.6 million compared to $ 178.4 million in the second quarter .", "now operating expenses were below guidance in q3 , and that was mainly due to some of our marketing programs that shifted in timing from q3 into q4 .", "and you will see that sort of mirrored back and reflected in our q4 expense guidance , where the delta from q3 to q4 will be driven mostly by our marketing programs .", "and then our operating income in the third quarter was $ 56.1 million on a gaap basis or 19.6 % of revenue compared to $ 34.1 million or 13.8 % of revenue in q3 of last year .", "operating income in the third quarter on a non-gaap basis was $ 83.6 million or 29.1 % of revenue compared to $ 60.5 million or 24.5 % of revenue in q3 of last year .", "income tax in q3 was 7.7 % on a gaap basis and 13.7 % on a non-gaap basis .", "net income on a gaap basis in the third quarter was $ 54.6 million or $ 0.52 per diluted share compared to $ 67.3 million or $ 0.66 per diluted share in last year 's q3 .", "now i 'd like to point out as a reminder , last year 's q3 net income , and that 's both gaap and non-gaap , included $ 36 million of discrete tax benefits , which does affect the year - over - year comparisons .", "so our net income on a non-gaap basis in the third quarter was $ 74.8 million or $ 0.71 per diluted share compared to $ 87.5 million or $ 0.86 per diluted share in q3 of last year .", "and again , that benefits -- the last year number benefits from that onetime tax credit .", "for both gaap and non-gaap , net income in the third quarter was above guidance due to revenue landing at the higher end of our range and expenses coming in below the range .", "during the third quarter , we generated $ 172 million in cash from operations compared to $ 134 million generated in last year 's third quarter .", "we ended the third quarter with about $ 1.3 billion in cash and investments .", "during the third quarter , we bought back about 400,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $ 37 million of stock repurchase authorization available .", "today , we announced that the board of directors has approved an additional $ 350 million of stock repurchase authorization .", "so if i combine that new approval with the remaining balance that was at the end of june , means that as of today , we have $ 387 million of stock repurchase authorization available going forward .", "we also announced today a cash dividend of $ 0.22 per share .", "the dividend will be payable on august 19 , 2021 , to shareholders of record on august 11 , 2021 .", "so now let 's discuss the forward outlook .", "last quarter , when i discussed guidance for q3 , i laid out a scenario that said our second half revenue could range from $ 560 million to $ 600 million .", "now with q3 under our belt and having landed in the range , we are updating the second half revenue range to $ 570 million to $ 600 million , in other words , bumping up the lower end by $ 10 million , which means we are anticipating q4 revenue to range from $ 280 million to $ 310 million .", "within that , licensing could range from $ 265 million to $ 290 million , while products and services could range from $ 15 million to $ 20 million .", "with respect to market conditions and industry analyst reports that look out over the horizon , there 's still a fair amount of uncertainty out there , and so we are maintaining similar assumptions as what we talked about last quarter , namely that pc tams in the second half could be higher on a year - over - year basis , while tams for tvs and other consumer devices could be down in the second half .", "we also continue to anticipate that we 'll see organic growth on a year - over - year basis from broader adoption of dolby technologies across various markets .", "and we also anticipate some higher revenue from dolby cinema as that industry looks to improve , which we have seen some signs of in recent times , and kevin made a couple of comments about that with some of the titles that came out .", "so let me move on to the rest of the p&l outlook for q4 .", "q4 gross margin on a gaap basis is estimated to range from 88 % to 89 % , and the non-gaap gross margin is estimated to range from 89 % to 90 % .", "within that , products and services gross margin is estimated to range from about breakeven to $ 1 million on a gaap basis and from about $ 1 million to $ 2 million on a non-gaap basis .", "operating expenses in q4 on a gaap basis are estimated to range from $ 216 million to $ 226 million , and operating expenses in q4 on a non-gaap basis are estimated to range from $ 190 million to $ 200 million .", "as i mentioned earlier , the increase from q3 to q4 would be driven primarily by specific marketing programs , some of which shifted in timing from q3 into q4 .", "but in total , q3 plus q4 marketing is expected to land at a similar amount as we were thinking last quarter .", "and to repeat a comment i made last quarter , marketing expenses for the full year fy ' 21 would be similar to what they were last year or maybe a bit lower depending on how q4 turns out .", "so let 's finish up the q4 guidance .", "other income is projected to range from $ 1 million to $ 2 million for the fourth quarter , and our effective tax rate for q4 is projected to range from 19 % to 20 % on both a gaap and non-gaap basis .", "based on a combination of the factors i just covered , we estimate that q4 diluted earnings per share could range from $ 0.25 to $ 0.40 on a gaap basis and from $ 0.47 to $ 0.62 on a non-gaap basis .", "and now that we 've provided guidance for q4 , here 's a full year outlook that would correspond to that .", "fy '21 revenue is anticipated to range from $ 1.28 billion to $ 1.31 billion , with gross margin ranging from 89 % to 90 % on a gaap basis and 90 % to 91 % on a non-gaap basis .", "total operating expenses for the year are estimated to range from $ 810 million to $ 820 million on a gaap basis and from $ 710 million to $ 720 million on a non-gaap basis .", "and full year diluted earnings per share are estimated to range from $ 2.79 to $ 2.94 on a gaap basis and from $ 3.57 to $ 3.72 on a non-gaap basis .", "so operator , hopefully , my phone is working okay now .", "can you queue up the first question ?", "yes , mr. chew , your line is open .", "let 's move on to the rest of the p&l outlook for q4 .", "i was n't quite sure where i dropped off .", "q4 gross margin on a gaap basis is estimated to range from 88 % to 89 % , and the non-gaap gross margin is estimated to range from 89 % to 90 % .", "within that , products and services gross margin is estimated to range from about breakeven to $ 1 million on a gaap basis and from about $ 1 million to $ 2 million on a non-gaap basis .", "operating expenses in q4 on a gaap basis are estimated to range from $ 216 million to $ 226 million , and operating expenses in q4 on a non-gaap basis are estimated to range from $ 190 million to $ 200 million
