than - expected results on credit - sensitive assets resulting in reversals of prior credit reserves and sales of reo properties at attractive levels .", "please turn to page 4 .", "we reported gaap earnings of $ 0.08 per share in the fourth quarter .", "these results were driven by continued price appreciation of loans held at fair value and by further improvement in credit leading to credit loss reserve reversals .", "on the other hand , fourth -
