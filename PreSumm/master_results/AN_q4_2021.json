term value .", "so the business drivers that i consider in that category are improvements in f&i performance , which is more driven by a focus on product penetration rather than rate , by used volume , which is more related to sales effectiveness , operational focus as well as additional usa stores , and finally , the sg&a control that joe just mentioned again .", "and we can clearly see the benefits of that coming through in our net income margin .", "and in my view , we should continue to translate into value and not be so quickly discounted as situational at this time .", "so obviously , that leads one of the biggest variables , which is clearly new vehicle margin .", "and naturally , there 's a lot of debate where this may go in the future .", "and i remember in my previous life , on quarterly discussions on calls like this , we spent a lot of time talking about breakeven points and what level of saar can you still make a profit or level of saar can't you make a profit .", "and if you look at the fourth quarter , we delivered a saar around that $ 13 million from my estimate , well below anyone would have been able to forecast .", "and the levels of profitability for both oems and dealers clearly show the benefits of selling vehicles at msrp .", "and what a concept , right , selling at msrp .", "so if that 's the learning , i think , has got to do that .", "by the way , while we 're on the subject of retail price , we 've seen a number of comments about vehicles being sold above msrp , quoting the potential adverse impacts on brands and customers , which i understand .", "and by the way , last year , less than 2 % of all the new vehicles sold by autonation were above msrp .", "but this discussion on msrp branded customers actually also adds to my optimism regarding new vehicle margins going forward .", "because i think it 's equally clear that significant discounting and high incentives can also damage a brand , which is another reason for our industry to balance appropriately supply and demand , and another reason why we may expect higher new vehicle margins than we have historically seen pre-covid .", "so finally , let me briefly turn to the future .", "i think everybody recognizes the industry will go through a significant transformation .", "and that 's not just in terms of product and powertrain , but in many other ways as well .", "when covid is behind us , we 'll see the emergence of additional mobility models and choices .", "we 'll see changes in the way customers approach vehicle ownership and usage .", "and we will progressively see changes in how dealers and oems are traditionally competed .", "and for me , this is an exciting time and offers many more opportunities and downsides .", "and now i 'm more convinced than ever , having seen under the hood of autonation , that the group can be well placed and positioned to continue to grow and thrive .", "autonation in the past has been known for its innovation and progressive approach .", "and you can be certain we 're going to be taking this approach to the next level .", "as we see it today , we have over 11 million customers in our family already , and every year , an additional three million interactions .", "so we have the opportunity not only to leverage our brand , our scale , our strong bricks and mortar footprint , but also to build on our growing digital capabilities and expand our business model to ensure we have greater autonomy and control in our future .", "so obviously , a lot more to come in the coming months .", "but i 'd like to make one announcement that will help indicate some of what the future may hold for autonation .", "and that is , i 'm now creating a new executive role .", "and i 'm delighted to announce gianluca camplone will be joining the group from march 1 and assuming the position of evp , head of mobility , business development and strategy , and coo of precision parts .", "this role will report directly to me .", "gianluca will sit on our executive committee .", "and i 'm sure several of you will already know gianluca camplone .", "but for those who do not know him , he joined autonation from mckinsey , where he was most recently serving as senior partner and leader of the advanced industry global practice and private equity industrial practice in north america .", "gianluca orchestrated a companywide $ 1 billion digital business building program .", "and he spearheaded a global team on multiple billion -
