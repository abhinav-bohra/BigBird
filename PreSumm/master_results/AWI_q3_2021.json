time delivery , shipping damage , billing accuracy , product defects , and returns .", "and i can share with you with great satisfaction that this measure not only remained above our 90 % threshold throughout 2021 for the mineral fiber segment in particular but it's improved in the third quarter .", "so i 'm proud of how our teams have executed to handle these unprecedented challenges internally to meet our customers ' needs .", "now externally , these challenges have impacted our business in the form of project delays , impacting both our mineral fiber and architectural specialties segments .", "despite these challenges , mineral fiber sales volumes increased in the third quarter versus prior year on the strength of the r&r part of our business that has more than offset the impact of these project delays and the lower new construction activity .", "our sales rate per shipping day also showed sequential improvement in the quarter .", "in fact , september sales rate per day eclipsed that of 2019 , and the quarterly results for this metric has now improved sequentially for the last five quarters .", "from a profitability perspective , the mineral fiber segment generated strong gross margins compared to prior year , reflecting positive like -

for - like pricing and favorable channel mix , increased volume driven by the 2020 acquisitions , and contributions from wave equity earnings .", "this favorability was partially offset by higher sg&a costs , increased input cost on freight raw , materials , and energy , and an increase in manufacturing cost driven by the 2020 acquisitions .", "the increase in sg&a was driven by more normalized discretionary spending compared to the prior year cost reductions , an increase in variable compensation , investments for future growth in our healthy spaces and digital initiatives , and the 2020 acquisitions .", "not surprisingly , like many other manufacturing companies , we felt inflation impacts throughout our supply chain , albeit less than some other building product companies .", "our strong supplier partnerships have never been more important and our teams have done a great job of managing through this challenge .", "we expect inflationary pressure to continue into the fourth quarter , we now see cost of goods sold inflation somewhere in the 4.5 % to 5 % range for the full year 2021 .", "as demonstrated historically and in this quarter , we will work to drive like -

year cost reductions , increased variable compensation and investments to support our growth initiatives .", "input cost trended higher this quarter due to raw material , energy and freight inflation , which remains a top focus area for us as we end the year and prepare for 2022 .", "in addition , we experienced a $ 3 million headwind due to unplanned maintenance activities at two of our larger plants .", "this caused downtime at both plants and drove lost productivity , higher scrap costs and additional freight cost to maintain our best - in - class service levels .", "both situations where remediated during the quarter and i 'm happy to report that the plants are running very well in october .", "this is an atypical event for awi .", "as many of you know , we consistently drive plant productivity year after year .", "moving to architectural specialties or as segment on slide 7 .", "third quarter adjusted net sales grew 31 % or $ 19 million with the 2020 acquisitions in terms of turf , moz , arktura , contributing $ 16 million and organic sales increasing $ 3 million .", "as segment adjusted ebitda increased 1 % as improved sales from the 2020 acquisitions and the organic business more than offset project push outs , higher sg&a , and increased manufacturing costs .", "the adjusted ebitda margin for the segment improved 350 basis points sequentially from the second quarter but contracted 500 basis points when compared to the third quarter 2020 results .", "this segment is still being pressured by inflationary conditions continued along with a recent spike in project delays due to commercial construction labor disruptions and supply chain challenges .", "the project push outs are delaying some revenue to q4 and 2022 .", "in september , we announced an additional round of price increases for as products , which have already gone into effect .", "we 've had as price increases in each quarter of 2021 .", "slide 8 shows the drivers of our consolidated results for the nine - month period , including a breakout of the impact for our 2020 acquisitions .", "sales for the first nine months of the year were up 18 % and adjusted ebitda increased 10 % .", "the year - to - date results are driven by higher volumes as the second quarter lapped a prior year more significantly impacted by the pandemic , favorable auv , and increased wave equity earnings , which were partially offset by higher sg&a spend and increased manufacturing in input costs .", "adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12 % to $ 3.28 .", "slide 9 shows year - to - date adjusted free cash flow performance , which is flat versus the prior year .", "increases in cash earnings , working capital improvements , and wave - related dividends were offset by an increase in income tax payments and higher capex spending following a reduced prior year in an effort to manage cash and liquidity during the pandemic .", "our cash generation through the first nine months is in line with our expectations .", "we summarize our updated guidance for 2021 on slide 10 .", "please note , this guidance update assumes no significant pandemic - related shutdowns or material job delays due to supply chain issues .", "we are narrowing our guidance ranges for all key metrics and now we expect year - over - year revenue growth of 17 % to 18 % , adjusted ebitda growth of 13 % to 15 % , adjusted earnings per share growth of 14 % to 16 % , and adjusted free cash flow of down 7 % to 2 % .", "the right side of the page highlights updates for the prior -- from the prior guidance communicated in july .", "you 'll notice the increase in mineral fiber auv range from 9 % to 11 % as our teams continue to do a great job of realizing price from our three mineral fiber increases this year .", "we 're bringing down the range of our mineral fiber volume to 1 % to 2 % as near - term choppiness remains and projects are delayed into the out months and 2022 .", "we continue to invest in our healthy spaces and digital initiatives and believe they will be meaningful contributors to our future growth .", "but the larger impact on volume for the current year is the project delays previously discussed .", "this is a shift in contribution between the 2020 acquisitions and the organic business to the as segment as revenue impacts are felt from the project delays .", "we now expect the 2020 acquisitions to contribute about 30 % growth and as organic in the mid - to - high single - digit range .", "in conclusion , i 'm proud of the work our teams have accomplished throughout the third quarter in the face of supply chain challenges and a renewal of covid - 19 concerns .", "it certainly was n't easy but they delivered a solid quarter .", "these are challenging times but i remain optimistic that our investments in the future , whether it's in people , growth initiatives , innovation , or partnerships , will unlock the next level of growth for awi .", "before we get into the q&a session , let me share a little bit more about how we see our current position and the progress on key initiatives and what that means for the future here at armstrong .", "inflation and supply chain challenges are likely to persist into next year .", "but at awi , we 're demonstrating that we can manage our way through this , successfully delivering price ahead of inflation and minimizing the impact from supply chain disruptions .", "market conditions are continuing to improve albeit and an uneven and choppy -

purpose applications such as offices , schools , and hospitality .", "vidashield and airassure , the two products that we introduced at the end of last year , again still early days , but the progress is encouraging .", "sales of these products in the third quarter doubled from the second quarter sales levels .", "and we have more than doubled the number of active projects in the quarter and are conducting several trials on large -
