officer .", "and kevin hake , senior vp .", "first to address regulation fair disclosure .", "we had a record setting second quarter highlighted by a 97 % increase in net income , a 23 % increase in homes delivered a 35 % increase in revenue , and a return on equity of 27 % .", "all of this is a result of a high level of performance across all 15 of our housing operations , as well as from our mortgage and title business .", "more our margins for the quarter were very strong .", "our gross margins improved by 320 basis points over last year , and improved sequentially by 70 basis points from the first quarter to a second quarter level of 25.1 % .", "our overhead expense ratio improved by 110 basis points from a year ago to 10.4 % of revenues , reflecting greater operating leverage .", "and most importantly , our pre tax income percentage improved significantly to 14.7 % versus 10 % a year ago .", "record second quarter results continue our trend of strong growth in both revenues and earnings that we have achieved over the past decade .", "since 2013 , our revenues have grown at a compounded annual rate of 19 % .", "and our pre tax income has grown at an even more impressive annual rate of 43 % .", "demand for new homes continues to be very good .", "and as reflected in our year to date new contracts increasing by 24 % .", "and our record set second quarter new contracts just slightly better than a year ago , with 2267 homes sold during the quarter .", "we achieved record second quarter sales notwithstanding that we are operating in nearly 20 % fewer communities than a year ago .", "and we are intentionally limiting sales and majority of our communities to control margins and better manage delivery times .", "given the drop in our community count and the difficult sales comps posed by this quarter in particularly the next quarter the third quarter , i wanted to provide a little more color on our sales results .", "last year was to say the least a most unusual year for our industry .", "no one could have predicted how our economy would fare when faced with one of the worst health crisis of our time .", "knowing what we know now , it is clear that comparisons between 2021 and 2020 need to be viewed carefully .", "our second quarter sales comps more quick , were clearly more challenging due to the unusually strong sales pace , which began in may and june of last year , as our industry as a whole experienced a dramatic rebound in sales after the extreme initial covid related sales .", "slowed down in march and april of last year .", "for emi homes , we sold 31 % more homes and last year second quarter , aided by the strength of last may in june .", "the increased sales pace continued and even got better .", "as you all recall , as we moved into last year 's third quarter , where our sales grew by 71 % over 2019 .", "it was in the late stages of last year , third quarter and frankly , in all of the fourth quarter of last year , when we first began to limit sales in many of our communities .", "and of course , we were raising our prices to try and meet the market demand .", "despite these efforts , we began to sell out of communities much faster than expected .", "on top of that , new community openings within our industry occurred slower than expected , due in part to delays in the governmental approval and inspection process , largely because of covid related work from home protocols .", "thus , a greater than anticipated drop in our community count .", "looking ahead , we are very well positioned to grow our communities .", "we expect to open more new communities in the second half of this year than we did in the first half .", "and importantly , we expect to open a record number of new communities in both the first half of 2022 and the second half of 2022 .", "all in support of our growth goals .", "finally , let me just say that our slowdown or decline in order growth is not indicative of demand .", "these are perhaps the best housing conditions .", "we 've seen , considering demand , buyer demographics and buyer sentiment , and the very strong credit credit quality of our buyers .", "we will continue to manage or limit sales in many of our communities on a go forward basis in order to control deliveries and maximize margins .", "and today we 've seen little if any evidence of pushback on price on all of our product lines from attached townhomes to our diverse single family lineup of homes , as well as our homes geared to empty nesters have performed at or above expectations .", "speaking of our product line , our smart series , which represents our most affordable line of homes , continues to perform at a very high level .", "smart siri sales in the second quarter accounted for just under 40 % of total company sales compared to about 35 % a year ago .", "we are selling our smart series homes and 35 % of our communities compared to 30 % of the communities a year ago .", "the average price of our smart series homes is now just under $ 350,000 compared to roughly $ 330,000 at the end of the first quarter .", "as we 've said repeatedly over the last several years when discussing our smart series line of homes .", "on average , our smart series communities produce better sales pace , better margins , faster cycle time , and thus better returns .", "our backlog sales value at the end of the quarter was $ 2.5 billion and all time quarterly record and 70 % better than last year .", "units in backlog increased by 49 % .", "to an all time record 5488 homes with an average price of homes in backlog equal to $ 454,000 .", "this is 15 % higher than a year ago .", "now i 'd like to provide a few comments on our markets .", "as i mentioned at the beginning of the call , we experienced strong performance from each of our 15 homebuilding divisions , with substantial income contributions for most of our markets led by orlando , tampa , minneapolis , dallas , columbus , and cincinnati .", "our deliveries increased by 18 % over last year in our southern region , reminding you that our southern region consists of our four texas

the south , we have a very strong land position .", "company wide , we own approximately 18,300 lots , which is roughly a two year supply .", "on top of that , we control the option contracts , and additional nearly 26,000 lots .", "so in total , are owned and controlled lots are slightly slightly more than 44,000 lots , which is just below a five year supply .", "perhaps most important 59 % of those near 44,000 lots are controlled under an option contract , which gives me my home 's significant flexibility to react to changes in demand or individual market conditions .", "first , our financial condition is very strong with one and a half billion dollars of equity at june 30 , and a book value slightly over $ 50 a share .", "we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $ 372,000,000.00 borrowings under our $ 550 million unsecured revolving credit facility .", "this resulted in a very healthy net debt to cap ratio of 16 % .", "we believe our low leverage in substantial cash generation allows us to allocate capital to share repurchases , while also continuing to make significant investments in replenishing our land position for the continued growth of our company .", "this replaces our existing $ 50 million share repurchase authorization which had roughly $ 17 million of remaining availability .", "the $ 100 million share repurchase authorization reflects our expectation of the ongoing strength in our business and our commitment to creating long term shareholder value , while always maintaining low debt leverage .", "finally , in closing , our company is an actual is in excellent shape .", "given the strength of our backlog , as well as the strength of our land position , we are poised to have an outstanding 2021 .", "and with our planned new community openings , we are equally excited about our prospects for a strong 2022 .", "new contracts and second quarter increased to 2267 .", "a second quarter record 2261 for last year second quarter

.", "and our second quarter sg and a expenses were 10.4 revenue , improving 110 basis points compared to 11.5 a year ago .", "this reflects greater operating leverage , and it was our lowest second quarter leverage in our company history .", "interest expense decreased 2.1 million for the quarter compared to last year .", "interest incurred for the quarter was 10 point 1 million compared to 10 point 3 million a year ago .", "this decreases due to lower outstanding borrowings in the second quarter , and also higher interest capitalisation due to more inventory being under development .", "we
