outs as well as community openings that were delayed to the third quarter .", "over the past 12 months our robust absorption pace has driven the close - out of over 150 selling communities .", "although they will not generate additional net orders , we will continue to produce revenues and profit in future quarters associated with nearly 80 % of these sold - out communities as we work through the construction and delivery of the sold homes .", "the upside from our strong pace of orders is now reflected in our backlog which will drive increased future housing revenues .", "our expectation of continued strong net order activity will drive elevated levels of community close -
