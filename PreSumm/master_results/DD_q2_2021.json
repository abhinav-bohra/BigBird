quarter financial performance , beginning on slide 5 .", "our results for the quarter reflect the diversity and strength of our portfolio and our teams ' continued ability to execute in the face of escalating raw material costs and global supply chain and logistics headwinds .", "net sales of $ 4.1 billion were up 26 % versus second quarter of 2020 , up 23 % on an organic basis .", "the organic sales growth resulted from a 20 % increase in volume and a 3 % increase in price .", "currency provided a 4 % tailwind in the quarter , which was slightly offset by a 1 % headwind as a result of non-core business divestitures in the prior year .", "overall sales growth was broad - based with double - digit growth on an organic basis in all 3 reporting segments and across all regions .", "the most notable increase versus the year - ago period was in our m&m segment , reflecting the sizable change in the global automotive market versus the prior year and disciplined pricing actions .", "i will provide additional color on our segment top - line results on the next slide .", "from an earnings perspective , we delivered operating ebitda of $ 1.06 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $ 1.06 per share , up 53 % and about 240 % , respectively , versus the year - ago period .", "the earnings improvement resulted from volume gains most notably reflecting ongoing recovery in key end markets adversely impacted by the pandemic and the absence of approximately $ 150 million in charges associated with temporary idling certain facilities , partially offset by the absence of a $ 64 million gain associated with a joint venture that has since been divested .", "strong operating ebitda leverage drove operating ebitda margin expansion of 460 basis points .", "incremental margins for the quarter were about 43 % .", "given the unique nature of 2020 and the discrete items that impacted our operating results in the prior year , it 's important to evaluate our year - over - year operating performance for our core results on an underlying basis .", "specifically , operating ebitda for our core results during the quarter was up about 40 % versus last year after excluding the impact of the $ 150 million in idle mills incurred in the prior year , with about 240 basis points of margin expansion and operating leverage of one and a half times .", "similarly , i continue to track our growth versus 2019 given the significant impact that the pandemic had in key end markets last year .", "in comparing our current second - quarter results to a more normalized performance before the pandemic , all reported sales in the quarter were up 6 % versus the second quarter of 2019 and up 10 % versus that same period for our core sales .", "operating ebitda for our core results during the quarter was up 15 % versus second quarter of 2019 or one and a half times leverage .", "from a segment perspective , e&i delivered operating ebitda margin of 32 % , with 190 basis points of expansion driven by broad - based volume gains .", "m&m delivered significant operating ebitda improvement , driven by an overall recovery in automotive markets and the absence of approximately $ 130 million in charges associated with temporarily idling polymer capacity in the year - ago period .", "operating ebitda margin for the quarter was 23 % , reflecting volume growth and net pricing gains resulting from actions taken ahead of escalating raw material costs .", "in w&p , operating ebitda increased 4 % versus the year - ago period .", "operating ebitda margin and leverage were adversely impacted primarily by 2 key drivers .", "first , given contractual commitments with customers , local selling price increases lagged the headwind from raw materials and supply chain cost escalation .", "we expect this to resolve in the second half as price increases start to kick in .", "second , production volumes for tyvek protective garments were at peak levels in the year - ago period given the company 's response to the pandemic .", "this enabled us to minimize manufacturing changeovers to other tyvek grades , resulting in an overall increase to production rates .", "as tyvek output shifted from protective garments to multiple other applications , the resulting increase in expected changeovers in the current quarter decreased production rates , leading to lower volumes .", "for the quarter , cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were $ 440 million and $ 224 million , respectively .", "while these amounts have improved since the first quarter , cash flow and conversion are not where we need them to be .", "the headwinds we faced are related to increased working capital levels and capital spending in excess of d&a as we advance critical capacity expansion projects .", "with respect to working capital , we saw an increase in inventories due to our efforts to create a more stable supply chain for our customers given the strong demand environment and numerous raw material and logistics constraints .", "in the second half of the year , we expect higher cash flow and conversion rate as the global supply chain and logistic environment stabilizes .", "slide 6 provides more detail on the year - over - year changes in net sales for the quarter .", "organic sales were up 17 % on 17 % volume growth with double - digit volume growth increases in all regions .", "volume gains were led by mid-20s percent growth in industrial solutions , reflecting broad - based demand strength across most product lines but most notably for oled displays for new phones and television launches , medical silicones in healthcare and kalrez seals within electronics .", "interconnect solutions also delivered organic growth over 20 % with high - teens volume growth .", "the volume growth was driven by higher material content in premium next - generation smartphones , partially resulting from timing shifts as select oem demand shifted from the second half this year , along with some share gains for printed circuit board .", "semiconductor technologies continues to benefit from strong electronics demand and advancements in key growth areas such as 5g , high - performance computing and electric vehicles .", "during the quarter , new technology ramps in advanced nodes within logic and foundry and higher demand for memory in servers and data centers drove double - digit volume growth .", "continued recovery of key end markets within w&p drove organic growth of 11 % , driven by volume increases .", "sales gains were led by recovery in construction with shelter solutions reporting organic sales growth of more than 30 % , which reflects continued strength in north american residential construction for products like styrofoam and tyvek house wrap and in retail channels for do - it - yourself applications .", "commercial construction recorded higher sales in the quarter for corian surfaces as global demand continues to improve .", "within safety solutions , organic sales were up high single digits , reflecting strong volume improvement for aramid fibers in industrial , oil and gas and automotive end markets .", "as previously noted , lower production volumes for tyvek reduced overall safety volume .", "in water solutions , broad - based demand for water technologies remained strong .", "however , logistics challenges primarily in our ultrafiltration business impacted our ability to supply , resulting in a low single - digit volume decline versus the year - ago period .", "we expect organic sales growth for the year for water solutions to be in the mid to high single digits .", "the most notable increase in top - line improvement was in our m&m segment , which had organic sales growth of over 50 % .", "the improvement was driven by the continuing recovery of the global automotive market , which represents about 60 % of the segment from an end market perspective and helped deliver strong volume growth across all 3 lines of business .", "local pricing gains of 13 % also contributed to organic sales growth , reflecting our actions taken to offset raw material costs and higher metals pricing in the advanced solutions business .", "excluding metals pricing , local price was up about 8 % .", "within engineering polymers , global supply constraints of key raw materials continues to improve but are expected to remain tight through the end of the year .", "we continue to expect to recover lost volume related to these disruptions as the raw material constraints are alleviated .", "i mentioned earlier that adjusted earnings per share of $ 1.06 per share was up over 240 % from $ 0.31 per share in the year - ago period .", "higher segment earnings resulted in a net benefit totaling over $ 0.40 .", "this net benefit resulted mainly from higher volumes and the absence of idle mills recorded in the prior year , offset slightly by portfolio changes , which includes the absence of the gain recorded in the prior year in corporate .", "also providing a significant benefit to adjusted earnings per share versus last year was an approximate $ 0.30 per share benefit due to a lower share count .", "benefit from lower interest expense in the current quarter as a result of our recent delevering actions was mostly offset by a higher base tax rate compared to last year .", "our base tax rate for the quarter of 19.8 % was higher than the year - ago period due to the absence of certain discrete gains benefiting the prior year rate .", "for full - year 2021 , we currently expect our base tax rate to be closer to the lower end of our expected range of 21 % to 22 % .", "let me discuss our financial outlook on slide 8 , which includes our view of the third quarter and full - year 2021 .", "we are raising our full - year guidance range for net sales , operating ebitda and adjusted eps .", "along with the underlying improvement that we are expecting compared to our previous estimates , our revised guide also reflects the acquisition of laird and the divestiture of the solamet business .", "at the midpoint of the range provided , we now expect net sales for the year to be about $ 16.5 billion and operating ebitda to be about $ 4.235 billion .", "also , we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be $ 4.27 per share at the midpoint of the range provided , which reflects about $ 0.23 underlying raise to our original estimate , a $ 0.10 benefit from the portfolio changes and about $ 0.27 full - year benefit related to the amortization reporting change .", "for the third - quarter 2021 , we expect net sales to be about $ 4.2 billion , operating ebitda to be about $ 1.07 billion and adjusted earnings per share to be about $ 1.12 per share , all at the midpoints of the ranges provided .", "before opening up for q&a , i 'd like to provide some highlights on our commitment to esg and what we are doing to sustainably grow and operate our businesses for the long term .", "in june , we published our 2021 sustainability report , which reflects our first full - year progress against the 2030 goals that we set in 2019 .", "our report highlights more than 50 examples of how our teams are addressing the environmental and social needs of our customers and communities .", "some of the highlights from this report are reflected on slide 9 .", "esg is fundamental to our core long -
