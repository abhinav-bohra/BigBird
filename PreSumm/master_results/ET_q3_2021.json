over - year .", "for midstream , adjusted ebitda was $ 556 million , compared to $ 530 million for the third quarter of 2020 .", "this was largely the result of a $ 156 million increase related to favorable ngl and natural gas prices , as well as volume growth in the permian and the ramp - up of recently completed assets in the northeast , which were partially offset by a decrease of $ 103 million due to the restructuring and assignment of certain contracts in the ark - la - tex region in the third quarter of 2020 .", "gathered gas volumes were 13 million mmbtus per day , compared to 12.9 million mmbtus per day for the same period last year due to higher volumes in the permian , ark -

party customers shifting to long - term contracts from the permian to the gulf coast and lower spreads , as well as an increase in operating expenses , which were largely offset by increased transportation volumes out of the permian and an increase in retained fuel revenues and storage margin .", "while it impacted us over the comparison period , the additional long - term contracting of third - party customers from the permian to the gulf coast is expected to benefit us going forward as the waha to katy basis differential has tightened significantly .", "to reduce volatility within our earnings and protect us from falling basis differentials , like we saw from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021 , we have strategically taken steps to lock in additional volumes under fee -
