3 , which comprises 6 % of the fair value of pmt 's overall crt investment , if all presently delinquent loans proceeded unmitigated to 180 days or more delinquent , additional losses would be approximately $ 18 million .", "through the end of the quarter , losses to date totaled $ 11 million .", "moving on to l street securities 2017 -

pm1 exceeding its face amount by $ 29 million at the end of the quarter .", "the most common method for borrowers to exit forbearance to date has been a covid - 19 payment deferral .", "this program allows the borrower to defer the amount owed to the end of the loan term , and the loan is deemed current after the borrower makes a specified number of monthly mortgage payments .", "during the quarter , we added $ 27 million in fair value of new investor loan securitization investments , and after the quarter , we added another $ 21 million in fair value from pmt 's inaugural securitization of investor loans .", "in total , this year , we have successfully deployed the runoff from elevated prepayments on crt investments .", "and on slide 8 , you can see $ 925 million of net new investments in long -

term prepayment projections .", "the fair value on agency mbs and interest rate hedges also declined by $ 95 million and included $ 80 million of fair value declines due to increases in market interest rates and declines due to hedge costs of $ 15 million .", "pmt 's correspondent production segment contributed $ 27.8 million to pre-tax income for the quarter .", "pmt 's corporate segment includes interest income from cash and short -
