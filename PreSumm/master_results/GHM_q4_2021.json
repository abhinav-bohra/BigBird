get this done , initially engaging with barber - nichols in late summer of 2018 , when jeff first visited .", "just immediately identified bni met most of the critical criteria for what graham strategically wanted in an acquisition .", "as we have discussed in the past , our process for identifying acquisition targets is to establish necessary key attributes of a target such as , but not limited to values and culture , ip protected products and market served operations model and revenue range .", "chris is responsible for developing the messaging for each target , creating the compelling reasons as to why graham is an ideal strategic acquirer and outlining the value of a proposed combination .", "most often the target is n't necessarily for sale , which was the case with bni .", "fortunately dan thoren , the president of bni was intrigued by chris 's messaging and agreed to have an initial discussion that took time to earn trust , develop relationships and establish

approach to their business all confirmed dan and the bni team have created something very special and extremely powerful .", "the time it took to complete the deal permitted us to observe dan and team

million a year earlier .", "over the ensuing two years , it was wonderful to observe the planning and forecasting processes and importantly their ability to deliver forecasted results culminating in $

processes are scalable to drive future growth .", "barber - nichols is an outstanding company .", "we are fortunate to have them become part of graham corporation effective today .", "jeff will go through the deal rationale in detail and dan will provide an overview of barber - nichols .", "however , what i viewed compelling about barber - nichols was it fulfilled our goal of diversifying into the defense market , which provides greater stability , multiple year visibility , incredible long - term asset base loading .", "the wonderful aspect about bni products is there is no overlap with graham's .", "we serve the defense shipbuilders specifically the nuclear propulsion program while bni serves offensive and defensive systems for the ships .", "in addition , bni serves the commercial space market with sophisticated and advanced technologies for rocket engine fuel systems and space life support systems .", "this is expected to be an expanding long - term growth market due to the internet of things , growing communication networks and the ever - increasing way in which people throughout the world are interconnected .", "thus today we had new market segment revenue within the defense industry and also bring new markets such as commercial space , advanced power generation , alternative energy along with capabilities for system integration .", "importantly , the acquisition of barber - nichols is a catalyst for immediate improvement in revenue and profitability with top line expanding approximately 50 % due to the addition of bni for the 10 months in fiscal 2022 that we own them and it provides a terrific platform for follow - on organic and acquisitive growth .", "i am very pleased and excited to have barber - nichols become part of graham .", "actually , i 've been

modest growth in fiscal 2022 and then move into the mid $ 40 million range by fiscal 2025 .", "complemented by barber - nichols defense revenue , we believe the combination will quickly approach $ 100 million in defense sales .", "our commitment to our installed base for crude oil refining and petrochemical markets will continue to bear fruit .", "everything we read here and observe supports continued investment in existing assets for mature markets and new capacity capital investment in emerging economies .", "graham 's shift into competing in price sensitive segments of our energy and petrochemical markets , supported by innovation of our operations model has changed our participation and success in these previously underserved segments .", "this strategy has been 10 % to 15 % of sales .", "last year was at a comparable level in fiscal 2020 .", "the team has done well to navigate the selling cycle to get us in position to win and also -- sorry , and also the execution side working with the global supply chain for component fabrication has created cost efficiencies and execution capacity for us .", "importantly , alan and his team achieved margins projected for the orders completed thus far .", "a key business initiative is to expand the capacity of our production workforce .", "today , we need to grow our capacity within our production workforce by 20 % in batavia .", "that will permit backlog conversion velocity to improve and also expand margins due to operating leverage and reduction in subcontracting .", "energy and petrochemical markets feel different today than six months ago .", "that is encouraging , however , the bid pipeline has a long way to rebuild before returning to pre-2020 levels .", "we are watching this closely during the next few quarters , cost measures have not been taken due to the need to have depth across the company 's sales , engineering , quality , manufacturing , it and other critical departments .", "it takes a long time to build a proficient knowledge worker at graham .", "we continue to evaluate near - term benefit and long - term implications of cost reduction measures .", "we elected to protect the strength of graham during this black swan event caused by covid - 19 .", "let 's move on to slide 5 .", "fourth quarter sales were $ 25.7 million .", "defense sales were strong at $ 6.5 million .", "also was revenue lift from short cycle sales , driven by the freeze in the us gulf coast region .", "also and importantly 15 % to 20 % of sales were due to our success penetrating the price sensitive segment of the refining market .", "earnings per share was $ 0.04 with net income at $ 400,000 .", "on march 31 , cash was $ 65 million of which approximately $ 40 million was used for the acquisition of barber - nichols .", "backlog on march 31 was $ 137.6 million with $ 104 million for the defense market and acquiring barber - nichols approximately $ 100 million of backlog was added effective today .", "nearly $ 240 million multi - year backlog is a valuable asset for graham .", "please move on to slide 6 .", "year - over - year revenue increased to 11 % and gross profit 14 % .", "profitability and margin were pressured due to decisions we made not to address business cost during the pandemic and also our inability to quickly expand production personnel .", "government support during the pandemic has made it difficult to compel potential workers to join the graham team .", "this should improve in the coming quarters , but is a headwind now as we want to convert more existing backlog more quickly by having a larger production workforce .", "we have the infrastructure but not the human resources .", "let 's move on to slide 7 .", "alan smith and the operations team performed remarkably in achieving full year revenue of $ 97.5 million .", "due to covid - 19 , full year throughput capacity was at 85 % as an average of what our production workforce could produce if unaffected by lost time due to covid .", "this made planning and management of backlog conversion difficult .", "alan and his team did fantastic even though that is not apparent in the results .", "here too profitability and margins were under pressure due to under - absorption caused by 15 % lower throughput and also strategic decisions to hold personnel at pre-covid levels .", "we had strong defense bookings of $ 69 million for the year .", "energy and petrochemicals stayed mired due to demand destruction stemming from the range of implications of covid - 19 .", "we do have a terrific backlog that at march 31 , as i said earlier was $ 137.6 million , up $ 25 million year - over - year .", "importantly , and again barber - nichols adds roughly $ 100 million into our backlog bringing the combined total to just under $ 240 million .", "$ 40 million of barber - nichols backlog is expected to contribute to fiscal 2022 revenue for the 10 months we own them .", "40 % to 45 % of our organic backlog is expected to convert into revenue during fiscal 2022 .", "now let 's move on to the guidance slide .", "full year revenue range is $ 130 million to $ 140 million with $ 45 million to $ 48 million from barber - nichols and the remainder being organic revenue .", "adjusted ebitda is expected to be between $ 7 million and $ 9 million .", "once we complete purchase accounting treatment of the bni acquisition , we will be in a position to provide gross margin and sg&a guidance .", "this was an exciting start to the fiscal 2022 .", "large elements of recent diversification strategies have come together to dramatically improve fiscal ' 22 results and more importantly reshape graham 's future with a path to stronger total shareholder returns .", "the barber - nichols acquisition is transformative for graham .", "there is a platform for follow - on organic and m&a investment to propel growth .", "graham 's defense revenues in the mid $ 20 million range with growth anticipated to yield more than $ 40 million of revenue by fiscal 2025 .", "importantly , we are beyond first article operations and therefore margins should improve as well .", "just as a reminder , first article operations are first time fabrications that involved production r&d , production of jigs and fixturing and defining ideal build flow or order of operations .", "once beyond first article work , productivity gains should be achieved .", "i am pleased by our success in winning work and previously underserved price focus segments of the energy and petrochemicals markets that represented 15 % of sales fiscal ' 19 through ' 21 .", "it 's also worth noting $ 7 million of new orders were secured during the month of may from the crude oil refining market .", "we became involved in these opportunities in early 2019 .", "it is great to see significant order releases from this end market .", "both are from the installed base .", "one is for us gulf coast refiner undertaking a revamp to enable use of lower cost , lower quality feedstocks .", "the other is a mideast refiner debottlenecking the refinery to provide more gasoline and diesel fuels to meet local demand .", "with those remarks , i want to pass the call over to jeff and dan to walk through the acquisition .", "if you could turn to the barber - nichols acquisition deck .", "if you look at slide 2 , you will see we have a safe harbor statement similar to that which was in the earnings deck and i 'll allow you to review rather than me reading through it .", "moving on to slide 3 .", "it 's great to be speaking with you from barber - nichols here in denver with dan thoren .", "as jim mentioned , we have been working at barber - nichols for quite a long time .", "my first visit to the denver facility was in august of 2018 , when dan was graciously willing to meet with me .", "barber - nichols which i may refer to as bni is a great fit for graham , since it meets all the criteria that most of you have heard me describe over the past several years .", "it is clearly a transformative acquisition for graham .", "certainly the most exciting activity in my time at graham and probably in the history of the company .", "it will increase the size of graham by 60 % on a pro forma basis and immediately accelerates our diversification strategy .", "we expect to see 10 months of revenue in fiscal 2022 or approximately 50 % growth .", "bni expands our defense business from $ 24 million in fiscal 2021 to a run rate of approximately $ 65 million to $ 70 million currently .", "since there was no overlap with our current defense business , this dramatically expands our platform .", "barber - nichols also has a $ 10 million in the aerospace business which is mostly related to the space industry .", "this will be another exciting market for us .", "looking forward , we expect more than half of our business to come from defense and aerospace .", "this is a fantastic complement to our refining and petrochemical platform .", "along with defense and aerospace , bni offers us opportunities for growth in cryogenics and advanced energy .", "as jim mentioned with a backlog of $ 100 million in addition to graham 's backlog of $ 137 million , we have a combined backlog of nearly $ 240 million of which 80 % is in defense and aerospace .", "this increased multiyear visibility reduced volatility of revenue and earnings and ability to grow organically and via m&a across multiple platforms is exciting .", "we clearly see some exciting organic growth opportunities .", "and yes , to be clear , once we have graham and barber - nichols working well together , we intend to look for more m&a growth opportunities .", "chris johnston and i are excited to engage with dan to identify further businesses to add to bni .", "as part of the deal , the owners of barber - nichols wanted some skin in the game , so approximately $ 9 million in graham shares were part of the purchase consideration .", "this represent 610,000 shares or approximately a 6 % increase in shares outstanding .", "i have mentioned numerous times that we would use a little equity if it made sense .", "clearly having the bni owners , who are remaining with us post acquisition to ask me for a stake in graham was another positive aspect of the deal .", "the transaction is expected to bring some very nice accretion , though the initial purchase accounting will likely put a near term damper on it .", "finally barber - nichols brings a strong management team , led by dan thoren who has nearly 30 years of barber - nichols , 24 of which as its president .", "dan is now ascending to president and chief operating officer of graham to utilize his capabilities across all of the combined company .", "matt malone , has taken over as the new president of bni .", "matt has strong leadership skills , a very high energy level which i expect will drive bni toward a very successful future .", "the remaining leadership team at bni is similarly top notch .", "this is a fantastic team that we are gaining along with the business .", "let me talk briefly about the deal structure .", "graham paid $ 70 million made up of $ 61 million of cash and $ 9 million of stock for 610,000 shares .", "out of the $ 61 million , $ 41 million was in cash from our balance sheet and we entered into a $ 20 million term loan for the remainder .", "this leaves us with over $ 20 million of cash , so our net debt position is zero , but it gives us flexibility to go after future organic and m&a investments .", "there is an earn out provision based on fiscal 2024 , essentially the third year of the deal , which will allow up to $ 14 million in additional cash payments .", "the earn out has a threshold , which if met would kick in at $ 8.75 million of ebitda in fiscal 2024 and provide a $ 7 million payout .", "if the ebitda achieved that year is $ 11 million , the payout increases to a maximum level of $ 14 million .", "between those two ebitda numbers the earn out would be interpolated .", "this acquisition assumed no synergies .", "we believe there will be benefits for the combined organization but not needing them to justify the deal was great .", "will graham bring some capabilities to barber - nichols , i believe so .", "but just as likely i believe barber - nichols will bring new capabilities to our current graham team .", "i mentioned dan and matt earlier , they will become graham named executive officers at our annual meeting at the end of july .", "along with the excitement of the acquisition , we also now have a far more efficient balance sheet .", "while having a lot of cash was comforting that dormant cash did not achieve a return for our shareholders .", "you all know that i 've desperately wanted to utilize that cash for growth and a stronger return .", "now with barber - nichols , i 'm confident that it will .", "we have entered into a new bank relationship with bank of america and it includes a $ 20 million term loan , which i mentioned earlier as well as a $ 30 million revolver .", "we also have a $ 10 million accordion feature available on top of that $ 30 million revolver .", "we do not expect to utilize the revolver much in the near term , but it will -- it provides us with more dry powder and flexibility going forward .", "we continue to have a relationship with hsbc now with the $ 7.5 million cash secured facility for certain bank guarantees in geographies where they have a strong presence .", "overall , our balance sheet will look much different , but in my view it will be far more efficient rather than overly conservative .", "we are now using our balance sheet for growth today and more so going forward .", "when our business development team that would be chris and i , talked about an ideal fit for graham , we could not have picked a better match than bni .", "before i continue , i would like to recognize chris johnston again .", "he has been working behind the scenes , most of you have not met him , but as i 've told many of you , he does a fantastic job for both m&a and as well as organic opportunities for us .",
