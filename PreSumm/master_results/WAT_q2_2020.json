over - year growth , our revenue results reflected modestly better market conditions than we had anticipated , an increasing impact of new products as well as strong execution by our global sales , service and operational teams .", "during the quarter , we also executed well on our plans to achieve meaningful near -

19 pandemic .", "that said , china 's pharma recurring revenues grew in the quarter across both large and small molecule which we expect to continue bolstering our confidence that we will see increasing instrument demand over time .", "china 's food and environmental markets were down in the second quarter , reflecting the continued funding pressure that is impacting government labs , partially offset by growth within independent labs .", "elsewhere in asia , recovery is a mixed picture with strength in certain geographies such as korea and slower recoveries in other regions such as japan and india .", "turning to the us , we are seeing a dynamic and somewhat uncertain environment with various states experiencing increasing covid -

19 containment efforts and european customers are adopting some of our new mass spec technology at a faster rate than other geographies as we typically see .", "aside from these current market dynamics , we remain sharply focused on our primary growth strategy of organic innovation .", "we believe we are well positioned to leverage our robust and growing new product pipeline as demand normalizes and we expect continuing increases in contribution from new products .", "looking at the waters product line , there is increasing evidence of traction of new products throughout the quarter particularly bioaccord and cyclic ims . in addition , we launched six new instruments year - to - date and have received very positive initial feedback .", "these new product launches were highlighted by the arc hplc , a rugged , reliable and modern hplc system that is a significant advancement , and enhances our strong technology leadership position in the core , liquid chromatography market .", "in our ta instruments product line , the three new products launched last quarter at pittcon have received strong customer interest .", "material science markets have been challenged , but these products are poised to support future growth and market share gains .", "in summary , the sales in our second quarter continued to be impacted by the covid - 19 pandemic .", "our revenue results reflected modestly better market conditions than we had anticipated , and increasing impact from our new products as well as strong execution by our global sales , service and operations teams .", "we also took decisive actions to manage our cost to ensure the largest portion of our 2020 savings plan in the second quarter , which as expected was a more challenging environment than the first quarter .", "this combination of better than expected top line performance with the benefits of our cost containment efforts enabled us to exceed our margin and earnings per share expectations .", "although risks remain with the uncertain trajectory of the global covid - 19 pandemic , we expect market conditions to improve modestly in the second half versus the first half of the year , and therefore have accelerated our growth investments to take advantage of opportunities as demand recovers .", "with that , i 'd like to pass the call over to sherry buck for a deeper review of our second quarter financials .", "in the second quarter , we recorded net sales of $ 520 million , a decrease of approximately 12 % in constant currency .", "currency translation decreased sales growth by approximately 1 % resulting in a sales decline of 13 % as reported .", "in the quarter , sales into our pharmaceutical market declined 10 % , sales into our industrial market declined 13 % while academic and governmental markets declined 21 % .", "looking at our product line growth , our recurring revenue , which represents the combination of precision chemistry products and service revenue declined 3 % in the quarter while instrument sales declined 23 % .", "as we noted last quarter , there was no year - over - year difference in the number of calendar days during the second or third quarters , but there are two additional calendar days in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2019 .", "chemistry revenues were down 4 % in the quarter , driven mostly by weakness in academic and governmental .", "on the service side of our business , revenues were down 2 % as mid single digit growth in service contract revenues were offset by a decline in on - demand service revenues and spare parts .", "breaking second quarter product sales down further , sales related to waters branded products and services declined 12 % , while sales of ta - branded products and services declined 20 % .", "combined , lc and lcms instrument platform sales declined 24 % and ta 's instrumentation system sales declined 20 % .", "looking at our growth rates in the second quarter geographically , and on a constant currency basis , sales in asia declined 12 % with china down 20 % .", "sales in americas declined 15 % , including a 14 % decline in the us and european sales were down 9 % .", "before i comment on our second quarter non-gaap financial performance versus the prior year , i would like to update you on the progress of our cost actions in response to the covid -
