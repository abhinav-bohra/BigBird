driven demand in the u.s. utility sector to start the fourth quarter , ongoing strength from our uk business along with the pickup in customer bidding and planning activity , we expect q4 rental and service revenues to improve by roughly 10 % from q3 .", "further , although visibility to the timing of mats sales is always a challenge to predict , it 's worth noting that several us utility companies have continued to publicly reconfirm their commitment to their capital plans .", "consequently , we believe we will see an uptick in year - end demand for product sales , potentially doubling the q3 results .", "combining the rs with the product sale expectation , this sets up for q4 to be the strongest revenue quarter of the year for the mats business .", "from a margin perspective , the extent of the year - end product sale demand will likely determine whether the mats business can return to double - digit operating margin in the fourth quarter .", "corporate office spending should remain near the q3 level in [ technical issues ] and we expect the effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to remain relatively in line with the year - to - date 2020 rate .", "with regards to cash flows , we have made solid progress in monetizing working capital over the past two quarters and see additional opportunities ahead with over $ 200 million of net working capital remaining on our books .", "more specifically , international receivables and global inventories remain well above historical levels .", "so we expect further reductions in excess working capital will continue to provide a tailwind to cash generation in the coming quarters .", "inventories will likely take several quarters to optimize depending on customer activity .", "meanwhile , reflective of our capital - light model , we expect limited net capital investments for the foreseeable future with capital deployment largely targeting industrial end market diversification efforts that provide a clear line of sight to cash flow and ebitda generation .", "as illustrated by our actions over the past two quarters , we are taking prudent steps to maintain positive cash flow with a particular focus on the remaining $ 67 million convertible note maturity at the end of next year .", "we expect that our cash on hand , cash generated from operations and the available capacity under our u.s. asset - based loan facility will provide sufficient liquidity to support our ongoing operations and satisfy our convertible note maturity .", "as we noted in the past , it remains our intention to fund the maturity without accessing public capital markets .", "as part of our capital structure management , we are evaluating additional sources of liquidity available to further enhance our capital structure .", "specifically , we maintain meaningful u.s. real estate as well as assets within our european operation that can be used to create additional liquidity through secured financings or alternative arrangements .", "it 's also worth noting that with our 30 -
