term investments in addition to them being a huge positive uplift to our ebitda and cash flow in the short to intermediate term .", "as we swapped properties in slower recovery markets for properties in faster recovery markets that also have significant upside from both operational improvements and capital investments .", "with the third quarter sale of villa florence in san francisco , since the pandemic began , we 've sold two older properties in san francisco and one in new york city , along with some rooftop antennas and the historic union station nashville for a total of $ 333 million .", "and we 've acquired two resorts in the southeast and two small b& bs in key west for a total of $ 384 million .", "we 're very excited about these swaps and the upside from the new acquisitions .", "not only did these transactions reduce our urban concentration and increase our resort concentration that these trades of san francisco , new york and nashville , for hollywood , florida , key west and the golden isles of georgia increase our leisure mix and reduce our business customer mix .", "while it might look like we 're focused on increasing our resort exposure , as discussed many times in the past , we remain opportunistic investors overall , utilizing risk - adjusted return forecasts and underwriting to determine both sales and acquisitions .", "and how others value properties and what others are willing to pay definitely impacts where and what we ultimately acquire since value is a key component of our risk - adjusted return investing approach .", "in that vein , over the last few months , we spent significant time evaluating the current values of our existing hotels and total portfolio .", "as a reminder , the value ranges we determined for each hotel are based upon the transaction market for similar properties in similar condition with similar opportunities and similar locations in the same markets .", "they 're also based upon whether management and flag are available or if the property is encumbered by those contractual arrangements .", "with a more active transaction market in the last three to four months , we feel there 's enough real market transaction information to now establish true tradable market values .", "and while these values will potentially move significantly and quickly in the next couple of years , we feel comfortable , again , publishing our overall gross and net asset values for our portfolio .", "we believe that our current net asset value is in the range of $ 30 per share at the low end to $ 35 per share at the high end and $ 32.50 at the midpoint , and we 're happy to discuss this in more detail in the q&a or in separate conversations over the next few weeks .", "i thought i 'd also touch on the current labor situation and update you on our current assessment of the ongoing margin opportunity in our portfolio as a result of the implementation of new operating models at all of our properties .", "in the last six to eight weeks , we believe the labor situation throughout our portfolio has improved significantly .", "as expected , as kids went back to school , more people got vaccinated , child care became more available and enhanced federal unemployment benefits expired , we 've seen more of our prior hotel associates coming back to work .", "and with lots of hard work , our property teams have also found more qualified candidates interested and willing to fill open positions .", "as a result , our properties have made significant progress in filling critical open positions and many of our properties are in good shape now with a more active pipeline for further hiring .", "in addition , it seems the h2b visa program is back up and running , and we expect significant numbers of h2b qualified workers to aid our seasonal properties like laplaya that have historically utilized this program and jekyll island , where we 'll be using the program for the first time beginning later this year or early next year .", "we also believe those current labor pressures we 're still experiencing will lessen over time as more workers come back to the labor force as the spread of the virus and cases decreased over time .", "in general , we 've not had to increase wages but we have made some adjustments here and there .", "this has been mostly at our resorts that are in markets where either we 're no longer where we wanted or needed to be in the market competitively or where we 've repositioned our properties higher through renovations and redevelopments .", "and we want to attract the best of the talent in the market to provide the highest level of service to match our higher rates .", "fortunately , our properties are generally at the higher end of their markets and are in a position to not only pay more as necessary but attract high - quality talent more easily because of the quality of our properties and the ability for associates to earn more money through not just wages and benefits , but higher tips and other gratuities .", "as you well know , we 've all been experiencing increasing levels of supply chain disruptions , including higher costs for many commodities like food and beverages , but also operating supplies in some of our services .", "we 've been able to successfully implement some very significant price increases throughout our portfolio for items such as food and beverage offerings , both in our outlets and through banquets and caving as well as charges for parking , event venues , audio visual equipment and services , resort and urban amenity fees , spot treatments , club dues and for other recreational activities .", "these increases have ranged from 5 % at the low end to as high as 25 % at the high end and 15 % is about average throughout the portfolio .", "we 've experienced little to no pushback on pricing increases so far .", "it seems both the leisure customer and the business customer are in great financial shape with plenty of discretionary income or high profits .", "and with prices increasing for all sorts of goods and services , our customers have been accepting of the increases .", "this pricing flexibility and customer acceptance should allow us to continue to be able to grow our pre-pandemic margins by 100 to 200 basis points based upon the restructured operating models developed during the pandemic , which utilize more cross- training , more efficient labor scheduling tools and more technology , among many efforts to continue our never -
