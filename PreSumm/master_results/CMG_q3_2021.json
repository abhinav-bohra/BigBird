over - year to $ 2 billion as comp sales grew 15.1 % .", "restaurant level margin of 23.5 % expanded 400 basis points over last year , and earnings per share adjusted for unusual items was $ 7.02 , representing 86.7 % year - over - year growth .", "the third quarter had a gaap tax benefit that i 'll discuss shortly , which is partially offset by expenses related to a previously disclosed modification to our 2018 performance share and transformation expenses , which netted to positively impact our earnings per share by $ 0.16 leading to gaap earnings per share of $ 7.18 .", "as we look ahead to q4 , there remains uncertainty on several fronts , including covid - related impacts as well as inflationary and staffing pressures .", "but given our strong underlying business momentum , we expect our comp to be in the low - to - mid double digits , which is encouraging considering that will be about 200 basis points less than pricing contribution during q4 versus q3 as we 've lap some of our delivery menu price increases .", "and our brisket lto will be for a partial quarter as compared to the full quarter of carne asada last year .", "let me now go through the p&l line items , beginning with cost of sales .", "our supply chain team has done an outstanding job , navigating the numerous industrywide disruption , which led to food costs being 30.3 % in q3 , a decrease of 200 basis points from last year .", "this is due primarily to leverage from menu price increases , which were partially offset by higher costs associated with beef and freight that unfortunately are continuing to worsen .", "it 's hard to predict how much of these headwinds will ultimately be temporary versus permanent but they are likely to persist for the foreseeable future .", "in addition , q4 will also include the higher cost brisket lto , which collectively will result in our food costs being in the low - 31 % range for the quarter .", "labor costs for the third quarter were 25.8 % , an increase of about 40 basis points from last year .", "this increase was driven by our strategy to increase average nationwide wages to $ 15 per hour , which is partially offset by menu price increases , sales leverage , and a one - time employee retention credit .", "given ongoing elevated wage inflation and greater new unit openings , we expect labor costs to be in the mid-26 % range in q4 .", "other operating costs for the quarter were 15.1 % , a decrease of 170 basis points from last year due primarily to price and sales leverage .", "marketing and promo costs for the quarter were 2.4 % , about 20 basis points lower than we spent last year .", "while q3 tends to be a seasonally lower advertising quarter , the timing of some initiatives also shifted into q4 this year .", "as a result , we anticipate marketing expense to be around 4 % in q4 to support smoked brisket and for the latest brand messaging under our behind the foil campaign .", "for the full year 2021 , marketing expense is expected to remain right about 3 % of sales .", "overall , other operating costs are expected to be in the mid-16 % range for the fourth quarter .", "looking at overall restaurant margins , we expect q4 to be in the 20 % to 21 % range .", "our q4 underlying margin would be around 22 % when you normalize marketing spend and remove the temporary headwind from the brisket lto .", "and the remaining cost pressure will continue to evaluate and take appropriate actions on menu prices to offset any lasting impacts .", "our value proposition remains strong , which we believe gives us a lot of pricing power .", "despite these challenges , we remain confident in our ability to drive restaurant level margins higher as our average unit volumes increase .", "g&a for the quarter was $ 146 million on a gaap basis or $ 137 million on a non-gaap basis , including $ 7.6 million for the previously mentioned modification for 2018 performance shares , and $ 1.6 million related to transformation and other expenses .", "g&a also includes about $ 100 million in underlying g&a , about $ 28 million related to non-cash stock compensation , about $ 8.5 million related to higher performance -

based bonus expense and employer taxes associated with shares that vest during the quarter as well as about $ 1.5 million related to our all - manager conference .", "our effective tax rate for q3 was 14.7 % on a gaap basis and 19.7 % on a non-gaap basis .", "both rates benefited from our option exercises and share vesting at elevated stock prices .", "in addition , our gaap tax rate included a return to provision benefit for additional nol generated on our 2020 federal income tax return and carried back to prior years .", "for q4 , we continue to estimate our underlying effective tax rate to be in the 25 % to 27 % range , though it may vary based on discrete items .", "our balance sheet remains healthy as we ended q3 with $ 1.2 billion in cash , restricted cash and investments with no debt along with a $ 500 million untapped revolver .", "during the quarter , we repurchased $ 99 million of our stock at average price of $ 1,813 and we expect to continue using excess free cash flow to opportunistically repurchase our stock .", "however , opening more chipotles continues to be the best return we can generate .", "during q3 , despite a few delays in opening timeline , we opened 41 new restaurants with 36 of these including a chipotlane .", "while we 're experiencing construction inflationary pressures , subcontractor labor shortages , critical equipment shortages and landlord delivery delays , our development team is doing an excellent job opening these new restaurants .", "in fact , we currently have more than 110 restaurants under construction , and while timing is somewhat unpredictable , this gives us confidence in ending the year at or slightly above the 200 new restaurants with now more than 75 % including a chipotlane versus our prior expectation of 70 % .", "also , the team has done a nice job building a robust new unit pipeline , which we believe will allow us to accelerate openings in 2022 .", "but because of the challenges i just mentioned and how they could impact the timeline , we will provide 2022 opening guidance during our q4 call .", "as of september 30th , we had a total of 284 chipotlanes , including 12 conversions and 8 relocations .", "they continue to enhance access and convenience for our guests , while demonstrating stellar performance .", "and while it 's early days , chipotlane conversions and relocations are yielding encouraging results .", "we will leverage our stage gate process to learn and refine our strategic approach to accelerating our chipotlane portfolio .", "you can see why we remain optimistic about our future ."], "summary_gold": "compname reports q3 earnings per share of $ 7.18 .<q>q3 earnings per share $ 7.18 .<q>q3 revenue rose 21.9 percent to $ 2.0 billion .<q>q3 adjusted earnings per share $ 7.02 excluding items .<q>qtrly comparable restaurant sales increased 15.1 % .<q>qtrly digital sales grew 8.6 % year over year to $ 840.4 million .<q>qtrly food , beverage and packaging costs in q3 were 30.3 % of revenue , decrease of 200 basis points compared to q3 of 2020 .<q>qtrly restaurant level operating margin was 23.5 % , an increase from 19.5 % in q3 of 2020 .<q>for q4 expect comparable restaurant sales to be in low to mid double -
