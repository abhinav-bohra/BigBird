party breweries and higher processing costs and finished goods keg inventory write - offs at company - owned breweries , partially offset by price increases and cost saving initiatives at company - owned breweries .", "excluding our current assessment of the impact of covid - 19 keg returns and other related direct costs , first quarter gross margin was 46.8 % .", "first quarter advertising , promotional and selling expense increased by $ 26.2 million in the first quarter in 2019 , primarily due to increased investments in media , production and local marketing , the addition of dogfish head brand -
