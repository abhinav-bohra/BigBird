day services propelled our digital growth .", "since the third quarter of 2019 , prior to the pandemic , q3 store sales have expanded by $ 3.8 billion , while digital sales have increased another $ 3.1 billion .", "this provides a vivid demonstration of the flexibility of our operating model to serve our guests no matter how they choose to shop .", "all of these results reflect the level of guest engagement far beyond what many would have imagined a few years ago when we started making huge investments throughout our business in our stores , new brands , same -

in - shop experiences .", "on top of that , of course , this will be our debut holiday season featuring ulta beauty at target .", "and on the subject of ulta beauty at target , our guests are telling us it 's clearly hitting the bullseye , with makeup , skincare , bath and body , hair care , and fragrance for more than 50 top brands now available at ulta beauty at target , both in -

up of seasonal hiring and team member training in advance of the holidays so everyone is ready to handle the additional volume .", "that 's what happens every year .", "but as brian and christina have already mentioned , this year , our teams have been facing additional out - of - the - ordinary challenges as they plan for and deliver record - setting volumes while facing unprecedented bottlenecks in the global supply chain .", "so while i 'm lucky to work with our amazing team every day , it 's at times like these that our team shines brightest .", "beyond their skill and expertise , they face every challenge with good nature and a collaborative mindset .", "i can't describe how proud i am to represent everything they 've accomplished this year as they 've delivered historically strong growth on top of record increases a year ago .", "within our supply chain , the team has been methodically working around multiple obstacles and challenges throughout the network , prioritizing our holiday - sensitive categories within our import receipts while thoughtfully planning domestic transportation to ensure products reach the shelf at the right time , and while we continue to see some periodic outages across different items and categories , wearing the holidays with a very healthy inventory position overall .", "specifically , at the end of the third quarter , inventory on the balance sheet was more than $ 2 billion higher than last year , representing growth of about 18 % from a year ago .", "looking back to the pre-covid period , our q3 ending inventory has grown more than $ 3.5 billion since the end of q3 2019 , representing 31 % growth over a two - year period .", "a sizable amount of this inventory will continue to flow to our stores over the next few weeks , and our team has clear visibility to where the inventory is located and when it will arrive in our stores .", "in our overseas operations , we 've benefited from a significant reduction in delay times .", "and , of course , given that we were already anticipating tight conditions many months ago , the team has been writing this year 's holiday purchase orders much earlier than last year to proactively mitigate the risk of both known and unexpected delays .", "we 're also benefiting from really strong performance across our domestic transportation network .", "and we 've secured the necessary capacity across both rail and over - the - road trucking to accommodate anticipated shipments throughout the fourth quarter .", "at the intersection of our overseas and domestic supply chains , the team continues to work around significant port delays , diverting shipments to less - congested entry points and relying on air freight in certain cases .", "and while target 's port operations have long been considered best in class , our team has been actively collaborating with government and port officials to help find solutions that will allow everyone 's containers to move through the ports more quickly .", "and we 're encouraged with the changes that have recently been put in place .", "i also want to pause and emphasize the ongoing collaboration that 's been happening between our supply chain , merchandising , and marketing teams .", "these teams have worked together to develop promotional and marketing plans that are much more fluid and nimble than in the past , enabling the incorporation of real - time data on inventory availability and location within our holiday plans in order to maximize their impact to the benefit of both our guests and operations .", "in our stores , the team is preparing for fourth quarter all year .", "and they 're energized and ready to serve our guests throughout the season .", "this will be the first holiday season since we launched our new service initiative , which is all about empowering our teams and increasing their confidence to build authentic connections with our guests .", "also , new this year , we 've rolled out a new point - of - sale system across more than 90 % of our stores , providing more speed , efficiency , and enhanced experience at both the checkout and our service counter .", "to continue building on an industry - leading in - store pickup and drive up experiences , we 've been rolling out new capabilities all year .", "these efforts include capital projects to add permanent storage capacity in more than 200 high - volume stores , investing in flexible fixtures to provide temporary storage areas to support seasonal peak , adding thousands of new items to the list available for pickup and drive up , doubling the number of drive up parking stalls compared with last year , and designating stall numbers to help our teams deliver drive up orders more efficiently .", "even as we 're adding these new capabilities , we 're also supporting our long - standing commitment to providing a safe shopping experience , maintaining the enhanced covid cleaning and safety routines that we implemented throughout the pandemic .", "we 've also been investing in team member hours , processes , and training to prepare our team to handle record freight and fulfillment volumes this year , all on enhancing safety messaging and actively monitoring processes to protect the safety of both our guests and our team .", "and , of course , as brian mentioned , our team is focused on being fully staffed across the store and supply chain throughout the holiday season .", "our stores have been hitting our seasonal hiring milestones .", "and because of the advancements we 've made in scheduling this year , average hours per store team member are running significantly higher this year in comparison to past years .", "in fact , unlike what you 're hearing from many others , because of the investments we 've made in pay and benefits and our focus on team member training and engagement , the hourly turnover rate in our stores is actually running lower this year compared with 2019 , particularly for our newly hired team members .", "and we 're continuing to invest in our team .", "following the recent rollout of the most comprehensive debt - free education program in the industry , we announced that to sustain our momentum through the holidays , we 're offering pay premiums during peak periods in our stores and distribution centers over the holiday season .", "as we 've said many times , our investments in the team are the most productive ones we 've made .", "turning to the work of the properties team , we expect to finish about 145 remodels in 2021 , having completed more than 40 remodels prior to the end of q3 with more than 100 additional projects slated to wrap up before the holiday .", "the team also opened another 15 new stores in the third quarter , bringing the year - to - date total up to 30 .", "among those projects , we 've opened new stores ranging from 11,000 to 160,000 square feet , which demonstrates the flexibility we 've developed to design the optimal store size for an individual neighborhood based on their local needs and available real estate in the market .", "to increase the capacity and efficiency of our supply chain , our team has also opened two new distribution centers this year .", "in addition , we have two new sortation centers set to open in the fourth quarter , with two more on track to open early next year .", "these are highly complex projects across multiple geographies , which require precise coordination across a large number of regional construction providers along with a diverse group of fixture and equipment vendors , all of whom have been facing the same bottlenecks we 've been facing in our merchandise supply chain .", "our construction team has handled all of these challenges with good humor and resilience , allowing us to continue reaching guests in new neighborhoods and support the growing supply chain needs of the entire chain .", "in support of those growing needs , we recently announced that we 're adding more than 30,000 permanent positions across our supply chain network to support the growth we expect to continue delivering in the fourth quarter and beyond .", "these team members will support new buildings in our regional dc network , adding replenishment capacity to support an increasingly productive store network .", "they 'll also be staffing and supporting our new sortation centers , which deliver efficiency , speed , and additional capacity in support of last mile fulfillment .", "and it 's amazing to pause and look back at how much our network needs have grown in a short time .", "for the entire fiscal year in 2018 , our business generates $ 74 billion in sales .", "less than three years later , our business had already delivered $ 74 billion in sales through the third quarter , with the biggest quarter of the year still ahead of us .", "our team and supply chain infrastructure have done an outstanding job in supporting that growth .", "and given that we do n't expect it to end anytime soon , we are committed to growing our physical footprint and our team , so they can continue to deliver on behalf of all of our stakeholders in q4 and beyond .", "when i first started working here in 1996 , target delivered just under $ 18 billion in revenue for what was then called dayton hudson corporation .", "while many things have changed since then , both in retail and at this company , we successfully maintain what 's made target 's successful and unique for nearly 60 years .", "we 've maintained our focus on offering affordable design in support of a unique merchandise assortment , providing a differentiated and outstanding shopping experience , investing in the best team in retail , and giving back to the communities that sustain us .", "this is another example of what we call the power of and .", "the reason target has stayed relevant for so many decades is our ability to stay true to our values and continually evolve in the way we serve our guests .", "over time , we 've emphasized our commitment to making the appropriate investments in our business , ones that will deepen target 's relationship with our guests , driving engagement which ultimately leads them to shop at target more often .", "and while it's our job to focus on driving performance every day , we 've committed to making investment decisions with a long - term perspective , not limiting our horizon to a month , a season , a quarter , or even a year , but thinking about how to position target as a leading retailer for generations .", "that 's how i think about our third quarter .", "in the face of multiple challenges in the external environment , we maintained our focus on our guests and took specific actions to ensure we have a healthy inventory position going into the holidays , even though those actions involve some incremental cost .", "and importantly , as we face those decisions , we had the resources we needed including the best team in retail , a sophisticated global supply chain , and a durable model that could accommodate those guest - focused investments .", "and while we 're making these decisions with a focus on the long term , we 've already seen the benefit of this year 's inventory investments , given that they helped to power third quarter traffic and sales growth that exceeded our expectations .", "in addition , given strong expense discipline across the organization , we benefited from a compelling amount of leverage on our sg&a and d&a expenses , resulting in solid earnings per share growth despite the sizable investments we were choosing to make .", "as brian mentioned , our 12.7 % comp in the third quarter came on top of a nearly 21 % increase a year ago .", "as expected , within the quarter , we saw a shift in a portion of our back - to - school sales back into august , given that most schools across the country began the school year with in - person learning .", "as a result , our august comp was our strongest of the quarter , our september comp dipped down to about 10 % , and we accelerated back into the low - teens in october .", "among the component drivers of our sales , growth continues to be driven by traffic , even as we retain nearly all of the basket growth that happened a year ago .", "specifically , third quarter traffic increased 12.9 % on top of a 4.5 % increase last year .", "while average ticket declined only slightly , about 20 basis points , after growing more than 15 % a year ago .", "among our sales channels , stores comparable sales grew 9.7 % in the quarter on top of 9.9 % last year , while digital comp sales grew 29 % on top of 155 % growth a year ago .", "within our digital fulfillment , sales on orders shipped to home increased slightly over last year , while same - day services grew about 60 % on top of a more than 200 % increase a year ago .", "among those same - day options , both in - store pickup and shipt grew more than 30 % in the quarter , while drive up grew more than 80 % on top of more than 500 % a year ago .", "put another way , since 2019 , sales through drive up have expanded more than 10 times for about $ 1.4 billion in the third quarter alone .", "moving down the p&l , our third quarter gross margin rate of 28 % was 2.6 percentage points lower than a year ago .", "among the drivers , core merchandising accounted for 2 percentage points , or more than three quarters of the rate decline , driven primarily by incremental freight and other inventory costs .", "among the other gross margin drivers , payroll growth in our supply chain accounted for about 70 basis points of pressure , while category sales mix contributed about 10 basis points of benefit .", "notably , digital fulfillment had an approximately neutral impact on gross margin rate in the quarter as the cost associated with higher digital volume were offset by the benefit of a shift in fulfillment mix toward our same - day options , which have meaningfully lower average unit costs compared with traditional e-commerce .", "on the sg&a expense line , we saw about 160 basis points of improvement in the third quarter , reflecting disciplined cost management combined with the leverage benefit of unexpectedly strong sales .", "on the d&a line , we saw about 20 basis points of rate improvement as sales growth more than offset the impact of higher accelerated depreciation , which reflects the continued ramp - up in our remodel program .", "altogether , our third quarter operating margin rate of 7.8 % was about 70 basis points lower than a year ago but more than 2 percentage points higher than two years ago .", "on a dollar basis , operating income was 3.9 % higher than a year ago and double the number recorded in the third quarter of 2019 .", "moving to the bottom of the p&l , our third quarter gaap earnings per share of $ 3.04 was 52 % higher than last year when we recorded more than $ 500 million of interest expense on early debt retirement .", "on the adjusted earnings per share line , where we excluded early debt retirement expense , we earned $ 3.03 in the quarter , representing an 8.7 % increase from a year ago .", "compared with two years ago , both gaap and adjusted earnings per share have increased more than 120 % .", "turning now to capital deployment , i 'm going to start as always with our long - term priorities .", "first , we look to fully invest in our business , and projects that meet our strategic and financial criteria .", "next , we support the dividend and look to build on our long history of annual increases , which we 've maintained every year since 1971 .", "and finally , we return any excess cash within the limits of our middle a credit ratings through share repurchases over time .", "on the capex line , we 'd invested $ 2.5 billion through the first three quarters of 2021 and expect to reach about $ 3.3 billion for the full year .", "as i mentioned last quarter , this is somewhat lower than our expectation going into the year and reflects a retiming of project spending into next year , given that we 've experienced delays on some projects relating to external factors like permitting and inspections in some communities .", "however , as john mentioned earlier , we 're eager to invest in a long list of productive growth opportunities over the next few years , adding new stores , remodeling existing stores , building replenishment capacity in our supply chain , and rolling out additional sortation centers .", "as of today , we continue to believe these investments will amount to capex in the $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion range in 2022 , and we 'll continue to refine our view in the months ahead .", "turning now to dividends , we paid $ 440 million in dividends in the third quarter , up $ 100 million from last year .", "this increase reflects a 32 % increase in the per - share dividend , partially offset by a decline in share count .", "i want to pause here and take note of the fact that with the payment of our december dividend , we 'll officially achieve our 50th consecutive year of annual increases in the per - share dividend , something very few companies have achieved .", "and lastly , given our cash position and strong cash generation by our operations , we continue to have ample capacity for share repurchases within the limits of our middle a ratings , even after we 've made robust investments in capex and dividends .", "in the third quarter , we deployed $ 2.2 billion to repurchase 8.8 million of our shares , bringing our year - to - date total up to $ 4.9 billion .", "as i 've mentioned in prior quarters , given our continued strong financial performance , our debt leverage has been lower and cash on the balance sheet has been higher than we'd expect to maintain over the longer term .", "as a result , going forward , we expect to increase our leverage and reduce our cash position at a pace that 's consistent with our financial expectations , credit rating goals , and assessment of the external environment .", "i 've mentioned before that the timeline to move those metrics fully back to historical levels will likely be a multi- year journey .", "and the rapidly changing conditions we 've seen over the last two years demonstrate why it 's prudent to maintain a thoughtful pace .", "as always , i 'll end my review of performance with our after - tax return on invested capital , which measures the quality of our current performance in the context of the investments we 've made over time .", "for the trailing 12 months through the end of q3 , our business generated an after -
