leading today 's discussion will be joe saffire , chief executive officer of life storage ; and andy gregoire , chief financial officer .<q>second quarter same - store revenue accelerated significantly to 14.7 % year - over - year , more than double the 7.3 % growth produced in the first quarter .<q>that occupancy contributed to very positive rent roll - up and substantially lower discounting on the new rentals .<q>the largest negative variance during the quarter occurred in repairs and maintenance and real estate taxes .<q>the increases were partially offset by an 11 % decrease in internet marketing expenses .<q>last night , we reported adjusted quarterly funds from operations of $ 1.20 per share for the second quarter , an increase of 27.7 % over the same period last year .<q>our net debt to recurring ebitda ratio decreased to 5 times , and our debt service coverage increased to a healthy 5.3 times at june 30th .<q>at quarter end , we had $ 360 million available on our line of credit , and we have no significant debt maturities until april of 2024 when $ 175 million becomes due .<q>our average debt maturity is 6.2 years .<q>we have substantial liquidity available to continue growing our asset base with investment opportunities that provide our shareholders with attractive risk - adjusted returns .<q>excluding property taxes , we continue to expect other expenses to increase between 2.25 % and 3.25 % , while property taxes are expected to increase 6.75 % to 7.75 % .<q>our balance sheet remains strong .<q>we have also increased our anticipated acquisitions by $ 325 million to between $ 800 million and $ 1 billion .<q>and with that , i will hand it over to andy to provide further details on the quarter and revisions to our guidance .<q>our actual results may differ from those projected due to risks and uncertainties with the company 's business .<q>also , as a reminder , during today 's question - and - answer session , we ask that you please limit yourself to two questions to allow time for everyone who wishes to participate .
i 'm quynh mcguire , vice president of investor relations .<q>and has been back up and running for a few weeks now , and while it was a major inconvenience operationally and commercially , the impact on our consolidated results for the first and second quarter is expected at less than 5 % and already baked into our full - year guidance .<q>employee travel , we continue to limit those to essential - only trips .<q>an example of that would be the recent deployment of our zero harm training modules for front - line employees as well as peer - to - peer workshops .<q>now , with covid vaccination rates increase , we 're resuming this training at selective locations .<q>as always we closely follow social distancing measures and masking protocols , and also we 're conducting hazard assessments for certain tasks in order to protect our employees from the highest job site risks .<q>and those who need to come into the office must use facial masks and observe all social distancing protocols when not located inside an enclosed workspace .<q>we 're postponing an official return to the office until september 7 , just after the us labor day holiday , with limited office return , starting july 1 , for those who would like to choose that option .<q>the pandemic has brought the work - life balance issue to the forefront , so we have asked our employees for suggestions on how to improve that aspect of their lives .<q>now , there were many interesting ideas to consider , and ultimately , we plan to implement certain measures over time .<q>and while we have n't ironed out all of the final details as of yet , it 's fair to say that we realize that a one - size - all -- fits - all approach is not fitting for an organization that 's spread out as we are in many smaller employee pockets .<q>what 's fit for pittsburgh is not necessarily what fits for nyborg , denmark or sydney , australia .<q>one thing that 's for certain though and that is our approach to flexibility in the workplace will reach heights we would n't have ever imagined prior to the pandemic .<q>on slide 8 , we see an overview of our operations and planning efforts at our facility in stickney , illinois , the tar plant experienced approximately one month of unplanned downtime , beginning march 20 .<q>now to [ phonetic ] notable accomplishments during the quarter .<q>the l'anse group led all koppers ' teams worldwide in practicing proactive leading activities related to safety and zero lagging indicators .
i 'll now discuss the financial results .<q>specific to cabinet components , we believe that the semi-custom segment , which is the main segment we serve , again outperformed the stock segment .<q>and according to many of our oem customers , lead times to their consumers are being extended while backlogs continue to increase .<q>demand for windows and doors remains solid .<q>in the north american residential housing market , both new construction and repair and remodel remain strong .<q>prior to discussing the detail by segment , i 'm going to provide some color on the ever - changing macroeconomic conditions of the markets in which we serve .<q>we have had success in these areas and believe this focus will continue to generate value for our shareholders .<q>however , we continue to stay focused on operational excellence projects and other initiatives that improve our return on invested capital and our ability to generate cash flow .<q>similar to most others in the building products space , we are facing inflationary pressures and labor shortages .<q>operational performance was excellent across all segments .<q>we are pleased to report another quarter of solid results as demand for our products remains strong and exceeded our expectations .<q>to summarize , on a consolidated basis for the full year , we now expect to generate net sales growth of approximately 23 % year over year to the midpoint of guidance while maintaining adjusted ebitda margin in the low 12 % range .<q>but we do not expect to realize margin expansion .<q>looking ahead to q4 , we will have a very tough comp .<q>although markets are slowly beginning to reopen in the u.k. and europe , continued travel restrictions , coupled with an underbuilt housing market bodes well for demand in our markets .<q>this continued into q2 and is ongoing .
this is jim koch , founder and chairman .<q>we 're slowly reopening our hospitality locations , which were closed since march , with a focus on outdoor service and takeout .<q>our accelerated depletions growth has been challenging operationally .<q>we 've been experiencing out of stocks and we expect wholesaler inventories to remain very tight for the rest of the summer .<q>in particular , the additional truly volumes have come at a higher incremental cost , due to an increased usage of third - party breweries , which is negatively impacting our gross margin expectation for the year .<q>we 'll continue to invest to increase capacity as appropriate to meet the needs of our business and take full advantage of the fast - growing hard seltzer category .<q>we 're a very competitive business , but we 're optimistic for continued growth of our current brand portfolio .<q>we remain prepared to forsake short - term earnings , as we invest to sustain long - term profitable growth in line with the opportunities that we see .<q>based on information in hand , year - to - date depletions reported to the company through the 28 weeks ended july 11 , 2020 , are estimated to have increased approximately 42 % from the comparable weeks in 2019 .<q>excluding the dogfish head impact , depletions increased 37 % .<q>now , i 'm going to hand it over to frank who will provide the financial details .<q>earnings per diluted share were $ 4.88 , an increase of $ 2.52 per diluted share from the second quarter of 2019 .<q>this increase was primarily due to increased revenue driven by shipment growth of 39.8 % partly offset by lower gross margins and higher operating expenses .<q>we began seeing the impact of covid - 19 pandemic in our business in early march .<q>to -date , the direct financial impact of the pandemic has primarily shown in significantly reduced keg demand from the on- premise channel and higher labor and safety related cost at our breweries .<q>we believe distributor inventory as of june 27 , 2020 averaged approximately 2.5 weeks on hand and was lower than prior year levels due the supply chain capacity constraints .
these types of statements are subject to various known and unknown risks , uncertainties , assumptions , and other factors , including those described in mfa 's annual report on form 10 - k for the year ended december 31 , 2020 , and other reports that it may file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission .<q>on the financing side , you can see that two - thirds of our asset - backed financing is nonmark to market with over 70 % of the nonmark - to - market financing in the form of securitizations as we continue to term out and reduce the cost of nonmark - to - market debt .<q>as craig has already noted , mfa delivered solid results for the second quarter , highlighted by higher net interest income on our residential whole loan investments .<q>before diving into the details , i want to point out two important changes that impact the way our results are presented this quarter .<q>while noninterest income , which primarily reflects market value changes , continues to be presented in other income .<q>secondly , as we noted in our last earnings call , starting this quarter , we decided to elect the fair value option for all acquisitions of the purchased performing loans .<q>this includes acquisitions of non-qm , fix and flip , single - family rental , and agency - eligible investor loans .<q>purchase performing loans acquired prior to this quarter continue to be accounted for at carrying value , so we will continue to present the economic book value metric to capture the impact of fair value changes for these loans .<q>further , we can now present interest yield and net interest spread information for all loans in our portfolio , which should make our results easy to review and more comparable to our peers .<q>turning now to the details of our q2 2021 results .<q>net income to common shareholders was $ 58.5 million or $ 0.13 per share .<q>as craig also noted interest expense again declined primarily due to the ongoing efforts to use securitization and other forms of more durable and lower - cost financing .<q>similarly to the prior quarter , interest income from our securities investments included approximately $ 8 million of accretion on an msr term note investment that was redeemed at par but that we have taken an impairment charge on in q1 of 2020 .<q>we reduced our overall cecl allowance on carrying value loans to $ 54.3 million , reflecting lower loan balances and adjustments to estimated levels of future unemployment and home price appreciation used in our credit loss modeling .<q>this reversal and other net adjustments to our cecl reserves positively impacted net income for the quarter by $ 8.9 million .<q>actual charge - off experience continues to remain very modest , with approximately $ 1.6 million of net charge - offs taken in the six - month period ended june 30 , 2021 .
along those lines , recall two adjustments during 2020 , including a non-cash charge in the first quarter of 2020 related to the sale of 703 locomotives for $ 385 million and a $ 99 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2020 related to an equity method investment .<q>employees from across the company have volunteered to provide support in our principal training facility and it's all hands - on deck ; number two , streamlining the hiring and onboarding process .<q>we 've trimmed weeks from the process of first identifying a candidate to have them on board ; three , increasing trainee pay and offering incentives such as signing , retention , and referral bonuses ; four , lengthening and combining trains .<q>we 've made solid progress in this regard ; and finally , five , we 're using a variety of techniques to optimize our existing crews , including realigning crew districts and making crew bases more fungible .<q>our people are getting creative and rising to the challenge , and resource additions are bearing fruit as we 've onboarded over 3 x more conductor trainees in january than any month in 2021 .<q>these trainees will promote throughout the second quarter , which is when we expect to start improving train and engine service staffing levels .<q>we do expect to see some relief in critical crew bases during q1 as trainees that started in 2021 became promoted , though we are still experiencing high levels of attrition in those same areas .<q>so when looking at the year as a whole , our plan is to leverage productivity gains to absorb volume growth while getting the workforce rebalanced to drive improvements in service quality .<q>let 's unpack the productivity discussion a little more on slide 10 .<q>we 've improved average train weight and length 21 % and 20 % , respectively , since mid-2019 when top21 was launched .<q>this has been a key to our success and will continue to be so going forward .<q>larger trains reduce labor intensity , improve locomotive productivity , improve fuel efficiency and provide our customers with a platform for growth .<q>we have efforts in the pipeline to continue this trend : first , on the infrastructure front , in 2021 , we launched work on 9 siding extensions , one of which was quickly completed and in service by the fourth quarter .<q>most of the others will be completed throughout 2022 ; second , our very capital efficient and high - performing dc to ac locomotive modernization program is ongoing .<q>and as shown on the slide , we are pulling five key levers to do so , including : number one , incorporating additional recruiting and training resources to increase hiring .<q>as a reminder , this is a dual - purpose program to rebuild engines at the end of their life while converting them to the latest and greatest technology .
gary will discuss asset quality and provide further detail on our loan portfolios .<q>this quarter 's record mortgage banking income of $ 17 million better reflects the fundamentals in the results without msr impairment as the mortgage banking business set a new production record for the quarter of $ 869 million .<q>turning to our participation in the paycheck protection program .<q>i would first like to recognize our teams for their support of our customers and communities throughout these extraordinary circumstances .<q>our employees have worked tirelessly to ensure businesses receive critical funding during a time when regions within our footprint experienced extended shut down , particularly in our metro markets in pennsylvania and the mid-atlantic , and when many borrowers turned from larger banks to f.n.b. to accommodate their needs .<q>as part of the ppp origination process , each borrower opened an f.n.b. account , which supports our efforts to bring in new households .<q>looking ahead , we are optimistic that borrowers will be able to deploy these funds in businesses around the footprint we open .<q>as an organization , we leveraged our technology infrastructure and expertise already in place to quickly adapt and accommodate our customers in a challenging remote environment .<q>coupled with significant financial aid and employee volunteerism in our communities , our efforts have helped tens of thousands of small businesses during the pandemic , and supported the retention of hundreds of thousands of jobs .<q>from the beginning of the covid - 19 crisis , f.n.b. has upheld consistent volumes of total transactions -- deposit transactions by providing customers with a seamless transition from physical to online and mobile engagement .<q>this was made possible from the significant investment we 've committed to digital -- our digital and online platforms over the last decade .<q>in fact , the appointment setting feature on our new website that went live in january enabled f.n.b. to continue serving clients safely in our branches throughout the crisis .<q>we grew from 26 monthly appointments in january to 2,700 appointments in april .<q>the rapid shift to remote services accelerated the enhancements to our digital strategy , and we 're already under way , and minimized disruption for our customers .<q>with interest rate expectations now reflecting lower for longer , it is important we continue to build on our recent success in capital markets , mortgage banking , wealth management and insurance .<q>i will now share some updates regarding our operations and delivery teams .
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied as a result of various risks , uncertainties and important factors , including those discussed in the risk factors , md&a and other sections of our annual report on form 10 - k and our other sec filings .<q>this replaces a legacy store delivery model where we hold appliances in stockrooms and storage containers behind our stores and then leverage store - based trucks and associates to deliver these products to customers ' homes .<q>to say this legacy process is inefficient would be an extreme understatement .<q>the new market - based delivery model is already driving higher appliance sales , improved profitability , lower inventory , higher on - time delivery rates and improved customer satisfaction .<q>and we 're freeing up space in our stockrooms , which will enable us to expand our same - day and next - day pro and diy fulfillment capabilities in the near future .<q>over the next 18 - plus months .<q>with this new delivery model , we will continue to drive sales , inventory turns and operating leverage through a technology - driven , simplify and customer - centric process .<q>before i close , i 'd like to share my perspective on the home improvement market as well as lowe 's opportunity to win in this market .<q>residential investment is expected to remain high due to historically low mortgage rates while home prices continue to appreciate .<q>we 're also pleased that we continue to see higher household formation trends and longer - term wallet share shift to the home .<q>it 's also worth noting that any near - term pressures on housing turnover is not related to an economic downturn as typical .<q>in fact , there is more housing demand than supply , resulting in home prices continuing to rise .<q>and because of this , consumers have an increased confidence in repairing and remodeling their homes .<q>as a reminder , approximately two - thirds of lowe 's annual sales are generated from repair and maintenance activity .<q>further , our research shows that it will take years for the supply of homes to meet the projected demand .<q>this remains a very positive indicator for home improvement .
this is allison lausas , vice president and chief accounting officer for idex corporation .<q>automotive production pullbacks due to microprocessor shortages have tempered the performance of our banded business .<q>larger tender activity is slowly increasing within the global fire rescue markets , but we feel these market challenges will persist into 2022 .<q>in fire & safety , north america fire oem production continues to struggle due to supply chain challenges .<q>price capture and volume offsets faced stronger headwinds within the segment due to higher direct oem exposure and higher levels of material intensity due to vertical integration .<q>we continue to win share through our targeted growth initiatives , and our intentionality around identifying opportunities that grow faster than the broader market is paying off .<q>semiconductor , food and pharma , analytical instrumentation , and life sciences all performed well .<q>moving to the health & science technologies segment .<q>in other words , excluding the impact of flow md , fmt organic sales would have grown 15 % instead of 7 % as reported .<q>it impacted fmt 's organic sales by 8 % .<q>as we noted last quarter , our flow md business has experienced a significant pullback in customers ' capital investments .<q>we are cautiously optimistic on energy as increased fuel prices and concerns over energy shortages have the potential to trigger investment .<q>the chemical and energy markets continue to lag primarily due to limited capital investment .<q>municipal spending is steady , and there is general optimism around future increased government funding .<q>our water businesses continue to perform well .<q>third - quarter net income was $ 116 million , which resulted in an earnings per share of $ 1.51 .
our fourth quarter completed another year of robust and sustained growth .<q>and when consumers shop , they are buying more than they were pre-pandemic .<q>our flavor solutions segment grew 14 % , reflecting higher base volume growth in new products as well as pricing actions to partially offset cost inflation and contributions for our fona and cholula acquisitions .<q>on a two - year basis , our sales also increased double digits with strong growth in all three regions .<q>turning to emea , which has continued its strong momentum .<q>we are winning in all channels with double - digit fourth quarter growth to quick - service restaurants or qsrs , branded foodservice customers and packaged food and beverage customers .<q>recovery has been robust in the away - from - home part of the portfolio , and growth in our at - home offerings has been outstanding .<q>as for the fourth quarter and in line with what we have said in the past , limited time offers and promotional activities can cause some sales volatility from quarter to quarter .<q>i 'm pleased to share highlights of our full fiscal year , including an update on our cholula and fona acquisitions , starting on slide 10 .<q>versus 2019 , we grew sales 20 % , which reflects the continuation of consumers cooking and using flavor more at home and the strength of our brands .<q>we have consistently driven industry - leading sales growth resulting in mccormick being named to the latest fortune 500 .<q>at year end , our board of directors announced a 9 % increase in our quarterly dividend , marking our 36th consecutive year of dividend increases .<q>we have paid dividends every year since 1925 and are proud to be a dividend aristocrat .<q>finally , we continue to be recognized for doing what 's right for people , communities and the planet .<q>during the year , mccormick was named the united nations global compact lead company and awarded the inaugural terra carta seal from his royal highness , the prince of wales , for our industry leadership in creating a sustainable future .<q>and just last week , corporate knights ranked mccormick in their 2022 global 100 sustainability index as the world 's 14th most sustainable corporation , and for the sixth consecutive year , no .
last night , we released results for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 , copies of which are posted in the investor relations section of our website .<q>the transaction reinforces our commitment to sustainability and was one of the first sustainability - linked revolving credit agreements in the u.s. chemical industry .<q>lastly , as a chemical industry , we need to attract the next generation of talented and diverse candidates into our field of chemistry .<q>this initiative will have a lasting and transformational impact on the students and our industry and we are proud to be an inaugural sponsor .<q>overall , we had a very successful 2021 in terms of financial performance and progress against our strategic objectives .<q>this well - rounded performance is a testament to the positioning of our portfolio and our exceptional team .<q>now a few comments on the fourth quarter .<q>i am pleased to report solid fourth quarter results with adjusted earnings per share of $ 1.11 .<q>this performance was 63 % above the same quarter last year despite the effects of the semiconductor chip shortage and ongoing global supply chain disruptions , as well as a higher level of maintenance spending due to the timing of turnarounds .<q>we also continue the momentum of battery materials and ended the year with ebitda in our previously communicated range of $ 15 million to $ 20 million .<q>cash flow from operations was strong at $ 100 million in the quarter despite the impact of higher raw material prices .<q>i will start with discussing results in the reinforcement materials segment .<q>the increases were principally due to higher unit margins and higher volumes .<q>higher margins were driven by higher spot pricing , particularly in asia .<q>we anticipate higher input costs in the first quarter that will temporarily impact results until our latest round of announced price increases and surcharges can be fully implemented to recoup the rising costs .<q>volumes were impacted during the quarter , largely due to two plant outages as we discussed on last quarter 's call .
i 'm very proud of our accomplishments in what has been an unprecedented and challenging environment over the past year and a half .<q>ademir will discuss our financial performance in greater detail later in the call .<q>as far as our outlook , in fiscal 2022 , we expect stronger financial performance reflecting positive demand trends , the impact of additional productivity initiatives and our significantly strengthened operating profile .<q>revenue increased $ 28 million or 62.7 % year - on - year , reflecting a 42.2 % organic growth rate or an approximate $ 19 million increase .<q>the renco acquisition contributed approximately $ 7.3 million in revenue and continues to be a highly complementary fit with our magnetics portfolio .<q>our electronics operating margin increased to 21.6 % compared to 13.1 % in the year ago quarter , reflecting operating leverage associated with revenue growth and productivity initiatives , partially offset by increased raw material cost .<q>we continue to leverage the sales synergies of our agile acquisition in markets such as semiconductors and through the expanded capabilities it has provided us .<q>in particular , nbos contributed in excess of $ 15 million in fiscal 2021 compared to our prior estimate of $ 12 million on our third quarter earnings call .<q>with our gs engineering acquisition now integrated , we have further globalized the business and leveraged its technological advantages , resulting in a very strong backlog for soft trim demand as the auto industry focuses on interior comfort of vehicles and increasingly replaces leather with sustainable materials .<q>turning to slide 6 , the scientific segment .<q>this is the first product in the marketplace which enables auto defrost while guaranteeing vaccines remain below critical temperatures , thus eliminating the need to manually defrost the freezer .<q>the development of this product is reflective of our focus on increasing the exposure to proprietary technologies and growing our intellectual property portfolio .<q>turning to the engineering technologies segment on slide 7 .<q>a few of our actions which i wanted to highlight include continued lean initiatives implemented across our production plant footprint and enhanced strategic sourcing to drive direct material synergies .<q>we ended fiscal 2021 with strong fourth quarter results and solid execution on our growth strategy .<q>as reflected in our backlog trends , we are continuing to see strong demand across many of our product lines and all geographies at electronics .
following our remarks , we will open the call for analyst questions .<q>delta led this outstanding performance , delivering another quarter of robust double - digit growth driven by strength in e-commerce and trade channels .<q>north american sales increased 16 % or 10 % , excluding acquisitions .<q>net acquisitions contributed 2 % to its growth and currency contributed another 1 % .<q>plumbing growth continued to be strong with sales up 16 % against the 13 % comp in the third quarter of last year .<q>we expect this increase to continue into the fourth quarter and these costs continue to normalize .<q>as planned during the quarter , we increased certain expenses such as headcount , advertising and marketing to a more normalized level to support our brands .<q>sg&a as a percentage of sales was 16.7 % .<q>we expect the exit this year price cost neutral .<q>we will offset these costs with additional pricing actions and productivity initiatives .<q>gross margin of 34.2 % is impacted by higher commodity and logistics cost in the quarter .<q>in local currency , international sales increased a robust 15 % or 18 % excluding acquisitions and divestitures against the healthy 9 % comp .<q>the strong performance was driven by outstanding execution to achieve volume growth in propane , faucets , showers and spas , and by increased selling prices .<q>with strong brand recognition and channel relationships , delta continues to drive consumer demand for its products .<q>hansgrohe delivered strong growth and demand continue to improve across europe and numerous other countries .<q>when comparing to q3 2019 , our third quarter pro sales are up over 35 % .
once again , this is john bruno .<q>in addition to the historically high level of commodity raw material prices , we 're also experiencing rising costs in other areas , such as labor and utilities .<q>we expect to continue to proactively work with our customers to implement additional selling price increases in the first quarter .<q>in aggregate , our selling price realization in the fourth quarter was about 8 % , with a higher price realization in our industrial reporting segment .<q>our price capture remains broad , with good traction in all businesses and all regions .<q>and the pace of price -- excuse me , the pace of price capture is much faster than the pace of prior inflationary cycles .<q>reflecting back to 2021 , we achieved all - time record sales of $ 16.8 billion led by strategic acquisitions and strong organic growth of 10 % despite the various ongoing supply chain challenges we incurred .<q>in addition , we delivered record earnings per share growth of more than 10 % even with raw material cost inflation of about 20 % for the full year , the highest level of coatings industry inflation in recent memory .<q>we also advanced our digital capabilities in many businesses , most notably the architectural coatings business or sales transaction on a digital platform increased by 20 % compared to 2020 , as we see our customers ' digital patterns become more ingrained .<q>we 're among a small number of companies that have achieved this milestone , along with even fewer companies paying a dividend for more than 120 consecutive years .<q>finally , we have lowered our net debt by about $ 350 million since funding tikkurila in june and exited 2021 with a strong balance sheet and optionality for future accretive cash deployment .<q>as one example , ppg - comex sources a high percentage of its residents internally , which has resulted in minimal disruptions .<q>looking ahead , demand continues to be robust in most of our end - use markets .<q>we anticipate more favorable economic conditions in the second quarter .<q>we will continue to aggressively manage all aspects of our cost structure and are managing to minimize the cost impacts of the current supply challenge .<q>as is typical , the month of march will be the largest component to our quarterly sales .
and from tds telecom , jim butman , president and chief executive officer ; and vicki villacrez , senior vice president and chief financial officer .<q>in addition to smartphone gross additions , we continue to have existing handset customers upgrading from feature phones to smartphones .<q>on a sequential basis , both gross and net additions improved due primarily to the normal seasonal trend .<q>i 'll touch more on churn in a moment .<q>this was down from 20,000 last year , driven by the decline in gross additions and higher churn .<q>postpaid handset net additions for the fourth quarter were positive 2,000 .<q>i want to talk first about postpaid handset connections shown on slide 7 .<q>and we'd aim to deploy 5g technology in wisconsin , our first 5g markets with commercial launches planned in the next couple of months .<q>we ended the year with volte technology available to nearly 70 % of our customers and deployment to the final markets is expected to be largely completed in 2020 .<q>network quality remains core to our customer satisfaction strategy .<q>the combined result of all these actions as we grew adjusted ebitda 5 % in 2019 .<q>to put this in perspective for the full - year , data usage grew 39 % while systems operation expenses were essentially flat , quite an accomplishment .<q>one highlight was our ability to manage network costs , given the impact from increased data usage .<q>as you can see on the graph on the right side of this slide , including the upgrades , total smartphone connections increased by 27,000 during the quarter and by 71,000 over the course of the past year that helps to drive more service revenue given that arpu for a smartphone is about $ 22 more than arpu for a feature phone .<q>in fact , for the year , cash operating expenses rose just four - tenths of 1 % .<q>also there was a decrease in universal service fund revenues resulting from the fcc's december 2018 ruling that revenues from text and multimedia messaging services are no longer assessable under the universal service fund .
consistent with those objectives , our communities under the leadership of our field staffs have continued to operate and serve our residents while adhering to the cdc 's guidelines and complying with local , municipal and state guidelines .<q>three , student sentiment with regard to a desire to be in the college environment with their peers versus at home with mom and dad even if instruction is being delivered predominantly online .<q>as you saw in last night 's release , with a range of five to 11 weeks left before the commencement of classes , we are now 90 % pre-leased for the upcoming academic year , only 340 basis points behind the prior year .<q>while the variance to prior year increased from the 230 basis points in our may 31 leasing update , it is worth noting that the variance to prior year at our open market leasing properties have decreased since that time .<q>i 'd now like to further break down our cautious optimism in terms of the ongoing risk and opportunities that may negatively or positively impact our final leasing numbers .<q>there are three normal and ordinary risk categories that we routinely manage in each and every annual lease - up .<q>those components are : one , renewal skips ; two , students who have asked us to attempt to relet their accommodations so that they may be released from their financial responsibility ; and three , no shows .<q>in all three of these risk categories , each year it is our goal to relet prior to the beginning of classes any accommodations that become available due to any of these three reasons .<q>two , universities now having available data on how covid impacts the 18 to 22 - year - old student demographic and having an improved understanding of how modern apartment style student housing and in - suite bath residence halls facilitate a student 's ability to sanitize their own living environment and to isolate in households of two to four residents in times of outbreak .<q>as we have commented to the market over the years , we typically only lose a total of 35 basis points to 60 basis points of final occupancy , with that net loss always having been reflected in the final leasing statistics we report each year .<q>as part of this year 's efforts to expedite this process , we have undertaken an exhaustive communication process to facilitate engagement with our residents , giving them the opportunity to let us know if there is a possibility that they are not coming .<q>and it 's worth noting , we also continue to have leasing activity of property serving the five universities that have announced predominantly online curriculum delivery , with our four same store properties at these schools being 90 % leased and with potential no shows and request for reletting currently representing only 5 % potential diminishment in occupancy .<q>one , universities ' focus on policies and procedures to promote a safe environment in the delivery of their academic curriculum , facilitating a return to campus with some component of in - person instruction .<q>i truly believe that we have collectively done some of the best work in our company 's 27 - year history during what has certainly been its most challenging period .<q>as you know , at the outset of this pandemic , consistent with our company values and the previously mentioned eight guiding objectives , we made a pledge that no resident would go without a home because of an inability to pay rent on a timely basis .<q>we also committed to be compassionate to the financial hardships that our residents and their parents may be experiencing due to covid and the corresponding government shutdowns .
in addition , today 's call includes discussions of certain non-gaap financial measures .<q>and we believe this dynamic of higher growth and lower risk will continue into the future , which is why we expect our u.s. based strategy will drive significant returns for shareholders .<q>with that in mind , we have invested nearly $ 40 billion in towers , small cells and fiber assets in the top market that are all foundational for the development of future 5g network .<q>we believe our unique strategy , portfolio of the infrastructure assets and proactive identification of future opportunities provide a platform for sustained long - term dividend growth as wireless network architecture evolves and our customers ' priorities shift over time .<q>today , our customers are primarily focusing their investment on macro sites as towers remain the most cost - effective way to deploy spectrum at scale and established broad network coverage .<q>with history as a guide , we believe the deployment of additional spectrum on existing cell sites will not be enough to keep pace with the persistent 30 % plus annual growth in mobile data traffic .<q>bigger picture , when i consider the durability of the underlying demand trends we see in the u.s. , how well we are positioned to consistently deliver growth through all phases of the 5g build out with significant potential upside in our comprehensive asset base as wireless networks continue to evolve .<q>in the near term , as i mentioned before , we expect to deliver outsized affo per share growth of 12 % in 2021 .<q>importantly , we provide access to such attractive industry dynamics , while providing a compelling total return opportunity , comprised of a high - quality dividend that currently yields 3.5 % with expected growth in that dividend of 7 % to 8 % annually .<q>as jay discussed , we delivered another great quarter of results in the third quarter .<q>we are excited about the outsized growth we are experiencing in the early stages of 5g .<q>one of the core principles underpinning our strategy is to focus on the u.s. market , because we believe that represents the best market in the world for wireless infrastructure ownership , since it has the most attractive growth profile and the lowest risk .<q>and we are identifying where wireless networks are going and investing early to position the company to capitalize on future opportunities , as we have done with small cells , edge computing and cbrs .<q>to execute on this strategy , we are providing our customers with access to our 40,000 towers and 80,000 route miles of fiber help them build out their 5g wireless networks .<q>being driven in large part by our expectation at tower core leasing activity will be approximately 50 % higher in 2022 than our trailing 5 - year average .<q>given that our dividend payout ratio has remained largely unchanged since 2014 , our dividend remains the best indicator of how we are performing both financially and operationally .
our results were released after yesterday 's market close .<q>our goal is to end the year with a solid , compelling business case to justify a decision to move forward at silver tip .<q>our three - year outlook reflects strong returns and a step change in production and cash flow .<q>if you did n't get a chance to listen to our investor day in december , i encourage you to go to our website , look at the materials or watch the replay to find out more about our culture , strategy and outlook .<q>before passing the call to mick , i want to quickly highlight slides 18 and 19 which provide a good high - level overview of our deep - rooted community relationships .<q>we strive to maintain strong relations with all of our partner communities and other local stakeholders with the goal of a mutual long - term prosperity .<q>wow , what a great quarter and a strong finish to the year .<q>building on our momentum , we expect to deliver another strong year from our operations in 2021 .<q>now taking a look at slide 6 and 7 and beginning with palmarejo .<q>strong results during the second half helped us finish the year on a high note , despite being down for roughly 45 days in the second quarter .<q>full - year gold production finished above the high end of its guidance range , while silver production was in line with expectations .<q>together , these great accomplishments helped to generate nearly $ 93 million of free cash flow ; palmarejo 's largest free cash flow year since 2017 .<q>we 're going to see positive results from our revised stacking plan , which leverages inter - lift liners to maximize the placement of hpgr - crushed ore on shallower portions of the leach pad .<q>going forward , we are continuing to focus on performance enhancements and driving sustained improvements in our results .<q>slide 5 highlights our fantastic financial results .<q>with that , i 'll pass the call over to tom .
with me on the call are dr. jeffrey graves , our president and chief executive officer ; jagtar narula , executive vice president and chief financial officer ; and andrew johnson , executive vice president and chief legal officer .<q>if you do n't , you will remain simply a vendor and not a true partner to your customers , which will ultimately be reflected in your organic growth rate and profit margins .<q>so with this in mind , at 3d systems , beginning a year ago , we changed the way we defined ourselves by reorganizing our entire company around key markets , and within those markets , key vertical segments that we believe will drive the most value from their adoption of additive manufacturing .<q>we began with the creation of two business segments , healthcare and industrial solutions .<q>using a strong application focus , these two businesses each integrate our printer , material and software technologies in unique combinations to solve the customers ' product need .<q>once complete , our customers can then ask us to scale the process for them to a certain production level .<q>and then with increasing demand , they can elect to have us enable a manufacturer of their choosing to continue scaling to high volumes .<q>this transfer of the workflow involves providing printing systems , materials and software along with the process definition .<q>this operating model has been very well received by our customer base and we expect it to fuel exciting organic growth in the years ahead .<q>most recently , we 've added a strong biotech organizational focus and invested significantly to bring our emerging biological technologies to laboratory and human applications , details of which we 'll cover in a few moments .<q>while this is natural when any industry is young and when the product is mainly consumed in small quantities by labs or prototype facilities , as the industry now matures and production environments are targeted , successful companies will need to adapt their entire operating model to reflect their deepening integration with specific markets and customers .<q>so in short , these are our five core market segments that you 'll hear us talk about moving forward .<q>let me illustrate this approach using our healthcare business as an example .<q>in the mid-1990s , 3d systems pioneered medical modeling , which is the printing of highly detailed anatomical models from digital images .<q>these models have proven instrumental in support of complex surgical procedures .<q>in a highly publicized application of our modeling technology , which was beautifully documented by cnn's dr. sanjay gupta , we created a number of medical models to assist in the separation of conjoined twins , jadon and anias mcdonald who were born with the extremely rare craniopagus condition , in which twins are joined at the head , sharing not only the skull and vasculature , but portions of the brain itself .
during the call , you 'll be hearing from steve moster , our president and ceo ; david barry , our president of pursuit ; and ellen ingersoll , our chief financial officer .<q>safety first is and always has been our no .<q>it was never a question of if we would be reopening , but more importantly , how ?<q>last week , we launched pursuit safety promise , which was constructed using material from the cdc and regional health authorities .<q>as guests return to our iconic locations and our team members are present to host them , we 've taken steps to ensure that we can do that safely .<q>and you can see all about that on the specifics on the pursuit website .<q>flyover iceland reopened last week in reykjavik , and we expect to benefit from the over 30,000 units of presold product already in the hands of our icelandic guests in that market .<q>and for our first weekend of operation , we handily surpassed our visit projection while maintaining a safe environment for visitors .<q>we appreciate the support of the icelandic government as they 've moved quickly to support both workers and businesses in this unprecedented global pandemic .<q>as travel restarts , we believe iceland 's thoughtful management of this public health crisis and renowned reputation as a safe destination , will position the country and our flyover iceland experience well .<q>we expect visitation to be below 2019 levels with less international visitors .<q>however , we do anticipate more canadians traveling within the country than usual .<q>to date , we have bookings in late june , and well into the third and fourth quarters of 2020 .<q>we 're not isolated from the global impact on travel and hospitality , we find ourselves among many fine brands and companies that are facing these same challenges .<q>we continue to take more every day .<q>canadian government has been very industry - focused , has enacted several programs that have been super helpful , including wage subsidies of up to 75 % for team members , and that 's called the cews program .
today 's call will begin with a business update from chris , highlighting third quarter results , current trends and context around our continued progress toward achieving our strategic plan , vision 2025 .<q>blueskin prevents uncontrolled air leakage and can yield up to 30 % savings on heating and cooling costs .<q>with accelerating demand for energy - efficient products made for more sustainable buildings in the future , we will continue to emphasize the development of products that help reduce the carbon emissions of buildings , positively impacting the environment .<q>finally , in the third quarter , we also continued to execute on our vision 2025 capital deployment strategy .<q>as a reminder , since 2016 , we have had over $ 1.8 billion in share repurchases .<q>we also anticipate continuing our long history of consistently raising our dividend , which we did again in august , marking the 45th consecutive year of increases .<q>we are very proud of the near half century of stability in our business model that affords us the ability to consistently return capital to shareholders .<q>turning to slide four and transitioning to our esg efforts .<q>as we close out 2021 , we continue to make steady progress and are performing audits to establish baseline data at our manufacturing facilities , identify opportunities for energy , waste , water and greenhouse gas reduction and establish achievable reduction targets for the future based on real , measurable and impactful actions .<q>we 're utilizing the carlisle operating system toolkit and processes to establish esg goals and targets , which among many benefits will result in meaningful reductions in our emissions and energy consumption .<q>we will set and publish these targets in the coming year .<q>we started recycling production materials made of paper such as facer , cardboard , office wastepaper from our carlisle , pennsylvania campus back into our polyiso insulation products in mid-2020 .<q>another effort has been to upgrade our factories with more efficient led lighting .<q>subsequent expansion of the facility will provide for the recycle of any earnings per share product away from any source .<q>i was in dixon this fall -- or at the beginning of this fall , and i was really pleased with what the team was doing and the fact that this initiative was driven by the folks in the facility there .<q>and we 're proud to see esg moving through our entire company with such momentum .
our chief financial officer , ray young , will review the drivers of our performance as well as corporate results and financial highlights .<q>carbohydrate solutions ' fourth quarter results were more than double the prior - year quarter .<q>volumes for north america sweeteners and starches were largely flat year over year .<q>as we look ahead , we believe the first quarter for carbohydrate solutions should be similar to or slightly above the strong first quarter of 2021 .<q>human nutrition had a great fourth quarter , with revenue growth of 21 % on a constant currency basis and substantially higher profits .<q>flavors continued its growth trajectory , driven primarily by improved product mix in emeai and continued strong performance from north america , partially offset by weaker apac results .<q>in specialty ingredients , overall profits for the fourth quarter were in line with the year - ago period as strong demand for plant - based proteins offset the impact of onetime insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020 .<q>the calendar year 2021 effective tax rate was approximately 17 % , up from 5 % in 2020 .<q>our balance sheet remains solid , with a net debt - to - total capital ratio of about 28 % and available liquidity of about $ 9 billion .<q>i hope most of you were able to join us on our global investor day last month .<q>there , we showed that we have consistently advanced our strategy from our work to improve roic through capital cost and cash ; to our strategic growth and margin enhancement accomplishments , including the creation of a global nutrition business ; to today 's focus on productivity and innovation .<q>let me take a few moments to talk about how we see the 2022 environment .<q>in ag services and oilseeds , we see a continued favorable global demand environment .<q>the majority of those negative timing effects are expected to reverse in the first half of 2022 .<q>then juan will discuss our outlook .<q>our team delivered a super fourth quarter .
i 'm joined by chairman and ceo , larry culp ; and cfo , carolina dybeck happe .<q>lean is fundamentally about going to gemba , where the real work is done , and is best learned in operations where you can see it , touch it , smell it firsthand .<q>john slattery , the ceo of ge aviation , and i joined our military team in lynn , massachusetts for the full week , while our business ceos joined their teams across the globe .<q>this quarter , we hosted our global kaizen week in each of our businesses , with over 1,600 employees participating .<q>as we accelerate our transformation , lean and decentralization are key to improving operational results .<q>this is enabling ge to look longer term even as we execute our deleveraging .<q>we 'll use the proceeds to further reduce debt , which we now expect to reach approximately $ 75 billion since the end of 2018 .<q>and we 're now targeting to close november 1 .<q>just last week , ge and aercap satisfied all regulatory clearances for the gecas transaction .<q>the gecas and aercap combination is a tremendous catalyst , enabling us to focus on our industrial core and accelerate our deleveraging plan .<q>challenges aside , our performance reflects the continued progress in our journey to become a more focused , simpler , stronger , high - tech industrial .<q>moving on to slide 3 .<q>we 'll provide more detail as usual during our fourth quarter earnings and outlook call .<q>looking further out to next year , as our businesses continue to strengthen , we expect revenue growth , margin expansion , and higher free cash flow despite the pressures that we 're managing through currently .<q>importantly , even with lower revenue , we 're raising our margin and earnings per share expectations , underscoring improved profitability and services growth , and reflecting our strengthened operations .<q>and we can improve our performance on the back of these changes for years to come .
this conference call also contains certain non-gaap financial measures .<q>we are confident we can continue to grow our double - premium inventory through organic exploration , improving well cost and well productivity and small bolt - on acquisitions , just like we did with the premium over the last five years .<q>these are low - cost opportunities within our core asset positions , which , in some cases , receive immediate benefit from our existing infrastructure .<q>premium and now double premium established a new higher threshold for adding inventory .<q>2021 is turning into an outstanding year for eog .<q>our exceptional well level returns are translating into double - digit corporate returns and our employees continue to position eog for long - term shareholder value creation .<q>here 's billy with an update on our operational performance .<q>our operating teams continue to deliver strong results .<q>once again , we exceeded our oil production target , producing slightly more than the high end of our guidance , driven by strong well results .<q>we have already exceeded our targeted 5 % well cost reduction in the first half of 2021 .<q>we now expect that our average well cost will be more than 7 % lower than last year .<q>average drilling days are down 11 % , and the feet of lateral completed in a single day increased more than 15 % .<q>we are utilizing our recently discussed super - zipper completions on about one third our well packages this year and expect that percentage to increase next year .<q>in addition , our sand costs are flat to slightly down year - to - date .<q>water reuse is another source of significant savings , and we continue to expand reuse infrastructure throughout our development areas .<q>we also use the strength of our balance sheet to take advantage of opportunities to reduce future costs in several areas .
technologies.com under the link , investor relations .<q>while the commercial aerospace sales were down , we did see the rate of decline improve and we are seeing signs that the business is beginning to rebound .<q>segment highlights in the quarter are as follows , a&d did see a return to sales growth in the quarter .<q>adjusted pre-tax dollars were down 2.5 % compared to prior year q3 and we had an exceptionally low tax rate in prior year q3 which further reduced eps .<q>we have a strong outlook for this business and are committed to driving significant improvements as we move forward .<q>margins for a&d were down driven by the issues at westland .<q>there are strong synergies between westland and our global subsidiary and we have already begun the work to bring these businesses together under one leadership structure .<q>the first and second quarter charges represent corrections to our previously reported financials and going forward , our 2021 year - to - date numbers will be updated to reflect these amounts .<q>they 've experienced several challenges related to new product development programs , which led to increased production cost and product quality issues .<q>we have started work immediately to get the production issues fixed into address cost issues within the business .<q>this has been the first quarter in 2021 where we saw sales growth from all three segments .<q>as we continue navigating through what we hope is the near end of covid , our number 1 focus remains the same increasing and maximizing our liquidity to position us for future m&a growth and increased investment in new products and solutions .<q>orders were a good story in q3 as entered orders were strong .<q>examples here include closure and consolidation of facilities , the move of manufacturing content to our mexico facility and ongoing make / buy [ phonetic ] programs .<q>the renewables business was very strong .<q>over the past year , we took several cost reduction actions across the company that have allowed us to hold margins during this down sales environment .
the quarter was generally pretty good , and maybe even modestly better than we expected on a recurring basis .<q>wealth management revenues were also up $ 1.1 million , or 14.9 % over the same periods due to higher investment management , advisory and trust services revenues .<q>insurance services revenues also increased slightly over first quarter 2020 results .<q>the company recorded a $ 5.7 million net benefit in the provision for credit losses during the first quarter of 2021 , due to a significant improvement in the economic outlook , and very low levels of net charge - offs .<q>the decrease in salaries and benefits expense was driven by a decrease in retirement - related severance and medical benefit costs , offset in part by increases in merit and incentive - related employee wages and payroll taxes .<q>other expenses were down due to the general decrease in the level of business activities as a result of the covid - 19 pandemic .<q>as of march 31 2021 , the company 's business lending portfolio included 874 first draw ppp loans with a total balance of $ 219.4 million and 1,819 second draw ppp loans with a total balance of $ 191.5 million .<q>and our nonbanking businesses continue to accelerate growth on both the revenue and margin lines .<q>our benefits business was up 12 % in ebitda over the last year .<q>we also had an ever so slight bit of organic loan growth in the quarter , ex-ppp , which is atypical for us in any first quarter , and loan quality is in as good a shape as i 've ever seen it .<q>our consumer lending businesses are very strong right now , and we expect a solid second and third quarter performance there .<q>in general , i think we got a very good start to the year .<q>net interest margin results continued to be negatively impacted by the significant increase in low - yield cash equivalents between comparable annual quarters .
i am bennett murphy , senior vice president , investor relations .<q>in fiscal 2021 , we completed a significant technology investment by bringing the specialty distribution business onto the sap platform , which will help improve efficiency , increase flexibility and support continuity .<q>as a global healthcare company , we understand and appreciate the importance of ensuring our businesses have the technology they need to support their operations and enhance their capabilities .<q>importantly , an increasingly critical part of our global role and responsibility is being strong corporate stewards , that is ensuring our financial health , investing in our people culture and ensuring long - term and sustainable value creation .<q>this includes our focus on maintaining our strong investment - grade credit ratings , and we remain on track to delivering on our commitments to the rating agencies .<q>notably , our financial and strategic position has enabled the continued enhancement of our healthcare capabilities , including the acquisition of alliance healthcare , which we completed in june .<q>since then , our culturally aligned teams have worked diligently to integrate our teams and businesses , conducting deep dive into strategically optimizing our operational and business development synergies to exploring ways to enhance the value we grade to our partners .<q>we have surveyed our team members to find out what 's most valuable to them and have invested in attractive benefit programs , such as increased paid parental leave , child and dependent care , and enhanced mental health and wellness programs .<q>as we continue to differentiate our business , we remain focused on being strategic partners with our customers as we help them achieve operational efficiencies and support growth in their businesses with innovative solutions .<q>this year , we furthered our diversity , equity inclusion efforts with the rollout of new employee resource groups and new diverse candidate slate objectives .<q>to further align our people strategy with our business strategy , we also introduced a new leadership competency model that will be embedded throughout all of our talent programs .<q>as a foundation for how we will recruit , engage and develop our people , this new model and the principles behind them will enable us to create value now and for the long term .<q>during the quarter , we are proud to have become a participant of the un global compact , the world 's largest corporate sustainability initiative .<q>we also held our third annual amerisourcebergen foundation conference , which helps foundation grantees connect and learn from each other and the foundation team to help them become even more effective in their work to positively impact local communities around the world .<q>earlier , i mentioned the distribution of tens of millions of doses of the covid - 19 vaccines to patients in more than 30 countries .<q>you 'll have an opportunity to ask questions after today 's remarks by management .
the company undertakes no obligation to update new information .<q>in fact , we are under contract to acquire a property in one of our identified markets , our first acquisition since the pandemic began and we expect to close this summer .<q>this acquisition will add just under 200,000 square feet and would be immediately accreted to whitestone 's ffo per share and positively contribute to whitestone 's long - term goals related to debt , leverage and g&a coverage .<q>in addition , our regional management team is in place giving us operational economies as we scale up our infrastructure .<q>we look forward to providing more details as we progress in the year .<q>moving forward at whitestone we 're well positioned with the improving balance sheet , enhanced liquidity , a laser focus on driving occupancy and revenue growth and leasing , leveraging our deep knowledge of our markets , properties and opportunities along with our business model to provide and craft the tenant mix to lease , to credit entrepreneurial businesses .<q>our targeted geographic focus on top msas in the sunbelt continues to produce great results .<q>texas and arizona , continue to see significant population migration and corporate relocations producing jobs from other areas of the countries .<q>this is best evidenced by our first quarter leasing activity , occupancy levels , leasing spreads and our average base rent per leased square foot .<q>our leasing activity in the quarter was very strong with 46 new leases , representing 117,000 square feet of newly occupied spaces .<q>this level of new lease square footage was 90 % higher than our average quarterly lease volume for the previous three year period .<q>by growing this way , we created a substantial value add portfolio of properties .<q>regarding occupancy , our operating portfolio occupancy stood at 89.1 % , up 1.5 % from the fourth quarter and down only 6 -- 0.6 % from a year ago with our austin market leading the way with almost 4 % increase in occupancy from q4 .<q>funds from operations core was $ 0.23 per share in q1 , compared to $ 0.24 per share in the prior year .<q>as jim , mentioned our collection continued to trend toward normal pre-covid levels , with 95 % of our contractual rents collected in q1 .<q>reflecting the continued improvement in the portfolio , our reserve for uncollectible revenue was $ 529,000 or 1.8 % of revenue , down from 4 % of revenue in q4 .
for today 's call , i 'll provide opening comments followed by preston , with an update on the current environment and our most recent acquisitions .<q>we are also enthusiastic about the wright medical acquisition and the category leadership we gain in both upper extremities and foot and ankle through wright 's diverse portfolio of implants , biologics , and enabling technology .<q>the combination of stryker and wright will continue to drive innovation that enhances our customers ' ability to address patient needs across to more than $ 3 billion extremities market .<q>the integration has been progressing well over the last few months .<q>the long period from sign to close was used to ensure that the appropriate integration plans were in place , leveraging our years of deal experience .<q>to date , the teams have been focused on moving quickly to align the new combined organization .<q>the u.s. sales leadership organizational structure for these three specialized business units has been announced and the rollout and full alignment of territories will be finalized during the first quarter as planned .<q>our teams are executing the sales integration while continuing to drive day - to - day business , and during the quarter , there was minimal disruption caused by the closing in integration activities .<q>finally , i want to restate our ongoing commitment to m&a , which was most recently demonstrated by our acquisition of orthosensor , a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for joint replacement .<q>smart devices and implants will play an important role in the future of orthopaedics and the addition of orthosensor will allow us to continue to innovate and advance smart sensor technology , including intraoperative sensors , wearables , and ultimately , smart implant .<q>updates to this annual guidance will be made each quarter as necessary throughout the year .<q>today , i will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and the related drivers .<q>our organic sales decline was 1.1 % in the quarter .<q>as a reminder , this quarter included the same number of selling days as q4 2019 .<q>however , we did see demand for certain capital products continue as we have strong results in our mako , medical beds , and emergency care products .<q>2020 had one additional selling day compared to 2019 and for the year , price had an unfavorable 0.7 % impact on sales .
the last several months are unlike anything most of us have experienced in our life times .<q>you know at some point , we 'll be looking at this virus through the rearview mirror .<q>in wrapping up my remarks , i want to leave you with this .<q>as a result , we will not be providing specific revenue and earnings guidance for the first quarter of fy ' 21 .<q>despite the recent positive data indicating that our new business trends may be stabilizing as well as the resilience that our clients and colleagues are demonstrating , the near - term predictability of our business remains clouded .<q>in some cases this has resulted in the delay or even cancellation of plans to reopen .<q>as city , states and countries reopen their economies , there has been a significant resurgence of covid - 19 cases in a number of places .<q>as we discussed in the last earnings call , we continue to assess the changing health and economic environment and the impact it has on our forward visibility .<q>this preserves the muscle of the firm and our ability to fully harness the opportunities and the recovery and we will maintain our dividend this quarter .<q>we 're committed to maintaining at least neutral ebitda .<q>we 've also set operational guardrails in our business , designed to preserve our position of strength and enable the firm to invest into the recovery .<q>so june was better than may and was better than june in terms of new business .<q>and sequentially , june was up approximately 18 % over may .<q>april , may and june stabilized , down approximately 30 % year - over - year .<q>and i truly believe that we have the right strategy with the right people at the right time to accelerate further through the turn like we 've done before .<q>to undertake this journey , we 're going to be agile , flexible and responsive to the environment and our clients .
a copy of which is available on our investor relations website at www .<q>but that 's why i think our teams very much deserve the sense of excitement and pride that they have when they turned those platforms positions into platforms for growth .<q>for the second point , let me pick up on that word platform .<q>what i 'd like to underscore is that to me , the successes we have been having are not the end , but rather the beginning .<q>the success we 've had has left us with powerful platforms that we can leverage going forward to extend that growth , to build upon it .<q>and that brings me to the third point to preview something ajay will discuss , which is there 's always near - term risk in these sorts of investments .<q>let me spend a minute on that .<q>as you know , our investments are typically in hiring .<q>if one instead buys a company , the investment shows up in its capital .<q>this year , our ambition is to have the highest organic growth rate during my tenure and i guess is during the company 's entire history , the highest organic growth rate .<q>there is no way to make those sorts of bold bets without facing some short - term financial risk .<q>and if you want to underscore some of the negatives , we 're making those bets at a time when our most profitable business , our restructuring business , is facing market demand that is lower than it 's been in 15 years according to one measure and 20 years according to another measure .<q>and we no longer have the rollover of the large restructuring jobs from the early parts of the 2020 .<q>and we 're facing compensation pressure due to wage inflation in a tight talent market .<q>and ultimately , thereby it delivers for the shareholders , as you have seen now over the last seven years .<q>my experience is when you have great people and great bets to make , you commit to those people , you commit to those opportunities and you make those bets .
joining in the q&a after bob and mike 's comments will be jacob thaysen , president of agilent 's life science and applied markets group ; sam raha , president of agilent 's diagnostics and genomics group ; and padraig mcdonnell , president of the agilent crosslab group .<q>it was a busy quarter at agilent .<q>in addition , the integration of resolution bioscience team is going well and we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast growing ngs based cancer diagnostic market .<q>earlier this month , we also announced the initiation of in - country manufacturing for our sureselect product line .<q>in q3 , we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a china based biopharma company .<q>we continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger china market position .<q>while still less than 10 % of dgg revenue , our china business grew 50 % in the quarter .<q>so , i have a few other achievements i 'd like to share with you .<q>i also want to highlight our performance in china .<q>for the first time in several quarters , we saw a diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels .<q>this gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $ 200 million annual run rate of revenue with existing capacity .<q>the quarterly results exceeded our expectations , easily surpassing the $ 30 million revenue milestone , while one quarter does not make a trend , our team has done a tremendous job increasing the output in a high quality manner .<q>the ramp of our facility in frederick , colorado continues to go very well .<q>the growth was broad based across product lines and regions and was led by our nasd gmp oligo business .<q>while we are watching delta variant very closely , to date we have not seen a meaningful negative impact on testing volumes .<q>at a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact , this has always been a key part of who we are as a company .
a copy of the release can be found on our ir website at ir .<q>our performance was strong with multinational customers , especially those who benefited from the pandemic .<q>however , our exposure to local and regional players adversely impacted sales .<q>i think it 's important to remember that while these smaller and regional customers were disproportionately impacted by covid - 19 , they have historically been an important source of growth across our industry and we expect them to be important contributors in our recovery .<q>on the whole , we are proud of the results achieved and resilience of our business in 2020 .<q>some of our end markets have seen prolonged and significant negative impact that led to inevitable headwinds for certain segments .<q>however , when you look at the whole of our portfolio , we see strong results with meaningful momentum that affirm our central role in the consumer product good value chain .<q>that gives me great confidence as we begin to execute as a new iff with the n&b business in 2021 .<q>scent trends continued to be very strong , taste improved and n&b continued to be pressured by covid .<q>it is good to see that the business has had steady improvement since the pandemic lows .<q>i would now like to pass the call over to rustom , who will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance in the fourth quarter .<q>i will cover the p&l high points on this slide and get into additional detail as we go through the following several slides .<q>when excluding the roughly $ 50 million impact of 2019 's 53rd week , our comparable currency - neutral growth was plus 2 % , and as i 'll explain on the next slide , up approximately 4 % , counting foreign exchange - related price changes as our peers in many cpgs disclosed .<q>while taste performed at levels similar to q3 2020 , we did see a significant acceleration in scent .<q>we delivered adjusted earnings per share , excluding amortization , of $ 1.32 , mostly as a result of lower operating profit in the quarter .<q>now moving to slide 9 .
i am joined today by summit hotel properties president and chief executive officer , jon stanner ; and executive vice president and chief financial officer , trey conkling .<q>as a final point on our urban portfolio , we believe business travel is now in the early stages of its recovery as urban midweek occupancy increased 10 percentage points from the second quarter to 57 % , and adr increased more than $ 30 to $ 144 or a 27 % increase for the quarter .<q>this translates to a revpar growth rate of 54 % versus second quarter for the urban portfolio .<q>to provide a little more insight into the company 's overall third quarter portfolio segmentation , growth in demand was driven primarily by the increases in group business and negotiated business segment , as previously mentioned .<q>similarly , full week negotiated revpar increased by 28 % relative to second quarter , while weekday negotiated revpar increased by 32 % .<q>although booking windows remain short - term in nature and forecasting continues to be a challenge , we 've experienced a decline in the percentage of room nights booked near to or on the night of stay .<q>but importantly , nights booked more than 30 days out , increased by 19 % during that same period .<q>while the overall booking window remains shortened relative to prepandemic standards , its expansion represents a definitive trend that started earlier in the year and has strengthened throughout the third quarter .<q>operating costs per occupied room declined nearly 10 % compared to 2019 , which drove third quarter gross operating profit margin and hotel ebitda margin to an impressive 47 % and 35 % , respectively .<q>we continue to operate our hotels utilizing a very lean staffing model , which consists of approximately ' 19 ftes on average or slightly more than 55 % of free pandemic staffing levels .<q>rehiring hourly staff , particularly in the housing housekeeping department has been an ongoing issue across the industry .<q>finally , turning to the balance sheet .<q>our overall liquidity position continued to strengthen during the quarter as the business made substantial progress generating positive cash flow .<q>additionally , we accessed the capital markets in august , taking advantage of a favorable preferred equity market with the issuance of $ 100 million of five and seven , eight series a perpetual preferred paper .<q>proceeds from this opportunistic offering were used to accretively refinance our $ 75 million , 6.45 % series b preferred stock and to reduce the outstanding balance on our november 2022 term loan to its current balance of $ 62 million .<q>we 're thrilled to announce the acquisition of a 27 hotel portfolio from newcrestimage , which is comprised of approximately 3,700 guest rooms located across 10 high - growth sunbelt markets in texas , oklahoma city and new orleans .
this is mike yates , vice president and chief accounting officer for idex corporation .<q>as we close out 2020 and look forward , we are optimistic that our units and markets are quickly on a path to pre-covid levels .<q>we then faced the onset of the pandemic , and we responded to it with purpose .<q>we have proactively taken strategic actions to address these factors .<q>a year ago , as we entered 2020 , we talked about the general industrial slowdown that we were seeing and what a flat to down 2 % to 5 % world looked like for idex .<q>and fire & safety saw growth in several product lines .<q>dispensing saw significant improvement as retailers began to release pent - up demand for equipment refreshes band - it after a strong bounce back in the third quarter , continued to improve based on auto market strength .<q>the actions that we took in 2019 and 2020 have left us well - positioned as we move into 2021 .<q>hst organic orders were up 6 % in the fourth quarter , driven by new product initiatives in life sciences and the recovery in auto and semicon continuing to boost our sealing solutions businesses .<q>excluding timing on large oem blanket orders year over year , our monthly order rates improved throughout the quarter .<q>turning now to our commercial results on slide 8 .<q>you have my commitment on that .<q>we will continue to grow and advance our culture as a key element of differentiation .<q>as part of that commitment , i intend to have a senior de&i leader in place reporting directly to me later this year .<q>developing a formal framework and goals for our de&i program is something we have all deployed at the senior leadership level making it a top priority .<q>we provide our current outlook for primary end markets .
today , we will review the fourth quarter and full year results of 2020 .<q>however , we believe that some of the demand was associated with larger than normal end of year budget release .<q>on a geographic basis , life science currency neutral year - over - year sales grew across all regions .<q>last month , the fda granted an eua for our covid qpcr assay kit , which runs on bio - rad 's existing cfx pcr platforms , as well as qpcr systems from other providers .<q>the assay kit is a multiplex test that targets two separate regions in the viral genome , to ensure greater sensitivity and tolerance to potential mutations .<q>amortization related to prior acquisitions , recorded in cost of goods sold was $ 4.6 million compared to $ 4.5 million in q4 of 2019 .<q>looking below the operating line , the change in fair market value of equity securities holdings added $ 904 million of income to the reported results and this is substantially related to holdings of the shares of sartorius ag .<q>our gaap tax rate in 2020 and 2019 were affected by the large unrealized gains in equity securities .<q>in addition , the 2019 tax rate included a discrete benefit , which allowed us to apply higher foreign tax credits .<q>growth in the overall life science segment was offset by continued softness in academic research demand , as these labs around the globe are still operating below capacity .<q>with me on the phone today are norman schwartz , our chief executive officer ; ilan daskal , executive vice president and chief financial officer ; andy last , executive vice president and chief operating officer ; annette tumolo , president of the life science group ; and dara wright , president of the clinical diagnostics group .<q>our actual results may differ materially from these plans and expectations and the impact and duration of the covid - 19 pandemic is unknown .<q>our remarks today will also include references to non-gaap net income and non-gaap diluted income per share , which are financial measures that are not defined under generally accepted accounting principles .<q>i 'd just like to take a few minutes to review our current state of operations around the world .<q>their response to the shifting needs of operating in a pandemic have been truly exemplary .<q>so at the onset of the pandemic , we set ourselves three key areas of focus to manage through this challenging period , which we continue with into 2021 .
sales in the second quarter were $ 129.6 million , up 54 % compared to the same period in 2020 .<q>the commercial vehicle market remains strong , not only for this year but likely into the first half of 2022 .<q>the chinese market has fluctuated recently showing the first chip - related impact .<q>european production is forecasted in the 16 million to 18 million unit range with some uncertainty persisting due to the extended covid lockdowns .<q>on - hand days of supply are between 25 and 30 days , the lowest in recent history , and down 50 % since january of this year .<q>the supply of global microcontrollers is improving from companies such as renesas and nxp , which should deliver some improvements to vehicle oems . for the u.s. light vehicles transportation market , demand remains robust .<q>operationally , we can see the end of our journey and the rollout of the sap system , though we will continue to optimize our learnings and capabilities .<q>and at the same time , continue to diversify our end market profile to complement our quality of earnings .<q>we continue to seek to expand our range of technologies , products , customers , and geographic reach .<q>potential changes in capital gains taxation may also provide some further momentum in our areas of interest .<q>building the cts operating system capability continues with four sites advancing their proficiency on the system and tools as we aim to empower our teams and strengthen operational and enterprise expertise .<q>as we look to capital deployment , our emphasis remains firmly on supporting organic growth investments and using our strong balance sheet to advance on m&a in alignment with our strategic priorities .<q>in terms of guidance for the full year 2021 , we are updating our range .<q>changes in foreign exchange rates impacted our revenue favorably by approximately $ 2.7 million .<q>this reflects progress toward our strategic goal to further diversify our business by growth in the industrial , medical as well as aerospace and defense end markets .<q>sales to the transportation end market represented 55 % of our total revenue .
we appreciate your time today .<q>the increase in staffing sg&a as a percentage of revenue was significantly impacted by negative leverage as revenues decreased in response to the pandemic .<q>staffing sg&a costs were 35.3 % of staffing revenues in the first quarter versus 34.2 % in the first quarter of 2019 .<q>one year ago , gross margin for protiviti was $ 64 million or 25.3 % of protiviti revenues .<q>when combined with temporary and consulting gross margin , overall staffing gross margin decreased 70 basis points compared to the year ago first quarter , to 44 % .<q>turning now to gross margin .<q>protiviti and its independently owned member firms serve clients through a network of 86 locations in 27 countries .<q>exchange rates had the effect of decreasing year - over - year protiviti revenues by $ 2 million and decreasing its year - over - year reported growth rate by 0.6 percentage points .<q>non-u.s. revenues were up 2 % on an as - adjusted basis .<q>the u.s. with u.s. protiviti revenues up 20 % .<q>moving on to operating income .<q>operating margin was 8.7 % .<q>also , we are currently taking further action to reduce sg&a costs by an additional 10 % .<q>protiviti expects second quarter revenues to be in the range of flat to down 10 % versus the prior year .<q>protiviti's pipeline remains strong , particularly for technology and regulatory compliance engagements .<q>this compares to a 9 % decrease for the full quarter .
unless otherwise stated , all net sales growth numbers are in constant currency and all organic results exclude the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions , divestitures , brand closures , and the impact of currency translation .<q>we realized excellent results across the board in brick - and - mortar , most especially in the americas and emea .<q>what is more , we are seeing the benefits of recent investment in online fulfillment , which have led to higher service levels and better inventory manager while setting the stage for expanded omnichannel capabilities in the market .<q>with it , we will have a unique ability to grow and build on our market and consumer insights to develop exceptional products to meet and surpass the needs and desires of chinese consumers .<q>this new world - class innovation center will be the first of its kind for our company .<q>we are enthusiastic for our new innovation center in shanghai to open in the second half of this fiscal year .<q>our brands created excitement in store with enticing high - touch services and unique activations .<q>we continue to invest in the vibrant and compelling long - term growth opportunity in mainland china , led by our talented local team .<q>despite this , the region still grew 10 % organically driven by strength in greater china and korea .<q>in asia pacific , many markets faced covid - induced lockdowns and temporary store closures , which pressured performance .<q>our expanded consumer reach enhanced these initiatives as bobbi brown launched in ulta beauty exceeded expectations , and we are encouraged by the early results of the new ulta beauty at target and sephora at kohl 's relationships .<q>strategic go - to - market initiatives supported by on - trend innovation increased advertising spending , and expert in - store virtual services delighted consumers .<q>our business in north america executed with excellence to deliver strong double - digit organic sales growth , powered by readiness for makeup 's emerging renaissance , ongoing strength in skincare and fragrance , and recovery in hair care .<q>online grew to be nearly double the size , on a reported basis , of the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020 .<q>here , a few among the many other highlights of the report : we are continuing to contribute to a low - carbon future .<q>the elc cares employee relief fund awarded nearly 14,000 grants and distributed nearly $ 8 million through june 30 , 2021 .
this is anvita patil , hecla 's assistant treasurer .<q>while we are a little higher than our 2020 full - year results , we are focused on reducing it further .<q>our operations teams have done an outstanding job of improving this aspect of the business .<q>our teams continue their exemplary safety performance , and our all injury frequency rate in the first quarter was 1.71 , which is a reduction of 72 % since implementing a revised safety and health management system in 2012 .<q>first and foremost is our focus on safety .<q>i 'll start on slide 10 .<q>continued strong operational performance and higher silver pricing drive our 2021 free cash flow expectations , which should continue to grow from our first - quarter performance .<q>at $ 25 per ounce realized price , the enhanced dividend policy has an implied yield of 7.4 % to the silver price .<q>on slide 11 , at the green creek mine , we produced 2.6 million ounces of silver and 13,200 ounces of gold at an all - in sustaining cost of $ 1.59 per ounce for the quarter .<q>this benefit will not recur later in the year .<q>all these efforts together with others in the pipeline are positioning casa berardi to deliver consistent production at lower costs .<q>our ongoing focus to improve productivity and to reduce costs are underpinned by multiple factors , and we 're starting to see a downward trend in aisc .<q>and the mill has maintained greater than 90 % availability since october of 2020 .<q>our investments in the mill to improve reliability and recovery are yielding great results .<q>the dramatic improvement in zinc concentrate treatment charges as compared to last year , therefore , has less impact .<q>unlike greens creek , the lucky friday produces a relatively small amount of zinc .
a strong third quarter is a continuation of the momentum we have historically demonstrated , which reflects both the stability and the growth potential of the platform we have established .<q>and our rv growth was 15.2 % for the quarter as a result of a 5 % rental rate increase and the effect of over 100 conversions to annual leases over the trailing 12 months .<q>our retransient revenues were up 29 % compared to last year .<q>this is on top of the 5 % transient growth we experienced in the third quarter of 2020 over 2019 when we began to see the benefits of travelers who are seeking drive - through vacation options and took advantage of our resorts in desirable destinations .<q>today , an accounting for the third quarters actual contribution , it has accelerated to 18.3 % ahead of original budget .<q>the increased levels of consumer engagement discussed last quarter have continued .<q>and we have seen our social media following and interaction continue to grow with more than 1.4 million followers on the three major platforms ; instagram , facebook and tiktok .<q>we have also continued to sign up members to our pilots sun rv resorts loyalty program .<q>and while it 's still in its early days , initial interest and feedback has been very positive .<q>in short , we believe we are seeing strong evidence of two important trends .<q>first , that many travelers are learning now and trying out an rv vacation ; and second , once travelers have discovered their sunnier side through an rv vacation , it becomes part of their future vacation considerations .<q>with respect to our total mh and rv portfolio , we continue to pursue our strategy of filling existing vacancy and creating additional revenue producing opportunities through expansion and conversions .<q>the rv site conversions result in an average 50 % increase in site revenues during the first year of conversion , with an additional benefit of transient site scarcity pushy [ phonetic ] rates .<q>moving on to new construction .<q>one of the ground - up developments delivered this quarter was the next phase of smith creek crossing , a manufactured housing community in granby , colorado .<q>home sales volume was up 64 % year - over - year as we sold more than 1,100 homes in the quarter .
first , i 'd like to say we 're very pleased with the results of this quarter .<q>as a percent of net revenue , cost of services were 83.6 % for the first quarter .<q>this compares to $ 1.2 billion in the same quarter last year .<q>additionally , the medicare sequester relief bill extended temporary suspension of the 2 % medicare sequestration cut that was set to expire march 31 through the end of 2021 .<q>we expect these rules to be finalized in august after the required comment period .<q>the proposed long - term acute care rule , if adopted , would see an increase in the standard federal rate of 2.45 % and an increase in the high - cost outlier threshold .<q>we continue to see strong referrals and higher acuity patients , which is driving both volume and rate in our critical illness recovery hospitals .<q>we will continue to outline this information as long as we believe it provides insight to the impact of covid - 19 on the company 's financial performance .<q>all in all , it was a stellar quarter for select .<q>and while our outpatient rehabilitation business experienced double - digit negative variance in patient visits in both january and february , we saw a surge of visits in march , and this has continued through april .<q>our concentra business segment has continued the trend we saw in q4 with nice growth in revenue , ebitda and ebitda margins .<q>occupancy rates in both business segments grew 500 basis points on a same - quarter year - over - year basis .<q>patient business were down 1.1 % with 2.1 million visits in the quarter .<q>they are included in our other activities .<q>the adjusted ebitda results for our operating segments do not include any recognitions of these funds .<q>this included $ 16.1 million related to payments received under the cares act for incremental costs incurred as a result of covid .
we will also present certain non-u.s. gaap financial information .<q>this segment is benefiting from strong consumer demand in the broad manufacturing sector recovery .<q>nondurables , excluding food and beverage , represents about 30 % of u.s. box demand across a wide range of consumer and industrial products .<q>with states starting to reopen , we 're also seeing improved demand in segments with greater exposure to restaurant and foodservice channels , such as produce and protein , although we 're still not back to pre-covid levels .<q>e -commerce , again grew at a strong double - digit pace in the first quarter , and we believe the majority of the accelerated consumer adoption in this channel is permanent .<q>in our u.s. box system demand remains robust as more states start lifting restrictions .<q>we 're working with our customers to recover from extensive backlogs .<q>our first quarter shipments were impacted by the significant production loss resulting from the storm .<q>u.s. and export containerboard demand is strong with low inventories in all regions .<q>higher recovered fiber costs were another significant headwind in the quarter .<q>maintenance outage costs increased sequentially .<q>operations and cost includes about $ 55 million impact from the winter storm , about half of which is due to unabsorbed fixed costs and the balance is related to repairs and higher distribution costs .<q>we 're well positioned and have the scale and footprint to serve just about every corrugated segment in a meaningful way , and our packaging team continues to focus on delivering superior packaging solutions to help our customers succeed .<q>our objective is to bring this business back to sustainable mid-teen margins and generate returns above our cost of capital .<q>demand for fluff is solid and we have healthy backlogs .<q>volume was moderately lower due to the shipping delays related to port congestion .
today 's call is being recorded and supporting materials of the property of dana incorporated .<q>continuing on the transition to electrified vehicles , slide eight highlights an exciting collaboration with pierce manufacturing and oshkosh airport products on their new revolutionary volterra platform of electric vehicles .<q>when the first vehicle rolled off the assembly line , they will feature an electric drivetrain with two dana tm4 motors , coupled with a dana - manufactured electromechanical , infinitely variable transmission pictured here in exploded view .<q>depending on the usage and mission profile , the fuel savings could be significant .<q>every second matters when responding to an airport emergency and the newly striker volterra .<q>arff is capable of achieving 28 % improved acceleration when fully loaded with the new ev technology .<q>as an added benefit , the striker volterra vehicle results in 0 emissions driving during entry and exit of the fire station ion ev mode , so that there 's no longer a need for expensive ventilation systems , within the station .<q>at pierce manufacturing , the first pierce volterra zero emissions pumper was placed in service in june of 2021 with the city of madison , wisconsin fire department , making it the first electric fire truck in service in north america .<q>this success is in our power technologies group .<q>please turn to page eight .<q>several electrified lifestyle and sport trucks have recently been announced .<q>to that , we 're pleased to be showcasing our capabilities by supplying our advanced battery cooling technology .<q>unfortunately , we can't yet mention the name of the oem .<q>our extensive range of long thermatek battery cooling product sets the industry standard for innovation .<q>the award - winning customer design , cooling -- custom design cooling solutions feature lightweight aluminum construction , resulting in ultra clean products that stabilize the battery temperature and enable faster charging .<q>turning to my final slide .
i 'll come back at the end to talk more about the progress we 're making toward building a company with long - term sustainable growth .<q>in recent weeks and months , we 've heard several customers publicly address their attentions to further expand their private label programs .<q>and third , our retail customers continue to express support for private label .<q>second , while the top line will face tough comparisons in the near term , we are taking actions to address those issues within our control , specifically , additional pricing to offset the incremental commodity inflation that i spoke to earlier .<q>we 've also restored service levels back to the pre-pandemic levels in the 98 % range .<q>i 'll start on slide nine with our q1 scorecard .<q>several factors give me confidence that we can continue to deliver the year .<q>despite the headwinds that were affecting the entire food and beverage industry , we remain confident in our outlook .<q>in our case , several plants were affected , with some , like our san antonio , texas plant where we make red sauces and salsa , impacted more extensively than others .<q>to a lesser degree , but worth noting , weather headwinds in the first quarter presented challenges .<q>on top of that , freight costs are escalating across the entire landscape due to increased demand and the limited availability of drivers .<q>while the pandemic is not yet over , the availability and acceptance of vaccines in the u.s. has been supportive of reopening efforts across much of the country .<q>second , you can see on the right that the away - from - home sector is recovering as restrictions across geographies begin to ease , which has positive implications for our foodservice business .<q>i think it 's worth noting on this slide that our profit improvement over the 2 - year period further demonstrates that we are a much healthier company today .<q>as we move down the p&l , slide 13 takes you through our earnings drivers .<q>after excluding the sales associated with the two in - store bakery plants , total sales in the retail channel declined $ 18 million versus last year .
we would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time .<q>and the investments we 're making in our new consumer construct are fueling higher parallel growth for women , led by our yoga business .<q>we 're seeing strong over indexing growth of 16 % in this key growth driver .<q>first , let 's take a look at apparel .<q>and looking at our innovation agenda , the two areas that i 'd like to touch on today where our relentless pipeline of innovative product continues to create separation between us and our competition , apparel and sustainability .<q>we expect this facility to act as an accelerant as it helps extend our advantage in innovation even further .<q>at over 750,000 square feet , this new home for our innovation teams is five times the size of our previous lab and is continued proof of nike 's leadership in sports science .<q>in this week , i toured our new lebron james innovation center here at our world headquarters with lebron .<q>our culture of innovation is our most profound competitive advantage .<q>and as i 've said before , at nike , everything starts with innovation .<q>we 're the largest kids ' athletic footwear brand in the world , but we know that there is still so much potential ahead .<q>and our kids business remains an important connection point for us , an organic incubator of the brand across multiple generations as we look long term .<q>playlist has been a hit with kids and parents alike with viewership numbers well above our expectations .<q>its latest season began a few months back with a new video starring lebron james and some of his co-stars from their movie space jam , a new legacy .<q>it 's filled with games , challenges and exclusive athlete content , all aligned to our mission of encouraging movement in play .<q>take , for example , playlist , which is a just for kid series on nike.com and youtube .
we 're in the final weeks of a much stronger year and recovery than we had forecasted earlier this year .<q>we 've raised our prices by a similar percentage , and our wholesale customers have agreed to those increases .<q>we 're planning a mid-single - digit percentage cost increase for our spring and summer product offerings .<q>our suppliers are raising their prices to help offset higher cotton and polyester prices .<q>inflation will impact our product costs next year .<q>we have negotiated and locked in higher , but very favorable freight rates with our suppliers and have largely avoided the abnormally high spot market rates for ocean containers .<q>transportation rates will be higher heading into 2022 .<q>historically , the peak shipping volume is from july to october .<q>transportation delays may moderate in the months ahead .<q>with only eight weeks to go before christmas , the selling windows are shortening .<q>we focus that effort on product offerings for our largest wholesale customers who supported our brands during the most challenging periods of the pandemic .<q>in recent months , we 've invested an unprecedented level of air freight to expedite the receipt of essential core products to serve the needs of families with young children .<q>by comparison , trucking capacity is up only 8 % .<q>we 've reflected that risk in our fourth quarter forecast .<q>our stores are expected to be the highest contributor to our annual revenue this year with store sales projected to exceed $ 1.1 billion .<q>given the more favorable rental market , our real estate team is pursuing opportunities to open more stores than previously planned .
i 'm joined by our chairman and ceo , scott santi ; and senior vice president and cfo , michael larsen .<q>as you know , given our high - margin profile , offsetting cost increases with price on a dollar per dollar basis causes some modest dilution of our operating margin percentage and our incremental margin percentage in the near term .<q>for the balance of the year and embedded in our guidance are all known raw material increases and the corresponding pricing actions that have either already been implemented or will be , again , eps - neutral for the full year .<q>at this early stage in the recovery , our 25.5 % operating margins are already exceeding our pre-covid operating margins .<q>four of the seven segments delivered operating margin of around 28 % or better in q1 , with one segment , welding , above 30 % in a quarter for the first time ever .<q>after - tax return on capital was a record 32.1 % , and free cash flow was solid at $ 541 million with a conversion of 81 % of net income , in line with typical seasonality for q1 .<q>as planned , we repurchased 250 million of our shares this quarter , and the effective tax rate was 22.4 % , slightly below prior year .<q>so in summary , the first quarter was solid for itw with broad - based organic growth of 6 % , strong profitability leverage , 19 % earnings growth , 45 % incremental profitability and record operating margin and earnings per share performance .<q>and the information on the left side of the page summarizes the organic revenue growth rate versus prior year by segment for q1 this year compared to q4 last year .<q>and obviously , there 's a positive impact as the easier comparisons begin on a year - over - year basis .<q>at the enterprise level , itw 's organic growth rate went from down 1 % in q4 to up 6 % .<q>as we go through the segment slides , you 'll see that this robust organic growth , combined with strong enterprise initiative impact contributed to some pretty strong operating margin performance in our segments .<q>so let 's go into a little more detail for each segment , starting with automotive oem .<q>north america revenue was down 2 % as customers continue to adjust their production schedules in response to the well - publicized shortage of certain components , including semiconductor chips .<q>and once again , our ability to deal with the impact of some pretty meaningful supply chain challenges and disruptions and still take care of our customers , with strong levels of profitability , speaks to the quality of the execution at itw .<q>during today 's call , we will discuss itw 's first quarter financial results and update our guidance for full year 2021 .
such risk factors are set forth in the company 's sec filings .<q>and we 've refined the degree of staffing that is required to operate our theaters , including enhanced planning and management controls .<q>we also continue to significantly advance our digital and social marketing capabilities , utilizing proven best practices from retail , travel and technology industries .<q>examples include leveraging iterative a/b testing to identify and scale winning concepts , simplifying consumer touch points to drive a more frictionless experience and applying advanced analytics against our highly valuable customer database to drive improved targeting accuracy and contextually relevant messaging .<q>these actions and capabilities are focused on increasing moviegoing frequency and overall consumer spend , and we believe they will be highly valuable in navigating the competitive landscape ahead and maintaining our increased market share .<q>during the third quarter , we completed billing reactivation on all movie club accounts that were proactively paused for the past 1.5 years during the pandemic .<q>in doing so , we have been extremely pleased by the minimal amount of churn we 've experienced , which represented only a modest 6 % dip in our pre-pandemic membership base that was largely driven by credit cards that expired during that timeframe .<q>we 've also continued to further enhance movie club and recently introduced movie club platinum , an earned premium tier that provides our most frequent moviegoers with even bigger incentives .<q>we expect this heightened tier will serve to further increase loyalty of our most active customers as well as stimulate incremental transactions .<q>another foray into simplifying and enhancing our customer experience while driving ancillary revenues is snacks in a tap , our recently launched online food and beverage ordering platform .<q>this platform enables guests to skip the line and have their concessions ready for pickup upon arrival or delivered to their seats for a nominal fee .<q>another exciting new business venture that we announced last week is our heightened focus on gaming initiatives , including our plan to hire a new vice president to forge strategic relationships and pursue content and licensing agreements in the gaming realm .<q>additionally , we 're continuing to explore other alternative content offerings and have seen similar positive results from events such as professional wrestling with aew and wwe , boxing with triller fight club , movie premiers , special live q&a sessions with talent and concerts , all in addition to ongoing events provided by fathom entertainment .<q>we 're also continuing to reap benefits from investments we 've made in premium amenities that enrich the moviegoing experience , which movie fans continue to seek out , including reclining seats with approximately 65 % of our entire domestic circuit featuring country loungers , the highest recliner penetration among the major theater operators .<q>and finally , cinionic laser projectors .<q>in line with our previously announced partnership , we are featuring laser projections crystal clear picture in all of our new build theaters and continue to upgrade our existing theaters with laser technology , which lasts longer and operates more efficiently .
com under the investor relations tab and will remain available after the call .<q>while we are fully focused on the implementation of our profitable growth strategy , we also remain committed to advance environmental , social and governance , or esg , at western union .<q>i would encourage you to read our 2020 esg report released in june to learn more about our 2020 impact and our esg strategy and goals , which are closely aligned to our business , our values and our purpose .<q>now turning back to second quarter results .<q>we see pricing stability in the market and varying levels of recovery from the effects of the ongoing pandemic , particularly outside the us , where economic activity and government policies are more mixed .<q>this was evident in my recent tours in europe where agents , customers and business leaders confirmed that while local economies are reopening and travel was sections are being lifted , the pace of economic recovery is being impacted by labor shortages and the spike in cases from the delta variant .<q>fortunately , for our customers around the globe , we offer remarkable choice with our omnichannel offering with a comprehensive set of funding and payout options , so they can transfer and receive money in a way that it 's most convenient for them .<q>during the quarter , we saw continued strength in principal per transaction or ppt with growth over 11 % and cross - border total principal growth of 29 % , benefiting from continued demand for support in received markets and improving economic and employment trends in central regions like the u.s. and western europe .<q>total company revenue grew 16 % or 13 % on a constant currency basis , with underlying trends aided by continued growth in our digital business and sequential improvement in the retail business .<q>digital revenues were up from the first quarter and grew 22 % year - over - year to over $ 265 million with quarterly highs for revenue , transactions and principal .<q>digital comprised 36 % of transactions and 24 % of revenues for the c2c segment .<q>as expected , we are beginning to see digital growth ease after exceptionally strong performance during the height of the covid - 19 pandemic .<q>wu.com results were healthy with transaction growth over 18 % , driven by 14 % growth in average monthly active users .<q>western union with its trusted brand , large and growing digital customer base , and global platform is well positioned to execute on this opportunity .<q>wu.com continue to lead money transfer appears in mobile app downloads by a wide margin and grow principle over 30 % .<q>we continue to expand in the new market launch in chile and peru in the second quarter and enhancing the customer experience with new futures and tools , including the rollout of additional electronic know your customer options across european and transaction reminders .
for today 's call , i will provide opening comments followed by preston with an update on the wright medical integration .<q>as a reminder , we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020 .<q>our organic sales growth was 4.7 % in the quarter .<q>versus q1 2020 , pricing was 0.9 % , unfavorable .<q>foreign currency had a favorable 1.3 % impact on sales .<q>during the quarter , the continued impact of the covid - 19 pandemic and related surgical procedure cancellations , primarily in the us and europe , negatively impacted our sales .<q>also , as noted in the fourth quarter , demand for certain capital products continued as we saw strong results in our mako and emergency care products .<q>international organic sales showed strong growth of 15 % and impacted by positive sales momentum in china , japan , australia , and canada .<q>our adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $ 1.93 increased 2.7 % from 2019 , reflecting sales growth partially offset by higher interest charges resulting from the wright acquisition as well as an overall disciplined ramp - up in operating costs .<q>these acquisitions continue to demonstrate our focus on our strategy of driving category leadership and market - leading growth .<q>this includes strong performances in us shoulder and us trauma .<q>neurotechnology and spine had constant currency and organic growth of 12.8 % .<q>this growth reflects double - digit performances in our interventional spine , neurosurgical and ent businesses and 27 % growth in our neurovascular business .<q>finally , our dedicated business development teams continue to identify and execute on tuck - in acquisitions .<q>glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results , before opening the call to q&a .<q>this was driven by outstanding international results , particularly in asia pacific and the benefits of our diversified business model .
earlier today , we published our fourth quarter 2021 results .<q>we believe this strategy provides the necessary framework to continue to drive long - term sustainable growth , and it is grounded in our purpose : making a difference in people 's lives .<q>we innovate customer solutions by combining leading technologies and operational strength to empower and protect the everyday hero .<q>we serve and support those who rely on us with a relentless focus throughout the product life cycle .<q>we advance by expanding into new markets and geographies to make a difference around the world .<q>we 're excited about the direction we 're headed and believe that innovate .<q>provides the road map to get us there .<q>i invite you to check out the details of our strategy on the oshkosh website .<q>much like we discussed on our last call , demand for our industry - leading access equipment remains very strong , but near - term results are being meaningfully impacted by supply chain and logistics challenges as well as higher input costs .<q>access equipment , which faced an extreme decline in demand in 2020 as a result of the covid - 19 pandemic , has since experienced the most rapid rebound of any of our businesses .<q>the rapid return of demand in 2021 exacerbated the supply chain challenges we have been facing , and we believe it will remain choppy well into 2022 .<q>our access team continues to work hard to source components to build and shift products to customers around the globe .<q>despite these challenges , we delivered strong revenue growth of 37 % in the fourth quarter , leading to 22 % revenue growth for the full year .<q>we have taken multiple pricing actions over the past several months based on rising input costs , which we expect will largely address price / cost challenges by the end of the second quarter of 2022 .<q>and of course , we will continue to be diligent in our pricing approach should input costs increase further .<q>we believe that we are in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle for access equipment as the rental companies work to lower the overall age of their fleets , which were at historically high levels entering 2021 .
reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website .<q>and we do n't leave it up to the market .<q>heat in michigan is not an option .<q>given the operational certainty of storage as well as the financial protection of a pass - through clause , our customers stay safe and warm all winter long and have affordable bills .<q>most of the gas is already locked in at just under $ 3 per thousand cubic feet , which is well below current levels in the spot market and offers tremendous customer value .<q>right now , our fields are full and ready to deliver for our customers ' heating needs throughout the winter months .<q>we started putting natural gas into our storage field in april and continued throughout the summer when natural gas prices were low .<q>that is a significant advantage .<q>let me tell you about our gas business .<q>as we move forward , we continue to see long - term dividend growth of 6 % to 8 % with a targeted payout ratio of about 60 % over time .<q>that 's what you expect , why you own us , and we know it 's a big part of our value .<q>as previously stated , we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022 and beyond .<q>we buy , store and deliver .<q>michigan 's strong regulatory construct is known across the industry as one of the best .<q>for the first nine months of the year , rate relief continues to be the primary driver of our positive year - over - year variance to the tune of $ 0.45 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses .<q>the waterfall chart on slide eight provides more detail on the key year - to - date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 .
these statements involve risks and uncertainties , and actual results may differ materially from those discussed or anticipated .<q>i 'm excited about the recent product launches of ageloc boost and nutricentials bioadaptives , which generated more than $ 35 million for the quarter in a limited number of markets .<q>for us , this shift has resulted in more than 90 % of our revenue coming from online transactions , with approximately half our revenue coming from recurring customer subscription and loyalty programs .<q>the way people engage with beauty and wellness has changed as shopping behaviors and personalized product experiences have become increasingly digital .<q>our next step to expand our dominant position will be to add connectivity to our devices as part of our empower me personalization strategy that we introduced to all of you at investor day .<q>this further validates our scientific rigor as a unique strength and competitive advantage in the beauty industry .<q>as ritch mentioned , this is the fourth consecutive year euromonitor has ranked nu skin as the world 's # 1 beauty device systems brand .<q>we 'll continue to strengthen our industry - leading position with our robust product pipeline in 2021 and beyond .<q>this category is nearly $ 7 billion and is projected to grow more than 20 % annually between now and 2030 .<q>before i go into more detail about the quarter , i want to run through the three key components of our strategy to grow : our innovative products , our unique affiliate channel and our powerful platform .<q>these trends , combined with our strategic investments over the past years to build greater digital capabilities , have positioned us well to realize today 's opportunities and accelerate our own pace of change .<q>traditional advertising , retail and e-commerce are being disrupted by influencer marketing and social commerce like never before , a trend that has accelerated significantly over the last year .<q>from digital , social and mobile connections to the expansion of the gig economy , our world is changing rapidly .<q>first , we 'll introduce a unique beauty - from - within product line , beginning with beauty focus collagen + with our proprietary formula aimed at disrupting the burgeoning $ 50 billion beauty supplement market .<q>this product is clinically proven to help improve skin health and complement other nu skin products , including our lumispa beauty system .<q>and it all happens within a digital ecosystem that enables our affiliates to attract , connect , transact and service consumers in nearly 50 markets .
yesterday , after the market closed , we issued our quarterly release .<q>this has obvious implications for ils investors .<q>but building proprietary climate change - informed cat models goes beyond investments in cat risk and benefits all of our stakeholders .<q>our ils partners rely on us to accurately model the risks inherent to their investment .<q>our clients appreciate the superior customer service that we can provide through deeper insight into the full distribution of their risk profile , which often leads to increased demand for our products .<q>and our shareholders benefit from the more efficient portfolios of risk we can construct as well as our enhanced sustainability .<q>contrary to some perspectives , accurately pricing for climate risk does not put us at a competitive disadvantage to our peers , rather an industry - leading understanding of the influence of climate on risk is a key component of superior risk selection allowing us to shape our portfolios but growing on the best business and shrinking on the worst .<q>moving on from climate change .<q>i want to take a minute to discuss capital deployment opportunities .<q>as we enter the important january one renewal period , i believe we will have one of the best opportunities in many years to profitably deploy material additional capital .<q>i 'll provide more detailed update on the renewal in our segments at the end of the call .<q>as kevin discussed , and as you saw in our pre release , our third quarter results were impacted by active wind and wildfire season .<q>despite this elevated activity , we reported positive net income and remain in a very strong capital position going into renewals .<q>today , i will discuss our consolidated performance and then provide more detail on our three drivers of profit : underwriting income , fee income and investment income .<q>starting with our consolidated results , where we reported an annualized return on average common equity of 2.8 % , benefiting from mark - to - market gains in our strategic investment portfolio .<q>moving now to our property segment , where gross written premiums increased by $ 113 million or 36 % from the comparable quarter .
i always mention strong and consistent cash flow and explain how we use that cash flow to pay a healthy and growing dividend , internally fund our expansion capex needs , keep our balance sheet strong and opportunistically buy back our shares i believe our shareholders understand and appreciate the strength of our cash flow even if there are varied positions on what we should do with it .<q>these things are all important to our long - term success , and we have advanced it all significantly on all three in 2021 .<q>we continue to focus on the g governance in esg as well .<q>this is increasingly a point of distinction with our investors , our regulators , and our customers .<q>1 in our sector for how we manage esg risk , and two other rating services have us in the top 10 .<q>in the meantime , sustainalytics has us ranked no .<q>we 'll soon be publishing our esg report , including both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions , we have incorporated esg reporting and risk management into our existing management processes , and the report will explain how .<q>further , our das team has now concluded three responsibly sourced gas transactions .<q>so we 're getting attractive returns on these investments .<q>importantly , too , that 69 % is projected to come in at a weighted average 3.6 times ebitda multiple of the expansion capital spend .<q>repurposing and building assets at our current terminal locations to support the energy sources of the future .<q>that includes natural gas , of course , but it also includes $ 250 million of organic projects supporting renewable diesel in our products and terminals business units and our renewable natural gas projects .<q>as things stand today , 69 % of our backlog is in support of low - carbon infrastructure .<q>those are low emissions along the chain from the producer through our transmission and storage business .<q>as always , we will evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities .<q>and so i 'm going to start with the natural gas business unit for the quarter .
they are based on management 's assumptions , which may or may not occur .<q>switching now to our detailed financial results .<q>in addition to these deferrals in order to further mitigate the financial effects of the pandemic , we initiated temporary cost - savings measures which provided approximately $ 2 million of savings for the third quarter and year - to - date .<q>at the end of september , this revenue totaled approximately $ 1 million .<q>utilities are also allowed to recover late fee revenue that has not been charged to customers since the suspension of normal collection processes .<q>i 'll describe earnings drivers on an after - tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5 % .<q>while our business model is resilient we are experiencing some financial impacts related to the pandemic .<q>prudency review and recovery of the deferral accounts will be determined at a future proceeding .<q>direct expense reduction , such as lower travel and meals and entertainment are to be netted against the deferral .<q>financing costs associated with additional liquidity and certain lost revenues .<q>these include ppe , bad debt expense .<q>as david noted , the oregon commission recently approved a covid - 19 term sheet that outlines the types of revenues and costs that may be recovered .<q>through september 30th , we have incurred an estimated $ 7 million of incremental cost and lower revenue .<q>as a reminder , northwest natural 's earnings are seasonal with a majority of revenues generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating season .<q>higher customer rates in washington , customer growth , and revenues from the north mist expansion project contributed an additional $ 10.4 million .<q>in the gas distribution segment , utility margin declined $ 100,000 .
this is tim argo , senior vice president of finance for maa .<q>transaction cap rates on closed projects that we underwrote were down 25 basis points from last quarter and down 50 basis points from first quarter of 2020 .<q>this robust investor demand supported by continued low interest rates has further compressed cap rates , which are frequently in the mid-3 % and low 4 % range for high - quality properties in desirable locations within our markets .<q>however , a lack of properties for sale is causing a supply demand imbalance that continues to drive already aggressive pricing .<q>investor demand for multifamily product within our region of the country remains strong .<q>i 'm proud of them and excited about their strong start to 2021 .<q>they 've shown tremendous adaptability and resilience over the last year .<q>we remain active in the transaction market , but as outlined in our guidance , we are not forecasting executing on any acquisitions of existing communities between now and year - end .<q>we expect phoenix , tampa , raleigh and jacksonville to be our strongest markets and expect houston , orlando and dc to recover but at a slower rate .<q>we are well positioned as we move into our busy leasing season .<q>this is 180 basis points better than the prior year and supports our ability to continue to prioritize our focus on rent growth .<q>exposure , which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60 - day period , is just 7.2 % .<q>our resident satisfaction scores remained strong and are actually ahead of last year by 120 basis points , which should support continued strong renewal lease pricing .<q>new lease - over - lease pricing in april is running close to 4 % of rent on the prior lease .<q>while acquiring existing assets is a challenge , we continue to make progress on the expansion of our development pipeline .<q>we expect to start construction on both of these projects in the second quarter .
in a moment , bruce broussard , humana 's president and chief executive officer ; and susan diamond , chief financial officer , will discuss our second quarter 2021 results and our updated financial outlook for 2021 .<q>she also spent two years on the finance team , leading enterprise planning and forecasting and overseeing the company 's line of business , cfos and controllers .<q>most recently , she led our home business , growing it to the largest offering of its kind .<q>her strong financial background and extensive knowledge of our business make her uniquely positioned to step into the cfo role .<q>the board and i have great confidence in our abilities and the contribution she will make in the next chapter for humana as we execute on our strategic plan and deliver shareholder value .<q>today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $ 6.89 for the second quarter , in line with our previous expectations .<q>recognizing the majority of today 's call will focus on our emerging experience and our 2021 guidance , i want to quickly touch on operating performance across our segments before diving into that detail .<q>our medicaid business results are exceeding our initial expectations given membership increases largely attributable to the extension of the public health emergency as well as higher than expected favorable prior period development .<q>finally , within we set our healthcare services operations , pharmacy continues to see increased mail order penetration as a result of customer experience improvements and additional marketing initiatives .<q>in addition , as bruce indicated in his remarks , we now expect the kindred at home acquisition to close in mid-august subject to customary state and federal regulatory approvals .<q>we remain comfortable with how we approach 2022 pricing , which i will expand on later in my remarks .<q>turning to full year 2021 guidance .<q>our philosophy regarding 2021 guidance has been to provide transparency into the uncertainty caused by covid - 19 and the ability to deliver our targeted earnings growth with solid underlying core business performance and largely offsetting covid - 19 - related headwinds and tailwinds .<q>we have been consistent in and remain committed to this philosophy .<q>in our group and specialty segment , consistent with our commentary on our last earnings call , medical membership declines are lower than we expected coming into the year .<q>we are currently seeing 87 % of our provider partners and value - based arrangements and surplus .
i hope you , your families and your colleagues are doing well .<q>sales are strong and margins are expanding .<q>our business is really firing on all cylinders .<q>and we are laying the foundation for an even better 2022 .<q>in summary , we expect fiscal year 2021 to be a tremendous year for toll brothers .<q>we believe the combination of these positive market conditions and our relentless focus on return on equity and internal operational efficiencies will pay off in the short and long - term with sustainable improved results .<q>our increased focus on more affordable luxury homes should also result in shorten building cycle times , improved inventory turns , lower building costs and higher margins over time .<q>in short , we are controlling more land with fewer dollars , which we expect to lead to higher returns .<q>we are structuring land acquisitions much more efficiently , laying out less cash upfront by negotiating deferred payment terms with sellers and using more third - party land banking , joint venture and option arrangements .<q>over the past year , we have completely revamped our land underwriting standards and are beginning to reap the benefits of this focus on capital - efficient returns .<q>our deep land position provides the foundation to grow our business .<q>sg&a is well controlled and being leveraged .<q>we are generating significant cash flow .<q>we also just announced the redemption of the $ 250 million of 5.625 % notes that were due in 2024 .<q>this quarter , we also repaid approximately $ 190 million of debt by paying down $ 150 million of our floating - rate bank term loan and reducing purchase money mortgages on some of our owned land by about $ 30 million , among some other things .<q>our strong cash generation in fiscal 2020 enabled us to balance land and builder acquisitions with returning cash to our stockholders , while prudently managing our debt .
i am pleased to report the final results for 2020 .<q>fourth quarter normalized ffo was $ 0.57 per share .<q>i will review our fourth quarter and full - year 2020 results , and provide an overview of our full - year 2021 guidance .<q>our team members strive to perform their best each day and the results of their efforts have been impressive .<q>we have over 4,000 team members dedicated to ensuring success in our organization , and for that i am grateful .<q>2020 was a difficult year .<q>over the past five years , we have increased our dividend 71 % .<q>consistent with the past , in 2021 , we expect to have an excess of $ 90 million of discretionary capital after meeting our obligations for dividend payments , recurring capital expenditures and principal payments .<q>the stability in growth of our cash flow , our solid balance sheet and the strong underlying trends in our business are the primary drivers of the decision to increase the dividend .<q>the board will determine the amount of each quarterly dividend in advance of payment .<q>the board has approved setting the annual dividend rate at a $ 1.45 per share , a 6 % increase .<q>next , i would like to update you on our 2021 dividend policy .<q>we will continue to pursue and execute on these value add transactions .<q>in total , in 2020 , we purchased eight parcels of land adjacent to our existing properties .<q>we anticipate being able to build 1,000 sites in these acquired acres .<q>strong performance in our core portfolio generated 3.6 % noi growth for the fourth quarter .
we appreciate your continued interest in our company .<q>esg has become a more significant topic of conversation in the investment community over the last couple of years , but these are not new areas of focus for us at davita .<q>our beliefs are incorporated into our stated vision of social responsibility that has three components : caring for our patients , caring for each other and caring for the world around us , including both our communities and our environment .<q>and our commitment to cultivating diversity is evident throughout the organization .<q>it starts with the board of directors , currently made up of nine leaders , of whom 67 % are diverse , including four women and three people of color .<q>these results have been achieved through thoughtful and deliberate practices to create a diverse pipeline of talent .<q>in 2021 , we published our first report on diversity and belonging , disclosing many of our company 's diverse metrics and our ongoing efforts to cultivate a diverse organization in which everyone feels that he or she belongs .<q>we also recently published our 14th annual corporate social responsibility report and our first esg report .<q>these reports disclose the progress we made in 2020 and lay out our ambitious esg goals for 2025 , including goals to reduce carbon emissions by 50 % and to have vendors representing 70 % of emissions set by climate change goals and to achieve engagement scores of 84 % or higher among our teammate population .<q>and as you can see by our goal , we have a lot more we hope to accomplish .<q>my final topic is our ongoing commitment to environmental , social and governance matters or esg .<q>q1 was a strong start to the year with solid financial performance .<q>as javier referenced , treatment volume was a large headwind and our nonacquired growth was negative 2.2 % compared to negative 0.3 % in q4 .<q>while covid presented the main challenge to nag in q1 , winter storms , particularly uri , were responsible for about 30 basis points of the nag decline .<q>treatments per day bottomed out during the first quarter , so we expect to start seeing quarter - over - quarter growth in q2 .<q>u.s. dialysis revenue per treatment grew sequentially by almost $ 3 this quarter as a result of the medicare rate increase , higher enrollment in ma plans , a slight improvement in commercial mix and higher volume from our hospital services business , partially offset by the seasonal impact of coinsurance and deductible .
such statements are based upon current information and management 's expectations as of this date and they are not guarantees of future performance .<q>we are adding back more rigs in the competition due to our proven ability to reactivate rig safely , efficiently and cost effectively .<q>we believe there is an opportunity to grow our market share above 25 % .<q>if you look at previous downturns we have faced since the 2008 financial crisis , we have emerged stronger with greater capability as we differentiated our offerings and grew market share in the premium part of the market .<q>going forward , in a structurally smaller u.s. market , we believe super - spec rigs combined with digital technology solutions that provide improved value through wellbore quality will prevail .<q>relative to the 800 rig drilling a year ago , many idle scr and less - capable ac rigs may be permanently sidelined .<q>another aspect of our asset deployment strategy , we plan to execute , will occur over the medium to long - term in international markets .<q>our international business development team is seeing some bidding activity in argentina , colombia , the middle east as well as other markets .<q>at this time , these prospects are in early stages , but we are encouraged by the customer interest in h&p flexrigs due to a combination of our expertise and unconventional drilling .<q>our strong historical performance in these areas and the need for , what we would consider an imminent legacy rig replacement , driven by an evolution toward digital technology for wellbore quality and placement .<q>these are great opportunities for h&p in addition to our initiatives to improve our cost structure , where mark will provide more details in his remarks .<q>before turning the call over to mark , i want to underscore once more the focus and success our company has made on its strategic objectives , particularly given the economic and industry headwinds we are navigating .<q>as we 've indicated previously , introducing disruptive technologies and new business models , is a long , arduous and sometimes , unpredictable process .<q>i believe our dedicated teams are well equipped and our conservative financial stewardship will enable us to capitalize on the challenges and opportunities ahead .<q>today , i will review our fiscal first quarter 2021 operating results , provide guidance for the second quarter , update full fiscal year 2021 guidance as appropriate and comment on our financial position .<q>let me start with highlights for the recently completed first quarter ended december 31 , 2020 .
david lesar , our ceo ; jason wells , our cfo , will discuss the company 's third quarter 2021 results .<q>we believe that with the deployment of these additional tools , we will be able to mitigate some of the impacts of future extreme weather events on our customers .<q>we already have an outstanding rfp for additional mobile generation , which could bring our total up to 500 megawatts and hope to have this procured in the coming months .<q>we look forward to mobilize quickly on the other tools provided to us by the texas legislature to improve the resiliency of the electric grid and help reduce the risk of prolonged outages .<q>we were the first the utility in the state to act on this legislative opportunity and had them in place to utilize them in the way the law intended .<q>and recently , during an ercot forecasted texas wide load - shedding event , the texas puc [ indecipherable ] to make sure our units were ready to support customers .<q>one of those opportunities was the ability to lease and put into rate base mobile generation units .<q>due to recent weather events in both louisiana and texas , we are running slightly behind on our capital spending plans on a year - to - date basis .<q>this includes new opportunities that stem from the latest legislative session in texas .<q>as i mentioned earlier , we have increased our five - year capital plans to $ 18 billion plus over the next five years and $ 40 billion plus over the next 10 years .<q>jason will get into more detail on the variances shortly .<q>in the third quarter of this year , we had a onetime impact to earnings of $ 0.04 per share related to our most recent board implemented governance changes .<q>so this raises our guidance for 2022 utility earnings per share to $ 1.36 to $ 1.38 .<q>and for the first nine months , we 've already achieved nearly 80 % of that full year goal .<q>these weather events pulled away many of our contract crews , so they could provide mutual assistance to our fellow utilities , especially in louisiana .<q>a recent highlight in indiana happened just this past week .
earlier today , we published our third quarter 2020 results .<q>we remain committed to the emea market and will be able to serve it more efficiently from our existing global manufacturing footprint , including plants in france and the u.k. in addition to the facilities rationalization , we also reduced our office staffing in the segment with a modest workforce reduction .<q>our simplification framework has been an important enabler for our ability to deliver robust margins throughout the business cycle , as well as relocate production so that we can operate with improved logistics and customer service levels .<q>while covid - 19 has impacted access equipment markets around the world , we are staying flexible and nimble in our approach to managing the business .<q>we know that access equipment will come back , but we do not currently have a time frame .<q>we will control what we can and make the right decisions that we believe will facilitate our success when demand returns .<q>we are further encouraged by the age of access equipment fleets , particularly in north america , that we expect will be a positive demand driver in future quarters .<q>finally , just as we discussed last quarter , our facility in china is back online , and we retain our positive outlook for this market as demand is returning .<q>please turn to page five , and i 'll discuss our defense segment .<q>department of defense and our allies .<q>we continue to work with a number of foreign governments on jltv opportunities .<q>we announced the closure of our medias , romania facility at the end of june , which will occur over the next 12 months .<q>our defense backlog remains solid at nearly $ 3.3 billion , up over 15 % from the prior year which provides good visibility , especially given the current environment where the pandemic has limited visibility across many industries .<q>we have been working with our partner , al - tadrea , for the past two years to finalize the agreement .<q>this is part of our longer - term plan to be an integrated strategic partner with his key u.s. ally for defense vehicles and life cycle services .<q>this is an important milestone for our international defense activities .
our actual results could significantly differ due to many risks , including those -- the risk factors in our sec filings .<q>in addition , we are leveraging relationships with advisors , and our distribution partners , centers of influence , uncovered through multi-year fixed rate annuities to migrate toward fixed index annuity .<q>we are beginning to see our plan bear results .<q>as the financial planning needs of americans evolve , american equity is focused on providing our clients the dignity of a paycheck for life .<q>i believe our commitment to this core mission statement will become recognized and appreciated in the market over time .<q>this will help grow ael in both our channels and open up other market access opportunities for us in the future .<q>at this time , i would also like to take a moment and share with you the conclusions of a corporate governance project undertaken by our board of directors .<q>earlier this year , our board , retained a nationally recognized expertise to review its structure and operations and to advise it on governance practices .<q>the board has completed its review and is implementing changes to refresh our corporate governance , in line with best practices and to advance our strategic evolution .<q>plus , the ceo has set a new director retirement age at 75 years and has modified the membership and structure of its committees .<q>importantly , on this front , our audit committee well exercise increased risk management oversight .<q>the nominating and corporate governance committee will have an expanded role in director compensation , selection and skills training .<q>the compensation committee we 'll have a deeper role in executive talent development and succession planning .<q>we believe these changes will make our board even more effective in driving stakeholder value realization and in playing its essential role in the successful transformation of the company .<q>capital markets showed strong performance and the investment portfolio performed as expected in the quarter .<q>the overall credit quality remained strong with an overall rating of single a minus for long - term investments .
please be advised that the discussion of our financial results may include certain non-gaap financial measures .<q>we recognize the particular difficulties in this age group , even prior to the pandemic and have been working on an entirely new design for our k - 5 course catalog .<q>additionally , supporting younger students during at - home learning can be a challenge for families .<q>younger students were less likely to attend school consistently , and were more likely to suffer from significant learning loss .<q>i also wanted to highlight one of our new product offerings for this school year .<q>tim will provide more details on this in just a minute .<q>for this year , that means we expect to grow both our top and bottom line and we believe we are on pace or better for the long - term goals we set out for ourselves just last november .<q>i think the investment community was rightfully skeptical of our ability to grow , after last year 's pandemic bump [ phonetic ] , and make no mistake , we continue to see a positive impact on our business from the ongoing pandemic uncertainty .<q>we think that this interest , coupled with the opening of new programs and new states , can sustain strong growth in this business over the long term .<q>even as interest in virtual options has increased , career learning interest continues to outpace it by multiples in the middle and high school space .<q>and our surveys for career learning demand are even more positive than overall virtual education .<q>it 's also three times the level we were at , just two years ago .<q>we desperately need skilled workers , and many high school students are realizing that their future success does not need to be tied to a four - year college degree .<q>our new programs are built specifically to support more independent learning and allow parents and families to play a more supporting role in their child 's education .<q>we believe these new courses will allow for deeper engagement and better academic outcomes .<q>and lastly , while covid was rightfully receiving much of the attention over the last year , there have been other catastrophic disruptions .
and scott wells , chief executive officer of clear channel outdoor americas , will participate in the q&a portion of the call .<q>we also benefited from our strategic focus on roadside locations , which historically account for about two - thirds of our total european revenue and are far less affected by covid - 19 driven restrictions than the transit environment which account for approximately 10 % of our european revenue .<q>our uk business was a great example of this , where about 80 % of revenue is historically from roadside inventory .<q>since mid-july , up until the recent announcements of new restrictions , our customer booking activity actually exceeded bookings made in the same period last year .<q>moving on to page 6 , and the americas business .<q>with the outlook in the americas improving , we remain cautiously optimistic for the near term .<q>our longer - term focus remains on returning to growth , which we believe we can achieve in 2021 .<q>as we enter the fourth quarter , our visibility remains limited .<q>however , we have shifted from playing defense to playing offense , leveraging the investments we 've made , and continuing to make in technology .<q>our focus is on selling creative ideas as opposed to specific billboard locations .<q>our ability to get a foot in the door is improving all the time .<q>we continue to demonstrate to advertisers how our radar suite of solutions can help us help them .<q>the audience levels are returning to normal , but travel patterns have changed .<q>audiences are spending more time close to home and less time in city centers , but they 're still out and about .<q>with radar , we 're able to quickly to adjust to these new travel patterns to help our customers understand the best inventory and roadways on which to reach their customers , we target those customers via our mobile ad and measure the success of the campaign .<q>this is just the latest of enhancements to the radar suite , and we expect to continue to add customer friendly capabilities to radar in the coming months .
presenting today are bryan deboer , president and ceo ; chris holzshu , executive vice president and coo ; and tina miller , senior vice president and cfo .<q>these lithia e-commerce sales are in addition to driveway 's growing successes that we will share in just a few moments .<q>to put this into perspective , these e-commerce sales as a percentage of monthly unique visitors , represents a 0.32 % or what we call a golden ratio .<q>this performance level is similar to other established , digital - only used retailers .<q>to further illustrate the strength of our omnichannel strategy , when our lad total sales are compared to unique visitors from all channels , our golden ratio was 1.46 % , nearly 5 times more successful than our digital used - only peers .<q>lastly , it 's important to note that we are not incurring incremental spending on our stores ' e-commerce tools as we are leveraging third - party vendors similar to our new vehicle franchise peers e-branding efforts .<q>though we are pacing significantly ahead of our 2025 plan , we remind everyone that our revenues have experienced drag from inventory constraints , and earnings are greatly inflated from vehicle margins .<q>finally , we are pleased to report that every channel and adjacency is considerably ahead of plan .<q>we remain humble and mindful that the elevated earnings levels of the past few quarters are driven by factors outside of our control and remain poised to capture every possible revenue and margin available to us in this market .<q>as a reminder , the 2025 plan assumes a pre-covid business environment , margins , and growth rates .<q>key drivers of this are no further equity capital raises meaning no further dilution to eps , leveraging our underutilized network to support a 2 times to 3 times increase in vehicle sales , and a 4 times increase in parts and service sales through the existing network .<q>further improvements in personnel productivity , economies of scale , and marketing from national brand awareness ; an investment - grade credit rating to reduce borrowing costs , and most importantly , further adjacencies with higher margins and structurally lower sg&a costs .<q>the adjacency we 're furthest [ phonetic ] along with is driveway finance or dfc , that has experienced rapid growth since expanding in spring of 2020 .<q>we are planning to enter the abs term market by the end of the year , which will allow us to quickly and profitably scale future consumer offering and lending volumes .<q>the front - loading of our m&a provides a larger base for driveway finance to draw from and increases the potential contribution above what our current 2025 plan includes .<q>we are excited about the continued growth of driveway and the interest and engagement it 's seen from our consumers .
joining me on the call today is bob schottenstein , our ceo and president ; tom mason , evp ; derek klutch , president of our mortgage company ; ann marie hunker , vp , corporate controller ; and kevin hake , senior vp .<q>we delivered a third quarter record 2,137 homes , delivering 58 % of our backlog , which was the same percentage as a year ago .<q>during the quarter , we opened 12 new communities while closing 25 , and we opened 51 new communities during the nine months ended 9/30 this year .<q>the breakdown by region is 86 in the northern region and 121 in the southern region .<q>our community count was 207 at the end of the third quarter compared to 221 at the end of ' 19 third quarter .<q>our new contracts were up 75 % in july , up 94 % in august and up 44 % in september .<q>we have meaningful operating momentum and are poised to have an outstanding year .<q>our balance sheet is healthy .<q>our financial condition is strong .<q>finally , let me conclude by saying that in addition to having a record - shattering quarter , our company is in the best shape ever .<q>our third quarter 2020 operating gross margin was 22.9 % , up 240 basis points year - over - year and up 100 basis points from the second quarter .<q>revenue was up 115 % to $ 28.9 million due to a higher volume of loans closed and sold along with significantly higher pricing margins .<q>our mortgage and title operations achieved record third quarter results in pre-tax income , revenue and number of loans originated .<q>and our earnings per diluted share for the quarter increased to $ 2.51 per share from $ 1.32 last year .<q>the decrease is due to lower outstanding borrowings in this year 's third quarter as well as a lower weighted average borrowing rate .<q>the pandemic continues to affect our operations , though our teams have managed through it very well .
chief investment officer greg wright , chief technology officer chris sharp , and chief revenue officer corey dyer are also on the call and will be available for q&a .<q>with the world 's eyes currently on tokyo for the olympics , we are opening a new tokyo facility that 's poised to win the gold medal .<q>we are also opening another data center in osaka this quarter , along with our first data center and the first carrier - neutral offering in seoul , korea , during the fourth quarter .<q>we are very excited about the opportunity in seoul .<q>finally , earlier this month , we announced our intention to enter india in partnership with brookfield infrastructure .<q>let 's turn to the macro environment on page 5 .<q>we are fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers .<q>our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platformdigital .<q>the first of these trends is the growing importance of data gravity for global 2000 enterprises .<q>last year , we introduced the data gravity index , our market intelligence tool , which forecasts the growing intensity of enterprise data creation life cycle and its gravitational impact on global it infrastructure between key global markets .<q>with data sets exploding and data gravity challenges expanding , this initiative will enable multinational enterprises to connect these data oceans through fabric and orchestration .<q>third - party research continues to support data gravity 's growing importance .<q>market intelligence firm , gartner , recently conducted its 6th annual survey of chief data officers , and less than 35 % of these executives reported their business have achieved their data sharing objectives , including data exchange with external data sources that drive revenue - generating business outcomes .<q>issues often arise due to multiple data hosting and processing meeting places together with the need for appropriate security controls and the inability to overcome latency challenges with direct private interconnection between many counterparties .<q>platformdigital was designed to solve these problems .<q>we signed total bookings of $ 113 million in the second quarter , including a $ 13 million contribution from interconnection .
joining us on the call today are rod larson , president and chief executive officer , who will be providing our prepared comments ; and alan curtis , senior vice president and chief financial officer .<q>subject to quarterly variances , we continue to expect our drill support market share to generally approximate 60 % .<q>sequentially , our second - quarter 2021 adjusted operating income line on lower segment revenue .<q>activity in our mobility solutions or nonenergy business remained muted during the second quarter of 2021 .<q>our manufactured products backlog on june 30th , 2021 , was $ 315 million improving on our first - quarter backlog of $ 248 million .<q>revenue benefited from ongoing field activities in several projects in angola and a seasonal increase in intervention , maintenance , and repair or imr work in the gulf of mexico .<q>adjusted unallocated expenses of $ 30.3 million was slightly lower sequentially due to lower expense accruals related to incentive - based compensation forfeitures .<q>we are projecting a decline in our consolidated adjusted operating results on moderately lower revenues with adjusted ebitda in the range of 50 million to $ 55 million .<q>we expect commodity prices to support good activity levels in our energy segments , particularly for short - cycle work .<q>ssr adjusted ebitda margin is anticipated to remain consistent with the prior several quarters .<q>for manufactured products , we anticipate relatively flat revenue and adjusted operating profitability .<q>the riserless well intervention project and field support contract in angola are expected to continue for a portion of the third quarter .<q>average rov revenue per day on hire of 8,056 was 2 % higher than average rov revenue per day on hire of $ 7,874 achieved during the first quarter .<q>our comments today also include non-gaap financial measures .<q>these results reflect a marked sequential increase in activity as four out of five of our operating segments delivered a revenue increase on average of more than 19 % .<q>as announced yesterday , we are raising our ebitda guidance range to 200 to $ 225 million for 2021 .
also , the release and supplemental include a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures .<q>to date , we 've received repayment of approximately 25 % of total deferrals and remain on track to be largely repaid by the end of 2021 .<q>we have made significant progress on phase two of our market rotation plan to exit greensboro and memphis .<q>these sales will bring phase two dispositions to $ 151 million for the year at prices that are in line with our pre pandemic expectations .<q>for the few high - quality buildings that have come to market since the pandemic started , pricing has been very competitive , especially for buildings with high occupancy , limited near - term lease roll and creditworthy customers .<q>we 're actively looking for opportunities to deploy capital , which is why we 've kept our 2020 acquisition outlook range unchanged at $ 0 to $ 200 million .<q>however , we 'll stay true to our mantra of being disciplined allocators of capital and only seek opportunities where risk - adjusted returns make sense for our shareholders .<q>our 1.2 million square foot $ 503 million development pipeline remains on budget and on schedule .<q>these deals bring our overall pre-leased rate to 79 % .<q>in addition to the signed leases , we have seen increased prospect activity at both these projects in the past several weeks .<q>upon stabilization , our pipeline will provide more than $ 40 million of noi , of which more than $ 32 million is already secured through signed leases .<q>we do n't expect any new project announcements this year , and therefore , we took the possibility of new development announcements out of our updated 2020 outlook .<q>as i mentioned earlier , we incurred $ 0.05 of expenses this quarter due to debt extinguishment charges and noncash straight - line rent write - offs .<q>in addition , fourth quarter dispositions will be dilutive by $ 0.01 per share .<q>these items , which negatively impact our full year results by $ 0.06 in the aggregate were not in our prior outlook of $ 3.59 to $ 3.68 .<q>finally , our performance the past few quarters demonstrates our ability to quickly adapt to changing macro conditions through reduced opex and meeting customers ' needs with flexible and creative lease solutions .
my discussions today focus on the fourth - quarter fiscal 2021 results .<q>we believe that arpu will continue to climb with the addition of new nrs pay accounts , increased utilization of our enormously powerful advertising network , and further utilization of data offerings by our consumer packaged goods partners just to name a few .<q>also within our fintech segment , money transfer revenue decreased 49 % compared to the year - ago quarter .<q>as we have discussed previously , a transitory foreign exchange market condition materially boosted revenue and gross profit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and persisted through the second quarter of fiscal 2021 .<q>and finally , turning to our largest segment , traditional communications continue to exceed our expectations .<q>the increase reflects the positive impact of an income tax valuation allowance reversal in addition to the strong improvements in the underlying profitability of several of our business units .<q>cash generation during the quarter helped to drive an increase in cash and current investments of $ 34 million during the quarter and $ 52 million during the fiscal year to $ 161 million as of july 31 , and we have no debt .<q>following the quarter close , our nrs business sold a 2.5 % stake to a private investment fund for $ 10 million , implying a $ 400 million valuation for that business .<q>that was based on approximately 19 times nrs ' trailing 12 - month revenue at the end of our third quarter .<q>within traditional communications , mobile top - up revenue increased by 41 % , powered by increases in sales in its b2b channel .<q>we expect to file the 10 - k with the sec on or about october 14 .<q>let 's focus first on net2 phone .<q>growth in our latin america and u.s. and canadian market was again very strong .<q>our subscription revenue margin remained robust , increasing 10 basis points to 83.5 % .<q>net2 phone 's strategic focus on midsized businesses , our multichannel go - to - market strategies , and deeply localized in - country offerings consistently generate gross margins and revenue growth metrics above ucaas industry averages .<q>customers in net2 phone do n't hear no very often .
we will be discussing results that were released yesterday after the close .<q>the main difference between reported and adjusted net income being the gain on sale of certain buildings .<q>compared to last year , total title revenues for the quarter increased $ 248 million or 50 % due to strong performances from our residential agency and commercial operations .<q>the title segment generated $ 126 million of pre-tax income , an increase of $ 71 million from last year 's quarter .<q>as a result of revenue growth and continued management focus .<q>pre-tax margin for the segment also improved to 17 % compared to 11 % from q2 2020 .<q>with respect to our direct title business , residential revenues increased $ 76 million or 47 % from increased purchase and refinancing transactions .<q>for the second quarter 2021 , stewart reported , net income of $ 95 million and diluted earnings per share of $ 3.50 on total operating revenues of $ 802 million .<q>the average agency remittance rate was settled or at 17.5 % .<q>in regard to operating expenses , which consist of employee and other operating costs , total operating expenses increased primarily due to increased revenue and order activity .<q>on other matters , our financial position remains very solid to support our customers , employees , and the real estate market .<q>our total cash and investments on the balance sheet are approximately $ 600 million over regulatory requirements and we have approximately $ 225 million available on our line of credit facility .<q>since these watch items can create operating volatility .<q>although the economy is improving , there are several watch items including fed and government policy in action , virus variants and anti-vac sentiment , and an improving yet historically high mortgage delinquency and forbearance , which need to play out .<q>to listen online , please go to the stewart.com website to access the link for this conference call .<q>because such statements are based on an expectation of future financial operating results and are not statements of fact , actual results may differ materially from those projected .
before getting into the details of the quarter 's performance , i would like to remind everyone that the year - ago quarter was the first full quarter impacted by the covid - 19 pandemic .<q>for q2 , our results came in above our internal expectations due to continued demand for remote capability , digital transformation , the ongoing recovery of office and data center it purchasing and overall above - market growth .<q>essentially , every product category we participate in saw strength in the quarter , most notably notebooks , chromebooks , cloud , security , services , networking and collaboration .<q>our manufacturing business also performed very well with results above the high end of our internal forecast .<q>the demand came from across most all our customer segments with smb and public sector leading the way .<q>from a geographical perspective , all regions were at expectations or better .<q>regarding our proposed merger with tech data , everything is going well .<q>as marshall mentioned , we are set up for an effective financing of the transaction .<q>our proxy has been filed and our shareholder meeting will be held next week .<q>and from a regulatory standpoint , we have received clearance from a number of governmental authorities and expect the rest to process through normal course .<q>as would be expected , the covid pandemic has led to review delays in some countries .<q>we still believe our transaction will close in the second half of 2021 , reflective of the typical six to eight months announced to close time frame for a deal of this size and complexity .<q>the integration work we have performed since the announcement , albeit limited due to regulatory rules , further supports the strategic benefits of this deal that we discussed in march .<q>we look forward to sharing more when the transaction closes later this year .<q>our priority remains on the health and safety of our associates .<q>we believe these factors represent potential tailwinds for our business .
i 'm evan goldstein , senior vice president of investor relations .<q>and i guess i 'm -- as excited as i am about the revenue , i 'm also very excited that as we 're executing this new operating margin model , we can see the margin in the quarter was also a very healthy , 20.4 % , up 20 basis points year over year , and also delivered $ 386 million in operating cash flow .<q>for fiscal year ' 22 , we are raising again our guide to $ 26.3 billion , which is now at the high end of our range .<q>again , based on just the outstanding performance of the company , we 're able to do some amazing things here with the operating margin .<q>i do n't think salesforce has really ever been -- you know , had better execution , better management team , greater momentum .<q>and i 'll say that in two areas .<q>one is in our core products , our focus on customer success , the customer 360 now with the slack user interface and everything being slack first , but also our core values .<q>so , many of our customers are attracted to us because , in many cases , they 're going through an amazing values transformation and in the areas of -- that we 've pioneered .<q>and as we start to head toward the fortune 100 , i think that -- a lot of the companies that i met with today were mostly fortune 100 ceos .<q>pretty awesome and above where we thought we were going to be , considerably above .<q>and i am excited about the outlook .<q>i 'm excited about our positioning with our customers .<q>so , my hat is really off to the management team and to the employees for making this happen .<q>and we 're raising our guidance for the fourth time in a row as we see increased opportunities for additional revenue growth and additional operating margin capability this year .<q>you see where the numbers are going .<q>and now you can also see that no other software company of our size and scale is really performing at this level .
as she said , i 'm david smith , the company 's ceo .<q>despite these short - term challenges , we continue to believe in the long - term potential of the echopark brand and remain very committed to growing our nationwide distribution network .<q>with our progress today , we remain confident in attaining our goals of 25 % population coverage by the end of 2021 and 90 % population coverage by 2025 .<q>returning now to our franchise business .<q>we recently announced several strategic acquisitions to further accelerate our growth plans in september , we signed a definitive agreement to acquire rfj auto partners , a top 15 u.s. dealer group by total revenues .<q>with 33 locations in seven states and a portfolio of 16 automotive brands , the transaction will add six incremental states to sonic 's geographic coverage and five additional brands to our portfolio , including the highest volume , chrysler dodge jeep ram dealer in the world and dave smith motors .<q>in addition to rfj auto during the third quarter , we announced the acquisition of bobby ford , audi subaru and volkswagen franchises in colorado , further enhancing our automotive sales and service network in that state .<q>with our improved balance sheet and additional liquidity resources , we believe sonic is well positioned to pursue further growth opportunities in our franchised dealerships business , as well as to keep executing on our echopark growth plans .<q>in summary , our quarterly results reflect sonic 's continued operating improvements despite industrywide challenges stemming from the pandemic .<q>the effects of new vehicle inventory shortages have continued to drive used vehicle wholesale pricing higher , which negatively impacted echopark margins and profitability in the near term .<q>joining me on the call today is our president , jeff dyke ; our cfo , mr. heath byrd ; our executive vp of operations , mr. tim keen ; and our chief digital retail officer , mr. steve wittman ; and our vice president of investor relations , mr. danny wieland .<q>we 're very excited to announce another record - breaking quarter .<q>this performance would not have been possible without the amazing effort and execution by our sonic and echopark teammates .<q>on a consolidated basis , we posted record third quarter revenues of $ 3.1 billion , up 21 % and record third quarter gross profit of $ 472 million , up 25 % , driven by strong performance across the board and new used fixed operations in f&i .<q>this includes new market - related losses of $ 18 million and $ 16.8 million , respectively .<q>diving deeper into our core franchised dealerships segment , third quarter 2021 revenues were $ 2.4 billion compared to $ 2.2 billion in the prior year , which reflects the ongoing recovery in consumer demand we 've seen since the high since pandemic .
as always , we appreciate your interest .<q>the outperformance continues to be driven by our operating portfolio performing better - than - anticipated namely higher occupancy and strong rent collections .<q>from a capital perspective , during the third quarter , we issued $ 32 million of equity at an average price of $ 133 per share and earlier this month we closed on two senior unsecured private placement notes totaling $ 175 million .<q>the $ 100 million note was a 10 - year -- has a 10 - year term with a fixed interest rate of 2.61 % .<q>that activity , combined with our already strong and conservative balance sheet , has kept us in a position of financial strength and flexibility , including the complete availability of our $ 395 million revolver as of today .<q>our debt to total market capitalization is 19 % , debt - to - ebitda ratio is 4.9 times , and our interest and fixed charge coverage ratios are over 7.4 times .<q>our rent collections have been equally strong .<q>last april , we reported that 26 % of our tenants have requested some form of rent deferment .<q>in the six subsequent months , that only rose to 28 % and deferral requests have basically ceased .<q>the agreed - upon rent deferrals thus far totaled $ 1.7 million , an increase of only $ 200,000 since our report in july .<q>we have consistently stated the depth and duration of the pandemic and its impact on the economy is undeterminable .<q>however , the immediacy and degree of potential tenant financial stress and loss of occupancy we had budgeted for has not materialized .<q>the revised midpoint exceeds our original pre-covid guidance at the beginning of the year .<q>among the budget changes were an increase in average occupancy from 96 % to 96.5 % and a decrease in reserves for uncollectible rent from $ 3.6 million to $ 2.3 million .<q>note that the reserve for potential bad debt for fourth quarter of $ 600,000 is not attributable to specific tenants .<q>our continued earnings growth directly contributed to increasing our quarterly dividend by 5.3 % to $ 0.79 per share .
it 's important to note that due to ongoing uncertainty related to covid - 19 with respect to the duration and extent of the virus ' immediate and long - term impact on the global retail environment , we continue to expect the possibility of material impacts on our business results .<q>about a year ago , we launched a powerful global under armour voice to drive increased consideration with our target consumer , the focused performer , empowered by enhanced tools and real - time metrics as consumer behavior shifted toward e-commerce , as well as working out from home , including a large shift toward running , we too altered course .<q>from the only way is through to through this together and other variations along the way , we refocused our efforts more surgically to drive greater returns at an exceedingly dynamic environment .<q>and while these efforts , of course , take time to manifest into sea change , exiting a year like 2020 with increased consideration , conversion and higher selling prices in many parts of our business gives us greater confidence in our strategy and execution for the year ahead .<q>in 2020 , we stuck to our playbook and leaned heavier into brand and product marketing to support successful introductions like our project rock collection , meridian pant , infinity bra , ua sportsmask and in footwear , the hovr machina , phantom 2 and the breakthru .<q>one highlight we 're especially encouraged by is the continued momentum in our women 's business , specifically bras and bottoms and broad - based interest across our run category , led by our innovation - driven hovr franchise .<q>another highlight is the launch of the curry brand in december .<q>as a purpose - led collaboration powered by under armour , we 're excited to partner with stephen to deliver performance products that , along with focused partnerships , will help fund youth sports in under - resourced communities through equitable access and safe places to play .<q>as the second footwear cushioning technology released under our reengineered go - to - market , flow 's proprietary nonrubber outsole has manifested into our most obedient and highest traction footwear yet .<q>starting with brand strength and engagement .<q>building on the success and momentum of hovr , the ua flow running platform will help us accomplish two things .<q>and second , as our most pinnacle running footwear offering , it will broaden our ability to segment and help differentiate our assortment , thereby creating opportunities for shelf space expansion within running specialty and key wholesale accounts .<q>switching gears to our second area of focus is our operating model evolution .<q>and within our comprehensive restructuring plan , we believe our central purpose continues to put us in a position to return to double - digit operating margin over the long term .<q>in this spirit , we 've been asked many times if we 've reached an optimal cost structure for under armour or where our general breakeven ratio lies .<q>therefore , our breakeven is somewhere around the 4.7 billion mark .
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties , a description of which can be found in our sec filings .<q>same - store revenues declined 4.9 % in the third quarter , while expenses were down 1.3 % due to increased efficiencies from our team and lower net utility costs as our energy initiatives drive value .<q>bad debt expense was 190 basis points , including 130 basis points attributable to court closures in recent los angeles regulations .<q>average daily occupancy was 93.9 % , down 280 basis points from last year , blended lease rates were down 3 % with new lease rates down 7.6 % and renewals up 2.6 % .<q>one measure of the health of our core businesses is residential net rental income .<q>and at the same time , we achieved 2.6 % rate growth on renewals , this all despite an environment with constant changes in employment , schools , courts , and regulations .<q>our customer service remains world - class with residents giving its 4.3 stars on 19,000 service .<q>our high standards for resident selections are paying dividends , as collections have been consistently high since april .<q>and our units to lease have been cut in half .<q>as a result , lease percentage , our best forward indicator of occupancy increased by more 6 % from july 1 to today .<q>new leasing pace rebounded and was up 20 % year - over - year .<q>encouraging signs make us highly optimistic about recovery and the long - term outlook for our business .<q>until then , i 'll not be able to add much on this subject beyond what i 've already said .<q>full sec descriptions of these plans are expected in form 10 filings expected to be published in the next few days .<q>with that said , results in the quarter depended on geography .<q>in our stable suburban markets , operations were largely business as usual .
i 'm kelsey duffey , vice president of investor relations at walker & dunlop .<q>finally , as you can see just to the right of the hud volumes , we 've brokered $ 1.5 billion of debt to third parties during q2 .<q>that number is down 23 % from q2 2019 , but still very strong , given the dislocation in place in the markets .<q>similar to our debt brokerage business , our multifamily property sales business slowed dramatically in q2 due to the pandemic .<q>we closed $ 447 million of sales volume in q2 , a slow quarter for our team , but we were seeing the market pick back up and currently have 33 properties worth $ 1.4 billion under contracts for closing in q3 and q4 .<q>vision 2020 was established in 2016 with very ambitious five - year goals , $ 30 billion of annual debt financing , $ 8 billion of annual investment sales , $ 8 billion in assets under management and $ 100 billion of loans in our servicing portfolio , which if achieved , would drive $ 1 billion in annual revenues .<q>but that has happened , and rates in hud 's countercyclical role should benefit our hud volumes in future quarters .<q>we announced twice during the second quarter , that the number of forbearance requests in our at - risk portfolio have been extremely low .<q>our only credit risk is on multifamily , and that portfolio continues to perform exceedingly well .<q>as steve will discuss , we took a large loan loss reserve in q1 to incorporate the expected impacts recorded and added another $ 5 million to that reserve in q2 .<q>there are two other topics i 'd like to focus on , before turning the call over to steve .<q>second , as anyone who has ever done hud financing will tell you ; hud business takes a long time to originated process and nothing ever happens in the quarter .<q>he is joined by steve theobald , chief financial officer .<q>these slides serve as a reference point for some of what willy and steve will touch on during the call .<q>we expressly disclaim any obligation to do so .<q>more detailed information about risk factors can be found in our annual and quarterly reports filed with the sec .
it is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host , bill rhodes , chairman , president and ceo .<q>and our earnings per share was $ 25.69 a share , increasing an impressive 38.1 % .<q>our net income was $ 555 million .<q>our same - store sales were up 13.6 % versus last year 's first quarter .<q>now let 's move into more specifics on performance for the quarter .<q>the market share data suggests that we continue to gain share in most markets across the country .<q>in fact , the northeastern midwestern markets slightly outperformed .<q>while last quarter we saw roughly 400 basis point gap in comp performance between the northeast and midwestern markets versus the remainder of the country , we did not see that gap this quarter .<q>during the quarter , there were some geographic regions that did better than others , as there always are .<q>it was encouraging for us to see sales trends remain strong .<q>in our commercial business , we saw most of the sales growth come from transaction growth from new and existing customers .<q>regarding this quarter 's traffic versus ticket growth in retail , our traffic was up 1 % , while our ticket was up 7.5 % .<q>historically , extreme weather , be that hot or cold , helps drive parts failure .<q>as we look forward to the winter months , we are encouraged to see forecast estimating a slightly colder than usual winter .<q>as americans get back to driving more , we 've seen maintenance and failure - related categories perform well .<q>we believe our hard parts business will continue to strengthen as our customers drive more .
on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are our ceo , mick farrell ; and cfo , brett sandercock .<q>in our core market of sleep apnea , we introduced our latest mask innovation in september .<q>it 's called the airtouch n20 .<q>this innovation is the first nasal mask with a memory foam cushion .<q>as a patient myself , i 'm happy to say that this is resmed 's softest nasal mask ever .<q>the adherence rates for resmed solutions are the best in the industry .<q>and it is innovation and technology like this new airtouch n20 that helps get us there .<q>our mask portfolio is crafted to offer physicians market - leading options for prescribing for each patient .<q>to enable home care providers to successfully fit the patient the first time every time and to satisfy the desires of the ultimate customer .<q>that 's the person who suffocates each night with sleep apnea .<q>our focus on innovation to meet customer needs will never end .<q>we are innovating with smaller , quieter , more comfortable , more connected and more intelligent solutions every day .<q>we have an exciting pipeline ahead .<q>let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business , focusing on our strategy to deliver better care for copd and asthma patients worldwide .<q>during the june quarter , we launched , in europe , an upgraded version of our airview cloud - based remote monitoring software , specifically designed for our ventilation solutions .<q>this solution called airview for ventilation provides remote monitoring capability , allowing clinicians to quickly access clinical data from resmed ventilation devices wherever they are , and to allow them to more easily triage and prioritize both chronic needs and acute needs for ventilated patients .
we will also discuss non-gaap financial measures regarding our performance .<q>we believe this is a prudent approach given the inherent difficulty in predicting fda clearance time lines .<q>as chris will later discuss , we believe it is responsible to not definitively predict the fda clearance in our fy 22 outlook .<q>to address the question on alaris clearance timing , we remain confident in our submission and the process we are undertaking , including working closely with the fda .<q>this new software version is intended to remediate the issues identified in the february 4 , 2020 , recall notice and provide programming , operational and cybersecurity updates to affected devices .<q>2 following submission of the 510 ( k ) , which includes this software version .<q>next , i want to update you on our bd 2025 strategy of grow , simplify and empower .<q>chris will provide you further details on our financial outlook later in the call .<q>we now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share range to be $ 12.85 to $ 12.95 .<q>we continue to expect covid diagnostic testing revenues of $ 1.8 billion to $ 1.9 billion , with more revenues coming from international markets than we previously anticipated .<q>last week , we announced to our customers a positive step in our remediation efforts .<q>first , id like to focus on our growth pillar .<q>ive spoken about these three innovation and growth focuses before .<q>we also have an exciting wave of new product introductions this summer , with the launch of our facsymphony a5 se , which is our first bd spectral analyzer , and provides an even higher cellular parameter analysis .<q>early feedback has been outstanding , and were already seeing excellent traction and early adoption .<q>biosciences has been a strong performer this year , and we expect the unit to deliver high single - digit growth for the full year .
on the call today are signet 's ceo , gina drosos ; and chief financial and strategy officer joan hilson .<q>as a result , we believe will be less impacted by inflation than jewelry industry competitors or the retail sector overall .<q>our financial fitness and our strong supply chain relationships enable us to deliver great value to customers despite inflationary pressures while still protecting and growing margin .<q>at signet , we are prepared to make the most of this dynamic with excellent value , fresh assortments , industry - leading marketing and services , expert advice from our jewelry consultants in store and online , and a connected commerce presence that provides superior and seamless customer experiences .<q>that said , whether people have been waiting two years to travel or two years to get married , they are making the purchases that matter to them even at higher prices .<q>inflation puts pressure on discretionary purchases .<q>the biggest issue on people 's minds , of course , is the war in ukraine and , to a lesser extent , the inflationary pressures that may create in both the near and longer term on what we were -- on top of what we were already experiencing .<q>this reinforces that consumers are willing to pay more for both experiences and goods that they want and value .<q>to dig a little deeper , our supply chain is a significant source of competitive advantage .<q>more than 75 % of american consumers say they are ready to travel and a majority of those are already planning trips for june and july despite the inflated cost of these trips versus pre-pandemic levels .<q>we also see macro headwinds in the months ahead and believe we are well - positioned to mitigate them .<q>they also appeal to customers who want to participate in a circular economy .<q>rental pieces make it easy and affordable for every number of a bridal party to shine at showers , engagement dinners and at the magical i do moment .<q>one example is the rocksbox bridal subscription , which we 're testing now .<q>in addition , these celebrations drive future growth because dating couples who attend a wedding together are among the most likely to get engaged shortly afterward .<q>and wedding days give us the opportunity to provide jewelry for the bride and groom , bridesmaids , mother of the bride , and guests attending the wedding .
but first , i 'll review the safe harbor disclosure .<q>but we are still waiting on california to approve the blend all year around .<q>we are pleased that new york becomes the latest state to allow the sale of e15 , opening up the fourth - largest fuel market in the usa .<q>ethanol stock is down 11.6 % compared to the same week , last year .<q>that 's almost -- that 's now of almost 1.6 million barrels over just the last three weeks , according to a eia data release on november 27 , for the week ending in november 22nd .<q>the ethanol stock last week drew 237,000 barrels and the stock ended 22.277 million barrels .<q>if or when trade disputes are resolved , export of ethanol are expected to increase as more countries will begin to blend ethanol into their fuel supply because of their growing concern about air quality .<q>we expect ethanol export will drop to 1.5 billion gallon this year due to the continued trade uncertainty .<q>brazil , canada , and india were the top three importers .<q>as you all know , the ethanol industry did not receive any payments or subsidy from usda or any other federal agencies .<q>these petitions have doubled since the epa updated its online dashboard in september .<q>the epa has already received 10 petitions for small refinery exemption for -- from the 2019 renewable fuel standard compliance year .<q>last year , ethanol export were very healthy 1.7 billion gallon .<q>that 's a reduction of 6 % u.s. export of distiller grain in the september dropped approximately 72,000 metric tons to 1,046,000 metric tons , about 6.4 % reduction in august .<q>however , that was 2 % above the 1,020,000 metric tons exported in september 2018 .<q>mexico was the top buyer .
for today 's call , jeff will begin by covering a summary of our second quarter results and by providing a current status of our global operations .<q>medical revenues for the second quarter increased 14 % sequentially and were up 18 % year - over - year from continued new product ramps , strength throughout our medical customers and increasing demand for critical devices necessary to support the covid - 19 fight , including x -ray and ultrasound devices , ventilators and diagnostic equipment , which we estimate is approximately a third of our sequential growth .<q>total benchmark revenue was $ 491 million .<q>three , maintaining a healthy balance sheet and four , ensuring the financial flexibility to run our operations through uncertainty .<q>two , delivering for our customers .<q>as we manage through the covid crisis , our priorities remain centered on one , the health and safety of our employees .<q>let me start by echoing jeff 's sentiment on the incredible efforts of our teams to support our customers through a very dynamic environment .<q>i hope everyone and their families are staying healthy and safe .<q>over to you , roop .<q>and we stand ready to execute decontamination protocols beyond our normal safe work in cleaning procedures .<q>as the incident rate domestically increases , there could be temporary shutdowns of one of our facilities at any given time .<q>unfortunately this has not happened .<q>as shelter - in - place orders were lifted in the us , we had hoped the country could maintain the declining infection curve .<q>we are staggering shifts and other protocols in our mexican operations to keep our employees safe and optimize output .<q>our guadalajara facility has been essentially operating at 75 % productivity due to at - risk employees being required to stay home for the jalisco state government restrictions .<q>demand from our defense customers for security solutions , aircraft , munitions and satellites remained strong .
the discussion today also contains non-gaap financial measures .<q>the strong engagement , which is fueled by our ongoing investments in value propositions , marketing , and new digital services , is helping to drive the results i just spoke about in billings and loan growth , as well as customer retention and satisfaction levels .<q>additionally , our customer - focused innovation strategy , which has driven increases in customer engagement , has continued to attract large numbers of new customers .<q>new card acquisitions reached 2.7 million in q4 , driven by strong demand for our premium fee - based products , where we saw acquisitions nearly double year over year .<q>in consumer , millennials and gen z customers are driving the growth in acquisitions , representing around 60 % of the new accounts we acquired globally in 2021 .<q>in commercial , q4 closed out as one of the best years we 've ever seen for u.s. sme new account acquisition .<q>we are entering 2022 in a position of strength .<q>and based on the momentum with which we exited 2021 and the opportunities we see ahead , we feel very good about the future .<q>we believe that continuing our strategy of investing at high levels in our customers ' brand and talent as we implement our growth plan will position us well as we seek to achieve our growth aspirations in 2024 and beyond .<q>you see the growth momentum that steve just discussed in our summary financials on slide 2 , with fourth - quarter revenues of $ 12.1 billion , up 31 % , and full - year revenues of $ 42.4 billion , up 17 % , both on an fx - adjusted basis .<q>getting into a more detailed look at our results , let 's start with volumes .<q>you 'll notice in the several views of volumes on slides 3 through 9 that we continued to show 2021 volume trends on both a year - over - year basis and relative to 2019 .<q>there are a few key insights that i would highlight across these slides that strengthen our conviction in the investment strategy we have been focused on to deliver our new growth plan .<q>this growth in billed business , as shown on slides 4 and 5 , is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services , which strengthened sequentially and grew 24 % versus 2019 in q4 .<q>this momentum is from the strong growth in online and card - not - present spending that continued throughout 2021 , even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth , demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we 've seen during the pandemic .<q>our strategic focus on helping our small and medium - sized enterprise clients run their businesses by expanding the range of products and capabilities that meet their b2b payments and working capital needs is driving the strong sme spending trends you see on slide 7 .

dollargeneral.com under news & events .<q>gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.8 % in the first quarter .<q>as todd noted , this was an increase of 208 basis points and represents our eighth consecutive quarter of year - over - year gross margin rate expansion .<q>these factors were partially offset by increased transportation costs , which were primarily driven by higher rates .<q>moving down the income statement .<q>turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow , which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to continue investing for the long term while delivering significant returns to shareholders .<q>in anticipation of a more challenging supply environment , we strategically pulled forward certain inventory purchases during the quarter , particularly in select nonconsumable categories to better support the sales momentum we were seeing in the business .<q>and while out of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high - demand products , we continue to make good progress with improving our in - stock position and are pleased with the overall quality of our inventory .<q>total capital expenditures for the quarter were $ 278 million and included : our planned investments in new stores , remodels and relocations ; distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives .<q>at the end of q1 , the remaining share repurchase authorization was $ 1.7 billion .<q>our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged .<q>we also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments , all while maintaining our current investment - grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted - debt - to - ebitda .<q>moving to an update on our financial outlook for fiscal 2021 .<q>in short , i feel very good about the underlying business and we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead .<q>we also may reference certain financial measures that have not been derived in accordance with gaap .<q>as a testament to their efforts , our first quarter results exceeded our expectations , reflecting strong underlying performance across the business , which we believe was enhanced by the most recent round of government stimulus payments .
let 's begin on slide 3 .<q>all of asia was down 11 % organically driven principally by china , which was down 16 % organically .<q>the us , our largest market , posted a 1 % organic decline in the quarter , an improvement over the 4 % decline in q3 and progressively improving order rates and a strong quarter in biopharma , marking and coding , food retail , and can making among others .<q>the revenue breakdown by geography reflects sequential improvement in each major geographies except with the exception of asia .<q>we expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters .<q>this result in china was not unexpected , as we continue to face headwinds in retail fueling due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate .<q>on the top is the revenue bridge .<q>let 's go to slide 6 .<q>i 'll pass it to brad here .<q>this margin performance coupled with the upcoming ramp - up of automated case line in food retail positions us to deliver material margin expansion in 2021 .<q>moving to the bottom of the page .<q>i 'm on page 9 .<q>we have strong revenue visibility into q1 and confidence in our team 's ability to match industrial production with improved customer demand .<q>recall , last quarters -- last quarter 's earnings call , we decided to prioritize prudent working capital management over fixed course -- fixed cost absorption to close out the year , and you can see the value delivered in our year - over - year working capital comparison .<q>free cash flow conversion stands at 21 % of revenue for the 4th quarter , historically our highest cash flow quarter and 14 % for the full year , a significant increase over the prior year .<q>bookings were up 2 % organically , reflecting the continued momentum we see across our businesses .
listeners to any replay should understand that the passage of time by itself will diminish the quality of the statements made .<q>this quarter , we signed a lease with a new investment - grade grocer at our crofton centre in baltimore , which is replacing a shoppers food warehouse .<q>this will be a brand - new flagship prototype store , demonstrating publix ' commitment to the center and cementing the anchor tenancy for years to come .<q>in both cases , we locked in strong credit anchors , thereby enhancing the durability of the cash flows at these centers .<q>we also signed a new medical tenant , piedmont urgent care , that replaces a sit - down restaurant at promenade at pleasant hill just outside of atlanta , swapping a high - covid - risk tenant for an essential tenant at a mid-20 % spread to the old brand .<q>not only were we able to reduce tenant risk , but we were able to do so at attractive economics .<q>with only five to six ferguson showroom openings in a typical year , we think this deal is a testament to the strength of our center .<q>for those of you that are not familiar with ferguson , they are a $ 34 billion market cap , bbb + - rated credit and the largest u.s. distributor of plumbing and second - largest distributor of industrial products .<q>looking forward , our leasing team remains active with a solid pipeline of deals lined up for the fourth quarter .<q>we continue to drive rent and sign leases with high - credit essential tenancy .<q>notably , we are seeing strong demand in florida , boston and detroit , where we are in negotiations on a number of major box deals , ranging from grocer to off - price retail as well as several national small shop deals .<q>today , i 'll discuss our third quarter results , provide an update on our balance sheet and end with commentary on our increased guidance .<q>third quarter operating ffo per share of $ 0.27 was up $ 0.05 over last quarter primarily due to about $ 0.04 of higher noi from acquisitions , $ 0.01 from lower rent not probable of collection and about $ 0.01 from higher lease termination fees , partially offset by lower straight - line rent .<q>as we look ahead , we expect bad debt to continue to moderate as our collection rate tracks toward pre-covid levels .<q>as brian mentioned , our operational performance in the quarter remained strong .<q>we signed 52 leases totaling 280,000 square feet at a blended comparable releasing spread of 8.2 % , including a 5.2 % renewal and 16 % new lease spread .
our discussion today includes certain non-gaap financial measures , which provide additional information we believe is helpful to investors .<q>we expect 2021 to deliver low - double - digit organic growth as these markets remain healthy and as we launch new innovative products .<q>like last quarter , demand for our end - of - arm tooling solutions in automotive , and medical and pharma applications remain solid .<q>total sales growth was strong with both year - over - year and sequential growth of 20 % .<q>it continues to demonstrate signs of a positive rebound as mid-single - digit orders growth over a year ago and third quarter were achieved .<q>looking next at our automation business .<q>that said , we are very mindful about the current impact semiconductor shortages are having on automotive production and we will monitor that situation carefully as it unfolds .<q>speaking of new products , as i mentioned earlier , our investments in innovation and r&d are aimed at providing a solid foundation for organic growth .<q>with general industrial markets on the upswing and global automotive production forecasted to be up meaningfully in 2021 , we anticipate engineered components to grow high - single digits organically .<q>as an example , we recently launched our comprehensive vacuum solutions product line with complete gripping solutions , advanced control systems and high - quality components .<q>the vacuum product range consists of about 1,100 items , including high - performance suction cups , vacuum pumps , sensors and related accessories that allow our customers to handle different objects in various industrial sectors with low energy consumption and reduce downtime .<q>however , we do expect aftermarket activity to gradually improve beginning in the second half of 2021 .<q>only then will we see commercial flights return in earnest , likely led by domestic travel , while international flights are expected to take a little longer to resume .<q>recovery will require more widespread vaccine distribution , allowing people to feel more comfortable about flying , combined with the lifting of the various travel restrictions that currently exist .<q>with the award of the long - term agreement with ge aviation on the leap program , mentioned on last quarter 's call , we now forecast approximately $ 100,000 of sales per aircraft , up from our previous estimate of $ 50,000 .<q>the oem silver lining for the fourth quarter was book - to - bill of 1.6 times relative -- reflective of the strongest orders quarter since the third quarter of 2019 .
for today 's call , jeff will begin by covering a summary of our fourth quarter results and a summary of initiatives progress in 2020 .<q>we continue working on optimizing our global footprint , including completing previously announced closures in some locations and ramping up new capabilities in others .<q>we had announced in q3 of last year our intent to close our aerospace turbine machining facility given the lack of alignment with our long - term strategy and the downturn in the market .<q>ultimately , and fortunately , for our customers and employees , we were able to divest of these assets versus shutting down the site , and we transferred the majority of personnel and assets to the acquiring company .<q>in parallel , we have been working on the angleton site closure and executing the transition plans , which remains on target .<q>in addition , we maintained our focus on expense management .<q>through improved processes , g&a centralization activities and investment prioritization , we managed our sg&a expense to $ 122 million for the year , which was lower than forecasted .<q>as i shared previously , benchmark has a great partnership attitude , engages with integrity in all endeavors and a foundation centered on our customers .<q>we 've continued to invest in new , diverse skills and talent across our organization .<q>our ongoing commitment to advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at all levels in the company through our esg processes will make benchmark a more technically -- technologically rich and innovative organization .<q>i hope everyone and their families continue to be safe and healthy .<q>as expected , increased revenues from stronger demand and new programs in industrial , defense and semi-cap offset declines in medical .<q>medical revenues for the fourth quarter were down sequentially from continued lower demand for products involved in covid - 19 therapies , such as ventilators , x-rays and ultrasound devices and overall softer demand related to elective surgeries and trauma devices , which have yet to return to pre-covid demand levels .<q>our sg&a was $ 32.4 million , an increase of $ 2.7 million sequentially and $ 8.2 million year - over - year .<q>we estimate that we incurred approximately $ 1.6 million or approximately $ 0.04 per share of covid costs in the quarter versus $ 1.3 million in q3 .<q>during the quarter , gross margin was positively impacted by overall sector mix , improved absorption and a number of customer recoveries , which represented 30 basis points of the 90 basis point increase .
we will start today 's call with remarks from bill berry , continental 's chief executive officer ; john hart , chief financial officer and chief strategy officer ; and jack stark , president and chief operating officer .<q>this transaction includes a healthy amount of pdp , benefiting our ebitdax by approximately $ 900 million per year at current strip prices , enhancing our credit metrics .<q>i will discuss agency views momentarily .<q>it is beneficial to the ongoing trajectory of our credit rating .<q>let 's discuss a few of those items .<q>this transaction has a number of benefits to continental shareholders .<q>as bill mentioned , today 's acquisition is immediately financially accretive on cash flow and free cash flow per share , earnings per share , return on capital employed and cash margin .<q>the transaction has been unanimously approved by the company 's board of directors and is effective as of october 1 , with an expected closing date in the fourth quarter .<q>like our other assets , the fully integrated nature of this asset offers a multifaceted value proposition including minerals and water infrastructure that we control and provides tremendous optionality and upside in the future , as shown on slide four .<q>later on the call , jack will provide details regarding this expanded permian footprint , along with the tremendous success our teams have had growing our top - tier corporate portfolio of lower 48 assets .<q>this transaction increases continental 's operational footprint in the area with our current acreage position across the permian now approximately 140,000 net acres .<q>we are pleased with this progress as our objective is three investment - grade ratings .<q>moody's has upgraded us to baa3 and s and p has maintained a positive outlook to upgrade to ig .<q>as you may have noted , the rating agencies have been supportive of this transaction and our plans .<q>we plan to utilize 2022 cash flow to pay off the revolver funding , rebuild our cash position and pay off our ' 23 and ' 24 bond maturities at the earliest possible opportunity .<q>our target is to reduce net debt back to current levels or approximately $ 4 billion by year - end ' 22 .
during the call , we will discuss certain non-gaap financial measures such as total segment operating income , adjusted ebitda , total adjusted segment ebitda , adjusted earnings per diluted share , adjusted net income , adjusted ebitda margin , and free cash flow .<q>that was no way we were riding , that was us lifting us .<q>it was the result of our teams ' investments and incredible efforts that drove those results .<q>equally as powerful is to not just look at how similar we are in corp fin to where we were 10 years ago , but to look at how we 've changed since then , how we 've enhanced our positions .<q>but we were primarily a u.s. business at that point in time .<q>we did n't have a german business .<q>fast - forward today , in north america , we are still the no .<q>but this year , we 've already won three of the biggest company side jobs in north and south america .<q>4 in london , we 're now no .<q>we have the leading position in hong kong , a strengthened practice in australia .<q>and now , a leading practice in latin america with people on the ground in places like mexico and brazil .<q>there are waves in our business .<q>but what our teams have done is to take a fundamentally strong u.s. business , and rather than sit on it , they 've made it fundamentally stronger , turning us into a powerful , global , multidimensional player .<q>i wo n't be as long - winded on the other segments , but let me touch on them .<q>not because we were n't good , but because we -- we were focused on one part , an important part , but a small part of our clients ' core needs .<q>today , some parts of this business are also extraordinarily slow , but critically , other parts are soaring .
a full transcript and download will be posted after the call .<q>in the third quarter , we will begin rolling out a next generation local train reporting application to improve our visibility and customer service for the first and last mile .<q>we are also in the final months of deployment of our current phase of the mobile track authority application that facilitates more efficient coordination between engineering and dispatching functions for right of way maintenance activities .<q>we are at a very exciting time for our company and industry , in which we have ample opportunities to drive customer and shareholder value through both operational improvements and technology , a powerful formula .<q>earlier , i mentioned the role the mechanical team has played in our psr success so i thought it would be useful to explain their crucial role on slide 9 ; psr railroads norfolk southern included end up needing fewer locomotives .<q>what our mechanical department has done is to take that initial annie [ phonetic ] and use it strategically to call the worst performing units and to make our locomotive fleet more homogeneous .<q>those changes unlock repair productivity .<q>think about the benefits of repairing newer and fewer locomotives , which drove down the number of units out of service for repair .<q>that started a virtuous cycle of improved reliability with 175 % improvement in the days between unscheduled events to a shop versus pre-psr levels , meaning that when units do go into the shop our craftsman can spend more time on preventive maintenance instead of triaging issues .<q>this cycle repeats itself and ultimately supports the efficient movement of trains and serving our customers .<q>fewer , more reliable units also require fewer resources .<q>so , we need fewer servicing facilities and have fewer people maintaining locomotives .<q>this is just an example -- a big example of norfolk southern 's psr transformation .<q>these changes are purposely aligned with our overall fleet strategy including investments in our fewer but better units through our dc to ac conversion , energy management solutions and predictive analytic tools for maintenance planning and failure prevention .<q>you can see on slide 11 that we are approaching pre-pandemic revenue levels ; however , the composition of our business has changed dramatically due to the secular trends in the overall economy that were accelerated by the pandemic .<q>the progress we have delivered amid dynamic business conditions underscores the value we provide to the markets we serve .
