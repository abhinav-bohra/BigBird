and finally , we committed to reduce debt by more than $ 50 million last quarter .
taken together , this led to $ 12 million of net income from continuing operations or $ 0.40 per share , up over 3 times versus the same period last year .
our tax rate is expected to be about 25 % , and combined , this should drive net income and earnings per share up more than 60 % .
the initial results of this effort were evident in the first quarter as we grew our active lots by about 8 % to over 18,000 , and importantly , we control 42 % of our active lots through options at quarter end , a 7 point sequential increase .
we expect land spending to accelerate in the remaining quarters of 2021 , ultimately exceeding the $ 600 million we initially anticipated , funded by our cash from this liquidity and cash from operations .
to fund this ambition , last year we started a title insurance agency called charity title , that will donate 100 % of its profits to charity .
our tax expense for the quarter was about $ 4.1 million , for an effective tax rate of 25.5 % .
we think this cumulative deficit is conservatively well above 1 million homes , which means that a few good quarters are unlikely to exhaust the need for new homes .
total gaap interest expense was down about 3 % .
in numeric terms , it means all of our homes will achieve a home energy rating system or hers rating of 45 or less , which is an energy conservation standard that is far beyond most existing building and energy codes .
this improvement is largely driven by increased profitability , as we expect gross margin to be up at least 50 basis points versus the prior year in the second half of fiscal 2021 .
from a supply perspective , our industry has delivered far fewer homes in the last 10 years , than job growth and household formation would have predicted .
homebuilding revenue increased about 2 % to $ 424 million on flat closings .
sg&a was down approximately 60 basis points as a percentage of total revenue to 12.7 % driven by controlling overhead expenses .
our gross margin , excluding amortized interest , impairments and abandonments was 22.1 % , up approximately 230 basis points .
we expect to end fiscal 2021 with a book value per share in excess of $ 22 .
