we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of between 80 % to 90 % , as previously guided , putting our three - year average right around 130 % .
for your convenience , we are also providing the equivalent adjusted operating margin here , which we now expect to be in the range of 12 % to 12.5 % , up 120 to 170 basis points .
and we expect to continue delivering cash conversion of greater than 100 % going forward .
we closed the quarter with $ 1.7 billion in cash .
benefits from restructuring savings remain unchanged , and this yields an adjusted earnings per share range of $ 2.50 to $ 2.70 , an increase of 21 % to 31 % over last year .
emerging markets were up 8 % , and western europe grew 9 % from metrology project deployments and demand in the test business .
segment backlog is up 29 % .
for 2021 , we expect adjusted ebitda margin to be at 90 to 140 basis points to a range of 17.2 % to 17.7 % .
segment ebitda margin and operating margins in the quarter were up 770 and 600 basis points , respectively .
our balance sheet will remain very strong even after $ 600 million of senior notes are retired in the fourth quarter , which clearly offers considerable room for capital deployment .
residential and industrial grew 31 % and 15 % , respectively , while commercial grew 5 % .
geographically , emerging markets in western europe both grew double digits , while the u.s. was down 1 % .
those assumptions are unchanged from our original guidance , including our euro to dollar conversion rate of 1.22 .
but in short , utilities were up 3 % ; industrial was up 14 % ; commercial , up 5 % ; and residential was up 31 % .
revenue grew 8 % organically versus the same period last year with performance better than our expectations across the board .
demand also continued to recover with orders up 18 % .
