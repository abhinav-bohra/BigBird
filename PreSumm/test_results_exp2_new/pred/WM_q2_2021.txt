with this increase , we expect our weighted average share count for the full year to be approximately 422 million shares .
at the same time , our robust cash generation in the first half of the year positions us to increase our full year share repurchase expectation up to our full $ 1.35 billion authorization .
while the bridge from our initial guidance to the current guidance has a number of puts and takes , the most significant drivers have accelerated price and volume recoveries in the collection and disposal business of about $ 135 million ; improved recycling profitability of another $ 135 million ; renewable energy increases of about $ 55 million ; and additional ads synergies of around $ 25 million .
these increases are partially offset by elevated cost inflation and incentive compensation costs that we currently estimate to be about $ 125 million .
the increase in adjusted operating ebitda guidance is expected to translate directly into incremental free cash flow , and we now expect that we will generate between $ 2.5 billion and $ 2.6 billion of free cash flow for the year .
we are now connecting our advanced technologies to automatically insert 90 % of our new commercial customers into existing routes , reducing our cost to serve and improving our speed to service .
next month , we 're hosting a supplier diversity initiative called share the green , which will give women - owned businesses the opportunity to become a supplier for one or more of the 45 companies participating in the event .
to date , we 've combined around 45 % of the ads operations into our billing and operational systems , which has allowed us to capture synergies and provide additional services to those customers .
at our automated facilities , labor costs were 35 % lower in the second quarter compared to our other single - stream mrfs .
second - quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 10 basis points to 61.1 % , demonstrating that we are continuing to manage our cost as volumes recover even in the face of inflationary cost pressures .
churn was 8.8 % in the quarter , and service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold .
this focus is particularly evident in our residential core price of 5.4 % , landfill core price of 4.7 % and transfer core price of 3.4 % .
we continue to target full - year capital spending within our $ 1.78 billion to $ 1.88 billion guidance range .
