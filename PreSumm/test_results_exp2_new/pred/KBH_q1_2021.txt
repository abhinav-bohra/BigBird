homebuilding operating income for the first quarter increased 90 % to $ 114.1 million from $ 60.2 million for the year - earlier quarter .
assuming no inventory related charges , we are forecasting a housing gross profit margin for the 2021 second quarter in a range of 20.5 % to 21.1 % .
the 9,200 homes we have in backlog together with our first - quarter deliveries represent about 85 % of the deliveries that were implied in our full year outlook we provided in january .
we believe we are well positioned to achieve this top line performance supported by our first quarter ending backlog value of approximately $ 3.7 billion and our expectation of continued strong housing market conditions .
we lead the industry in building energy star certified new homes having delivered more than 150,000 of these homes to date as well as over 11,000 solar - powered homes .
we grew our lot position by approximately 3,000 lots since year - end to nearly 70,000 lots owned and controlled and maintained our option lots at 40 % of our total .
we believe our overall average selling price for the full year will be in the range of $ 405,000 to $ 415,000 , a relatively modest year - over - year increase and a result of our focus on offering affordable product across our footprint .
this division has increased its annual deliveries by almost 50 % in the last three years and has achieved the number one ranking in the market .
however , the median square footage of our homes in backlog is almost 2,100 square feet which is consistent with the median footage of homes we delivered in 2020 .
most notably , demographic trends are favorable especially with respect to first - time buyers as over 70 million millennials are in their prime homebuying years with an even larger gen z cohort right behind them now entering their homebuying age .
texas is our largest market by units and the severe weather shut down our operations for roughly 10 days in mid-february .
consistent with our forecast , we ended the quarter with 209 communities , down 16 % from a year ago .
we are positioned for remarkable 2021 and achieving our objectives of expanding our scale and improving our profitability while driving a meaningfully higher return on equity which we now anticipate will be above 18 % .
