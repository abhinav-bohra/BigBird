to close out our year - to - date performance , we also benefited from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $ 0.07 per share and another $ 0.02 per share of upside , largely driven by recovering commercial and industrial load .
longer term , we are committed to growing our adjusted earnings per share toward the high end of our 6 % to 8 % growth range as we highlighted on our q2 call .
for the third quarter , we delivered adjusted net income of $ 156 million or $ 0.54 per share .
our prices remain competitive as the average residential customer pays about $ 2 a day to heat their home and $ 4 a day to keep the lights on .
for the first nine months of the year , rate relief continues to be the primary driver of our positive year - over - year variance to the tune of $ 0.45 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses .
in fact , as we approach the winter heating season , our 90 - day arrears are back to prepandemic levels with an 80 % reduction in our uncollectible accounts .
we also remarketed $ 35 million of tax - exempt revenue bonds earlier this month at a rate of under 1 % through 2026 .
as we double down on the clean energy transformation , i 'm also pleased to share that we received approval for our voluntary green pricing program , which would add an additional 1,000 megawatts of owned renewable generation to our growing renewable portfolio .
due to the strong execution implied by these record - setting issuances coupled with the enerbank sale , which provided approximately $ 60 million of upside relative to the sale price announced at signing , we now have the flexibility to reduce our equity needs for the year even further , which will now be limited to the $ 57 million of equity forwards we have already contracted .
during the storm , we had more than 3,700 members of our team working around the clock to safely restore customers .
most of the gas is already locked in at just under $ 3 per thousand cubic feet , which is well below current levels in the spot market and offers tremendous customer value .
