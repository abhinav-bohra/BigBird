new insurance written in enact was 26.7 billion in the quarter , up 7 % versus the prior quarter , driven primarily by a larger purchase origination market and down 6 % versus the prior year , primarily driven by lower estimated market share .
one , reduce our holding company debt to approximately 1 billion .
to further accelerate our efforts to reduce debt , and improve it , enact and genworth credit ratings , we remain focused on partially monetizing our ownership of enact through a minority ipo of up to 19.9 % .
ceded premiums were up 2 million this quarter to 18 million versus 16 million last quarter and reflect the expansion of our credit risk transfer program .
as of the second quarter , the pre-tax balance of this reserve was 957 million , up from 625 million as of year - end 2020 .
having achieved 15.5 billion against the current target of 22.5 billion means we are approximately two - thirds of the way toward achieving breakeven .
we ended the quarter with more than 842 million in holding company cash .
as of june 30 , 2021 , approximately 59 % of genworth 's ltc policyholders have accepted all premium increases in full , 27 % have taken a reduced benefit option and 14 % have opted for a non-forfeiture option .
new delinquencies of approximately 7,000 during the quarter were down 30 % sequentially with 45 % reported in new forbearance plants .
additionally , we released 4 million of ibnr reserves related to june delinquencies that have not yet been reported by services to us and which we expect will be lower than had been assumed in our prior ibnr reserves .
our new delinquency rate or new delinquencies over policies in force , was 0.7 % , which reflects a return to pre-pandemic levels .
this increases our confidence in enact , issuing a 200 million dividend in the fourth quarter .
in total , approximately 64 % of our total delinquencies are in forbearance plans .
after reaching our 1 billion debt target and realizing the resumption of dividends from enact to the parent company , we expect to generate reliable and sustainable future cash flows that will enable genworth to consider returning cash to shareholders through a regular dividend and through share repurchases .
with these key initiatives underway , we have begun to focus our growth strategy on the future of ltc insurance and we are advancing our plans through a new insurance company to create a leading profitable ltc insurance business in the u.s as i said before , there is a great need for long - term care solutions in the u.s. with 54 million americans , aged 65 and older , at the end of 2019 , and with that number expected to increase to 95 million by 2060 , while at the same time , care costs are rising rapidly .
to remind investors , we had previously established a reserve of 158 million for mortality experience during the pandemic to reflect our view that the remaining claim population is less likely to terminate than the pre-pandemic average due to the pandemic impacting our most vulnerable claimants .
