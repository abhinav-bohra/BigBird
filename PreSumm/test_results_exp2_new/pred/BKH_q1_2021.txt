in the first quarter , we booked storm - related net expenses of $ 12.55 million pre-tax or $ 0.15 per share after tax .
in february , we entered into an $ 800 million , nine - month term loan to bolster our liquidity in light of the increased fuel costs related to storm uri .
we repaid $ 200 million of that term loan at quarter - end and are developing the appropriate refinancing strategy for the remaining $ 600 million as we finalized storm uri recovery mechanisms .
for our electric businesses , the impact to our wholesale power margin sharing of $ 3.2 million was partially offset by $ 1.7 million of power generation benefits .

as an example , lincoln , nebraska reported 11 straight days of temperatures below zero in february with lows of the minus 20s .
this includes $ 559 million of deferred utility fuel costs we booked as a regulatory asset .
the storm highlighted the need for safe , reliable natural gas utilities and reliable generation capacity when our customers experienced temperatures as low as 27 degrees below zero , setting numerous all - time record lows across our communities .

in 2020 , we proudly marked 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases , one of the longest track records in our industry .
