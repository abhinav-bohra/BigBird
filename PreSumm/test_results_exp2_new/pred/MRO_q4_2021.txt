we expect our 2022 program to deliver over $ 3 billion of free cash flow at a reinvestment rate of less than 30 % , assuming $ 80 wti and $ 4 henry hub .
we started 2021 with the top priority of balance sheet improvement , accelerating $ 1.4 billion of gross debt reduction during the first three quarters of the year .
in addition , the gas capture of 99 % or better .
as dane just mentioned , by staying disciplined and maintaining a low reinvestment rate , we expect to exceed our minimum return of capital commitment of 40 % of cash flow from operations .
we will continue our investment in reducing our ghg intensity targeting a 40 % reduction relative to our 2019 baseline .
at basin level , consistent with prior indications around our capital allocation mix , we will be spending approximately 75 % for capital budget in the eagle ford and bakken with the balance going to the permian and oklahoma .
my second key point today is that we are successfully executing on our mandate to deliver financial outcomes that are not only superior to our e&p peer group , but are superior to the broader s&p 500 as well .
our current outstanding buyback authorization is $ 1.7 billion , and we continue to believe that buying back our stock in a disciplined manner is a good use of our capital .
in total , we have now executed $ 1 billion of share repurchases since october , driving an 8 % reduction to our outstanding share count in just four and a half months .
during the fourth quarter , we returned over 70 % of our cash from operations or more than $ 800 million to our equity investors , significantly exceeding our minimum 40 % commitment .
importantly , our 2030 ghg and methane intensity objectives represent industry - leading improvement and will contribute to absolute performance that is competitive with the very best oil and gas producers globally .
for any given quarter , it is reasonable to expect a plus or minus 5 % variance around the midpoint of our full year production guidance .
while our five - year benchmark scenario is based on a well - by - well execution - level model , our longer - term portfolio modeling extends the maintenance scenario out 10 years and shows that we can deliver the same peer - leading financial outcomes for at least a decade .
