continuing with the theme of good fundamentals on slide number 6 , our perceived old world chemistry has new world application and value .
this is a company that is focused on continuing to grow adjusted ebitda and coupling that with balanced capital management to deliver more than $ 10 of earnings per share in the near future .
slide number 5 has an illustration .
even though we have grown our earnings for five consecutive quarters and delivered a levered free cash flow that is approaching 20 % , we still must show that our performance will continue to improve , but maybe more importantly , we must demonstrate our ability to manage uncertainty and volatility .
i wo n't read all of these mega trend multipliers , as i 'm sure they 're familiar to you , but instead jump to slide number 7 and hit on the differentiated growth profile of epoxy .
we expect it wo n't be long before our epoxy business delivers greater than $ 1 billion of ebitda and carries the same enterprise value that all of olin carries today , more representative of a highly engineered materials company .
