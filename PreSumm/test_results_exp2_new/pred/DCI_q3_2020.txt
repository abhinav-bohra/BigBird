out of an abundance of caution , we drew an additional $ 100 million from our revolving credit facility during third quarter .
at the end of the third quarter , our leverage ratio was 1.0 times net debt to ebitda , which is where we were at the end of the second quarter and right in line with our long - term target .
despite a sales decline of 12 % , our third quarter ebitda margin was flat with the prior year .
third quarter capex declined by more than 40 % and the spend trajectory is consistent with what we communicated previously .
engine segment sales were down 14 % , reflecting a sharp decline in our first - fit businesses .
third quarter sales of off - road products were down 25 % , with more than half the decline coming from exhaust and emissions .
the total aftermarket decline of 8 % was primarily due to a low double - digit decline in sales through the independent channel .
this r&d facility is a $ 15 million investment in building our material science capabilities .
we had favorability from incentive compensation , which was down nearly $ 6 million and discretionary expenses were significantly reduced in relation to covid - 19 .
we are committed to the quarterly dividend , which has been paid every year for more than 60 years and increased annually for 24 years in a row .
total sales for the month are expected to be down about 24 % from last year .
we repurchased 1.6 % of outstanding shares so far this year .
our dust collection business , which makes up 60 % of ifs , was hit hard by the pandemic .
