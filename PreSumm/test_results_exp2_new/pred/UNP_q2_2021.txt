fertilizer carloads were up 2 % year - over - year and 23 % from the first quarter , due to strong agricultural demand and seasonality of fertilizer applications .
for second quarter 2021 , the combination of operating revenue up 30 % and operating expense only up 17 % , illustrates our efficient handling of volume growth to produce record quarterly operating income of $ 2.5 billion .
for perspective , seven day car loadings in the second quarter of 2019 were almost 166,000 , versus only 133,000 in 2020 , and then rebounding this year to 163,000 .
turning now to premium , revenue for the quarter was up 50 % on a 31 % increase in volume .
setting aside the impact of one - time items and fuel , up 's core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 800 basis points , and added $ 1.04 to earnings per share .
workforce productivity was an all - time quarterly record , driven by an increase in daily car miles of more than 20 % , while workforce levels remained flat .
looking at the individual lines , compensation and benefits expenses up 13 % versus 2020 .
however , we still have work to do to return to running a more fluid network , with the goal to return this metric back to the 220 to 230 miles per day range , we achieved earlier this year .
with volumes up 22 % in the quarter , our benchmark of success is growing expenses at a slower rate .
partially offsetting that good news in 2021 is a real estate gain of $ 0.08 recorded in last year second quarter .
average revenue per car increased by 14 % from higher fuel surcharge revenue , positive mix of traffic and core pricing gains .
business mix was actually negative sequentially , more than offsetting positive pricing gains and creating a 100 basis point headwind .
through growing train size , other productivity initiatives and technology , our fuel consumption rate was a second quarter record , improving 3 % compared to last year .
looking at operating ratio , we 're dropping the low end of our initial range and now expect to achieve roughly 200 basis points of improvement , or an operating ratio closer to 56.5 % for full year 2021 .
from a volume standpoint , we are increasing our growth outlook for the full year to around 7 % , which includes just over a one point headwind from ongoing energy market challenges .
sequentially , fuel surcharge increased freight revenue 275 basis points .
