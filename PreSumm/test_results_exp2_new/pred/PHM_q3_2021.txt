our third quarter pre-tax income was $ 49 million versus $ 64 million last year .
in the third quarter , we operated from an average of 768 communities .
consistent with the guide in our recent market update , this is down 14 % from last year 's average of 892 communities .
although more than half of our quarter end backlog is expected to deliver in 2022 , we will continue to see the benefit of rising prices in our fourth quarter as our average closing price is expected to be $ 485,000 to $ 490,000 .
our $ 2.9 billion of land spend is comparable to what we invested for the full year in both 2020 and in the pre-pandemic year of 2019 , and we remain fully on track to invest approximately $ 4 billion in total for the full year of 2021 .
prior year sg&a expense for the period was $ 271 million for a comparable 9.6 % home sale revenues .
in the comparable prior year period , our effective rate was 14 % as we realized a tax benefit of $ 53 million associated with energy tax credits recognized in the period .
in contrast , our orders from move - up and active adult buyers decreased 22 % and 4 % , respectively , which was driven by comparable 22 % and 5 % decreases in community count , respectively .
reflective of these conditions , our average price in backlog increased 18 % or $ 78,000 over last year to $ 519,000 .
this is an increase of 36 % over the prior year 's third quarter adjusted earnings of $ 1.34 per share .
consistent with our capital allocation priorities , along with investing $ 948 million more in land acquisition and development through the first 9 months of 2021 compared with last year , we have also returned $ 726 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and have paid off nearly $ 800 million in debt this year , leaving us with a net debt - to - capital ratio of only 5.7 % .
our business continues to generate strong cash flow , which allowed us to end the quarter with $ 1.6 billion of cash after significant investment in the business and continued shareholder distributions in the quarter .
the $ 261 million in stock repurchase is a sequential increase of $ 61 million from the second quarter of this year .
for others , it 's changing lead times where order fulfillment has gone from 6 weeks to 16 weeks , back to 11 weeks and then back to 16 weeks .
given that 90 % of our specs are early in the construction cycle and we have only 109 finished specs , these units are about helping to position the company for 2022 , rather than providing closings in 2021 .
on the other hand , our results have certainly benefited from the remarkable demand and pricing environment the homebuilding industry has experienced over the past 18 months .
