during the first quarter , we invested $ 32 million in loews hotels .
for a good snapshot of this operational improvement , i would encourage you to review page 11 of our quarterly earnings supplement , which shows the increase in available rooms , occupancy and average daily rate since q2 last year .
the low point for profitability was last year 's second quarter when loews hotels posted an adjusted ebitda loss of $ 54 million .
the remainder of the corporate sector generated a $ 75 million pre-tax and $ 106 million after - tax loss in the quarter .
as an historical footnote , the company 's expense ratio in , say , 2017 , was over 34 % , so you can see how far cna has come in a few short years .
we currently expect , absent any divestitures or development projects , to make a net cash contribution to loews hotels of less than $ 80 million in 2021 , down materially from our earlier estimates , given better - than - anticipated cash flow .
the parent company portfolio of cash and investments stood at $ 3.6 billion at quarter - end , with about 80 % in cash and equivalents .
the average daily room rate of our owned and jv hotels that are open increased by 25 % to $ 234 .
we also received , as jim mentioned , $ 199 million dividend from altium pursuant to its recapitalization .
as a reminder , we purchased the company for a total enterprise value of $ 1.2 billion in 2017 and have not invested any additional capital in altium since the acquisition .
one , altium undertook a recapitalization during the quarter , refinancing its existing term loans with a single $ 1.05 billion term loan ; the company booked a $ 14 million pre-tax debt extinguishment charge in connection with the recap .
cna contributed net income of $ 279 million , up dramatically from a $ 55 million net loss in q1 2020 .
in the second quarter , upon deconsolidation , we will book a net pre-tax gain of approximately $ 560 million , which reflects both the net realized gain on the stake sold to gic and the unrealized gain on our retained 53 % stake .
loews hotels has an ownership interest in nearly 15,000 rooms , approximately 11,000 of which are located in resort destinations .
i would note that prior - year development was comparable this year and last , with less than 1 point of favorable development in both periods .
cna 's investment portfolio ended the quarter with $ 4.3 billion in unrealized gains , down from a high of $ 5.7 million last quarter , primarily due to higher interest rates .
