the plan includes approximately $ 180 million for the installation of 21 new or replacement lifts across 14 of our resorts and a transformational lift served terrain expansion at keystone .
as previously announced on september 23 , 2021 , we are excited to be proceeding with our ambitious capital investment plan for calendar year 2022 of approximately $ 315 million to $ 325 million across our resorts , excluding one - time investments related to integration activities , employee housing development projects and real estate - related projects .
all of the projects in the plan are subject to regulatory approvals and expected to be completed in time for the 2022/2023 north american winter season .
at some resorts , more than 10 % of our employees were unable to work due to covid - 19 at one time .
the increase in wages and the return to normal staffing levels will represent an approximately $ 175 million increase in expected labor expense in fiscal 2023 compared to the fiscal 2022 expected labor expense , including inflationary adjustments .
in addition to the two brand - new lift configurations at vail and keystone , the replacement lift will collectively increase lift capacity at those lift locations by more than 45 % .
we estimate resort ebitda margin for fiscal 2022 to be approximately 32.9 % using the midpoint of the guidance range .
destination and international visitation trends at whistler blackcomb , the $ 20 million investment in frontline staff bonuses , increased wages for our summer operations , and the inclusion of an estimated $ 6 million in acquisition and integration - related expenses specific to the seven springs resorts .
tipped employees will be guaranteed a minimum of $ 20 per hour .
the guidance assumes an exchange rate of $ 0.79 between the canadian dollar and u.s. dollar related to the operations of whistler blackcomb in canada and an exchange rate of $ 0.72 between the australian dollar and u.s. dollar related to the operations of perisher , falls creek , and hotham in australia .
despite significant growth of our pass program this year , visitation for the season - to - date period was modestly up 2.8 % compared to fiscal 2020 , given the company 's strategy to shift lift ticket guests into an advance commitment pass product .
net income attributable to vail resorts was $ 223.4 million or $ 5.47 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 , compared to net income attributable to vail resorts of $ 147.8 million or $ 3.62 per diluted share in the prior year .
our total cash and revolver availability as of january 31 , 2022 , was approximately $ 2 billion , with $ 1.4 billion of cash on hand , $ 417 million of u.s. revolver availability under the vail holdings credit agreement , and $ 214 million of revolver availability under the whistler credit agreement .
the 2021/2022 north american ski season got off to a slow start .
as we turn our attention to the 2022/2023 ski season and beyond , the company will be making its largest ever investment in both its employees and its resorts to ensure we continue to deliver our company mission of an experience of a lifetime .
we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend on vail resorts common stock of $ 1.91 per share .
