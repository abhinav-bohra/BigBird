benefiting our free cash position , in january , we raised $ 417 million of net debt , and we had a $ 181 million timing benefit , largely associated with deferred revenue classification .
ticket sales in the first quarter were $ 200 million , but this was offset largely by a shift of deferred revenue from short term to long term for shows that were rescheduled into 2022 .
kathy willard , our cfo for the past 15 years , will be retiring as of june 30 .
in the u.s. , over 40 % of the population have received at least one vaccine dose , and most states are now fully or partially reopening with more restrictions being lifted daily .
our aoi loss for the quarter was $ 152 million , which consisted of $ 323 million in operational fixed costs and $ 171 million of contribution margin , which included $ 149 million from operations , along with various onetime items , including insurance recoveries .
while we expect the second quarter to be our first year - on - year improvement since q4 of 2019 and to also be generating positive aoi through the second half of the year , we still plan on reducing costs this year by $ 750 million and reducing cash spend by $ 1.5 billion relative to prepandemic plans .
on our festivals where fans were able to retain their tickets for the next scheduled event , 65 % of fans are doing so .
in the u.k. , we have 11 festivals planned this summer , including our largest ones , reading , leeds and parklife , where tickets are already sold out .
the global refund rate for live nation concerts that are rescheduled and are in or have gone through a refund window or windows was unchanged from the prior quarter at 17 % through the end of q1 .
and in q1 , we had $ 59 million average cash contribution margin per month , roughly 50 % higher cm than we averaged in q4 .
