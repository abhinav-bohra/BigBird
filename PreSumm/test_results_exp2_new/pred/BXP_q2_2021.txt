there are 7 buildings in total 3 of which are vacant and will be converted to lab immediately .
we have 920,000 square feet of lab redevelopment and development projects currently underway that are experiencing strong user demand and expected to deliver in the next 36 months .
today , life sciences at bxp is 3 million square feet , representing 6.4 % of our total revenue .
consideration for the purchase will be the assumption of a $ 202 million mortgage on the property and the issuance of $ 98 million of op units and bxp 's operating partnership .
the impacts on space needs are going to really vary depending upon the size of organizations which we would like to put in 3 categories .
bxp will own either 51 % or 33.3 % of the property , depending on whether one or two private equity investors join the partnership .
this was an off - market transaction completed at a price of $ 100 million or $ 650 a square foot , and a 6.4 % initial cap rate .
with generous ceiling heights and a unique elevator configuration allowing for 2 separate dedicated lobbies , we believe the building will appeal to both large and medium sized users seeking marketing and brand expression opportunities with their space .
bxp has a strong growth ramp driven by improving economic conditions and leasing activity , the recovery of our variable revenue streams , delivery of a well - leased development pipeline , completion now of 4 new acquisitions , a strong balance sheet and capital allocated from large scale private equity partners to pursue new investment opportunities as the pandemic recedes , a rapidly expanding life science portfolio in the nation 's hottest life science markets as well as low interest rates and decreasing capital costs .
and honestly , they are moving forward with plans for space , based on long - term growth plans hiring that 's occurred over the last 16 months , and thousands of open job requirements that they are trying to fill right now .

and lastly , in the second quarter , we completed another life science acquisition 153 and 211 second avenue in waltham , massachusetts .
within 5 years , assuming continued strong market conditions , we could more than double the amount of bxp 's revenue that is generated from the life science sector .
our ffo per share this quarter was $ 0.10 above market consensus and $ 0.12 above our own forecast , which mike will detail shortly .
the entire site is 31 acres and can accommodate additional ground - up development depending on demand .
our sequential parking income grew about 20 % from the first quarter and while we 've not seen monthly parking permits pick up tenants are driving in and paying for daily parking , we actually think that monthly parking permits will be a good indicator for the increase of office frequency in boston and san francisco .
