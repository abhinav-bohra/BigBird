combined with our annuity account values , we now manage $ 12.7 billion of assets for our clients .
return on equity improved 90 basis points in the 12 months ending june 30 , 2021 compared to the prior year period .
turning to the financial highlights on slide 9 : operating earnings per share were up 20 % year - over - year and up 60 % excluding significant items .
life sales generated by our exclusive field agents were up 23 % and comprised over 40 % of our total life sales .
over the last 4 quarters , we have deployed $ 337 million of excess capital on share repurchases reducing weighted average shares outstanding by 7 % .
our securities licensed registered agent force was up 6 % .
turning to slide 13 : we continue to generate strong free cash flow to the holding company in the sector with excess cash flow , $ 114 million or 128 % of operating income for the quarter and $ 432 million or 119 % of operating income on a trailing 12 month basis .
overall health sales were up almost 90 % over the prior period which reflected the first full quarter of the pandemic when state home restrictions were first instituted .
regarding our annuity margin , recall that in the second quarter of 2020 , we saw a favorable mortality in our other annuities block unrelated to covid , which translated to $ 10 million of positive impacts .
the number of new annuity accounts grew 16 % and the average annuity policy size rose 14 % .
even after returning $ 105 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter , our excess capital grew by approximately $ 22 million from march 31 to june 30 of this year .
total collected life and health premiums were up 1 % .
recall that we report our alternative investments on a 1/4 lag .
in general , we expect alternative investments to revert to a mean annualized return of between 7 % and 8 % at some point and over the long term , but the actual results will certainly be more variable with likely more upside potential than downside in the near term given the current economic outlook .
we expect to file our form 10 - q and post it on our website on or before august 6 .
we also raised our dividend 8 % in may and 9 consecutive annual increase .
