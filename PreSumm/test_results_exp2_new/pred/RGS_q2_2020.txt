consistent with the total company consolidated results , the year - over - year variance was driven primarily by the elimination of the adjusted ebitda that had been generated in the prior year period from the company - owned salons that were sold and converted into the franchise platform over the past 12 months .
the remaining lease liability associated with the tbg salons is approximately $ 30 million and regis will operate the salons until lease end date or until a new franchise owner is identified .
at the end of december , tbg transferred back to regis 207 of its north american mall - based salons , a roughly 10 % of the company 's portfolio .
by eliminating approximately 290 positions , including 15 contractors across the u.s. and canada , which is expected to result in approximately $ 19 million of annualized g&a savings as the company accelerates into its multiyear transformation .
excluding discrete items and the income from discontinued operations the company reported decreased second quarter 2020 adjusted net income of $ 4.6 million or $ 0.13 earnings per diluted share as compared to adjusted net income of $ 8 million or $ 0.18 earnings per diluted share for the same period last year .
as of december 31 , nearly 70 % of our portfolio is now franchised .
this means that net of closing roughly 350 to 500 underperforming salons , which typically occurs at lease expiration .
the headwinds in the quarter were partially offset by a $ 5.8 million increase in franchise revenues and $ 33.6 million of rent revenue recorded in connection with the new lease accounting guidance adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 .
further , we believe it is the right time to redesign our capital structure so that our debt facility is better suited for a company that is now 70 % franchised .
we are pleased to report this quarter that we continue to make meaningful progress in our ongoing strategic transformation to capital light high growth franchise company in august 2019 we estimated that it would take us 18 to 24 months to complete our conversion to a fully franchise portfolio .
