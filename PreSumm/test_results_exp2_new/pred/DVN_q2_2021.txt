in the second quarter , we retired $ 710 million of debt , bringing our total debt retired year - to - date to over $ 1.2 billion .
this dividend represents a 44 % increase versus last quarter and is more than a fourfold increase compared to the period a year ago .
this is evidenced by the announcement last night that our dividend payable on september 30 was raised for the third consecutive quarter to $ 0.49 per share .
our low leverage is also complemented by a liquidity position of $ 4.5 billion and a debt profile with no near - term maturities .
to deliver on this positive rate of change , the team achieved record - setting drill times in both bone spring and wolfcamp formations with spud to release times and our best wells improving to less than 12 days .
our completions work improved to an average of nearly 2,000 feet per day in the quarter .
after funding the fixed dividend , up to 50 % of the excess free cash flow in any given quarter will be allocated to our variable dividend .
this is resulting in a dividend yield that 's the highest in the entire s&p 500 index .
with this differentiated framework , we 've returned more than $ 400 million of cash to our shareholders in the first half of the year , which exceeds the entire payout from all of last year .
as a result of this investment , delaware basin 's high - margin oil production continue to rapidly advance , growing 22 % on a year - over - year basis .
during the quarter , our capital program consisted of 13 operated rigs and four dedicated frac crews , resulting in 88 new wells that commenced first production .
the initial 30 - day rates from activity at stateline and cotton draw average north of 3,300 boe per day and recoveries are on track to exceed 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent .
efficiencies drove capital spending 9 % below guidance .
with drilling and completion costs coming in at nearly $ 1 million below predrill expectations , our rates of return at cotton draw and stateline are projected to approach 200 % at today 's strip pricing .
investors need to take notice , devon offers a truly unique investment opportunity for the near 0 interest rate world that we live in today .
to put it in perspective , this incremental cash flow would represent cash flow per share growth of more than 20 % year over year , if you held all other constants -- all other factors constant .
