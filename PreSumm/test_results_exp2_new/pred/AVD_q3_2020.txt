the core business plus new product pipeline acquisitions puts us at a three - year top line target of $ 604 million and a five - year target of $ 736 million .
we expect that with the addition of agrinos , the growth of our other biologicals and the expansion of envance / tyratech we should see incremental revenues in year three of $ 48 million and in year five of $ 118 million .
if out of conservatism , we cut that number in half to $ 20 million per year and extrapolate it forward , we find that our incremental acquisition growth that put us at $ 60 million by year three and $ 100 million by year five .
through the end of the third quarter of 2020 , we had already been on track to sell approximately $ 22 million in green products this year , including biologicals , bio-nutritional products through both our domestic and international businesses and essential oil products through envance which are the active ingredients in procter & gamble 's zevo line of consumer products .
in the first nine months of 2020 we have generated $ 19 million from operations as compared to using $ 21 million in the first nine months of 2019 .
in our us crop market , sales were affected by reduced cotton acres , which according to usda statistics , are down about 11 % or 1.5 million acres in 2020 .
in previous conference calls , we expected to end in the region of $ 145 million .
as a result of these various dynamics , gross margin performance in the quarter reduced from 38 % to 37 % and for the nine - month period from 39 % to 38 % .
generally speaking , over the long term our net factory costs amount to about 2.5 % of net sales , reflecting some latent capacity in our plants should the need arise .
within that overall decline , our us sales were down about $ 7.5 million and our international sales were flat .
the underlying period - over - period improvement in our base inventory before the impact of recent acquisitions amounted to approximately $ 14 million or 7.5 % .
in addition , the new acquisitions that eric will mention in a moment are expected to add approximately $ 15 million at december 31st , 2020 .
during the last year , in addition to paying down $ 16 million in debt , we have funded more than $ 27 million in investments , including fixed assets , product acquisitions and technology investments from the cash generated from operations .
using 2019 numbers as a reference , let 's build a model using a baseline of annual sales of $ 468 million .
the reported reduction actually understates the real improvement because in 2019 we benefited from adjustments to earn out liabilities related to past acquisitions in the amount of $ 3.5 million that did not recur this year .
