of note , we have realized a significant decrease in per unit g&a expense , dropping roughly 25 % over the past year , driven by our acquisition and ongoing development in appalachia .
with respect to consolidated capital spending , all of our segment ranges remain the same and we are still projecting between $ 720 million and $ 830 million for the fiscal year .
national fuel 's second quarter gaap earnings were $ 1.23 per share .
for our non-regulated businesses , we now expect seneca 's full year loe to range between $ 0.82 and $ 0.84 per mcfe , a $ 0.01 lower at the midpoint of our revised guidance range .
so all in , about 95 % of our forecasted gas production is already sold .
we expect our annual capital levels in california will be in the $ 10 million to $ 20 million range over the next few years absent further increases in the longer - term oil strip .
once complete , this project will generate about $ 50 million of annual revenue for us .
when you back out items impacting comparability , principally related to the premium paid for the early redemption of our $ 500 million december ' 21 maturity , our operating results were $ 1.34 per share , a significant increase over last year .
this timing will allow seneca to capture the premium winter pricing typically seen in the transco zone 6 market .
as we look to the back half of the year and beyond , we would expect that dd&a trends closer to the low $ 0.60 per mcfe area .
on the gathering side of our business costs were in line with prior expectations and we still anticipate o&m to be in line with our earlier $ 0.09 per mcf guidance .
also in march , our utility announced greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets for its delivery system of 75 % by 2030 and 90 % by 2050 , both from 1990 levels .
the targets rely on our commitment to the continued modernization of our utility infrastructure which today has led to a reduction in epa subpart w emissions of well over 60 % .
this has significantly increased seneca 's flexibility to move more gas to premium dominion and empire markets versus the weaker tgp 300 zone 4 market .
that leaves a relatively small amount of production , less than 10 bcf , exposed to in - basin spot pricing .
in addition , last summer 's tioga county acquisition continues to exceed our expectations with gathering throughput and appalachian production up over 45 % .
