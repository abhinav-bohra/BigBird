keep in mind , the 2020 fourth quarter we were comparing against was acutely impacted by covid and saw a 17 % higher core funeral volume increase over the 2019 fourth quarter .
excluding cash taxes in both periods , operating cash flow before taxes increased almost $ 6 million to $ 287 million in the fourth quarter , driven by modest increases in earnings and favorable working capital , partially offset by $ 6 million of higher cash interest payments .
we continue to believe that after establishing a new base here in 2022 , we will return to earnings growth in the 8 % to 12 % range in 2023 .
our core preneed funeral average revenue per contract [ inaudible ] the backlog now is over $ 6,300 .
deducting recurrent capex of $ 260 million , which again represents maintenance , capex and cemetery development capex , we calculate free cash flow for the full year to be an impressive $ 652 million in 2021 , up $ 33 million from $ 619 million in 2020 .
however , we were still able to grow the velocity of contract sold by almost 5 % , which accounted for the remainder of the sales production .
for the last two years alone , we meaningfully reduced our outstanding shares by about 10 % through timely execution on our repurchasing strategy .
so how are we going to grow earnings per share at a 16.5 % compounded annual growth rate from the 2019 base ?
this brings total 2021 spend on new builds to $ 43 million with again low double digit to maintain irrs , which also helped drive additional earnings and cash flow growth for the company .
recognized preneed revenues generated about $ 8 million of the revenue growth , primarily due to higher recognized preneed merchandise and service growth .
since the inception of our repurchase program , we have now reduced our shares outstanding by just over 50 % .
and finally , we forecast preneed funeral sales production to grow in a 3 % to 5 % range for the year .
while we saw 4 % comparable funeral volume growth , even growing over a covid - impacted 2020 , the primary drivers of our revenue was mid-20 % growth in both preneed and atneed cemetery revenues , combined with a strong 7 % increase in our funeral sales average .
this is an 8 % increase over 2020 and more than $ 300 higher than our atneed average for the quarter .
so overall , our fixed costs have increased 6 % over the two - year period , or let 's say , 3 % on a compounded annual basis while we are caring for 17 % more customers than we did in 2019 .
first , we 'll be required to pay the remaining half for about $ 20 million of payroll taxes that were deferred in 2020 as allowed under the cares act .
