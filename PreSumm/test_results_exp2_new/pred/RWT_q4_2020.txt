and a similar dynamic to the third quarter , though to a lesser extent , business purpose mortgage banking results included a benefit from spread tightening on the $ 286 million of sfr loan inventory it carried into the fourth quarter .

the single - investor securitization provides $ 200 million in financing for sfr loans , and includes a unique ramp up feature that enhances capital efficiency and reduces our reliance on traditional warehouse funding .

at our mortgage banking operations to support growing volumes , we increased our residential warehouse capacity from $ 600 million to $ 1.3 billion and maintain $ 1 billion of capacity for bpl operations , with nearly 70 % of this total capacity being non-marginable .
and in 2021 , we expect after - tax returns on this capital to 20 % .
after the payment of our $ 0.14 dividend , our book value increased to $ 9.91 per share , representing a 5 % increase for the quarter .
