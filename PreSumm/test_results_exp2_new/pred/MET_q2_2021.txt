adjusted earnings per share , excluding the notable item , was $ 2.30 , benefiting from strong returns in our private equity portfolio but show most of the year - over - year variance .
regarding non-medical health , the interest adjusted benefit ratio was 73.8 % in 2q of ' 21 , within its annual target range of 70 % to 75 % , but higher than the prior year quarter of 58.5 % , which benefited from extremely low dental utilization and favorable disability incidence .
and yesterday , our board approved a new $ 3 billion share repurchase authorization .
our decision to sell most of our $ 2.5 billion hedge fund portfolio and increase the allocation to private equity has provided a better match for our long - dated liabilities , while creating significant value for our shareholders .
the 10 - year strategic partnership we forged allows each company to focus on its core strengths : farmers ' 90 years of p&c underwriting and service excellence and metlife 's unrivaled distribution reach in the u.s. group benefits space .
this is on top of the $ 475 million we have remaining on our december 2020 authorization .
group benefits sales were up 39 % year - to - date , primarily due to higher jumbo case activity and remain on track to deliver a record sales year in 2021 .
in the quarter , the group life mortality ratio was 94.3 % , below the 106.3 % from last quarter but still above the top end of our guidance range .
in early april , we also closed on the sale of our auto and home business to farmers insurance for $ 3.94 billion in cash .
we reported private equity gains of 9.7 % in the second quarter compared with a negative 8.2 % a year ago .
additionally , adjusted earnings include one notable item of $ 66 million related to a legal reserve release .
as we did over 100 years ago with our visiting nurses program , metlife has mobilized to make a positive contribution to advance public health .
more than 500 employers now offer metlife pet insurance as a voluntary benefit to their employees and we believe our best - in - class product will continue to make gains in this highly attractive and underpenetrated market .
asia 's solid volume growth also contributed to the strong performance driven by higher general account assets under management on an amortized cost basis , which were up 7 % and 6 % on a constant currency basis .
what we have instead is a publicly disclosed direct expense ratio target that we have brought down by 200 basis points over the past five years and promise to keep there .
