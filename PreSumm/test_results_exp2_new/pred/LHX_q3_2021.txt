absent such delays , we would have comfortably been within our prior 3 % to 5 % range .
we 're in augmented reality assembly aid that electronically displays and validates our processes , helps reduce cycle time by 25 % and higher first - pass yields by several points .
when combined with other orders in the quarter , revenue synergy awards to date totaled roughly $ 900 million on the win rate that remains at 70 % .
having said that , we do not anticipate any impact to our bookings nor our win rate and expect the segment to end the year with a book - to - bill well over 1 time .
finally , we received a strategic award on the revenue synergy front as we signed a $ 130 million contract with the mid-east customer to provide modernized software - defined radios through a localized joint venture .
and this customer channel synergy award opens the door to a long - term opportunity for up to 50,000 radios .
our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $ 3.6 billion this year versus our prior $ 3.4 billion .
the focus we 've had be it on reducing the number of suppliers or leveraging our roughly $ 7.5 billion spend as an enterprise remain in place with further opportunities in the years ahead .
free cash flow was $ 673 million and we ended the quarter steady with working capital days at 56 .
of this growth synergies and operations contributed $ 0.39 , lower share count contributed another $ 0.20 and pension and tax accounted for the remaining $ 0.08 then more than offset a $ 0.14 headwind from divested earnings and a $ 0.16 headwind from supply chain delays .
in the third quarter , the impact was nearly $ 100 million or approximately 2 points of revenue .
the other half of our opportunity comes from the engineering excellence and supply chain on the former through the deployment of our digital ecosystem , front - loading our program activities , and enhancing training for our roughly 20,000 engineers and 1500 program managers , we 're able to increase commonality and better manage cost and schedule across the company .
this supported robust shareholder returns of $ 1.5 billion , comprised of $ 1.3 billion in share repurchases and $ 202 million in dividends .
on supply chain , the global disruption we 've highlighted have been largely contained to about 15 % of the company and are temporary in nature .
integrated mission systems revenue was down 3 % driven by follow on isr aircraft award timing from the nato customer that would have contributed 8 points of growth for which revenue has now been booked in october .
and in the fourth quarter , our expectation is for the backlog of unfilled orders to grow and all told , we foresee a roughly $ 250 million to $ 300 million revenue impact for the year , implying another step down in the fourth quarter .
