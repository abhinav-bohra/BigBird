normalizing all periods to provide an apples - to - apples comparison , we ended june 2021 with 129,600 life licenses and december 2020 with 130,700 life licenses .
as we noted last quarter , we now expect the majority of these licenses to age out , placing the normalized size of the sales force around 129,200 .
covid claims continue to be linked to older policies with less than 1 % of claims coming from policies issued since the onset of the pandemic .
during the third quarter , lapses remained around 25 % to 30 % lower in pre-covid levels for all durations except duration one , which was about 15 % lower .
net inflows of $ 1 billion during the quarter remained well above historical levels .
third quarter net covid - related death claims were $ 14 million , up from $ 8 million in the prior year period .
barring an unexpected change in market sentiment , we expect the fourth quarter investment sales to grow between 20 % and 25 % year - over - year and more than 40 % full year 2021 versus 2020 .
as i noted earlier , we 've made significant strides in expanding our product offering over the last 2 years .
while full year results would be down approximately 8 % versus 2020 's elevated levels , it will still represent more than a 10 % increase over pre-covid 2019 full year results .
the rate of covid mortality in our insured population also increased from around 11 million to 14 million per 100,000 deaths .
we incurred about $ 2 million of excess death claims in the quarter , not specifically identified as covid , but that we believe are indirectly tied to the pandemic , either through delayed medical care , societal issues such as crime or the behavioral health crisis .
we also expect to surpass $ 900 billion of face amount in force by the end of the year , another milestone in our corporate history .
and while sales are down versus the record levels , we forecast full year sales to be about 10 % above pre-pandemic levels .
compared to the pre-pandemic baseline , dac amortization was favorable by $ 11 million , offset by $ 6 million in higher benefit reserves due to strong persistency for a net favorable impact of $ 5 million to pre-tax income .
we anticipate pre-tax operating earnings to be in the $ 20 million range fourth quarter with lifetime value commissions around $ 1,170 and contract acquisition costs around $ 640 per approved policy .
asset - based revenues increased 31 % , reflecting a similar increase in average client asset value .
