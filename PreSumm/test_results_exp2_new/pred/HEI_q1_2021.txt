net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was $ 5.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal ' 21 , and that compared to $ 7.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal ' 20 .
and again , this year , we continue to make the 5 % match to team members ' 401 ( k ) investments .
as you know , most team members invest 6 % , heico matches it with 5 % of their salary in heico shares .
and in consideration of heico 's consolidated backlog , which has increased by $ 62 million since october 31 , ' 20 , the backlog was $ 906 million as of january 31 , ' 21 .
about 90 % of our people cannot work from home and have to come in .
no one customer accounted for more than 10 % of net sales .
in january 21 , we paid our regular semiannual cash dividend of $ 0.08 per share , and this represented our 85th consecutive semiannual cash dividend since 1979 .
as management looks at the company , we really believe that our success and the ability to keep our head well above water , not to get into any financial binds , not to struggle to sell debt at 8 % or 10 % and so forth and to be fiscally sound is all attributed to the unbelievable talent and brilliance of the team members .
