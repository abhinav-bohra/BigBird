even more encouraging is the strength of transient pricing with our second quarter transient rate at $ 253 .
our trailing six - week booking trends are now down only 10 % to 15 % compared to the same time in 2019 , which marks a substantial improvement from the 80 % to 90 % declines we saw in the first of the year and the 40 % to 50 % declines we saw going into the second quarter .
as previously mentioned , several recent groups have picked up 90 % to 100 % of their room blocks , which was well in excess of our forecast .
for example , travelers on tripadvisor recently ranked oceans edge as one of the top 10 hotels in key west , up from 24 at the end of 2019 , even with a massive increase in adr . these factors give us confidence that the rate increase is sustainable , and additional growth is achievable .
the citywide calendar in many of our primary markets are very encouraging over the next several quarters and over 30 % of our group room nights on the books for the fourth quarter are for citywide events .
the performance of these hotels was driven by occupancy approaching pre-covid levels with significantly higher room rates compared to ' 19 , running 30 % higher at wailea beach resort and up a staggering 91 % at oceans edge .
in addition to cash on hand , we also maintained full availability on our $ 500 million revolving credit facility .
furthermore , our occupancy , adr and revpar have each increased meaningfully on a sequential basis every month this year , and our june revpar of almost $ 130 was nearly 5 times that of the $ 27 comparable revpar achieved this past january .
through july 29 , our 17 open hotels generated revpar of approximately $ 165 , made up of a 62 % occupancy and a $ 266 average daily rate .
during the quarter , the hotel ran an occupancy of 61 % at an average rate over $ 1,000 and in july , the hotel ran at over 70 % occupancy at a rate of nearly $ 1,250 .
proceeds from these two transactions , both of which were record - setting low coupons at the time of issuance , are being used to redeem higher cost existing preferred equity and will reduce our comparable preferred dividends by $ 1.5 million per year .
building on the better - than - anticipated results of the first quarter , second quarter materially exceeded our expectations with comparable 17 - hotel portfolio revenues of $ 104 million , and revpar of $ 96 .
catering revenue per group room night also increased by over 2.5 times as corporate group and associations returned .
