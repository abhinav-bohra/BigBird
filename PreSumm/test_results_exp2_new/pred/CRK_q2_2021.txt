adjusted ebitdax of $ 251 million was 55 % higher than the second quarter of 2020 .
operating cash flow for the quarter was $ 196 million or $ 0.71 per diluted share .
for the first six months of the year , production totaled 241.5 bcfe .
we had a solid quarter , and it was driven by that 6 % production increase in combination with stronger oil and gas prices than we had last year .
the proceeds from the offering were used to redeem the remainder of our 9.75 quarter bonds .
we issued $ 965 million of new 5.875 % senior notes , which are due in 2030 .
i know that , that denominator is why jerry jones and his family invested $ 1 billion in comstock since august 2018 , and we believe that is why you , the bondholders , banks and equity owners buy comstock , proven rock quality , proven results over many , many years .
with the refinancing in place , we reduced our interest costs per mcfe by 25 % this quarter to $ 0.36 and are committed to continue working to reduce that number by year - end 2021 , if possible .
in addition to lowering our cost of capital , we also improved our weighted average maturity of our senior notes to 7.6 years , up from 6.3 years .
that reduced our realized gas price that $ 2.46 per mcfe from the actual $ 2.59 for mcfe we realized from selling our gas production .
our second quarter interest cost for mcfe would have been $ 0.36 per mcfe as compared to a $ 0.48 rate in the first quarter .
we currently plan to retire the 2025 7.5 % bonds , probably sometime early next year , just using -- targeting the free cash flow that 's generated and using that as a permanent debt reduction moved by the company .
we also had about 38 % of our oil volumes hedged , which decreased our realized oil price to $ 55.82 per barrel versus the $ 61.25 we actually realized .
so we did end the quarter with about $ 20 million in cash on the balance sheet .
combined with the march refinancing that we did , our annual interest payments were reduced by $ 48 million .
we now have in total about $ 2.459 billion of senior notes outstanding .
