the average selling price of downstream products increased by $ 158 per ton from the prior year , reaching $ 1,092 .
however , to put this performance into context , during the fiscal 2014 and 2015 time period , we experienced similar robust market conditions to what we enjoy today , and our 12 - month ebitda was between 375 million and 400 million with return on invested capital in the mid-single digits .
this represents cmc 's 229th consecutive quarterly dividend with the amount paid per share increasing 17 % from a year ago .
in addition , as we announced last week , in late december , we closed on the sale of our rancho cucamonga california site and received gross proceeds of 313 million .
largest driver of this 73 % improvement was a significant increase in margins on steel products and raw materials .
turning to slide 11 of the supplemental deck , our europe segment generated record adjusted ebitda of 79.8 million for the first quarter of 2022 compared to adjusted ebitda of 14.5 million in the prior - year period .
turning to capital allocation , balance sheet , and liquidity , as of november 30 , 2021 , cash and cash equivalents totaled 415 million .
cmc 's transformational growth projects over the last several years have expanded our north american business by nearly 50 % , necessitating organizational adjustment to accommodate such rapid growth .
this improvement was driven by expanded margins over scrap , the receipt of a 15.5 million energy credit , and strong profit contributions from our new rolling line .
during the second quarter , we will record a pre-tax gain of approximately 275 million related to this transaction .
proceeds received represent approximately 45 % of the entire purchase price of the rebar acquisition we completed in 2019 .
these transactions amounted to approximately 5.3 million , leaving 344 million remaining under the current authorization .
cmc was founded 106 years ago as a metals recycler , and we carry on that legacy today , operating possibly the cleanest portfolio of steel mills in the world .
this would add roughly 15 % to current domestic consumption of around 8.5 million tons .
importantly , arizona 2 will help further optimize cmc 's operational network and enhance customer service .
the infrastructure investment and jobs act signed last november will provide 1.2 trillion in funding over five years and stimulate an estimated 1 million to 1.5 million tons of incremental annual rebar demand at full run rate .
