in addition to the rent abatement savings , we have negotiated 58 renewals year - to - date and achieved a 28 % reduction in cash rent or 27 % on a straight - line basis in the u.s. , this was on top of an 11 % cash rent reduction or 8 % on a straight - line basis or 160 renewals last year .
j&m 's gross margin decrease of 1,370 basis points was due to more close outs at wholesale , incremental inventory reserves and higher markdowns at retail .
these renewals are for an even shorter - term , averaging approximately one and a half years compared to the three year average we saw last year , with almost a third of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next 24 months , we should make substantial progress here .
and as a percentage of sales , leveraged 10 basis points to 44.1 % as we realized the collective benefits of our organization 's disciplined actions to manage expenses and relief from government programs .
adjusted sg&a expenses were down 11 % .
this result was better than we expected due mainly to stronger sales at journeys and represents a meaningful improvement from last quarter 's 20 % decline .
robust e-commerce comp of 62 % was offset by a decline in - store revenue of 22 % driven by a comp decline of 18 % , while our stores were closed for 5 % of the possible operating days during the quarter .
the combination of these drivers led to a total revenue decrease of 11 % year over year .
while the annual tax rate is expected to be approximately 18 % .
with the ability to fulfill online orders via our distribution centers or from any of our almost 1,500 store locations , we 're well - positioned to meet the surge in demand .
overall , sales were down 10 % for journeys with comp sales down 6 % while store traffic was down well into double digits , much higher conversion and transaction size lifted journeys ' comps .
for the third quarter , ending cash was $ 115 million , with borrowings of $ 33 million for a net cash position of $ 82 million .
equally encouraging was the health of our inventories which were down more than 20 % , allowing for fresh receipts of holiday merchandise .
capital expenditures were $ 8 million as we -- as our spend remains focused on digital and omnichannel and depreciation and amortization was $ 11 million .
in summary , the third - quarter 's adjusted operating income was $ 13.9 million versus last year 's adjusted operating income of $ 26.7 million .
j&m 's inventory was down 3 % on sales that were down 45 % reflecting the pack - and - hold inventory and the level of reserves we believe will be adequate to better rightsize the current inventory levels .
