deferred revenue as of july four , 2021 , was $ 310 million , up $ 75 million or 32 % compared to second quarter 2019 .
attendance from our single - day guests in the second quarter represented 36 % of total attendance versus 39 % for the second quarter of 2019 , reflecting the impact of lower prebook sales , which are counted toward single - day attendance .
as a result of our strong revenue trends and season pass sales , we generated $ 190 million of cash flow during the quarter .
we continue to be on track to deliver $ 80 million to $ 110 million in incremental annual run rate ebitda once our transformation plan has been fully implemented and attendance returns to 2019 levels .
second quarter 2021 also included $ 11 million of proceeds received in connection with one of our terminated international development agreements in china .
this includes an incremental investment of approximately $ 20 million in seasonal wage rate increases annually on a go - forward basis in addition to the $ 20 million we called out in our previous baseline for a net increase of $ 40 million compared to 2019 .
applying the pro forma allocation mentioned on last quarter 's earnings call to 2019 , admission spending per capita increased 24 % .
we expect to incur the remaining $ 24 million in 2021 and 2022 , the majority of which is related to investments in technology , including a new crm system .
revenue in the quarter was $ 460 million , down $ 17 million or 4 % .
on the cost side , cash , operating and sg&a expenses versus 2019 decreased by $ 4 million or 2 % .
we expect this calendar shift -- the calendar change to shift approximately 500,000 of attendance out of the fourth quarter and into the third quarter .
priority # 2 is to pay down debt until we reach our targeted leverage range of three times to four times net debt to adjusted ebitda .
over the past few months , we have hosted numerous vaccination sites at our parks , and we have donated more than 140,000 tickets as an incentive for residents in areas around our parks in texas , illinois and california to get vaccinated .
for the full year , we previously expected to spend less than $ 98 million spent in 2020 .
year - to - date capital expenditures were $ 42 million .
