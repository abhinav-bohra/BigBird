these efforts have underpinned our operational efficiency gains and give us confidence in the durability around keeping our drilling complete cost below $ 600 per foot , all while achieving our environmental goals and producing best - in - class wells .
this efficiency level exceeds range 's previous best first quarter in winter operations record by 14 % .
for some added context on our inventory , range is turning to sales approximately 60 wells this year , but we have approximately 2,000 marcellus locations with eurs that are greater than 2 bcfe per 1,000 foot of lateral .
overall , the team completed just under 1,200 frac stages while setting a first quarter winter operations efficiency record by averaging over eight frac stages per day .
on the back with this improved pricing , range generated $ 193 million in cash flow from operations before changes in working capital , and with capital spending , coming in at just $ 105 million for the quarter , range generated solid free cash flow .
on the completion side , 16 wells were completed during the quarter .
40 % of the water used to complete these new wells was recycled water from range 's producing wells along with third - party water , sourced from our water sharing process .
the average initial production of these wells exceeded 44 million cubic feet equivalent per day including more than 9,700 barrels per day of combined condensate and natural gas liquids per well , placing them in the top tier of wells in our marcellus program history .
this past winter , propane posted its largest seasonal withdrawal and well over a decade , leaving the end of march propane stocks at a 33 % deficit to last year and a 17 % deficit to the five - year average .
additionally range 's premium to a mont belvieu equivalent barrel increased by approximately $ 1.50 per barrel versus the prior quarter as range realizes this highest premium to mont belvieu in the company 's history .
as a result , we expect propane prices to transact at levels at or above 60 % of wti crude this fall and the upcoming winter .
in fact range 's pre-hedge margin improved by over $ 1 per mcfe in the first quarter when compared to the 2020 average .
drilling efficiencies continued with nearly three - quarters of the new wells drilled on pads with existing production , coupled with a 5 % increase in daily lateral footage drilled compared to 2020 .
our q1 turn - in lines consisted of an average horizontal length in excess of 11,500 feet and added just under 200,000 producing lateral feet to range 's appalachia assets .
this will position us to achieve our 2021 maintenance target of 2.15 bcfe per day through additional margin enhancing liquids production while spending $ 425 million or less .
on the natural gas side , cold weather during mid-q1 equated to the third coldest february , when looking at the past 10 years .
