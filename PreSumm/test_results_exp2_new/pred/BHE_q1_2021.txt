we estimate that we will generate approximately $ 80 million to $ 100 million of cash flow from operations for the fiscal year 2021 .
growth is expected in q2 , even though demand for commercial aerospace programs , which was about 25 % of the sector demand in 2020 , continues to deteriorate .
our non-gaap diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $ 0.23 to $ 0.29 for a midpoint of $ 0.26 .
implied in our guidance is a 2.5 % to 2.9 % non-gaap operating margin range for modeling purposes .
to that point , in q1 , about 50 % of our new wins have an engineering component .
our cash balance was $ 400 million at march 31 with $ 153 million available in the us .
we still expect gross margins for the full year to be at least 9 % .
for q1 , our non-gaap gross margin was 8.3 % .
our pipeline continues to grow , and our trailing four quarter wins are over $ 800 million , which is a new record for our organization .
this is 10 basis points better than the midpoint of our q1 2021 guidance and 10 basis points less than our year - over - year comparison , which has stronger higher value market mix .
our differentiated offerings in support of the semi-cap market and our new program wins have enabled significant growth in the semi-cap vertical , which we expect will now grow over 20 % this year .
our cash conversion cycle days were 65 in the first quarter , an improvement of six days from the fourth quarter from the timing of inventory receipts , shipments to customers and collections within the quarter .
our gaap results included restructuring and other one - time costs , totaling $ 1.6 million related to reductions in force and other restructuring activities around our network of sites , $ 3.4 million of insurance recovery .
this strength , coupled with new programs and high - performance computing in mid-2021 and additional new program ramps in the higher value markets , gives us confidence that we can achieve greater than 5 % growth in 2021 .
our sg&a was $ 30.5 million , a decrease of $ 1.9 million sequentially due to lower variable compensation costs .
on a sequential basis , we were lower by 130 basis points , as a result of our lower revenue , reduced absorption , higher discrete medical claims activity and higher variable compensation .
