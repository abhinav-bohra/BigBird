discretionary ethane that can be recovered on our system in both the mid-continent and rocky mountain regions remains approximately 100,000 barrels per day .
in the rocky mountain region , first - quarter processed volumes increased 5 % year over year despite colder - than - normal weather in february .
once complete , we will have approximately 1.7 bcf per day of processing capacity in the basin , and we 'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital as producer activity levels increase .
we now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average close to the high end of our $ 0.95 to $ 1 per mmbtu guidance range .
in march , volumes exceeded 1.2 billion cubic feet per day , a level we can maintain even without increased producer activity .
in the rockies region , full recovery would provide an opportunity for $ 400 million in an annual adjusted ebitda at full rates .
with yesterday 's earnings announcement , we increased our 2021 net income and earnings per share guidance 10 % and adjusted ebitda guidance 5 % compared with our original expectations provided in late february .
the gathering and processing segment 's average fee rate remained $ 1.04 per mmbtu during the quarter , unchanged from the fourth - quarter 2020 .
as we look toward 2022 , high single to low double - digit growth in ebitda appears reasonable in the $ 50 to $ 70 per barrel price range when you adjust 2021 for the approximately $ 90 million weather impact to revised guidance .
this compares with 1.2 bcf that we sold in the first quarter of 2020 .
