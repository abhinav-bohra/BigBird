we ended the quarter with about $ 4.8 billion of cash .
within iata 's estimate is the expectation that domestic travel will be back to 93 % of pre-pandemic levels in calendar year 2022 .
the $ 200 million revolver paydown is the primary reason that our cash balance ticked up much less than the $ 250 million of free cash flow we generated in q1 .
at this time , we are engaged directly with the dla and do not have any further update on whether or not we expect to pay all or a portion of the $ 21 million voluntary refund request .
domestic air traffic for calendar 2021 was only down 28 % compared to pre-pandemic versus international , which was still down 75 % .
organic growth was 9 % , driven by the rebound in our commercial oem and aftermarket end markets .
our net debt - to - ebitda ratio is now at 6.7 times .
this ratio is down from 8.2 times , at its peak .
our total commercial oem revenue increased approximately 13 % in q1 compared with the prior year period .
we are now at a decision point with regard to our sizable cash balance , which is now approaching $ 5 billion .
all three options are on the table each individually , but then also potentially in some combination over the next 12 months .
bob has been a key member of the transdigm management team for over 25 years and a significant partner in the company 's growth during the entire period .
i am also very pleased that despite the challenging commercial environment , our ebitda as defined margin was 47.3 % in the quarter .
commercial oem bookings came in even stronger with almost 20 % sequential improvement over q4 .
to reiterate what we said on the q4 earnings call , our teams are still planning for our commercial aftermarket revenue to grow in the 20 % to 30 % range .
sequentially , total commercial aftermarket revenues grew approximately 10 % and bookings grew more than 15 % .
