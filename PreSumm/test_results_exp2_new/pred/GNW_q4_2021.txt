we see tremendous potential in the business as part of our ltc growth strategy , so we are making an investment of approximately $ 8 million in carescout in the first quarter to expand its clinical assessment capabilities in care support solutions .
the product has a maximum lifetime benefit of $ 250,000 , and the pricing assumptions for the key ltc risk were interest rates , lapses , morbidity and mortality are based on genworth 's current experience and projections for these factors .
we are hopeful that with a substantial reduction in outstanding parent holding company debt in 2021 , our improved cash interest coverage ratio , significant excess cash available to repurchase our outstanding 2024 debt , the long duration of the remaining 2034 and 2066 debt and the expectation of continued strong u.s. statutory net income that the rating agents will continue to upgrade the parent debt ratings over time .
joost has approximately 30 years of experience in the insurance industry .
we expect this investment to triple the annual assessment revenues in the next few years to approximately $ 30 million .
acquired by genworth in 2008 , carescout is a market leader in providing ltc care assessments and care support through our network of 35,000 clinicians nationwide .
our u.s. gaap debt to capital ratio at the end of the year was 13 % , one of the lowest among life insurers that report this metric .
joost worked with me at ing group for over a decade , including stints helping me oversee ing 's worldwide insurance and investment management businesses in over 40 countries and restructuring ing 's very large side agency distribution channels in the emerging markets in asia , latin america and eastern europe .
even with this debt management activity , we ended the quarter with a solid holding company cash and liquidity position of $ 356 million .
full year adjusted operating income for u.s. life and runoff combined was $ 321 million , led by strong ltc adjusted operating income of $ 445 million for the year .
legacy ltc products were sold pursuant to a regulatory regime designed to make premium adjustments difficult to obtain even though it is impossible to price products with assumptions that will hold , and of course , they did not hold for 30 to 40 years .
after we retire the remaining of genworth 's $ 280 million of debt due in 2024 , our pro forma cash flow coverage will be approximately five times based on a conservative view of projected future cash flows .
during 2021 , genworth delivered a new record for approved ltc rate increases of $ 403 million from 45 states on 173 separate rate filings .
we have included our statutory information through september 2021 on pages 15 and 16 of the investor deck .
given that our net debt position is now below $ 1 billion , and we expect enact to share their dividend policy later this year , we plan to consider initiating a capital management program later in 2022 .
genworth therefore decided to proceed with a partial ipo and sold approximately 18.4 % of enact shares , which we believe was the best viable option for shareholders .
