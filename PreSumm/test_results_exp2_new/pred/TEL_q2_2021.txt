so let me get into our year - over - year segment results and there are slides 5 through 7 .
with that as a little bit of a backdrop , i do want to take a moment to frame out the current market environment and our business relative to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke .
as i already stated in the quarter , our orders were very strong at approximately $ 4.6 billion , and we had a book to bill of 1.22 .
second quarter sales of $ 3.7 billion were better than our expectations in each of our segments .
the adjusted effective tax rate in q2 was approximately 17 % .
orders on a sequential basis in europe were up 14 % , and north america sequential orders were up 22 % , and that was broad based growth across all our segments than those two regions .
from a free cash flow perspective , in the second quarter free cash flow was $ 477 million , with approximately $ 340 million being returned to shareholders .
adjusted earnings per share was $ 1.57 and gaap earnings per share was $ 1.51 for the quarter and included restructuring , acquisition and other charges of $ 0.06 .
and lastly in the industrial segment , our energy business , we saw 4 % organic growth , and this was driven by increase in penetration of renewables , especially benefiting from solar applications around the world .
and when you think about our industrial equipment market , it was very strong and up 16 % organically , with growth in all regions and increasing strength in factory automation applications where we 're benefiting from accelerating capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor equipment as well as along the auto manufacturing supply chain .
we continue to optimize our manufacturing footprint and improve the cost structure of the organization and continue to expect total restructuring charges in the ballpark of $ 200 million for fiscal ' 21 .
orders in transportation and in communications were up 50 % and 45 % respectively .
we also had very strong performance in our communications segment , with organic growth of 29 % , which was strong double - digit growth in both of the businesses in that segment .
currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by $ 115 million versus the prior year .
and year - to - date , we are generating content outperformance over production in our expected 4 % to 6 % range .
we are continuing to benefit from stricter emission standards and the increased operator adoption of euro 5 and 6 in china which reinforces our strong position in that country .
