point number 4 , the early redemption of $ 120 million of the high cost acquisition bonds this month was funded a 100 % with cash from operations , as was the additional $ 100 million of bonds repaid last october .
at the same time we rinked $ 1.5 billion in ebitda , global ecu supply demand fundamentals are likely to be improved and olin will expand our strategy to incorporate fixed asset light structural moves to take us to the next higher ebitda level , as more molecules move through our sphere of influence .
in fact , maybe the most important slide we have ever published is slide number 12 .
through a combination of improved adjusted ebitda , disciplined capital spending and debt reduction , we expect our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio to improve to roughly three times within the next 12 months .
point number 2 , our merchant chlorine net - backs go to a multi- year high , following our fourth quarter activations , which included shifting an additional 30 % of our ongoing business away from arbitrary external trade indices .
additionally , we have adjusted down our forward annual capital spend requirements to around $ 200 million , reflecting a better match of our physical plant assets to our model .
so wrapping up my opening comments with slide number 6 , our first half quarterly average ebitda should be better than the fourth quarter of 2020 across every business .
the olin winchester team relishes its commitment to support both the u.s. war fighter and the more than 55 million of us who enjoy shooting sports .
now , turning your attention to slide number 3 , olin 's quarterly ecu profit contribution index chart , even though the global chlor alkali market configuration is in the poorest state for olin , in other words when strong , back integrated pvc production , which olin does not directly participate in , pushes out lots of co-produce caustic into a weak caustic demand environment , really the emphasis being on the weak caustic demand point here , we still sequentially lifted our ecu pci by lifting margins across chlorine , edc and virtually every chlorine derivative while simultaneously not allowing olin caustic to decline in price as much as industry indices would have anticipated .
and speaking of quality and moving to slides 4 and 5 , winchester delivered the best quarterly performance in the business 's 155 - year history with even better quarters expected throughout 2021 .
we start 2021 with 633 active projects .
note that we do have a number of turnarounds in the second quarter to contend with and we expect a 10 % improvement in the ecu pci across the first half .
please see slide number 15 in the appendix for some more detail on that .
point number 1 , epoxy will be the star of the show and is expected to surpass our prior quarterly ebitda record as the team lifts the permanent earnings foundation of that business to match the value of our product offering .
