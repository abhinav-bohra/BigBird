our q4 scenario assumes that there will roughly be a 5 % improvement in unit shipments plus or minus blended across all device categories .
and last year 's q3 included a $ 30 million charge for restructuring mostly associated with an early exit from a leased facility .
so to summarize , our scenario for total revenue in q4 is a range of $ 225 million to $ 255 million .
the composition of q3 revenue was $ 235 million in licensing ; and $ 12 million in products and services .

we also announced today a cash dividend of $ 0.22 per share , which will be payable on august 26 , 2020 to shareholders of record on august 17th , 2020 .
based on a combination of the factors i just reviewed , we estimate the q4 diluted earnings per share on the gaap basis could range from five -- from about $ 0.05 to about $ 0.20 ; and then on a non-gaap basis , we estimate , it would range from about $ 0.22 to $ 0.37 .
operating expenses in q3 were about $ 8 million less than the low end of the range we 've guided , mostly driven by timing of certain marketing programs that were pushed into q4 , lower legal expenses and lower travel and outside services .
