the comparison of 2021 to 2019 most clearly illustrates the efficiency we 've achieved over the past 2 years , as we generated 9 % higher operating income on 4 % less volume .
for 3rd quarter 2021 , the operating revenue up 13 % and operating expense only up 9 % .
setting aside these exogenous issues , up 's core operational performance drove operating ratio improvement of 430 basis points and added $ 0.56 to eps .
our manifest and auto trip plan compliance results improved from 57 % in august to 61 % in september .
we generated 3rd quarter record operating income of $ 2.4 billion , net income of $ 1.7 billion and earnings per share also with 3rd quarter records .
coal and renewable carloads grew 9 % year - over - year and 17 % from the second quarter .
revenue for the quarter was up 14 % compared to last year , driven by a 4 % increase in volume and a 9 % increase in average revenue per car , reflecting strong core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue .
while we made improvement from our freight car velocity weekly low of 184 in august , to 210 miles per day in the last 2 weeks of september , our goal remains to return freight car velocity toward and 220 miles per day .
now let 's move on to slide 17 which provides a summary of our 3rd quarter operating expenses , which increased 9 % in total versus 2020 .
rising fuel prices throughout the quarter , negatively impacted operating ratio by 140 basis points .
this represented a 1 % improvement versus 2020 and helped our customers eliminate 5.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions .
in fact , over the last 30 days , barrel prices have increased around $ 10 with spot diesel prices up over $ 0.25 per gallon .
to put that in context , however , at the end of this year we will have generated almost $ 1.8 billion of productivity since our implementation of psr in late 2018 .
this compares to $ 1.4 billion or $ 2.01 per share in the third quarter of 2020 despite the network and global supply chain challenges our quarterly operating ratio of 56.3 % improved 240 basis points versus last year and represents a third quarter record .
management , engineering and mechanical workforces together decreased 3 % .
we are also adjusting our productivity guidance for the year , down to $ 350 million as the weather impact and related network challenges impede the progress we expect to make with our efficiency in 2021 .
