so we 're starting second quarter at 27 , so the number is going to be somewhere in the mid-20s .
our book value per share is now at $ 32.83 .
tangible book values at $ 32 even .
i wo n't say from which bank , but it comes with $ 0.5 million loan and $ 26 million in deposits with a full suite of treasury management products .
we did declare a $ 0.23 dividend , and currently , we anticipate maintaining that level .
the quarterly performance , we reported net income of about $ 99 million , 98.8 % to be exact , $ 1.06 per share .
we still have a little less than $ 40 million left in the buyback , and we plan to execute it against a buyback opportunistically .
loans were down about $ 500 million .
and the reason i can say that is because on march 31 , on a spot basis , we were already down to 27 basis points .
so , i think $ 425 million of that $ 505 million was directly attributable to less utilization .
this compares to $ 0.89 that we reported to you last quarter .
about 30 % of our employees are either vaccinated or about to be fully vaccinated , and many more are in line .
the reserve declined from 1.08 % to 0.95 % of loans , and slides nine through 11 of our deck gives some further details on the allowance .
a decrease of $ 10.1 million due to charge - offs , most of which related to one bfg franchise loan that was having trouble even prior to covid .
we bought back about $ 7.3 million of stock this quarter .
also , let me talk a little bit about 2.0 , and specifically 2.0 revenue initiatives .
