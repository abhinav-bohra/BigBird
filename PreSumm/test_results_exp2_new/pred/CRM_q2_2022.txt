1 crm just got better .
one is in our core products , our focus on customer success , the customer 360 now with the slack user interface and everything being slack first , but also our core values .
for fiscal year ' 22 , we are raising again our guide to $ 26.3 billion , which is now at the high end of our range .
and i guess i 'm -- as excited as i am about the revenue , i 'm also very excited that as we 're executing this new operating margin model , we can see the margin in the quarter was also a very healthy , 20.4 % , up 20 basis points year over year , and also delivered $ 386 million in operating cash flow .
and from a business perspective , well , i 'd say it 's been an absolutely extraordinary 18 months for salesforce , i know for all of you and certainly for all the ceos i met with today .
and three out of the last five quarters , we 're having greater than 20 % operating margin .
