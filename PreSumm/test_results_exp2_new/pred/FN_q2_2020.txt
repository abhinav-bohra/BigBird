looking at our non-optical communications business , revenue of 104 million was up from 97 million in the first quarter , which was also better than expected .
non-gaap gross margin in the second quarter was 11.9 % .
as a result , non-gaap operating income was 38.5 million , and non-gaap operating margin was 9 % .
62.2 million remain in our share repurchase program .
finally , revenue generated from other non-optical applications grew 20 % sequentially to 33 million , mainly from fabrinet west .
from an earnings per share perspective , we anticipate non-gaap net income per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $ 0.92 to $ 0.95 , and gaap net income per share of $ 0.75 to $ 0.78 , based on approximately 37.9 million fully diluted shares outstanding .
sensor revenue increased slightly to 3.9 million from 3.5 million .
we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be 5 to 6 % for the full year .
datacom represented 23 % of optical communications revenue .
while it is still early days , we believe that if this program ramps as anticipated , that cisco could represent 10 % of revenue or more for fabrinet in fiscal 2021 .
