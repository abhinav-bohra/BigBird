started 40 years ago , the company has always adapted its business very effectively to the challenges presented by the market , the environment and new customer preferences .
in addition , last year 's outflow included the non-recurring payment of the $ 46 million european commission fine .
well , at the height of the closures in november , we had over 200 stores closed , more than half of these have reopened and we expect further openings in the coming days .
our americas wholesale business was down 34 % in constant currency , still under pressure from the deceleration in demand , but improving each quarter .
free cash flow for the first nine months of the year was an inflow of $ 83 million , an increase of $ 162 million versus an outflow of $ 79 million last year .
given the expected level of revenue , the seasonality of our business , as well as the mix , we expect sg&a as a percent of sales to delever by approximately 400 basis points versus the prior year .
licensing revenues also improved versus q2 , down 12 % in q3 .
our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 16 % , down from 24 % last year , driven by the mix of statutory earnings .
this proved to be a great strategy and represented a revenue increase in the period for europe of about $ 50 million .
total q3 revenues for europe increased 16 % and operating profit exceeded $ 51 million delivering a margin expansion of 900 basis points for the period .
we plan to complete the full implementation of the customer 360 solution by the end of next year .
let me just confirm today that we still believe that the opportunities we had identified to expand operating margins by 500 basis points are still intact .
this quarter we booked roughly $ 8 million in rent credits for fully negotiated rent relief deals , mostly in europe .
we also made significant progress with our customer 360 project .
adjusted operating profit for the third quarter was $ 55 million , a 140 % more than the operating profit in q3 last year of $ 23 million .
apparel resulted in a style reduction of 38 % and this is after expanding the offering with multiple colors per stall , for e-commerce that represented a 7 % increase of product choices online .
