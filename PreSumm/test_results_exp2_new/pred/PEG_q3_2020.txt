o&m expense was $ 0.03 unfavorable versus the third quarter of 2019 , primarily reflecting our internal labor costs on tropical storm isaias and timing of certain maintenance activities , partly offset by the reversal of certain covid - 19 - related cost recognized in prior quarters .
obviously , offsetting this timing item , pse&g reversed a $ 0.04 accrual of revenue under the weather normalization costs for collection of lower gas margins resulting from the warmer - than - normal winter earlier in the year due to recovery limitations under that quarters earnings test .
