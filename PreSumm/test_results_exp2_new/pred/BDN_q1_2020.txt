our office leasing slides are close to $ 0.02 a share , the construction slides will cost us $ 0.01 .

we anticipate losing a $ 0.01 through our joint ventures and we anticipate losing another $ 0.01 through lost parking revenue , and the hotel component of our aka project at the fmc tower .
of that , based upon the information we have , we think that 10 % of those will likely progress to execution , about 70 % , it 's just simply too early to tell as a lot of our prospects are focused on their own businesses versus their office space requirements and we believe about 15 % is mostly likely dead requirements because of the virus and we expect to lose the balance of about 7 % to another competitor .
we have about 45 % of the deals in our pipeline on hold due to the virus .
to do a very quick reconciliation , our previous midpoint was a $ 1.46 per share .
