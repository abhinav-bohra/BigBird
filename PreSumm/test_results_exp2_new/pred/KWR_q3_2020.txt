as a result of our strong cash flow , we were able to reduce net debt by $ 58 million , a 7 % reduction from q2 .
this improves our leverage ratio to 3.4 times from 3.7 times at the end of june , and our bank calculated leverage at the end of q3 was about 2.9 times versus our covenant maximum of 4.25 times .
in addition , our low capital intensity allows us flexibility with our capital spending , and consistent with our q2 call , we 're on pace to reduce our capex by more than 30 % versus our original pre-covid estimate .
our other industry groups of metals and global specialty businesses also increased and showed growth of 21 % and 16 % respectively .
indeed , we saw this in both q2 and q3 and are pleased to report that our year - to - date operating cash flow more than tripled versus last year to $ 112 million .
please see slides 6 through 10 now , while i review some highlights .
metalworking increased the most and grew 39 % sequentially from the second quarter , due primarily to automotive oems and related suppliers coming back from the prolong shutdowns or significantly reduced production rates in the second quarter due to covid .
also , the total synergies we estimate that we will achieve in 2021 have been raised from $ 65 million to $ 75 million with ' 22 reaching $ 80 million .
in 2021 , as mike mentioned , we expect to see a greater than 20 % increase in adjusted ebitda .
our non-gaap operating income of $ 43.2 million rebounded significantly from q2's $ 11.2 million and is also up 25 % from $ 34.5 million in q3 of last year , primarily due to the addition of houghton and norman hay and the benefits of realized cost synergies , partially offset by the negative impact of covid - 19 .
remember that we closed the combination on august 1 , 2019 , so our actual reported and non-gaap q3 2019 results include only two months of houghton .
in this quarter , we achieved $ 17 million in synergies , and we expect sequential improvement during our future quarters .
first , as we look sequentially , the americas saw the largest quarterly net sales improvement as sales grew 48 % sequentially , driven primarily by stronger volumes .
this approximately 10 % decline was felt in all regions and segments .
this pandemic and its impacts have been similar in many ways to what we went through in late 2008 .
as we said previously , we estimate it will take at least two more years for our markets to fully return , and some markets like aerospace , which makes up about 3 % of our sales , will take more time than that .
