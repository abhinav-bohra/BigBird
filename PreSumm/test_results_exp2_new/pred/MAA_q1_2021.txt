and finally , in a way to reflect the first quarter earnings performance , we increased our full year guidance range for core ffo by $ 0.05 to a range of $ 6.35 to $ 6.65 per share .
transaction cap rates on closed projects that we underwrote were down 25 basis points from last quarter and down 50 basis points from first quarter of 2020 .
we ended the quarter with low leverage , debt - to - ebitda of only 4.9 times and with $ 644 million of combined cash and borrowing capacity under our line of credit .
as expected , operating trends continued to improve through the quarter , producing same - store revenue and noi performance that was slightly ahead of our forecast , providing about $ 0.01 per share on favorability for the quarter .
our resident satisfaction scores remained strong and are actually ahead of last year by 120 basis points , which should support continued strong renewal lease pricing .
net earnings impact to maa during the quarter was only about $ 765,000 , primarily related to down units .
we also funded an additional $ 64 million of cost toward completion of our development pipeline , which , at quarter end , included seven communities with total projected cost of $ 528 million , of which $ 193 million remains to be funded .
exposure , which is all vacant units plus notices through a 60 - day period , is just 7.2 % .
the number of participants has decreased to just 325 for the april of this year rental assistance plan .
this robust investor demand supported by continued low interest rates has further compressed cap rates , which are frequently in the mid-3 % and low 4 % range for high - quality properties in desirable locations within our markets .
this is 180 basis points better than the prior year and supports our ability to continue to prioritize our focus on rent growth .
this represents only 20 basis points of april billed rent .
new lease - over - lease pricing in april is running close to 4 % of rent on the prior lease .
we completed 964 redevelopment units and 13,975 smart home packages .
