third quarter 2020 office occupancy for the same - store portfolio was 91.1 % , a sequential decline of 40 basis points due to several small tenants not reopening post covid .
as of november 6 , our tenants have paid more than 99 % of october contractual rents .
this project is designed to be leed certified and total estimated project costs are over $ 280 million .
as a result of our proactive steps to improve coverage through mutually beneficial arrangements with capital senior , holiday , brookdale and other smaller tenants , our trailing 12 months cash flow coverage for senior housing is 1.4x .
as an example , we estimate that our top 10 health system tenants have collectively received nearly 5 billion in cares act relief and 10 billion in medicare advanced payments .
this gives us confidence that our occupancy will soon build from the current state which is already 96 % leased .
remember 88 % of mob noi is from investment grade tenants or hca and 97 % of our mob noi comes from tenants affiliated with major health systems , including some of the nation 's most prestigious , not - fort - profit health systems .

we are also investing nearly $ 420 million in ground up development of new consumer focused senior living communities , which are well under way .
spurred by record capital flows into the life science sector , this market has less than 2 % lab vacancy , unparalleled access to a large concentration of life science firms and an extensive venture capital network going after the world class talent pool .
during the third quarter , our healthcare triple - net assets showed continued strength and resilience as evidenced by receiving 100 % of third quarter , october and november from our total healthcare tenants .
our joint venture with gic may be expanded to over $ 2 billion with other pre-identified future r&i development projects currently in our pipeline if they go forward .
