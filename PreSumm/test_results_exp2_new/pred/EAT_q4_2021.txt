our board of directors has also reinstated the share repurchase authorization that was suspended in the early days of the pandemic with an authorization amount of $ 300 million .
to reward our operator 's strong performance throughout the fiscal year , we also chose to further invest in our hourly team members and managers through a variety of incremental bonus structures , totaling approximately $ 4 million for the quarter beyond our normal payout formulas .
capex of $ 155 million to $ 165 million , an annual effective tax rate of 14 % to 15 % , and weighted annual share count of 45 million to 47 million shares .
this decreased our total funded debt leverage to 2.5 times and our lease - adjusted leverage to 3.6 times at year end .
the new $ 800 million five - year revolver includes improved pricing allows the return of restricted payments and provides ample liquidity and flexibility to support our growth strategies .
our fourth - quarter restaurant operating margin was 16.9 % .
this incremental investment impacted quarterly earnings per share by approximately $ 0.06 and increased labor expense margin by roughly 40 basis points , well worth the benefits it will accrue .
food and beverage expense for the fourth quarter as a percent of company sales was 20 basis points unfavorable as compared to prior year .
our teams have raised nearly $ 90 million for st. jude 's patients during our partnership .
it 's now in over 250 restaurants today and doing very well .
adjusting this performance for the impact of the 53rd week , the resulting 16 % operating margin still represents a material year - over - year improvement and more importantly was a 110 - basis - point margin improvement versus the pre-covid fourth quarter of fiscal ' 19 .
in a year of closures and shutdowns , we opened our first virtual brand in over 1,000 restaurants by leveraging our technological infrastructure , it 's just wings surpassed our $ 150 million target in our company - owned restaurants .
restaurant expense was 830 basis points favorable year over year as we fully leveraged many of our fixed costs , particularly from the benefit of the additional week in the quarter .
by year - end , our revolver balance was reduced to $ 171 million .
it 's in more than 250 restaurants now , and we anticipate full implementation by november .
