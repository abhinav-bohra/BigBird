and what it does is it assumes that the inferred resources that we mine , which is about 5 % to 15 % of what we typically mine at those two mines , that that was waste .
that host more than 300 million ounces of silver and 3 billion pounds of copper .
so as a result of that , our silver reserves increased 6 % over last year , and they 're now the second highest in our history at 200 million ounces , with greens creek 's reserves at 125 million ounces .
and so i 'd encourage you to look at section 21 as section 19 .
and so what we 've also done is we 've included in section 21 the summarized information , the supplemental information that gives our long - term plans that includes this inferred materials at their expected grade .
greens creek had another strong year as the mine produced 9.2 million ounces at an all - in sustaining costs of $ 3.19 per ounce , which was below our lower end of guidance at $ 3.25 per silver ounce .
with this strong and consistent free cash flow generation , we 've seen an increase to our cash balance of 60 % over 2020 and more than three times that of 2019 .
now , the lucky friday has been around for 80 years , but this new mining method fundamentally changes this long standing mine .
now we mined 86 % of our tons last year with the ucb method , but we we did n't speak about this until almost the end of the year because we wanted to make sure we understood how the cycle worked , confirmed how it would improve our seismicity management , determine how we manage dilution , and consider the impacts on the workforce .
in 2021 , production was a 75 % increase over 2020 .
a 5 % inflation factor would add less than $ 7 million to the total capital spend .
our third message is that on the esg front , hecla stands out with the safety record of our employees that is 40 % below the national average , and we are also net neutral on greenhouse gas emissions for scope 1 and 2 because we have among the smallest emissions in our industry .
our 2022 total expected spend on production costs is about 6 % higher than 2021 .
turning to slide 7 , as phil noted earlier , we generated record revenue of more than $ 800 million , of which silver contributed 34 % while gold contributed 42 % .
and in those reports , there 's an economic analysis that 's in section 19 that shows very strong economics of the reserves .
production in 2022 is planned to be almost 20 % greater than 2021 while the all in sustaining cost per ounce is expected to decline by more than 30 % due to higher production and byproduct credits .
