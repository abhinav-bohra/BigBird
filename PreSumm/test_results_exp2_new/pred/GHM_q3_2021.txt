cash is at $ 69.3 million , up $ 1.4 million from the end of q2 but still down from $ 73 million at the end of fiscal 2020 .
it is important to point out the defense strategy where $ 100 million of new orders were secured in the last 12 quarters , representing 30 % of total orders has been a terrific counter balance to headwinds within our more traditional markets .
year - to - date , ebitda margins were 5.6 % versus 3.1 % in the first nine months of last year .
at the peak of the second wave in early january , the production departments were operating at no less than 90 % capacity .
the orders for defense during the last two quarters were $ 65 million .
stated differently , approximately 60 % of orders in the past 12 quarters were from our traditional markets or customers and 40 % from strategies to broaden revenue streams .
lastly , our annual guidance remains at $ 93 million to $ 97 million , which was communicated during our second quarter earnings call .
15 % of our total orders since late in fiscal 2019 have come from this strategy .
cash per share is $ 6.94 .
we have 20 positions that we are hoping to fill over the next two years that would allow us to expand our backlog conversion and drive revenue growth .
full year gross margin should fall between 21 % to 22 % .
orders in q3 were in excess of $ 61 million , our strongest order recorded ever , driven by $ 52 million in defense orders .
sales to the defense industry were $ 4.5 million and were up slightly year - on - year .
our backlog is now nearly $ 150 million , 70 % of which is in the defense market .
this is despite our challenging q1 when the production was at 50 % of capacity due to covid impacts .
our covid - 19 impact in the quarter was small compared to q1 , but we still lost approximately $ 900,000 of revenue due to employee absences related to covid .
