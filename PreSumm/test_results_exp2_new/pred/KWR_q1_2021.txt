as you can see in chart eight , our quarterly adjusted ebitda of $ 77.1 million grew 28 % from the prior year , which drove an 8 % increase in our trailing 12 - month adjusted ebitda to $ 239 million .
notably , this 1 % improvement year - over - year is really the benefit of strong execution of integration synergies , offsetting higher raw material costs that we incurred in the quarter .
to note , we do expect both our second quarter and full year etrs will be in the range of 24.5 % to 26.5 % .
excluding various onetime items in each period , our tax rate would have been reasonably consistent at 25 % for the current quarter compared to 22 % last year .
this includes prioritizing debt reduction while continuing to pay dividends and invest in acquisitions that provide growth opportunities , which make strategic sense , all while remaining committed to reducing our leverage below our targeted 2.5 times level by the end of this year .
so we continue to feel good about our ability to deliver on our historical performance of consistently growing 2 % to 4 % above the market due to share gains .
the sequential increase was broad - based , with all segments and regions growing between 9 % and 12 % .
emea also showed strong net sales growth of 14 % due to a solid bounce back from covid - 19 .
