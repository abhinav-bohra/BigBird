interest expense between $ 36 million and $ 38 million ; depreciation and amortization between $ 104 million and $ 107 million ; capital expenditures of approximately $ 42 million and $ 47 million , which is lower than our prior expectations ; and historical average of around $ 60 million , excluding extraordinary projects , and our effective tax rate is expected to be 26 % to 27 % .
as mike mentioned earlier , with this plan , we will achieve our near - term target leverage ratio of 2.5 x by 2023 .
private brand tissue share in the us rose to over 30 % recently , up from 18 % in 2011 .
there are no planned major maintenance outages , which will benefit us , given the $ 5 million q3 outage .
please note that we largely exited the away from home tissue segments in the third quarter of this year , which historically represented 3 % to 4 % of our overall case volume .
in north america , we view tissue demand as being approximately 10 million tons with annual demand growth of 1 % to 2 % , slightly exceeding population growth .
our production of converted product in the quarter was 11.4 million cases are down 25 % versus the prior year .
we are expected to achieve the full run rate benefit of the neenah closure , which we previous previously stated as being more than $ 10 million annualized .
this includes a $ 50 per ton increase in october for both grades .
let me walk you through the build up to that range from our third quarter adjusted ebitda $ 50 million .
this was a bit higher than our guidance of 10 % to 15 % growth , partly driven by the august demand uptick .
and finally , we maintained ample liquidity of $ 270 million at quarter end and reduce net debt by another $ 7 million .
but that said , our expectation for the fourth quarter is adjusted ebitda of $ 48 million to $ 56 million .
