for the full - year , we expect capital expenditures of approximately $ 125 million to $ 145 million , which represents nearly a 10 % reduction compared to 2020 , and is primarily composed of maintenance requirements for our marine fleet .
industry analysts have predicted the average active frac crew count could climb back to near 200 , which is a notable improvement from 2020 levels .
inland operating margins were near 20 % and prices were materially increasing in both inland and coastal .
all of this should help improve the market and is expected to contribute to a meaningful improvement in barge utilization likely into the high 80 to low 90 % range by the end of the year .
across the company , we have tightly managed costs , which has helped maintain overall marine transportation margins near 10 % , and distribution and service margins near breakeven .
this amount was slightly below the low end of our previously disclosed guidance range of $ 300 million .
during the quarter , coastal barge utilization was in the mid-70 % range , unchanged sequentially but down from the mid-80 % range in the 2019 fourth quarter .
in marine transportation , refinery utilization has steadily improved into the low 80 % range .
in the fourth quarter , marine transportation revenues were $ 299.4 million , with an operating income of $ 29.2 million and an operating margin of 9.7 % .
compared to the third quarter , revenues improved $ 14.4 million or 8 % .
turning to the balance sheet ; as of december 31 , we had $ 80.3 million of cash , total debt was $ 1.47 billion , and our debt to cap ratio was 32.2 % .
chemical plant utilization modestly improved 1 % sequentially , but remained below 2019 levels .
earlier today we announced 2020 fourth quarter earnings of $ 0.37 per share .
long - term inland marine transportation contracts are those contracts with a term of one year or longer , contributed approximately 70 % of revenue , with 62 % from time charters and 38 % from contracts of affreightment .
