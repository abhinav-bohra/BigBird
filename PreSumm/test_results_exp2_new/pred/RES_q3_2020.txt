segment operating loss in the third quarter of 2020 was $ 3.8 million compared to an operating profit of $ 1.6 million in the third quarter of the prior year .
third quarter 2020 capital expenditures were $ 13.7 million and we currently estimate the full - year capital expenditures to be approximately $ 60 million to $ 70 million and comprised primarily of capitalized maintenance of our existing equipment as well as upgrades of selected pressure pumping equipment for dual fuel capability .
these expenses decreased due to lower employment costs , primarily the result of cost reduction initiatives during previous quarters , partially offset by $ 3.3 million of accelerated amortization of restricted stock related to the passing of our chairman .
