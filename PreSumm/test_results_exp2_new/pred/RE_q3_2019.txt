the segments i just referenced to make up approximately 75 % of our business growth in the quarter and represent the balanced portfolio we seek to build .
as mentioned last quarter , our global fac book is well over $ 400 million gross written premium in force , and we see continued growth opportunities there , given favorable market conditions .
year - to - date reinsurance attritional losses are 57.5 % compared to 57 % for the full year 2018 , due predominantly to shift in mix , increased casualty business as well as overall more proportional business to capture the primary rate movements .
investment income was up $ 60 million or 14 % from one year ago .
by year - end , we will be closing in on $ 3 billion of annual gross premium , and as you have seen , the profit picture there remains solid .
after 8 weeks on the job , i 've had the opportunity to start getting deeper into our businesses and to meet our employees , major customers and our key distribution partners in the us and around the world .
we are a top 10 global reinsurer with a 47 - year history .
this result is primarily driven by the growth in invested assets coming from our record cash flow , which was $ 1.5 billion during the first nine months .
our underlying performance continue to be excellent , as our attritional underwriting gain of $ 250 million nearly offset the cat loss .
before moving into taxes , i 'd like to point out that we included for the first time on page 15 in the financial supplement a split of our net investment income between the insurance segment and total reinsurance .
another $ 4 million of the favorable development was identified through reserve studies completed in the third quarter of 2019 .
the 2019 result represents an annualized net income return on equity of 13 % .
at the same time , the supply of reinsurance capital is relatively flat or down considering trapped capital , given that over 50 % of the retro capacity is supported by unrated alternative capital .
we also have an entrepreneurial and growing primary specialty insurance business with a ' client first ' culture of providing solutions with more than 150 products and services .
the increase in shareholders ' equity is primarily attributable to $ 792 million of net income and the recovery in the fair value of the investment portfolio .
higher - than - expected catastrophe losses would cause the tax rate to trend lower than the current 9 % .
