our tax rate , we expect for the year to end up at the mid 20 %s range , we 're actually up 31 % versus 23 % , but we are still thinking we will wind up as we have some tax benefits that we 'll see coming for us in fourth quarter .
for the first six months of 2021 , our sales were up 25 % and gross margins , in absolute terms , were up 24 % .
from a tax perspective , our effective rate increased to 32 % for the second quarter of 2021 as compared to 29 % this time last year .
and second , we have lower borrowings due to debt repayment for 12 months of cash generation from our businesses , offset by some acquisition activity .
overall , gross margin percentage remained strong at 46 % .
with regard to our q2 2021 international sales , we saw increased sales of 10 % and a strong increase in gross margin , which were up 35 % .
so , it 's a huge increase when [ phonetic ] accounted that generally a freighter coming across has about $ 73 million of revenue that now has moved up to $ 420 million of revenue , so quite a big increase .
as you can see from this slide , our operating income was 33 % higher than the level reported for the same period of 2020 .
interest expense , we felt we'd be similar to 2020 , but in fact our interest is down by 30 % .
if , for a moment , we exclude the impact of products and entities acquired since december of 2019 , our base inventory has reduced by 11 % from $ 177 million at that time to $ 158 million this year .
debt to ebitda ratio , we were saying we 're targeting 2 to 2.5 times as we were preparing building inventories for the season .
our current inventory target at the end of the financial year is $ 150 million .
within that overall improvement , our us sales increased by 44 % to $ 84 million and our international sales increased by 10 % to $ 51 million .
accordingly , we paid a deposit of $ 10 million for a product acquisition , and took control of that asset at the start of the third quarter .
our outbound freight costs are almost purely volume driven and were up 34 % .
looking at a 40 % increase per annum to get to that $ 70 million and that $ 140 million , this -- we could have acquisitions that fall into that space , but certainly we 've got acquisitions covered in the other into the core operations .
