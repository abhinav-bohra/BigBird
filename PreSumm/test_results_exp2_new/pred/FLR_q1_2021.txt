as david mentioned , we received a $ 40 million investment in nuscale from jgc this quarter and are anticipating other significant investments in the near future .
our g&a expense in the quarter was $ 66 million .
we are maintaining our adjusted earnings per share guidance of between $ 0.50 and $ 0.80 for the full year .
note here that even though partners are meeting nuscale 's cash needs , we will continue to expense 100 % of this investment on our income statement on a consolidated basis .
this compares favorably to $ 55 million in the first quarter of 2020 .
we are also maintaining our previous segment level guidance and expect 2021 full year segment margins to be approximately 2.5 % to 3.5 % in energy solutions , which excludes any fluctuation from the embedded foreign currency derivative ; 2 % to 3 % in urban solutions ; and 2.5 % to 3 % in mission solutions .
removing nuscale expenses and the effect of the embedded derivative would improve our total segment profit margin to 3.6 % .
this reimbursable 12 - month contract with two six - month options is valued at $ 690 million .
