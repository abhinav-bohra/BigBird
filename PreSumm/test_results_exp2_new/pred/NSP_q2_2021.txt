as for q3 , we are forecasting adjusted ebitda in a range of $ 52 million to $ 62 million and adjusted earnings per share from $ 0.74 to $ 0.93 .
both worksite employees paid from new client sales and net gains from hiring in our client base exceeded our targets and second quarter client retention came in at our historical high levels of 99 % .
we are now forecasting 5.5 % to 6.5 % worksite employee growth for the full year , an improvement over our previous guidance of 4 % to 6 % growth .
in spite of these three factors , we experienced a decline in gross profit of 9 % from q2 of 2020 related to the dynamics associated with the pandemic .
now , another positive outcome in the payroll tax area during q2 was the receipt of $ 11 million of federal payroll tax refunds related to prior years .
as the year began , we were optimistic we would achieve this growth rate by year end or early 2022 , despite the loss of our largest client , which represented just under 3 % of our worksite employee base .
another highlight from our sales organization this quarter was booked sales for our traditional employment solution , workforce acceleration , which achieved 94 % of forecast .
we ended q2 with $ 213 million of adjusted cash and $ 370 million of debt .
we saw some of these effects in our own data this year with average wages and bonuses up 7 % and 44 % respectively .
during the quarter , we repurchased 98,000 shares of stock at a cost of $ 9 million , raised our dividend rate by 12.5 % paying out $ 17 million in cash dividends and invested $ 9 million in capital expenditures .
my optimism for the long - term future is rooted in a different dynamic than i 've seen in the 35 years building our company and industry .
we expect to begin ramping up the number of business performance advisors at a rate of approximately 10 per month and go into 2022 at around 700 bpas across country .
outperformance in paid worksite employees from previous booked sales combined with stronger than expected hiring within the client base and historically high client retention to produce a rapid acceleration in our unit growth ; in fact , paid worksite employees were up 9 % in four months by the end of june over our low point of the year in february .
