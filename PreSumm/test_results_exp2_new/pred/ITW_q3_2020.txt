overall , organic revenue was still down 5 % year - over - year , with north america now 10 % and europe down 5 % .
north america and international organic revenue were both down about 20 % .
as expected , food equipment was the hardest hit segment in the quarter as organic revenue declined 20 % , a significant improvement though from being down 38 % in q2 .
we now expect free cash flow to end the year significantly above $ 2 billion .
at quarter end , we had $ 2.2 billion of cash on hand , no commercial paper , and a $ 2.5 billion undrawn revolving credit facility , tier 1 credit ratings , and total liquidity of more than $ 4.7 billion .
lastly , as we discussed on our last call , we did initiate a few restructuring projects that were part of our 2020 plan pre-pandemic , which will lead to a reduction in operating margins of 150 basis points , to 20.8 % .
the operating flexibility that is core to our 80 /20 front - to - back operating system also applies to our cost structure , which show through in our operating margin performance in q3 .
equipment sales were down 21 % and service was down 17 % .
china , which had already turned positive last quarter at 6 % also improved sequentially and was up 15 % this quarter .
as you can see from the footnote , the reported operating margin of 23.7 % , include a 350 basis points of unfavorable impact from removing a potential divestiture from assets held for sale .
speaking of divestitures , let me make a broader comment on our portfolio management efforts and specifically the 2018 decision to divest seven businesses that we determine no longer fit our enterprise strategy framework , with revenue of approximately $ 1 billion .
we expect that the completion of these divestitures will improve our overall organic growth rate at the enterprise level by approximately 50 basis points and increase enterprise operating margins by 100 basis points .
institutional demand was down about 30 % and restaurants , including qsr were down a little bit more than that .
in addition , after - tax return on invested capital improved to 29.6 % , an all - time high for the company .
despite the negative volume leverage and our decision to stay invested in our key strategic priorities , q3 operating margin was 23.8 % , down only 120 basis points compared to prior year .
as we sit here today , we expect organic revenue for the full year to be down 11 % to 11.5 % , operating margin to be in the range of 22 % to 22.5 % and operating income in the range of $ 2.7 billion to $ 2.8 billion .
