dividend payments in the first quarter totaled about $ 36 million or $ 0.21 per share .
we also paid down our credit facility by a net amount of $ 80 million during the quarter as cash flow generation during the quarter , as i 've said , was very robust .
we also deployed almost $ 6 million toward real estate purchases .
on the continued growth in ebitda , our leverage at the end of the quarter fell below three times to 2.61 times .
finally , we deployed over $ 140 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases .
and the gross profit percentage increased more than 1,500 basis points to nearly 41 % , realizing a 69 % incremental margin .
additionally , we continue planning for the deployment of $ 50 million to $ 100 million toward acquisitions and around $ 50 million in new funeral home construction projects .
this , combined with the capital structure improvements we have made over the last 15 months , are expected to allow us to produce earnings per share , compounded annual growth returns in the low or even potentially mid-teen percentage range for 2022 and 2023 , off of a pre-covid 2019 earnings per share base of $ 1.90 , even while absorbing these temporary pull forward effects .
we are so proud of all 24,000 of our colleagues that have managed through the challenges of the past year and a half .
from a growth capital perspective , we invested about $ 9 million on growth capital toward the new build and expansion of several funeral homes .
our cemetery development capital was almost $ 15 million lower than the prior - year quarter .
we also continue to expect the full - year normalized effective tax rate between 24 % and 25 % .
we were very pleased with the core funeral sales average growth of 0.5 % in the quarter .
total comparable funeral revenues grew $ 109 million or almost 22 % over the same period last year .
the majority of this growth where about $ 85 million was driven by an increase in core velocity or the number of preneed contracts sold .
this was achieved despite a modest 20 basis point increase in the core cremation rate which is well below our typical annual expectation of 100 to 150 basis points .
