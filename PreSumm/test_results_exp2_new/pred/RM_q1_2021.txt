as illustrated on page 4 , branch originations were comparable to prior year as we ended first quarter , originating 169.7 million of loans .
to that end , we are happy to announce an increase of our quarterly dividend by 25 % to $ 0.25 per share .
as of march 31 , approximately 70 % of our total portfolio had been originated since april 2020 .
we generated net income of 25.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $ 2.31 , resulting from our growth initiatives , stable operating expenses , lower funding costs , and strong credit .
sequentially , interest in field and total revenue yield decreased 80 and 90 basis points , respectively .
turning to page 7 , total revenue grew 2 % to 97.7 million .
at the end of april , we saw 30 - plus day delinquencies dropped further to a record low of approximately 3.7 % .
the third round of $ 1,400 stimulus checks led to a temporary period of higher loan payment activity along with some weakening of loan demand .
our large loan portfolio actually grew sequentially in the first quarter by $ 4 million or 0.6 % as the stimulus measures disproportionately impacted our higher - rate small loan portfolio .
we plan to open 15 to 20 net new branches in 2021 .
for 2021 , we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 25 % .
our allowance includes a 23.8 million reserve for additional credit losses associated with covid - 19 .
loan demand remained relatively soft in april due to the impact of the distribution of the remaining 20 % of stimulus payments along with additional tax refunds .
net credit loss is roughly 80 basis points from the fourth quarter .
page 13 is a reminder of our strong funding profile .
we purchased a total of 300 million of interest rate caps since the beginning of the pandemic at a libor strike price range of 25 to 50 basis points .
