this is greater than a 50 % improvement when compared to our program average .
you can see on the map there over one million acres , predominantly in the midland basin , 920,000 and 100,000 acres in the delaware .
if you take that just for the remainder of the year , we plan to run with the addition of doublepoint , 24 to 26 rigs and seven to nine frac fleets .
pioneer will move to second place next year , moving over 4 , and then moving up to the top spot above devon .
and longer term , as we think about reducing our growth rate from 30 % down to 5 % , we can drive that down to three to four rigs as we are consistent with our 5 % growth plan over the long term .
and the primary driver is really just our low -- our margins in the high 20s , our low - cost basis in addition to the fact that we 're paying out 75 % of our cash flow versus devon 's 50 % .
this will take our midland basin on up to over 900,000 net acres .
and what this allows us to do , is we 've successfully drilled longer laterals out to 15,000 feet , really up from the 9,000 to 10,000 feet that we 've been drilling at , really allow for a lot of locations that we can drill longer laterals on , which is much more capital efficient and really adding essentially the same production by drilling fewer wells .
we refinanced those on a weighted average base well under 2 % .
we are forecasting g&a per boe to be around $ 1.15 to $ 1.20 by year - end .
we 've also , and joey will talk more about this , successfully tested simulfrac on our acreage during the first quarter , and we 're seeing significant savings like the industry -- other industry participants in that $ 200,000 to $ 300,000 per well .
on g&a , we 've accomplished $ 100 million of parsley savings .
and going into 2022 , the company will be over 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day just in the permian basin in 2022 .
they 're showing them leading this year at 7 % .
i think what 's key is that when you look at the current stock price , our dividend yield will move up from 1.5 % to over 4 % in 2022 and over 8 % in the following years to 2026 .
i do have to have a call out for devon and rig 's great slide , comparing their dividend to peers , i think we 're in there around 1.5 % toward the bottom quartile .
