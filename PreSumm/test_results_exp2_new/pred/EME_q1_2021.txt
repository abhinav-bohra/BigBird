consolidated revenues of $ 2.3 billion are up a modest $ 4.2 million or 20 basis points over quarter one 2020 .
and as expected , we had a significant decline in revenues of over 35.3 % in our industrial services segment , which was impacted not only by industry conditions but also the texas freeze , which in many cases , pushed out our turnaround schedule into the second quarter of 2021 .
this segment 's results additionally benefited by $ 9.5 million as a result of the strengthening of the pound sterling , given the lifting of uncertainty around the terms of the united kingdom 's trade deal with the european union that became effective on january 1 , 2021 .
on a positive note , this segment was able to partially offset these negative headwinds with a nearly 21 % reduction in first quarter selling , general and administrative expenses due to certain cost savings initiatives enacted in calendar year 2020 .
our u.s. building services team had an exceptional quarter , earning 5 % operating income margins on 10.3 % revenue growth .

u.k. building services operating income of $ 9.4 million or 7.4 % of revenues represents an improvement of $ 3.6 million and 230 basis points of operating margin expansion over 2020 's first quarter .

our total u.s. construction business is reporting $ 105.2 million of operating income and a 7.7 % operating margin .
additionally , operating income for the quarter benefited from approximately $ 800,000 of favorable foreign exchange rate movement .
all but $ 15 million of that is organic growth .
however , more representative of what we are now experiencing in this segment , rpos grew $ 60 million or up 10 % from december 31 .
it jumped over 50 , which is expansion territory in february and was over 55 in march .
