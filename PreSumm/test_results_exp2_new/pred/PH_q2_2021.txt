if you look at the breakdown of adjustments for the fy ' 22 or excuse me fy ' 21 , as reported numbers it netted to $ 0.03 this quarter , and that is made up in the following buckets , business realignment expenses of $ 0.14 , integration cost to achieve of $ 0.02 , acquisition - related amortization expense of $ 0.62 , and as we communicated last quarter , we are adjusting out the gain on the sale of land that amounted to $ 0.77 .
and what 's interesting about this list with the exception of international distribution , these are all new with win strategy 3.0 .
we generated $ 3.44 this quarter and that compares to $ 2.98 last year .
there is no changes to what we have communicated previously , our full - year forecast will generate savings of $ 250 million and that will be $ 210 million incremental .
international distribution is going to continue from the success we 've had with 2.0 .
the decline was partially offset by the contributions from acquisitions , that was 2.6 % and currency impact of 1 % .
we are now forecasting for the full year that discretionary total will increase to $ 225 million or an increase of $ 50 million .
operating margins for the second quarter was 18 % versus last year 's 20.2 % , this resulted in a detrimental margin of 28.8 % , which is in line with our expectations , and really the result of all the previous actions we 've taken to realign the aerospace business to current market conditions , along with strong cost controls and really helping to offset the pandemic imposed to the mix that we 're seeing from the commercial and military businesses .
tom already mentioned this , but our operating cash flow activities increased 64 % year - over - year to a record of $ 1.35 billion of cash , this is an impressive 20.4 % of sales .
you can see the significant improvement versus prior 230 basis points .
so on the left hand side , it 's a series of portfolio things that you 've seen us make transforming the portfolio company buying three great companies , $ 3 billion of acquired revenue we 're all accretive on growth , cash margins .
if we want to just focus on orders , real quick moving to slide 22 , our orders came in at flat this year or this quarter i should say and that was really driven by plus 1 % and our industrial north american businesses plus 10 % in our diversified industrial businesses and minus 18 % on a 12 month basis in aerospace .
this 250 basis point improvement reflects all the positive impacts from our win strategy initiatives , the hard work and dedication to cost containment and productivity improvements , as well as savings from those realignment activities , i just spoke off and really performance of the recent acquisition .
the output of what we 're trying to do here is that we want our pbi context the percent of sales to grow by 600 basis points over the next five years and more innovative portfolio , better chances to grow , better margins etc .
so the easy way to remember this is , is the quarter we put up 320's and we happen to highlight them in gold , so greater than 20 % ebitda margin , cfoa margin and segment operating margin , so we 're pretty proud of that .
top quartile safety performance , we had a 23 % reduction in recordable incidents this now makes 75 % reduction for the last five years , which has been phenomenal .
