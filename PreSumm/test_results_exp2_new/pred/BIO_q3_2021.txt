total amortization expense related to acquisitions recorded in sg&a for the quarter was $ 2.4 million versus $ 2.3 million in q3 of 2020 .
following the end of the quarter , we completed the acquisition of dropworks for approximately $ 125 million in cash .
the non-gaap effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was 18 % compared to 22.5 % for the same period in 2020 .
full year non-gaap operating margin is forecasted to be about 19.5 % versus prior guidance of 19 % .
in cost of goods sold , we have excluded $ 4.7 million of amortization of purchased intangibles , $ 4.1 million in ip license costs associated with the debt royalty payment and a small restructuring cost .
we see dropworks as accelerating bio - rad 's entry into the lower - end segment of the digital pcr business and allow for expansion in the $ 2.5 billion to $ 3 billion qpcr segment , thereby significantly increasing the opportunity for our ddpcr platforms .
we have also excluded certain items below the operating line , which are the increase in value of the sartorius equity holdings of $ 4.869 billion and about a $ 2 million loss associated with venture investments .
we estimate that covid - 19 - related sales were about $ 57 million in the quarter as we continue to benefit from spikes in demand in geographies where new outbreaks have occurred .
the cumulative sum of these non-gaap adjustments result in moving the quarterly operating margin from 21 % on a gaap basis to 19.4 % on a non-gaap basis .
excluding the back royalties , the q3 year - over - year currency - neutral revenue growth was 9 % .
