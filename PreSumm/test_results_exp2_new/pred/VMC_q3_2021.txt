asphalt volume declined by 8 % as volume growth in california was more than offset by lower arizona volumes due to extremely wet weather .

even with these headwinds , we improved our aggregate cash gross profit per ton by 3 % and to $ 7.74 .
unit diesel prices were up over 50 % , leading to $ 14 million of additional expense .
