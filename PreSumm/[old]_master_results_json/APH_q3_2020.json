of - the - year seasonality .", "and for the full year 2020 , we expect sales to be roughly flat with prior year .", "and this reflects the pandemic - related disruptions we experienced in certain geographies , offset by increased investments by our customers in support of higher bandwidth demand .", "now , turning to our outlook for the future , while our performance in the third quarter was very strong , there still remain significant uncertainties in the global market related to the covid -
