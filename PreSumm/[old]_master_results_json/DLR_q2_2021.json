level operating expenses that have been deferred due to covid , along with an uptick in g&a expense as we return to the office and resume a more normal travel schedule .", "so your model should reflect these higher costs .", "last , but certainly not least , let 's turn to the balance sheet on page 13 .", "as you may recall , we closed on the sale of a portfolio of noncore assets in europe for $ 680 million late in the first quarter , which impacted second quarter adjusted ebitda to the tune of approximately $ 10 million .", "as a result , net debt to adjusted ebitda was slightly elevated 6 x as of the end of the second quarter but is expected to come back down in line with our long - term range over the course of the year through a combination of proceeds from asset sales and growth in cash flows as signed leases commence .", "fixed charge coverage ticked down slightly , also reflecting the near - term impact from asset sales , but remains well above our target and close to an all - time high at 5.4x , reflecting the results of our proactive liability management .", "we continue to execute our financial strategy of maximizing the menu of available capital options while minimizing the related costs and extending the duration of our liabilities to match our long -
