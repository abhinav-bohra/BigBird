over - year growth in adjusted ebitda versus the expectation we shared with you in february that it could easily be down versus 2020 .", "looking ahead to our full year 2021 expectations , we expect that our 2021 adjusted ebitda will be at or above $ 220 million .", "i said last quarter that we 'll listen closely at our 2019 adjusted ebitda of $ 265 million before the pandemic as the best available benchmark for how our business is recovering as well as backing out our estimate that the 2020 impact of the pandemic was roughly $ 40 million to $ 50 million .", "if you look at the first quarter of 2021 , our adjusted ebitda of $ 45 million was still below the first quarter of 2019 .", "and when we reported -- and that 's when we also reported $ 50 million in adjusted ebitda .", "and when you exclude the roughly $ 4 million in contribution from the cares fund we recorded this quarter , we were roughly 18 % below q1 2019 .", "so while i 'm certainly pleased with our results , it 's still clear that we 're not back to normal and , in fact , that our first quarter results reflect a similar run rate of covid impact to what we experienced last year .", "i do n't think this should be surprising , given the unique nature of the services we provide and the time led of this covid impact and since much of our patient volume is based on pregnancies and trial birth timing .", "lastly , i 'll add that our operating results for the past two quarters have been unusually volatile .", "so we 're also mindful of the still uncertain nature of how fast or consistently we 'll see things recover .", "now i 've talked for a couple of quarters about my confidence that we can achieve a run rate of $ 270 million in adjusted ebitda once we move past the impact of covid - 19 pandemic .", "our results bolster our confidence that we will reach and exceed that run rate .", "but i 'm not confident just because we saw better trends over the past couple of months .", "i 'm confident because we continue to push our operating plans and because we are reshaping how we do things here .", "our singular focus at mednax is to reinforce our position as the formal provider of women's and children 's healthcare in the markets we serve and to do so efficiently and as the best partner we can be to the patients we serve as well as to the payers and health systems we work with .", "so let me talk about what we 've been focused on and speak to you about our core pediatrix and obstetrix .", "it 's all about the patient .", "since mednax first began caring for mothers and babies in their most challenging times about 40 years ago , the only absolute imperative that our founder and board member , dr. medel , prescribed has been take great care of the patient .", "much of my time is spent with our clinicians , hospital partners , prospective partners , and of course , with my team .", "and i can attest to this unwavering commitment .", "there 's an unshakable conviction at mednax that we always take great care of the patients , everything else will follow .", "now that 's easier said than done .", "to take the best care of the patients , the mothers , babies and children required a lot of work and investment .", "first , we have to recruit and retain the finest physicians and clinicians .", "second , to do this , we try to provide more support for our affiliated clinicians than anyone else in our field .", "third , we have a foremost independent research organization in our field of medicine , including complex newborn screenings .", "one in four babies in the u.s. are patients of ours .", "we have more knowledge and data in these areas than anyone else .", "and since our care is provided , of course , at a very local level , we have to provide more support for our affiliated clinicians in each market where we are than anyone else .", "finally , we must always lead in our field .", "for example , one of the most critical and active parts of our organization is our clinical support group .", "this grew along with our full support team , make sure that we can continue to advance our skill and knowledge for the sake of our patients .", "in two weeks , as we did even during the depth of the pandemic last year , we will be holding our annual medical directors meeting , where over 2,000 clinicians will actively participate and will learn from research , quality and clinical experts .", "on top of these areas , we provide system support , recruiting support and every other kind of health to allow our clinicians to , again , take great care of the patients .", "this long -

by - market approach that 's driven by local intelligence and relationships .", "we 've also added resources to this team to make sure that we 're highly integrated , not just in intensifying and winning new business but providing services quickly and seamlessly to the partners who put their trust in us and in pediatrics affiliated physicians .", "in my view , we 've lapped until now two other major ingredients to propel us forward .", "first , our patient relationships have not extended path to our subspecialty practices .", "we need to make sure as well as we can that when a patient needs to see a physician in our network , they can do so as quickly as easily as possible .", "we 're moving forward in pediatric urgent care to develop plans for expansion of their business in markets where we have a significant presence , and we will expand with our brand name pediatrics .", "we believe that providing pediatric primary and urgent care and patient -

over - year .", "we recorded about $ 8 million in revenue from the provided relief fund established by the cares act during the quarter .", "overall , same unit revenue increased by 2.5 % year - over - year , or 3.6 % after excluding the additional calendar day in february 2020 for the 2020 leap year .", "same unit volumes declined 2.5 % year - over - year or 1.4 % adjusted for the leap year , compared to a 6.6 % year - over - year decline in the 2020 fourth quarter .", "first , as mark mentioned , patient volumes improved throughout the quarter , such that we saw same unit growth in march across all of our service lines with the exception of picu and pediatric hospitalist services .", "second , our nicu days for the quarter as a whole were down slightly more than total births at the hospitals where we provide nicu coverage .", "this reflects a modest year - over - year decline in average length of stay , partially offset by a year - over - year increase in the rate of admission .", "i know that the rate of admission was an area of interest for many of you following our fourth quarter release .", "so i 'll point out that in q1 , our admit rate reverted to its historical level after being modestly lower through the latter part of 2020 .", "lastly , i 'd like to address our 2021 volume relative to 2019 .", "our first quarter same unit volume was down approximately 3 % as compared to the same period in 2019 , with hospital - based volume down to a greater degree than office - based volume .", "we 'll continue to look at this two year comparison throughout this year since it 's likely that comparisons to 2020 will not be relevant based on the pandemic - related disruptions we experienced last year .", "on the pricing side , we had a couple of favorable items in addition to our usual rate growth , which has been typically in the 1 % to 2 % range based on managed care and administrative fee revenues .", "first , the cares revenue we recorded added little under 2 % to our pricing growth .", "on the expense side , our practice level , salary , wage and benefit expense was up by $ 2.7 million or about 85 basis points year - over - year .", "this increase mostly reflects variable incentive compensation tied to practice level revenues , partially offset by a decrease in malpractice expense , which was higher in 2020 .", "our g&a expense was down nearly $ 1 million year - over - year , despite incurring approximately $ 5 million of costs related to transitional services we provided to the buyers of our anesthesia and radiology medical groups .", "the reimbursement for those expenses is reflected in our investment and other income line item .", "so there 's minimal impact to our adjusted ebitda , but those costs do inflate our reported g&a expense .", "in the near term , i 'll note that while the radiology psa arrangement has concluded , we do anticipate that we 'll continue providing services under our anesthesiology psa , at least through the second quarter of this year .", "so you should expect a similar expense and reimbursement dynamic in the second quarter .", "we expect to wind down the anesthesiology psa services sometime after the second quarter , at which point we 'll also be able to begin winding down the expenses we 're incurring and move toward that future state expectation for g&a .", "again , there may be some period of time when we 're still incurring some of those expenses but not being reimbursed for them .", "lastly , our balance sheet reflects our reduced leverage profile and strong liquidity position .", "we ended the quarter with $ 270 million in cash and net debt of $ 730 million , implying leverage just north of three times .", "and i think we are ready to take questions ."], "summary_gold": "q1 same store sales rose 2.5 percent .<q>during 2021 q1 , mednax 's operations were negatively impacted by reductions in patient volumes and revenue from covid -
