home tissue demand remained elevated during the quarter .", "we continue to believe that this is being driven by the shift from away from home to at - home consumption , as many people continue to work and learn from home .", "we noted on our previous earning call that because of these consumption changes , we were seeing retail sales per iri panel data stabilize at above pre-covid levels .", "in the third quarter that resulted in low double - digit retail sales growth relative to the 2019 quarter .", "we expect that year - over - year increase had continued to moderate as retailers replenished their inventories , consumers de-stocked their pantries and people adjust to living with the pandemic .", "our industry view remains largely the same , so i will summarize in a few key points to provide some context .", "first , recall that the market for tissue in the us is traditionally two - third at - home and one - third away - from - home .", "many states economies began to reopen , which we believe drove some of the normalization and demand in the third quarter .", "we expect continued uncertainty associated with these reopening and travel patterns , making it challenging to predict demand drivers for these end markets during the next few quarters .", "it is also difficult to predict what a new normal might look like as the pandemic eventually subsides .", "second , while it is too early to discern trends on branded share relative to private branded share .", "we are noticing the paper towel demand is tracking ahead of the overall tissue category while facial demand is lagging .", "we will continue to monitor these trends in the coming months and quarters due to the continued uncertainty in consumer demand associated with covid .", "third , as we noted last quarter , sku rationalization has occurred , creating additional production .", "we believe that lower sku counts benefit both retailers and manufacturers like us .", "while we have seen some customers desiring a recovery of skus , we do not anticipate sku counts to go back to pre-covid levels in the near to medium term .", "our tissue results in the third quarter were robust .", "we shipped 14.5 million cases , which was up around 10 % compared to the third quarter of 2019 , but down 9 % over the second quarter of 2020 , as expected .", "we continue to execute for our customers and are pleased with production efficiency and fixed cost leverage achieved .", "we have largely replenished inventories throughout the supply chain and are seeing in - stock conditions improve .", "in addition , to meet peak demand during the pandemic , we believe that some of our customers need short - term commitments to alternative suppliers and tertiary brands to meet demand , including imported products .", "as a result , we believe that these customers have greater than normal inventory levels in several product categories that they are now working to reduce .", "we have also adjusted our sales and customer mix over the last six months to better position our business for growth in a long - run .", "that has led us to exit several customers to reduce complexity and improve our network .", "while we have a robust pipeline of new business for next year , these strategic moves are expected to have a volume drag in the next couple of quarters .", "mike will further address the impact of these trends on our businesses and financial outlook section of our discussion .", "as you recall , we estimate that approximately two - thirds of paperboard demand is derived from products that are more recession - resilient and one - third is driven by more economically sensitive or discretionary products .", "our business including customer demand has been stable despite economic uncertainties .", "our folding carton customers , especially those with exposure to food and healthcare packaging continue to see strong demand and our foodservice customers , especially those with exposure to quick service restaurants and away - from - home dining , as well as commercial printers continue to see weaker demand .", "our exposure to diverse end - market segments helped provide stability for our order book in the quarter .", "we did not have a planned major maintenance outage in the third quarter of 2020 like we did in 2019 , which drove improved operations .", "our current sales backlogs are consistent with previous years , indicating stable demand .", "while we 're encouraged by our solid performance in the quarter , we 're navigating through some uncertain market conditions .", "on our last earnings call , we introduced the remagine brand of sbs folding carton paperboard with up to 30 % post -

over - year price impacts .", "we are benefiting from the volume increases related to the production ramp which helped to meet elevated demand .", "overall fixed cost leverage from increased production , lower input costs and improved mix positively impacted our tissue business in the third quarter of 2020 , relative to the third quarter of 2019 .", "you can review a comparison of our third quarter 2020 performance relative to the second quarter of 2020 on slide 16 in the appendix .", "slide 10 contains some additional context to the outstanding performance in our tissue business and we are building off the data we shared last quarter .", "the slide contains iri panel data , which is a snapshot of retail sales of tissue measured in dollars .", "the line shows monthly change on a year - over - year basis while the data on the box shows a quarterly view versus last year .", "it is estimated that $ 1 retail sales grew 34 % in the first quarter , 23 % in the second quarter and 12 % in the third quarter .", "you can see in the data that pantry loading phenomenon at the end of the first and beginning of second quarters , that has given away to a more stable demand picture for our retail customers .", "during our last quarter 's call , we anticipated the iri panel data to be up in the 10 % to 15 % range in the third quarter and it was close to 12 % .", "in the fourth quarter , we would expect year -

over - year adjusted ebitda comparison for our paperboard business .", "lower pricing reflected in macy 's reported price decrease in february was partially offset by favorable mix .", "the absence of a planned major maintenance outage at our idaho mill was also a major driver of year -

related weakness , our portfolio of customers and end - market segment exposure continues to position us well through the end of october .", "if assumptions around demand as well as largely stable prices and raw material inputs hold , we would anticipate fourth quarter adjusted ebitda to be in the range of $ 52 million to $ 62 million .", "this range also assumes that we continue to operate our assets without significant covid -
