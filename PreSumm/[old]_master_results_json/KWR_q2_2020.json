q following our q1 update to address the evolving covid - 19 - related issues and these risk factors should be reviewed along with those in our 2019 form 10 - k .", "reconciliations are provided in the appendix of this investor deck .", "we followed a similar review format for this deck as the one we used during our last couple of calls post combination where our comparison periods show actual and non-gaap results as well as pro forma sales and pro forma adjusted ebitda as if we had been combined with houghton throughout the periods presented .", "so please see slides 6 through 8 now while i review some highlights .", "as mike noted , the precipitous decline in volumes we began to see in the latter half of march continued into april .", "we expected april to be the trough in volumes , and it was with slightly better performance in may , and in june , we saw more meaningful improvement in volumes and performance as mike mentioned .", "so , while our actual sales are up significantly to $ 286 million in q2 compared to $ 206 million in the prior year , this is due to the inclusion of houghton and norman hay .", "on a pro forma basis , including houghton in q2 of last year , net sales declined about 27 % .", "most of this decline was due to the covid - 19 impact on volumes .", "but we also saw a negative foreign exchange impact on the top line of about 4 % , due primarily to the significant weakening of the brazilian real , the mexican peso and the rmb versus the dollar .", "these negative impacts were partially offset by the inclusion of norman hay .", "our gross margin of 34 % for q2 was down from 36.5 % in the prior year quarter , which we attribute primarily to the steep decline in volumes and the related impact on fixed manufacturing costs .", "as mike mentioned , we realized meaningful procurement synergies in the quarter and our product margins were up approximately 2 % , which was masked by the impact of fixed manufacturing costs on our significantly lower volumes .", "as volumes pick up , we expect the benefits to our gross margin to be more visible and fall to the bottom line .", "the drag from covid is also evident in our non-gaap operating income of $ 11.2 million compared to $ 25.5 million in q2 of ' 19 and $ 36 million in q1 of 2020 .", "similarly , our non-gaap earnings per share of $ 0.21 was down from $ 1.56 in q2 of last year and $ 1.35 sequentially .", "our effective tax rate in the current quarter was 57.9 % compared to 24.2 % in q2 of last year .", "this quarter 's elevated rate was primarily driven by an adjustment to tax reserves related to certain tax credits we acquired with houghton and also to an adjustment relating to certain foreign tax audits .", "excluding all unusual items , we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2020 will be in the range of 22 % to 25 % .", "as mike mentioned earlier , our q2 adjusted ebitda $ 32.1 million is in line with our guidance at roughly half of our q1 adjusted ebitda of $ 60.5 million .", "and we continue to expect our full - year adjusted ebitda will be more than $ 200 million .", "with the decline in adjusted ebitda , our net leverage has picked up about 0.2 times to 3.7 times on a reported basis and 3.1 times on a bank calculated basis , which is still comfortably below our bank covenant of 4.25 times .", "we stress tested our projections for this year under multiple scenarios as mike mentioned and expect no problem in remaining in compliance with our bank covenants .", "and we have strong liquidity to support these uncertain times .", "in addition , we 're benefiting from the current low interest rate environment as the average interest rate on our debt is now about 1.9 % as compared to 2.4 % at march 31 .", "a bright spot in the quarter was our cash flow .", "we 're pleased to report that our operating cash flow doubled year - to - date to $ 44.7 million versus first half of last year of $ 22.4 million .", "in addition , our q2 operating cash flow of $ 24.5 million exceeded the prior quarter of $ 20.2 million .", "this positive cash flow trend is primarily due to improved working capital .", "as we 've discussed in the past , the company has a very asset - light business model where the majority of capital deployed is in working capital and not in property , plant and equipment .", "when general economic or industry crisis occur and stress sales , we generate cash through the release of working capital .", "we saw this in the 2008 - 2009 crisis , and we are seeing it now .", "in addition , our low capital intensity allows us flexibility in our capex spending and we 're on pace to reduce capex by about 30 % from our initial combined company estimates as we mentioned last quarter .", "as mike mentioned , it was a tough quarter .", "but we 're encouraged by some positive trends in business performance and the increase in cash flow i just mentioned , as well as the $ 12 million of cost synergies realized this quarter .", "in addition , the increase in total synergies we expect to realize this year , which is up from $ 35 million to $ 53 million and the disciplined cost reduction actions we 've taken will help mitigate the impact this difficult economic and business environment .", "in summary , our track record of weathering tough economic environments through gaining share , cost reductions , and generating good cash flow during major downturn , all give us confidence in our ability to weather the storm .", "more importantly , we 've positioned our company need to leverage the future upswing in business activity when it occurs ."], "summary_gold": "q2 sales $ 286 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $ 290.4 million .<q>q2 non -gaap earnings per share $ 0.21 excluding items .<q>affirms full year 2020 guidance of more than $ 200 million of adjusted ebitda .", "summary_pred": "for us , our top priority is to protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers , while ensuring our business continuity to meet our customers ' requirements .<q>all of our 34 plants around the world are operating and we are satisfying all of our customer needs .<q>i am very proud of what the quaker houghton team has done to continue servicing our customers as well as continuing with our integration effort , which has not missed a beat .<q>a great deal has changed in the world in 2020 with the covid -
