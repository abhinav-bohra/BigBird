over - year basis , the claim and expense ratios also remained relatively consistent .", "fourth quarter claims ratio however trended lower and the expense ratio ticked upward and that 's primarily due to a mix of business shift toward the title operation , which as you can see operates with a lower loss and higher expense ratio .", "turning now to the balance sheet .", "total cash and invested assets increased by 10.2 % to $ 14.5 billion at the end of 2019 .", "the change was driven by a combination of strong operating cash flow , which totaled $ 936 million for 2019 , as well as substantial unrealized market appreciation for both the fixed income and equity portfolios .", "composition of the portfolio remains relatively consistent compared to year - end 2018 , whereby 72 % is allocated to cash and bonds and the remaining 28 % to equities .", "and that portfolio continues to focus on high quality long - term dividend paying companies .", "on a consolidated basis , claim reserves developed without significant favorable or unfavorable development for the 2019 period , and that 's compared to favorable development for 2018 's fourth quarter and full year of 2.4 percentage point and 1.4 percentage point respectively .", "old republic book value per share increased to $ 19.98 , up 16 % for the year .", "inclusive of our regular quarterly dividends and the $ 1 per share special dividend that was paid in the third quarter of last year .", "the total return on beginning book value amounted to just a little bit above 26 % .", "that special dividend was evaluated in light of capital adequacy and liquidity needs , along with the anticipation of withdrawing capital from our run -off mortgage guaranty operations .", "i will say with regulatory approval , we currently expect to receive a return of capital totaling $ 150 million from this run off business during the course of 2020 .", "looking ahead , with respect to our mi operations , we continue to proceed along the lines that we 've previously disclosed .", "we said that the options available to us include a continued profitable run-off of the business over the next several years or alternatively a reactivation of the business under new ownership or finally a reinsurance of the remaining book of enforced policies .", "we continue to assess all of our options in the interest of producing the most beneficial long - term outcome for all stakeholders .", "so overall old republic 's balance sheet remains in very strong condition , is well capitalized , and is well positioned for future growth .", "so with that i 'm going to turn things over to craig for some additional commentary .", "so as the results karl covered demonstrate our strategic diversification between our title insurance business and our general insurance business works very well for us .", "the uncorrelated nature of these two businesses help produce steadier earnings for ori overall which is underscored by some of the figures karl referenced .", "i 'll reiterate a few of those .", "95.1 composite ratio , the 10.8 % return on equity , the 16 % increase in book value per share and including dividends a total return on book value of 26 % , all for the 2019 year .", "so specific to the general insurance group , as the release indicates and as we show in the financial supplement , the group 's mid-single - digit growth quarter - to - quarter and year - over - year in both net premiums earned and in total operating revenues .", "quarter - over - quarter operating income was relatively flat while year - over - year operating income was up 1.7 % .", "net premiums earned in commercial auto rose by 6 % year - over - year and this mostly reflects the positive effect of the rate increases that we 've been achieving in this line that currently stand in the high teens for the 2019 year .", "however premiums have been somewhat offset by a decline in the exposure base due to lower us freight shipments in 2019 compared to 2018 .", "as can be seen in the financial supplement , workers ' compensation experienced a 1.9 % drop in net premiums earned year - over - year .", "and this is mostly resulting from rate decreases .", "and for 2019 , those are in the low single - digit and those rate decreases correspond with lower claim frequency trends that we 've seen in the past several years .", "quarter - over - quarter the group 's overall composite ratio rose slightly to 98.8 from 98.5 , while year - over - year it stands at 97.5 for 2019 compared to 97.2 for 2018 .", "the group 's fourth quarter expense ratio came in at 25.8 % , while the full year 2019 expense ratio came in at 25.7 % up from 25 % in 2018 .", "this higher expense ratio in 2019 is largely due to differences in the mix of business .", "for example , workers compensation , ratings as we just spoke about are less than they were and that typically comes with a lower commission rate .", "so that 's what we mean by differences due to mix of business .", "turning to claim ratios , our fourth quarter commercial auto claim ratio came in at an elevated 91.3 % , with the year - over - year ratio coming in at 84 % .", "the systemic increases in claims severity trend in the us commercial auto line continue .", "these are from the same underlying causes that we 've spoken about now for several quarters .", "and we will continue to respond through rate increases , risk selection accompanied with better levels of technology to help us in that risk selection and we 'll continue to perfect this until such time , we see this claim ratio come back in the line with our target , which remains in the low 70s .", "turning to workers compensation , the fourth quarter claim ratio declined to 57.4 % from 67.5 % quarter - over - quarter .", "and year - over - year this claim ratio declined from 70.7 % in 2018 to 63.2 % in 2019 .", "and obviously , we remain very pleased with this is improving result in workers compensation .", "general liability experienced an elevated claim ratio quarter - over - quarter and year - over - year , but as is the case we have said in the past we write less premium in this line of coverage .", "so results tend to be more lumpy , more volatile quarter - to - quarter and year - to - year .", "for commercial auto workers ' comp and gl combined , given that we typically provide these coverages together to an account , the quarter - over - quarter claim ratio increased by 2.2 percentage points , while year - over - year this claim ratio held relatively steady .", "still looking at the financial supplement , we note that financial indemnity claim ratio quarter - over - quarter and year - over - year dropped significantly , coming back in the line with our targets .", "and we think this improvement reflects actions that we 've taken to address the higher incident of guaranteed asset protection , gap claims as well as the higher incidence of d&o claims that we experienced over the last few years .", "and as we spoke about in prior quarters , we were taking some fairly aggressive action in those regards .", "all of the claim ratios we report of course , we are inclusive of favorable and unfavorable development , and in the latest quarter we saw unfavorable development of 2.9 percentage points mostly resulting from commercial auto .", "while year - to - date , the development was unfavorable by 0.4 percentage points .", "so again speaking for the general insurance group , we continually seek to selectively grow our business , make investments to sustain long - term growth and profitability while proactively responding to loss trends that we 're seeing .", "underwriting profitability remains paramount and there is a keen focus on improving our claim ratios , particularly our commercial auto claim ratio .", "so on this note , i 'll turn the discussion over to you , rande for comments on ori title insurance group .", "in the fourth quarter , we set an all -
