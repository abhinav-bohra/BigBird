over - year to $ 118.9 million in the third quarter .", "this was supported by cloud revenue growth within the segment of 26 % year - over - year .", "one item to keep in mind going into the fourth quarter is that we expect our c&i revenue to be down year - over - year due to a timing issue associated with revenue recognition from a public sector client that benefited us in the fourth quarter of 2020 as well as some runoff of traditional infrastructure work that 's not part of how we 're planning to grow this business .", "we still expect c&i to be the fastest -

over - year .", "this growth was helped by higher license revenue than expected in part due to a contract being renewed for a longer duration than initially anticipated .", "i think the fact that clients are signing eight year agreements for clearpath forward operating system is a testament to the strength of the solution and the modernization roadmap that supports this offering .", "ecs services revenue grew 1 % year - over - year .", "as we 've previously noted , we had expected the third quarter to be the lightest of the year in terms of license revenue , which we still expect to be split approximately 55 % and 45 % between the first and second half of the year .", "this software renewal cadence is as expected and actually de-risks the fourth quarter as ecs license revenue is more evenly distributed throughout the year , with a lot less reliance on fourth quarter signs .", "as a reminder , the prior year first half / second half split was 40 % -- 60 % , with 40 % of the full year segment revenue coming in the fourth quarter .", "we expect overall 2021 ecs revenue to be roughly flat year -

over - year to $ 141.3 million .", "as a result of all of this , the total company revenue was down 1.5 % year - over - year in the third quarter to $ 488 million .", "as i noted , though , this does not change our expectations for revenue for the full year as this quarterly cadence was anticipated and was embedded in our guidance , as was our expectation for year - over - year decline in the fourth quarter revenue due to the timing issues i mentioned , which is why we 're reaffirming that guidance at 0 % to 2 % year - over - year revenue growth .", "the company backlog was impacted by the continued shift of our mix of business toward higher growth and higher - margin solutions and the exiting of some nonstrategic contracts .", "additionally , during 2021 , we have seen the duration of contracts and backlog shortening as it did in 2020 and 2019 .", "as a result , total company backlog was $ 3 billion as of the end of the third quarter relative to $ 3.3 billion as of the end of the prior quarter .", "type of solutions that we are shifting our mix toward are less capital - intensive and have a shorter implementation timeframe , which we expect will lead this backlog to convert to revenue more quickly than it has in the past .", "this is supported by year - over - year increase in acv that peter noted .", "of the $ 3 billion in backlog , we expect approximately $ 380 million will convert into revenue in the fourth quarter .", "third quarter total company gross profit was up year - over - year , and gross profit margin was up year - over - year as well .", "these results were supported by year - over - year improvements in c&i and ecs gross margins .", "c&i gross profit increased 116.3 % year - over - year to $ 9.3 million , and gross margin improved 410 basis points to 7.8 % , driven by the improvements to margin in both cloud and traditional infrastructure work .", "ecs gross profit increased 28.8 % year - over - year to $ 97 million , and gross margin improved 1,360 basis points to 65 % , helped by the higher revenue i mentioned earlier .", "dws gross profit was $ 16.8 million relative to $ 21.6 million in the prior year period , largely driven by the flow - through impact of lower revenue .", "dws gross margin was 11.9 % relative to 14.6 % in the prior year period .", "as with revenue , our year - to - date non-gaap operating profit margin results are roughly in line with internal expectations , and accordingly , we 're reaffirming our full year 2021 guidance for this metric at 9 % to 10 % .", "sg&a expense increased year - over - year in the quarter , largely due to increased investments in our go - to - market efforts , primarily related to direct sales support and increases in noncash - based compensation .", "as a result , total company non-gaap operating profit margin was 5.7 % relative to 8.6 % in the prior year period .", "we anticipated additional investments in our go - to - market efforts over the next few quarters to support our growth strategy , increased awareness of our enhanced solution portfolio and within the context of a highly competitive labor market across the it services industry , increased compensation to retain and attract top talent , we need to maximize our growth strategy .", "based on this , we expect to be toward the lower end of the non-gaap operating profit margin guidance i just mentioned .", "consistent with our discussions over the last couple of quarters , i 'm pleased to report that we 've concluded our cost optimization program , and it is now fully underpinned .", "the annualized savings associated with this program are at the high end of the targeted range we provided , which was $ 130 million to $ 160 million .", "as i mentioned already , the reinvestment of a portion of these savings has begun and will continue through the first half of 2022 .", "our net loss from continuing operations was $ 18.7 million or $ 0.28 per diluted share versus $ 13.3 million or $ 0.21 per diluted share in the prior year period .", "non-gaap net income was $ 6.9 million versus $ 36.8 million in the prior year period , and non-gaap diluted earnings per share was $ 0.10 versus $ 0.51 in the prior year period .", "these gaap and non-gaap net income and earnings per share results are reflective of lower operating profit that i mentioned as well as higher taxes this year due to the geographies in which the income was earned .", "as with revenue and non-gaap operating profit margin , our year - to - date adjusted ebitda results are generally in line with our expectations , and so we are reaffirming full year 2021 guidance for this metric at 17.25 % to 18.25 % .", "adjusted ebitda in the quarter was $ 74.6 million relative to $ 82.3 million in the prior year period , and adjusted ebitda margin in the quarter was 15.3 % versus 16.6 % in the prior year period based on similar drivers as non-gaap operating profit and margin .", "likewise , as with operating profit , we expect to be toward the lower end of the guidance range in light of these investments in our team to support growth in a competitive labor market .", "we continue our capital - light strategy and our focus on integrating best - in - class offerings to enhance our solutions and optimize our development costs .", "our capital expenditures declined year - over - year again in the third quarter , down 18.4 % to $ 26.1 million .", "we now expect capex to be between 100 and $ 110 million for the full year 2021 , which is lower than our previous expectations .", "free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow also continued to improve , with free cash flow up 14.9 % year - over - year to $ 39.4 million and adjusted free cash flow up 36.3 % to $ 69.9 million .", "these cash flow metrics were also up significantly on a sequential basis , and we continue to expect to be free cash flow positive for the full year 2021 .", "in continuing our efforts to further derisk our balance sheet , we completed a transfer of additional gross pension liabilities in october through a $ 235 million annuity contract .", "we expect a onetime noncash pre-tax settlement charge in the fourth quarter associated with this liability transfer of approximately $ 130 million or $ 1.94 per share .", "another positive balance sheet item to note is last week , moody's has resolved the positive outlook associated with our debt by providing an upgrade of our corporate family rating to b1 with a stable outlook , and our senior secured notes were upgraded to b1 as well .", "to wrap up , our third quarter was consistent with our expectations and represent continued progress on our refresh strategy and the achievement of both our short and long -
