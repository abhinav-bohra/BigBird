branded retailer , dreams sells a variety of products across a range of price points .", "their margin profile is lower than our historical international margins , which is driving the major change in year - over - year margins internationally .", "excluding dreams , the underlying sales and margin performance internationally was in line with our expectations across both europe and asia pacific .", "now moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow items .", "we generated strong third quarter operating cash flows of $ 285 million .", "we are running very light on inventory , and we would expect that our inventory days would increase by the end of the year to support our expected sales growth in 2022 .", "at the end of the third quarter , consolidated debt less cash was $ 1.9 billion , and our leverage ratio under our credit facility was 1.7 times .", "our strong financial performance and balance sheet resulted in positive signals from the capital markets .", "first , we received multiple rating agency upgrades during the quarter , resulting in the strongest credit ratings in the company 's history .", "second , we issued an $ 800 million three 7/8 % 10 -

in - class manufacturing and logistics capabilities to manufacture non-branded product .", "this will allow us to earn our fair share of approximately 20 % of the bedding market we believe is serviced by oem .", "this also is expected to decrease our cost per unit for our branded product as we spread fixed costs and drive more advantageous supply agreements .", "the third building block of future growth is our expectation that we 'll be able to service the entirety with a robust demand for our brands and products through the wholesale channel .", "throughout 2021 , because of supply chain issues , we 've had to turn away new north american customers opportunities and have had our existing customers , including our e-commerce and retail operations , on allocation .", "beginning in 2022 , we anticipate being able to fully service demand and reengage with those new customers who approached us in the past about bringing on our brands and non-branded products .", "we also expect to return to a normalized brand mix dynamics as supply chain improves for both tempur and sealy operations .", "the fourth building block is continued expansion through our direct channel .", "as i 've said before , we believe that we have one of the fastest growing , most profitable direct -
