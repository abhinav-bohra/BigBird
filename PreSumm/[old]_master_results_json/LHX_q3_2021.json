best market position for radios .", "and with our broad and diversified portfolio , along with continued execution elsewhere , especially on the margin front , we 've increased our range on earnings per share to $ 12.85 to $ 13 per share and still expect to deliver free cash flow per share of around $ 14 , up double - digit on both accounts .", "shifting over to the third quarter , following organic revenue growth of 6 % in the second quarter , we saw a decline of 1 % due to timing associated with supply chain delays at cs and in isr aircraft award with ims . while i 'm disappointed by the soft top - line results , i 'll note that the order momentum remained strong with a book - to - bill of 1.07 and we delivered record - high margins at 19.6 % .", "eps was $ 3.21 , up 13 % versus the prior year with solid free cash flow of $ 673 million , that contributed to shareholder returns of $ 1.5 billion in the quarter .", "our execution against the company 's strategic priorities have been a key factor and value creation for all stakeholders , in spite of the pandemic , and we made progress in the quarter by advancing topline opportunities , improving operational performance , wrapping up portfolio shaping and returning capital to our owners .", "starting with the top line , the revenue decline in the quarter fell short of our internal targets , largely due to two - timing factors .", "at cs , the global electronic component shortage has led to a supply chain disruption for our product and electronics - focused businesses notably tactical communications .", "in the third quarter , the impact was nearly $ 100 million or approximately 2 points of revenue .", "and in the fourth quarter , our expectation is for the backlog of unfilled orders to grow and all told , we foresee a roughly $ 250 million to $ 300 million revenue impact for the year , implying another step down in the fourth quarter .", "this is a primary driver of our revenue guidance adjustment at cs .", "having said that , we do not anticipate any impact to our bookings nor our win rate and expect the segment to end the year with a book - to - bill well over 1 time .", "in addition , despite the supply chain challenges we faced in q3 and ongoing headwinds , we were able to meet delivery requirements on all of our key us dod modernization programs and are on track to continue to do so in the fourth quarter including deliveries on the recently awarded hms full - rate production contract with the us army .", "second , in ims we had a follow - on isr aircraft order with a nato customer that booked late in the quarter , causing revenues to slip to q4 representing roughly a 2.5 point shift between quarters .", "while the supply chain headwinds limit upside opportunities to our revenues for this year , i 've been pleased with the team 's traction against our strategy of delivering end -

digit range for both .", "the sas segment was up 3 % and led by strong growth in our responsive space business , while as was up 1 % including the benefit from recovery in commercial aerospace .", "margins expanded 170 basis points to 19.6 % with the most notable drivers being from e3 performance and cost management , which more than offset volume - related supply chain headwinds .", "we exceeded our internal expectations by more than 100 basis points from favorable mix related to award timing and strong e3 performance .", "the team continues to drive margin upside by delivering on e3 improvements that lead to outperformance in scheduled milestones costs and retirement of risk .", "these drivers along with our share repurchase activity drove earnings per share up 13 % or $ 0.37 to $ 3.21 as shown on slide 5 .", "of this growth synergies and operations contributed $ 0.39 , lower share count contributed another $ 0.20 and pension and tax accounted for the remaining $ 0.08 then more than offset a $ 0.14 headwind from divested earnings and a $ 0.16 headwind from supply chain delays .", "free cash flow was $ 673 million and we ended the quarter steady with working capital days at 56 .", "this supported robust shareholder returns of $ 1.5 billion , comprised of $ 1.3 billion in share repurchases and $ 202 million in dividends .", "integrated mission systems revenue was down 3 % driven by follow on isr aircraft award timing from the nato customer that would have contributed 8 points of growth for which revenue has now been booked in october .", "revenue was also impacted by the expected timing of wescam turret deliveries from a completed facility move .", "by contrast , our maritime business grew in the mid-single digits from a ramp on key platforms including the constellation class frigate and classified programs .", "operating income was up 4 % and margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.6 % from operational excellence , integration benefits and pension .", "funded book - to - bill was 1.04 in the quarter and 1.05 year - to - date with strength across the segment .", "in space and airborne systems , revenue increased 3 % driven by double - digit growth in space , primarily from our ramping missile defense and other responsive programs .", "the space growth was more than offset -- from the production transition -- i 'm sorry the space program more than offset headwinds from the production transition of the f - 35 tech refresh 3 program within mission avionics , as well as program timing and electronic warfare , and intel & cyber .", "we expect an overall ramp in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter for the segment .", "operating income was up 5 % and margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.8 % as e3 performance , increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher r&d investments and mix impacts from growth programs such as in space .", "and funded book to bill was about 1 for the quarter and 1.05 year - to - date , driven by responsive and other space awards .", "next , communication systems organic revenue was down 5 % due primarily to product delivery delays within tactical communications that stemmed from the global electronic component shortages , creating an approximately 8.0 headwind year - over - year and versus expectations , as well as lower volume for our legacy unmanned platforms in broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments .", "in addition , the integrated vision and global communication solutions businesses were impacted by delivery timing and contract roll - offs on international programs , respectively .", "conversely , our public safety business was up double digits versus the prior year and sequentially , and strong radio sales following the state of florida law enforcement system award in the prior quarter .", "operating income decreased to 1 % and margins expanded 130 basis points to 26.3 % .", "from operational excellence , including program performance within broadband , favorable mix on public safety radios and integration benefits that outweighed supply chain impacts and higher r&d investments .", "and funded book -

offs along with the late awards within defense aviation .", "operating income decreased 13 % primarily due to divestitures while margins expanded 140 basis points to 14.4 % and expense management , the commercial aerospace recovery and integration benefits more than offset divestiture related headwinds .", "and funded book -

digits on average .", "turning to margins , we 've raised our outlook to 18.75 % from 18.5 % , due to performance to date e3 progress and favorable mix from award timing .", "margins will step back in the fourth quarter due to increased supply chain delays along with mixed effects on new earlier - stage programs , but still strong progress for the full year .", "from a segment perspective , we 've improved the outlook for each with cs above the prior midpoint of its range and ims , sas , and as above the top end of the prior ranges .", "on earnings per share we are raising the lower end of the prior guide by $ 0.05 to $ 12.85 to $ 13 per share , reflecting 11 % growth from 2020 at the midpoint .", "delivering on our double -
