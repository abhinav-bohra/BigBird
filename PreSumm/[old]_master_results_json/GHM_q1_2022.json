over - year .", "however , it was for different reasons .", "you might recall that our first quarter last year operated at nominally 50 % capacity due to covid - 19 , thus impacting revenue and profitability due to under- absorption .", "in the most recent quarter , our workforce utilization was at capacity .", "however , mix was very different .", "orders from our crude oil refining and chemical / petrochemical markets were very low during the third and fourth quarters last fiscal year where non-navy orders totaled $ 17.5 million for both quarters .", "consequently , greater production resources were pulled into navy backlog , which are lower margin due to first article work and also due to contract structure for a large order in backlog .", "those headwinds work out of backlog across the next few quarters and largely behind us as we exit this current fiscal year .", "organic revenue and profitability are expected to improve across the fiscal year .", "orders in the first quarter were $ 20.9 million and were principally organic .", "barber - nichols orders were $ 200,000 for the month of june .", "somewhat encouragingly , there were strong orders from our crude oil refining market in the quarter that totaled $ 11.5 million .", "we did have a significant win in the quarter for a domestic refinery revamping their facility to improve crude oil feedstock processing flexibility .", "that particular win was gratifying for me .", "i still remember losing the original order to a domestic competitor in the mid-1990s .", "and now , 25 years later , we won back the installation and replaced the original supplier with our own vacuum systems .", "consolidated backlog at june 30 was $ 236 million , of which 80 % is for defense .", "importantly , as we work through the more challenging margin backlog , that impacts the current fiscal year .", "margin potential for our defense backlog improves measurably .", "barber - nichols acquisition provides additional market diversity to our profile as it also adds backlog for new markets including space and advanced energy industries .", "while we put considerable cash toward acquiring barber - nichols to strengthen and diversify revenue along with earnings , our balance sheet remains strong and our opportunity to drive our return on assets improves .", "as announced earlier today and as debbie had mentioned , i 'm very pleased to confirm that i will retire effective august 31 at the end of this month and dan thoren will succeed me as president and ceo of the corporation .", "he also will join our board of directors at that time .", "it has been a tremendous honor and great privilege for me to serve graham shareholders and the corporation as its principal executive officer since 2006 .", "i believe i am departing on a high note as this is an incredibly exciting time for the company , considering first the strength of our organic defense strategy having advanced to preferred supplier status for many of the products the company provides to the us navy , and in some cases , we are now bidding on a sole -

nichols .", "the comparable quarter last year was early on during the covid pandemic .", "and as jim mentioned , we ran the company at half capacity during that quarter .", "however , in that quarter , we did have a $ 5 million project which was recognized on a completed contract basis and because of covid had shifted from fiscal 2020 into q1 of 2021 .", "gross profit and earnings per share were dramatically affected by a very poor mix of projects and some timing and some cost items .", "namely , we had some liquidated damages due to covid in the quarter and some timing of expenses which were pulled into q1 .", "we also had a small amount of acquisition expenses , about $ 169,000 pre-tax , and the first month of purchase price accounting related costs for barber - nichols .", "to clarify the latter , the purchase accounting amortization costs were $ 225,000 before taxes in june .", "before we move on , i want to mention that we expect approximately $ 2.7 million pre-tax and $ 2.15 million after - tax related to acquisition purchase accounting .", "90 % of this is amortization costs , with the rest being a step - up in depreciation and inventory .", "we will be filing an 8 - k later this week with much more detail on the purchase accounting and pro forma income statements .", "we expect the amount of amortization will be similar in fiscal 2023 as fiscal 2022 since we will have 12 rather than 10 months of amortization in fiscal 2023 .", "it will decrease in future years and level off at approximately $ 1.1 million pre-tax .", "with the acquisition of barber - nichols , we have moved from a very inefficient to a much more efficient balance sheet .", "we have added $ 20 million of low - cost term debt as part of the acquisition and we have access to a much larger revolving line of credit .", "this term loan and the line of credit will provide ongoing flexibility .", "we expect the acquisition of barber - nichols to be accretive in fiscal 2022 , even with the $ 2.15 million or approximately $ 0.20 a share in added amortization costs .", "we will continue to look for both organic and m&a - related growth opportunities and believe we have the financial strength to invest in both areas .", "with the addition of barber - nichols , we believe there are some excellent opportunities in both arenas .", "orders in the commercial markets picked up in q1 off a very low base in the previous two quarters .", "with a $ 236 million backlog , we are well positioned for long - term growth .", "80 % of that backlog is in the defense market , which provides an excellent baseline for our business , not just this year , but in upcoming years as well .", "before i pass it over to dan , i would be remiss if i did n't recognize jim for his 37 years of service at graham , the last 15 years being as leader .", "he has transitioned graham from a company which has -- which was capacity limited and had minimal growth engines to a much broader organization with strong footprints in defense and the asian energy markets to couple with our long history in the united states and middle east .", "look nearly anywhere in the world and you will see graham equipment in many world - class refining and petrochemical facilities .", "you will also see graham equipment playing a key role on us navy vessels which support our country 's national defense .", "i 've known dan for the past three years , including negotiating the acquisition with or perhaps against him during part of that time .", "dan is a very high character leader with a great history at barber - nichols and i expect him to do the same at graham .", "over the past many months when the board members have asked for my view as dan as a potential ceo , i was and continue to be unequivocal in my belief that dan is the right ceo to take graham forward .", "now that i 've set the bar high , dan , i 'll pass the call over to you .", "very kind words , very kind introduction .", "i 've spent two and a half years getting to know graham , their leadership and at a high level their business .", "indirectly , i 've learned a little about their culture , their people , their customers and their board .", "over the last two months , i 've met with the executive team , managers , employees , customers and the board to understand the company in more depth .", "these interactions have helped me understand the proud engineering and manufacturing heritage at graham , the importance of the company in the community of batavia , new york and how they have become a trusted partner to their customers across the world in the critical process industries that they serve .", "as i go through my slides , i 'll give you an idea of how we are developing our strategy to build upon our strong legacies while leveraging our opportunities in the defense and space industries .", "specifically , we 'll be working to generate sustainable earnings growth , reduce that earnings volatility , improve operating performance , generate strong cash flows to reinvest in our business and provide a dividend to stockholders .", "the ultimate goals are to provide an acceptable return to our stockholders and provide benefit to all of our stakeholders .", "now let 's focus on slide 7 .", "with graham corporation acquired barber - nichols , we recognize that the two businesses have individual strengths , serving their respective markets that we do not want to disrupt .", "our strategy is to leverage the strengths of each as platforms that provide potential for both organic and inorganic growth .", "as such , graham operations and bn operations both operate under the graham corporation umbrella .", "as we consider future capital investments , our plan is to add new companies and technologies with related engineered product that can stand alone yet collaborate to win bigger business .", "leverage best practices between subject matter experts in the companies , share services across the organizations and provide career paths for key employees .", "when we do these things , each member company can remain focused and agile while accomplishing more than they could alone .", "as you look at slide 7 , this depicts our two platforms for expansion .", "barber - nichols is currently in space and defense predominantly .", "graham manufacturing is currently in defense , energy and petrochemical .", "for the space industry , we believe there are acquisition opportunities in this expanding market as it gains more interest in private investment .", "we will be looking for small acquisitions that we can tuck in as well as medium acquisitions that can stand on their own and are complementary to our current businesses .", "we are also focused on internal investments to develop new products and technologies in that space industry .", "both graham and barber -
