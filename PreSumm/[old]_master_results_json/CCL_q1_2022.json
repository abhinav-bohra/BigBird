plus percent occupancies for the first quarter since many of these sailings were confirmed just a number of months before departure , which resulted in less than the normal booking lead time .", "however , we had anticipated first quarter occupancy would exceed the 58 % achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021 .", "we started the quarter with over 55 % cabin occupancy booked for the first quarter and expected to improve upon that during the quarter .", "however , during the first quarter 2022 , as a result of the omicron variant , we experienced an impact on bookings for near -

term sailings , optimizing our longer - term prospects for future revenue and pricing .", "once again , our onboard and other revenue per diems were up significantly in the first quarter 2022 versus the first quarter 2019 , in part due to the bundled packages as well as onboard credits utilized by guests from cruises canceled during the pause .", "we had great growth in onboard and other per diems on both sides of the atlantic .", "increases in bar , casino , shops , spa and internet led the way onboard .", "over the past 2.5 years , we have offered and our guests have chosen more and more bundled package options .", "in the end , we will see the benefit of these bundled packages in onboard and other revenue .", "as a result of these bundled packages , the line between passenger ticket and onboard revenue is blurred .", "for accounting purposes , we allocate the total price paid by the guests between the two categories .", "therefore , the best way to judge our performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics .", "on the cost side , our adjusted cruise cost without fuel per available lower berth day , or albd as it is more commonly called , for the first quarter 2022 was up 25 % .", "i did say adjusted cruise costs and not net cruise costs , a term we had previously used .", "the calculation of adjusted cruise costs and net cruise costs are the same .", "the increase in adjusted cruise costs without fuel per albd is driven essentially by five things : first , the cost of a portion of the fleet being in pause status ; second , restart related expenses ; third , 15 ships being in dry dock during the quarter , which resulted in nearly double the number of dry dock days during the first quarter versus the first quarter 2019 ; fourth , the cost of maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols ; and finally , inflation .", "remember , that because a portion of the fleet was in pause status during the first quarter and the higher number of dry dock days , we spread costs over less albds .", "this will again result in a doubling of the dry dock days during the quarter compared to 2019 , which will impact adjusted cruise cost without fuel per albd during the second quarter .", "we anticipate that many of these costs and expenses driving adjusted cruise costs without fuel per albd higher will end during 2022 and will not reoccur in 2023 .", "as a result of all of the above , we expect to see a significant improvement in adjusted cruise costs , excluding fuel per albd , from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022 with a low double -
