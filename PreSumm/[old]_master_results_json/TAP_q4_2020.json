premise and drove revenue and ebitda declines in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2020 .", "in fact , europe which accounted for only 16 % of our revenue in 2020 contributed to 61 % of

was down 28.4 % on a constant currency basis .", "while we delivered net pricing growth in north america and europe as well as positive brand and packaged mix in the us .", "this is more than offset by volume declines and unfavorable channel mix principally driven by varying degrees of on - premise restrictions throughout much of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic , which also drove packaging material constraints due to the unprecedented can demand .", "brand volumes declined 7.8 % and financial volumes declined 8.9 % .", "north american shipment trends improved in the second half of the year as certain packaging material constraints ease and we both distributed inventory .", "net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis grew 1.1 % in constant currency due to pricing growth in north america and europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the us .", "the success of our both premium innovations including vizzy , blue moon lightsky and coors seltzer , help drive us net sales per hectoliter up 2.3 % for the year .", "underlying cogs per hectoliter increased 2.8 % on a constant currency basis driven by cost inflation including higher transportation costs , volume deleverage and mix impacts from premiumization in north america , partially offset by cost savings .", "higher can sourcing cost in north america contributed to the higher cost inflation .", "after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic we aggressively begin sourcing additional aluminum cans from all over the world to support our core brands to address unprecedented off - premise demand .", "also we saw tightening of the freight market throughout the year which has led to higher transportation costs .", "underlying mg&a decreased 9.9 % on a constant currency basis as we quickly took action , pivoting spend away from the areas impacted by the coronavirus pandemic , particularly live in the payments events and sporting events due to shortened or delayed seasons such as the delayed start of the nh - alc season into 2021 .", "in the second half of the year , we began to progressively increase marketing spend , particularly in social and tv media stepping up support behind our new innovations , such as vizzy , blue moon lightsky and coors seltzer in alignment with additional supply coming online as well as continuing to support our core coors light , miller lite and other -- our chronic core brands .", "mg&a declines were also driven by targeted cost mitigation actions and significant cost savings in the fifth year of our revitalization cost savings program .", "in aggregate , we delivered approximately $ 270 million across mg&a and cost of goods sold , chasing us on track to meet our $ 600 million target in total gross savings .", "these reductions were offset by innovations , in fact in lower incentive compensation and a non-recurring vendor benefit in the prior year which we referenced last quarter .", "as a result , underlying ebitda decreased 10 % on a constant currency basis .", "underlying free cash flow was $ 1.3 billion for the year , a decrease of $ 104 million from the prior year driven by lower underlying ebitda and higher cash taxes partially offset by favorable working capital .", "the working capital benefit was driven by the deferral of approximately $ 150 million in tax payments on various government bonds with payment deferral programs related to the coronavirus pandemic of which , we currently anticipate the majority to be paid in 2021 as they become due .", "capital expenditures incurred were $ 530 million for the year .", "with improved liquidity and strong cash management , we were able to accelerate certain investments in expanding our production capacity and capabilities to support new innovations and growth initiatives .", "in addition to the strong free cash flow performance , we made tremendous stride in improving our financial flexibility , including continuing to pay down debt favorably amending our us revolving credit facilities and suspending our dividend in may for the remainder of 2020 .", "we reduced our net debt position by $ 1.1 billion in 2020 and reduce our trailing 12 month net debt to underlying ebitda ratio to 3.5 times as we remain committed to maintaining our investment grade rating .", "now let 's discuss the fourth quarter .", "we 're again europe due to the on- premise lockdown had a significant and disproportionately negative impact on our results .", "consolidated net sales revenue declined 8.3 % in constant currency principally due to financial volume declines as a result of the on- premise restrictions along with corresponding negative channel mix , partially offset by net pricing growth in north america and europe as well as positive brand and package mix in the us .", "north america net sales revenue was down 1 % in constant currency .", "however , in the us , despite increased on - premise restrictions and aluminum can supply constraints , we delivered net sales revenue growth of 1.9 % in the quarter .", "and we continue to build this distributor inventory in the us with brand volumes down 6.2 % compared to domestic shipment declines of 2.3 % .", "growth in the us business was more than offset by lower volumes and negative mix in canada , and to a lesser latin america as a result of the on- premise restrictions .", "in europe , net sales revenue was down 59.4 % in constant currency driven by volume declines and negative mix due to increased on premise restriction with the most meaningful in the uk , which experienced a return to almost total on - premise locked down for november and the historically strong month of december and with the subdued nature of many festive celebrations during the fourth quarter , we did not see a big shift of volume into the off - premise .", "net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 3.7 % in constant currency reflecting net pricing growth in north america and europe more than offsetting the negative mix effect of the various market dynamics and consumer shift caused by the coronavirus pandemic .", "in the us net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis increased 4.2 % driven by favorable sales mix from new innovations and strong net parking growth .", "while in europe , net sales per hectoliter on a brand volume basis decreased 8.2 % due to unfavorable mix , particularly driven by the higher margin uk business which more than offset pricing increases .", "underlying cogs per hectoliter increased 6.4 % on a constant currency basis , as we saw a greater impact on price inflation and us mix premiumization in q4 compared to the full year .", "mg&a in the quarter increased 5.8 % on a constant currency basis due to higher planned marketing spend to support our core brands and key innovation as well as backing lower incentive compensation and a non-recurring vendor benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019 .", "this was partially offset by cost savings and lower discretionary spend .", "as a result , underlying ebitda decreased 33.6 % on a constant currency basis disproportionately driven by europe .", "given the length and severity of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our europe business as well as the projected recovery currently expected in certain on - premise markets , we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $ 1.5 billion in our europe segment .", "we also recognized $ 39.6 million of asset impairment charges in our north american segment .", "these charges are non-cash and are not included in underlying results .", "so this takes me to our financial outlook .", "as you may recall , on march the 27 of last year , we withdrew our guidance due to the uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic .", "while uncertainty remains in an effort to help enhanced visibility , we have determined to reinstate our practice of providing guidance .", "we have also determined to adjust the matrix provided which includes adding garden for net sales revenue , a metric which aligns with our revitalization can goals for driving top line growth as well as net debt to underlying ebitda leverage ratios , given our commitment to remaining investment grade .", "we are very proud of our performance and agility navigating the coronavirus pandemic and executing against our revitalization plan , but recognize that headwinds remain .", "the pandemic continues to impact our business due to on - premise losses across all our geographies and disproportionately starting in europe as well as canada .", "we expect big domestic shipment trends in the us to continue to be higher than brand volume trends in the third quarter as we continue to build inventories hitting into the peak season .", "for the year , we maintain our annual goal of shipping to consumption in the us .", "in europe , we continue to experience significant lockdowns and expect third quarter volumes will be materially impacted due to the prior year period similar to what was experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "for 2021 , we expect to deliver mid-single - digit net sales revenue growth .", "2021 is intended to be a europe investment as we continue to de-lever our revitalization plan and drive toward long - term growth .", "this entails increasing year - over - year marketing spend to build on the strength of our core brands and support our successful 2020 launches including blue moon lightsky , vizzy and coors seltzer and new innovations to come as well as investing in further expanding our capabilities to drive productivity and efficiency .", "we expect significant increases in spain , beginning in the second quarter , which is the prior comparable quarter .", "while we continue to expect revitalization plan savings as i discussed , given this increase in along with cost headwinds related to higher inflation including transportation costs and continued premiumization of our portfolio ,

million plus or minus passed the same .", "and an effective tax rate in the range of 20 % to 23 % .", "we entered 2021 with greatly improved financial flexibility .", "later enabling us to not only
