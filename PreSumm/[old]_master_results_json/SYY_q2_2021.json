% to $ 2.1 billion in the second quarter .", "most of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to covid .", "however , we did see a modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 67 basis points as our rate came in at 18.2 % .", "a couple of thoughts on that .", "first , we typically see a seasonal decline in gross margin sequentially from the first quarter through the second quarter as we did this year .", "second , our largest segment us foodservice and its partner segment sygma , each had a flat gross margin rate versus the same pre-covid , quarter which is frankly remarkable given these market dynamics .", "given the growth of our national accounts business at sygma , which is lower margin , we did see business mix shift , which accounted for the vast majority of the margin rate change .", "our enterprise margin was also impacted by the international and other businesses as both showed gross margin decline in the quarter for reasons which are being addressed .", "our expense profile changed over the course of our second quarter as adjusted operating expense decreased 15.3 % to $ 1.9 billion .", "this expense profile reflects a deleverage of our cost structure as sales remained down 23 % .", "these results arise from some purposeful choices .", "first , and on the positive side of the equation , we targeted and achieved increased productivity in key areas such as our warehouse network .", "we also maintained our key transportation efficiency metrics despite significant swings in case volume .", "second , we continue to make excellent progress against our $ 350 million of cost savings initiatives in fiscal 2021 .", "i can see the savings in the detailed income statement , and we continue to identify and pursue more opportunities .", "third , but on the other side of the equation , we have made the purposeful choice to leverage our financial strength to prepare for the business recovery before it happens .", "as previously announced , we changed our sales consultant compensation to include both the fixed and variable component to drive retention and focus on key operational metrics .", "we can see that change working in our market wins .", "additionally , we brought back hundreds of associates in the second quarter in support of our business model .", "in the third quarter , and indeed in the back half , we anticipate we will hire thousands of additional sales consultants , new business developers , culinary experts and operations associates in anticipation of the pending business recovery .", "we plan to be ahead of the recovery curve , not catching up and we have the financial resources to do just that .", "finally , as kevin mentioned , we continue to make purposeful investments in our capability builds in support of our transformation , pricing , customer experience , sales , vendor management and personalization .", "while we expect significant returns on these efforts in future quarters , the investment dollars are offsetting part of our savings in the second quarter and will do so in the back half .", "when combined with the impact of slower openings in our international segment , we expect our third quarter results to be more challenging than originally anticipated .", "however , as volume returns and grows , whether due to market recovery or our purposeful investments , we expect to move up the sales curve more rapidly than others and expect over the next several quarters the impact of the cost savings efforts separated from the ongoing investments will be more visible .", "finally , at the enterprise level , adjusted operating income decreased 63 % to $ 234 million .", "for the second quarter , our non-gaap tax rate of 16.8 % was favorably driven by the impact of stock option exercises .", "adjusted earnings per share decreased 80 % to $ 0.17 for the quarter .", "now let 's turn to our second quarter results by business segment , starting with the u.s. foodservice operations .", "sales were $ 8 billion , which was a decrease of 23.9 % versus the prior - year period .", "notwithstanding the difficult environment , the business acquired a record number of new customers , as our sales teams hit the streets and we deployed digital tools .", "we also saw growth in our national accounts customer base .", "within the business , sysco brand sales for the second quarter decreased 165 basis points to 36.5 % for total u.s. cases , driven by the customer and product mix shift .", "with respect to local us cases , sysco brand sales decreased 455 basis points to 42 % , which was driven by product mix shift in the pre-packaged and takeaway ready products .", "gross profit decreased 24 % to $ 1.6 billion for the quarter , while as i called out earlier , gross margin was flat for the quarter at 19.7 % as the business very successfully managed through the puts and takes of the covid environment and addressed headwinds such as aged inventory for customers like cruise lines and product mix shift out of higher margin categories like pp&e .", "the segment 's adjusted operating expenses decreased 18.9 % to $ 1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 33 % to $ 472 million .", "moving on to the sygma segment .", "sales increased 4 % to $ 1.5 billion compared to the prior - year period , driven by the success of national and regional quick service restaurant servicing drive - through traffic .", "this is the second consecutive quarter of sales growth in this segment .", "we continue to see new business wins in the sygma segment and are pleased by the overall improvement .", "gross profit increased 4.1 % to $ 129 million for the quarter and gross margin was flat to the prior - year .", "adjusted operating expenses increased 4 % , $ 118 million and adjusted operating income increased 5 % to $ 11 million .", "moving to the international segment , our european , canadian and latin american businesses have been substantially impacted by recent shutdowns , which are more aggressive than lockdowns in the u.s. the international foodservice operation segment saw sales of $ 2 billion , a decrease of 32 % while gross profit decreased 36.2 % and gross margin decreased 128 basis points .", "the gross margin decline was a result of adverse market mix , customer mix , product mix and aged inventory .", "for the international segment , adjusted operating expenses decreased 16 % and adjusted operating income decreased 175 % for an operating loss of $ 55 million .", "our other segment , which includes our guest worldwide business , remains challenged as hospitality occupancy rates remain low compared to prior year levels .", "however , the business is in better shape than many of its competitors and has achieved a number of recent customer wins , including being named the preferred distributor for renaissance hotels , jw marriott , and westin hotels via a new contract with avendra in both the u.s. and canada , and being given access to all marriott properties in north america , central america and the caribbean .", "while still in turnaround mode in a difficult hospitality environment , the business improved its underlying profitability during the second quarter .", "cash flow from operations was $ 937 million for the first half of fiscal 2021 .", "free cash flow was $ 788 million year - to - date , which is in line with our previously noted guidance .", "net capex for the first half of fiscal 2021 was $ 148 million , which was $ 235 million lower than last year as the company carefully assessed its capital investment choices in the face of covid .", "sysco remains financially strong from a balance sheet perspective .", "at quarter end , we had balance sheet cash of $ 5.8 billion , plus access to $ 2 billion of available borrowing capacity for a total of $ 7.8 billion .", "our cash and available liquidity ensures us the stability and flexibility to make decisions that are in the best interest of the company .", "we continue to monitor our operating environment carefully .", "and as we assess reopening timelines and investment needs consistent with the
