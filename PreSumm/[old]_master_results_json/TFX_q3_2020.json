19 , which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately $ 81 million across several global product categories .", "this was somewhat offset by approximately $ 3 million of additional revenue within our vascular access and other product categories , which experienced modestly higher - than - expected demand as a result of covid - 19 .", "from a margin perspective , we generated adjusted gross and operating margins of 57.2 % and 25.1 % , respectively .", "this translated into a year -

digit revenue growth profile and further accretion to adjusted earnings per share .", "after our recent meetings with the fda , we determined to proceed with the bla submission rather than an eua .", "we continue to work closely with the agency in determining the timing of that submission .", "overall , we continue to invest organically in clinical and commercial catalysts that will help to sustain our revenue growth aspirations in a normalized environment .", "we will also look to augment those internal efforts through the deployment of capital for inorganic growth opportunities , such as z - medica .", "given the previous discussion of the company 's revenue performance , i 'll begin at the gross profit line .", "for the quarter , adjusted gross profit was $ 359.6 million versus $ 380 million in the prior year quarter or a decrease of approximately 5 % .", "adjusted gross margin totaled 57.2 % during the quarter , which is a decrease of 140 basis points versus the prior year period .", "the decline in gross margin was primarily due to covid - 19 - related impacts , including lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing costs , along with a foreign exchange headwind .", "the volume impact was significant for the quarter as the adverse revenue impact from covid - 19 tended to skew toward higher gross margin products , including interventional urology , interventional access and surgical .", "in total , we estimate that covid - 19 negatively impacted our adjusted gross profit by approximately $ 59 million in the quarter .", "we continue to tightly manage discretionary spending as a means to partially offset the reduced revenue and gross profit resulting from covid - 19 .", "and as a result of the efforts , we estimate that operating expenses were reduced in the third quarter by approximately $ 22 million .", "while we expect the actions taken to continue to deliver opex savings through the remainder of the year , by far the largest quarterly opex reduction was realized in the second quarter .", "adjusted operating profit during the third quarter of 2020 was $ 157.6 million , and this compares to $ 175.3 million in the prior year or a decrease of approximately 10 % .", "third quarter operating margin was 25.1 % were down 190 basis points year -

over - year decrease in our third quarter adjusted tax rate is primarily due to a favorable mix of taxable income versus the prior year period as well as a higher benefit from stock - based compensation as compared to the prior year period .", "at the bottom line , third quarter adjusted earnings per share decreased 6.7 % to $ 2.77 .", "included in this result is an estimated adverse impact from covid -
