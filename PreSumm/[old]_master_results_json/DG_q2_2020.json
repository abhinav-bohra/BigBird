to - date through q2 , we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $ 2.9 billion , an increase of $ 1.8 billion or 157 % .", "this increase was primarily driven by strong operating performance combined with lower levels of inventory , as our supply chain teams continue to work closely with our vendor partners to improve in -
