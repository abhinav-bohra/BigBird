end , our afudc equity that 's the funds used during construction -- the equity funds used during construction is lower and as a result of a lower amount of construction work in progress during 2020 , we had a significant capital project associated with the palos verdes peninsula water reliability project and that was adding to our afudc equity all year .", "so we 're expecting to see lower afudc equity here in the quarter , it was down about $ 1 million .", "i mentioned is up slightly .", "we believe we 're on target for capital for the year .", "and then two other items that are outside of our general control , but i did want to mention because they are fairly significant in the quarter .", "the market value of certain of our retirement plan assets was in -- so the market value increased $ 0.3 million as compared to a loss of $ 4.7 million in the first quarter of 2020 .", "so kind of a return to normal for that -- for that item [ technical issues ] now first quarter of 2020 .", "and then our unbilled revenue very similar , we had a $ 1,000 loss on unbilled revenue , very small and probably more typical as compared to a negative $ 3.7 million in 2020 which was a sort of an atypical drop in that unbilled revenue accruals .", "and so those two items i 'd say are a little bit more normal compared to the abnormal amounts that were in the last year .", "flipping to slide seven , i wo n't talk in detail about this , but this is our waterfall earnings per share bridge chart that covers those same topics .", "next on slide eight , i 'll just make a brief comment about the tax rate , i know some of the analysts look at the effective tax rate of the company .", "just wanted to remind everyone that during 2021 we are refunding to customers in rates , $ 19 million of excess deferreds associated with the change in tax rate for the tax cuts and jobs act .", "and that drives down the effective income tax rate to 6 % .", "so there is a -- the revenue is down and the tax rate is down and so we are n't making any money on that , but just when you see the headline tax rate it 's very low .", "the second thing , there was a big benefit at the end of 2020 related to our mains and services repairs investments and the state tax deduction that we 're allowed to take there .", "and just to update you on the estimates , in 2020 we had $ 160 million of deductible mains and services repairs investments , and our current estimate for 2021 is that we will have $ 60 million that qualifies for that tax treatment , and so that 's going to be a factor that 's going to be a little bit lower for the year 2021 .", "capital spending is still anticipated to be between $ 270 million to $ 300 million .", "that has n't changed , but it 's just the timing of the close of certain projects that is going to change that tax qualification .", "so the first one is our cost of capital filing .", "the cost of capital , if you will remember is filed once every three years .", "our last one was in 2017 , because we had a one - year extension .", "we will be filing that cost of capital application on monday , may 3rd , and in our application that we will be filing with the commission we 're requesting a return on equity of 10.35 % , that is up from the currently approved 9.2 % cost of equity .", "we also will be taken advantage of refinancings , and new debt issuances .", "so that our embedded cost of debt is going down a 128 basis points from the previously authorized 5.51 % cost of debt , to a new cost of debt of 4.23 % .", "coupling those two together the increase in cost of equity and the decreased cost of debt means that our rate of return -- authorized rate of return that we are requesting would go up just slightly from 7.48 % to 7.5 % , and what that really means from a customer perspective is that the median bill increase should be about $ 0.34 a month .", "so , really not a big change on the customer 's bill at all .", "now we do recall that though -- the cost of capital filing will be reviewed by the commission , and would be approved for -- to be effective in january 2022 .", "i might also point out that our capital structure , which is about 53 % equity and 47 % debt will remain unchanged in this particular application .", "not only are we refinancing existing debt with new lower - cost debt , but because we 've been investing so much capital , and have been obtaining new debt at a lower cost , that is really what 's helping drive our overall cost of debt down , which is a benefit to our customers .", "the second item i 'll talk about just briefly is our our three - year general rate case filing that will be filed in -- on july 1st , actually july 3rd , because the 1st is a weekend .", "we are working on that right now , and we will provide more information to you all when we get to our next quarterly conference call .", "i want to provide a quick update on our continued efforts in responding to the covid - 19 pandemic .", "first and foremost , let me start off by saying we have continued to see the incremental benefits of people being vaccinated in all four states that we operate in .", "currently over one - third of our employees have been vaccinated , which is great news .", "the vaccine rollout was a little bumpy at first , but we 've seen those bumps kind of smooth out , and we continue to see daily increases in a number of employees that we 've seen vaccinated , as well as we have seen a steep decline in the number of cases of covid found within the cal water family or from our employees .", "we only had a -- five cases in the first quarter that we 've seen where employees have become sick , and then recovered .", "to date we 've had no -- we 've sustained no loss of the life with cal water employees for which we 're very grateful for .", "in terms of supporting our customers , we have maintained a suspension of all collection activities in all four states .", "you 're starting to see that lifted in different states around the u.s. , in the four states that we operate in our suspension of collection activities is still in full force .", "we have seen and continue to see an increase in customer account aging from suspension of collection activities , that bills currently over 90 are about $ 11.6 million , and we have adjusted our bad debt reserve , an additional $ 0.5 million from $ 5.2 million to $ 5.7 million , and i 'll talk more about some creative things we 're doing working with the commission a little bit later on collection activities .", "the incremental expenses associated with our covid response was approximately $ 300,000 .", "that gets recorded in a memo account for a potential recovery at later dates in hawaii and california .", "interesting to note that water sales have been a 105 % of adopted , really driven by the fact the residential demand has been higher and that 's been offset by lower business and industrial use .", "and so as we start to see business use just kind of pick back up , and things get back to normal , we 'll expect to see that the business and industrial sales pick up .", "our liquidity has remained strong .", "we had $ 84.4 million of cash , and additional capacity of about $ 115 million on the lines of credit , subject to some borrowing conditions .", "so i think we weathered the worst of the covid storm , and we 're starting to come out of it .", "california , which is the largest entity that we operate in , is scheduled to be fully opened back up for business here on june 15th .", "going on to the next slide , i want to just take a moment to talk about our recently published esg report .", "our report was published a few weeks ago , that aligns with sasb and referencing gri is now available .", "there is a link in the deck that will take you to the report .", "additionally , for those of you that get the hard copy of the annual report and proxy , there is a summary esg report that 's included in our annual report .", "a lot of hard work went into producing our first esg report .", "we 're very , very proud of it , and we 're very proud of the work we 're doing on the esg frontier .", "and i look forward to reporting more on this as we work on our esg -
