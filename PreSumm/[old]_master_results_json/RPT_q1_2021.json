19 has had a negative impact on many tenant categories .", "but unlike during the global financial crisis , it has also had a positive impact on many other tenant categories , like grocery , home improvement , electronics , wholesale clubs , general merchandise and medical use .", "it has also boosted some businesses that were struggling pre pandemic , like pets , office supply and hobby .", "ironically , many of the big - box tenants that were not in favor pre pandemic have thrived sense , enough so that we think credit center is a more apt description for the power center category .", "one of the biggest opportunities that we saw after the onset of covid was an acceleration of the widening valuation gap between different segments of retail real estate .", "it soon became clear that there were numerous value creation opportunities to unlock if we could figure out a way to monetize the various dislocations between single - versus multi-tenant properties , larger versus smaller footprints and between essential and high credit but nonessential tenant categories .", "our solution was our new net lease retail real estate platform with our partners , gic , zimmer and monarch , that we are calling rgmz until we rebrand later this year .", "given the relationship with rpt and our existing operating and development capabilities , the new platform gives access to proprietary deal flow from multi-tenant assets , larger - scale sale - leaseback transactions with national tenants , blended extends of shorter - term leases on strong real estate , remerchandising of expiring leases and build - to - suit opportunities .", "the net lease platform and our r2g joint venture should allow us to grow aum and expand in target markets faster than we could do on our own .", "our joint ventures also add a new , sustainable and diversified cash flow stream to rpt and we believe will improve our ffo growth profile by enhancing our returns and increasing the economic spread on our deployed capital as we take advantage of the valuation dislocations i mentioned earlier .", "as we 've previously noted , the $ 151 million initial seed sale to rgmz will close in tranches over the course of 2021 .", "the first tranche of 13 parcels closed on march five for just over $ 36 million .", "i wo n't go into all the transactional details , but overall , we could n't be more excited about the net lease platform .", "our northborough crossing deal in the boston msa as currently under contract for $ 104 million is a perfect example of what we are trying to achieve with the net lease platform .", "here , we are buying a premier shopping center that , upon close , will be accretive to rpt 's earnings from day one .", "but by selling parcels to rgmz , we have the opportunity to materially lower our basis and enhance our yield .", "our expectations are that we could sell up to $ 75 million of the center to rgmz , resulting in a significantly reduced basis for rpt .", "consistent with our thesis regarding the value dislocation between multi-tenant and net lease properties , our effective acquisition yield on the retained multi-tenant asset could improve by up to 300 basis points after the acquisition and parcelization processes close .", "there is real synergy between rpt and the new platform that benefits both sides in a way that is difficult to replicate .", "for rgmz , they get access to high - quality tenants and a location with household incomes of about $ 148,000 that no other triple - net investor has access to .", "for rpt , we gain entry into the attractive boston msa on a deal that we would likely have passed on without the potential parcel sales to rgmz .", "equally important is that , as a net lease platforms manager , rpt maintains equal control of the net lease components of the center .", "this type of control is not available to multi-tenant owners that sell pads to unaffiliated entities .", "the synergies of the two platforms give us a unique opportunity that we believe will result in outsized future earnings growth .", "we look forward to providing more details on the northborough and subsequent parcel sales over the next several weeks .", "turning to our acquisition pipeline .", "since we announced our net lease platform , we have engaged with many of you , and a consistent question that comes up is how quickly we can deploy the capital raised at both our rgmz and r2g joint ventures .", "keep in mind that while we only recently announced rgmz , we had been working on the deal for almost a year , and we 're actively cultivating an investment pipeline throughout the pandemic .", "our ability to go to contract on northborough so quickly after closing the new jv is a testament to the strong groundwork that was laid over the past year .", "additionally , we are in active contract negotiations on several other deals and have embedded a total of $ 100 million of net acquisitions at our pro rata share and after parcel sales to rgmz into our guidance .", "we remain optimistic that we will be able to deploy the vast majority of our current cash and future proceeds from the rest of the net lease platform seed sale by year - end , reflecting about $ 150 million of upside to what is currently reflected in our guidance range .", "we are currently tracking a diverse pipeline of over $ 2 billion in markets like boston , atlanta , tampa , nashville , miami , jacksonville and orlando .", "pipeline consisting of rpt , r2g and rgmz deals runs the gamut from single - property , locally owned deals to institutionally owned portfolios .", "the tie that binds each of these deals is the durability of underlying property cash flows and our ability to grow future noi by buying under - market rents or properties with redevelopment opportunities .", "tyler sorenson , who 's heading up acquisitions for the net lease platform , brings a wealth of experience to rpt that we believe will further accelerate our net lease acquisition program and our pipeline .", "last quarter , we outlined 11 remerchandising opportunities consisting of redemising , expansions or combinations .", "with the exact lifts will fluctuate as deals move into and out of the pipeline , these larger leasing deals continue to reflect the best risk - adjusted use of our capital , and we will allocate accordingly .", "we have made very good progress since last quarter with the grocery deal at troy marketplace moving from the shadow pipeline to the active pipeline .", "three other projects were also added this quarter , bringing the total in - progress pipeline to over $ 13 million with expected returns in the high single digits .", "it 's no secret that covid - 19 put pressure on certain experiential tenants .", "but as i noted earlier , this pressure has created opportunities as was the case at our troy marketplace property outside of detroit .", "troy marketplace is a dominant power center that has maintained a high level of occupancy throughout the pandemic , was 97 % leased at quarter end .", "because of covid 's impact on a recreation tenant , we were able to get the space back without a buyout and replace them with a new , premier , first - to - state investment - grade grocer .", "we were able to generate an 88 % rent spread on the new lease .", "although the incremental return on capital is tighter than our typical underwriting , we believe that attracting a premier grocer at this already strong center will create significant value via cap rate compression of almost 200 basis points and position the asset for success for years to come .", "as i 've previously said , we see a lot of value creation from the addition of a grocer component to these credit centers and are looking forward to executing more of these .", "we also continue to see strong leasing demand from our former stein mart space in st. louis and are now in lease negotiation with a leading retailer .", "at winchester in detroit , we are finalizing a lease with a quality national off - price tenant to take our only other stein mart box .", "florida has continued to be a robust leasing market for rpt .", "we are seeing great activity across the board at our centers within the state and are close to deals that will significantly upgrade the tenant credit at west broward and shoppes of lakeland .", "there is also strong demand at the marketplace of delray , which is creating friction at this property that could result in a significant improvement in the tenant mix .", "as we continue to move past the heart of the pandemic , we are again revisiting our development program we had put on hold pre covid - 19 .", "although we are still not ready to put shovels in the ground just yet , we have reengaged with potential partners on a few of our properties that we previously flagged for potential residential use in florida .", "we are seeing extremely strong demand for residential at both river city and parkway shops in jacksonville .", "as we 've stated in the past , although the highest and best use of certain parts of our centers may not be retail , we will remain focused on our core retail competencies and will look to monetize non-retail components through ground leases , land sales or potentially even land contributions into partnerships with leading residential players to retain some future upside .", "today , i will discuss our first quarter results , our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and end with a commentary on our updated guidance .", "first quarter operating ffo per share of $ 0.19 was up $ 0.01 versus last quarter , driven by our improving rent collections as we experienced a decline in rent not probable collection and abatement , which totaled $ 3.2 million in the quarter , down from $ 4.4 million last quarter .", "further , as disclosed on page 33 of our supplemental , our first quarter rental income , excluding prior year amounts , has ticked up since last quarter and is now only down 5 % from first quarter of 2020 despite the continued nonpayment of our theater tenants who have remained closed since the onset of the pandemic .", "our four regals are slated to open in late may and account for about 75 % of our total theater exposure .", "given regal 's reopening plans and recent liquidity infusions , we expect in our forecasting resumption of rent payments in the next few weeks .", "we continue to take a conservative stance with uncollected rents and have reserved nearly 80 % of our uncollected first quarter recurring billings .", "additionally , we effectively have no exposure to tenants in bankruptcy left in the portfolio .", "as of quarter end , $ 18 million of our recurring billings for the trailing 12 months remain outstanding , of which $ 12 million has been reserved with the majority of the $ 6 million balance expected to be repaid over the course of ' 21 and 2022 .", "operationally , we continue to execute and put runs on the board .", "we started 2021 on a high note , signing 62 deals in the quarter covering 556,000 square feet .", "this was the highest number of deals signed in the quarter in almost two years .", "blended rent spreads were up 9 % as we achieved a 51 % comparable new lease spread , our best quarterly spread in almost three years , driven by our troy marketplace grocery deal that brian previously noted .", "while the ti related to this deal was outsized , it was more than offset by the value of nearly $ 20 million that was created by cap rate compression .", "excluding this deal , our new lease spread would have been up 26 % , highlighting a solid , broad - based demand and mark - to - market opportunities in our portfolio .", "our renewal spreads also continued to improve , up 3.9 % , making the third consecutive quarter of improving renewal spreads .", "given our strong leasing activity , we ended the first quarter with a signed not open backlog of $ 3.3 million , the majority of which will come online over the next 12 months .", "we also have a full pipeline of deals with over $ 2 million of leases in advanced legal negotiations .", "additionally , as brian touched on , we have identified several remerchandising deals that will generate well into double - digit return on cost in addition to cap rate compression across certain properties .", "in the spirit of transparency , we have outlined these active and pipeline remerchandising opportunities on page 19 and 20 of our supplemental .", "occupancy for the quarter was 90.6 % , down 90 basis points sequentially due primarily to the proactive and planned recapture of our space at our troy marketplace and west broward properties that will facilitate new grocer deals .", "given the lack of bankruptcy exposure in our portfolio , our signed not open backlog , our robust leasing pipeline and our remerchandising opportunities , we believe occupancy has troughed and expect it to track upward over the next several quarters as we march toward restabilization of our portfolio .", "the closing of the first tranche of the initial seed sale to our net lease platform benefited both our leverage and liquidity levels in the quarter .", "we ended the first quarter with net debt to annualized adjusted ebitda of 7.2 times , down from 7.6 times last quarter .", "looking forward , we continue to target leverage in the 5.5 to 6.5 times range , which will be driven by the normalization of ebitda as the impacts of covid - 19 reverse course in ' 21 and 2022 , the stabilization of our portfolio and as future tranches of the rgmz seed close in 2021 .", "however , it is important to keep in mind that the timing of acquisitions and subsequent net lease parcel sales may have a temporary impact on reported quarterly leverage levels .", "from a liquidity perspective , we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $ 143 million and a fully unused $ 350 million unsecured line of credit .", "including the expected proceeds from the remaining rgmz seed sales , our pro forma cash balance would be about $ 250 million .", "in short , we have a war chest of cash and a deep acquisition pipeline that we expect will generate strong external growth for rpt shareholders .", "regarding our pending debt maturities through 2022 , we have just one $ 37 million private placement note that matures in june and a $ 52 million mortgage that is prepayable starting in november and carries an above - market 5.7 % interest rate .", "based on the positive feedback from our unsecured debt partners , we expect to refinance both these notes later this year .", "however , given our strong liquidity position and as an interim step , we may repay our $ 37 million private placement note due in june ahead of our expected refinancing .", "as with any debt issuance , we look to maintain a flat maturity ladder with a goal of having no more than 15 % of our debt stack maturing in any given year .", "the last topic i want to touch on is our updated 2021 offo per share guidance of $ 0.81 to $ 0.89 , which is up $ 0.03 at the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $ 0.77 to $ 0.87 .", "our updated range includes the impact from the sale of the remaining tranches of initial rgmz seed .", "also assumed in our forecast are $ 100 million of net acquisitions at our pro rata share .", "included in this assumption is the gross purchase price of northborough that is expected to close in the second quarter .", "however , it 's important to again note that we expect to sell certain net lease parcels at northborough to rgmz in the fourth quarter that will lower our basis , as brian mentioned .", "the net impact of the initial seed sales and net acquisition activity of $ 100 million is expected to add $ 0.02 of upside relative to the midpoint of prior guidance .", "the other $ 0.01 of upside stems from outperformance in the first quarter that we are now projecting in future periods .", "like last quarter , the range around the midpoint of our updated guidance is largely driven by our performance on the bad debt front , particularly from our theaters .", "also , it should be noted that our guidance does not include any assumptions of recovery for prior period bad debt or straight - line rent reserves .", "and lastly , although we have $ 100 million of net acquisitions formally built into guidance , we believe we can deploy as much as $ 250 million into opportunistic acquisitions within our target markets that meet our disciplined underwriting standards , representing upside to our guidance range ."], "summary_gold": "q1 operating ffo per share $ 0.19 .<q>sees fy 2021 operating ffo per share $ 0.81 to $ 0.89 .", "summary_pred": "we continue to benefit from the multiyear mark -
