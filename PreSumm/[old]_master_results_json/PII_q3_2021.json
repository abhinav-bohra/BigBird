over - year basis , mostly due to increased input costs from logistics , commodities , plant inefficiencies and labor .", "the input costs were partially offset by increased pricing and ongoing lower promotional and floor plan financing costs .", "adjusted operating expenses were up 4 % , primarily due to increased research and development expenditures and , to a lesser degree , increased selling and marketing costs during the quarter .", "income from financial services declined 38 % during the quarter , primarily due to lower retail credit income .", "retail financing penetration rates continue to be low due to more customers paying in cash , minimal promotional programs available from polaris and consumers having additional time to shop around for alternative financing options .", "and finally , the tax rate finished at 20.5 % , compared to 23.7 % in the third quarter last year due to favorable adjustments related to research and development credits taken in the quarter .", "from a segment reporting perspective , motorcycles , global adjacent markets and boats increased sales for the quarter , driven by volume , pricing , lower promotions and favorable product mix .", "sales for our orv , snowmobile and aftermarket segments reported lower sales for the quarter , driven by the supply chain shortages .", "all segments continued to benefit from ongoing low promotional costs , given high demand and the lack of product in the channel .", "pricing actions taken in may also had a favorable impact during the quarter , but were muted , given the large quantity of customer preorder units , which did not benefit from the pricing actions .", "average selling prices for all segments were up , orv increased about 5 % ; motorcycles were up approximately 10 % ; adjacent markets increased about 1 % ; and boats was up approximately 30 % for the quarter .", "mix had an impact on asps in all segments .", "i will talk more about pricing actions we have recently taken as they are an important countermeasure to the increasingly inflationary environment we are facing today and going forward .", "our international sales increased 21 % during the quarter , with all regions and segments growing sales as many economies continued to gain traction as they recovered from earlier covid shutdowns .", "currency added 3 percentage points to the international growth for the quarter .", "parts , garments and accessories sales increased 8 % during the quarter , with strong demand across all segments and categories in that business , particularly parts and accessories .", "back orders driven by the supply chain bottlenecks remained high , limiting our growth in pg&a for the quarter .", "moving on to our guidance for the remainder of the year .", "as mike indicated , supply chain challenges significantly impacted our ability to ship products in the third quarter , and we anticipate continued pressure in the fourth quarter and into 2022 .", "when we last updated our expectations in july , we have been expecting the supply chain constraints to ease as we headed into the fourth quarter .", "unfortunately , the supply environment has not improved in the ways we had anticipated .", "therefore , we are lowering our full -

plus increase in input costs since the beginning of the year , but just in the third quarter alone , our input costs from logistics , ocean and truck rates , commodities , labor rates and plant inefficiencies increased over $ 100 million or approximately 580 basis points when compared to the prior - year third quarter .", "given the magnitude of the input cost increases and the expectation that they are not transitory , we are quickly adjusting our pricing for model year 2022 .", "here in october , we announced price increases that will increase the average sales price on most orv and motorcycle models in the mid-single - digits percent range .", "similar increases were also announced for associated pg&a .", "these increases are in addition to several price increases we have made earlier in the year .", "while the cost environment is a headwind that will continue to impact our gross profit margins in the fourth quarter , the benefit of the recent pricing actions taken or announced will not have a significant impact until the first quarter of 2022 as the dealers ' current preorders are set at the previous pricing levels .", "adjusted operating expenses are now expected to improve 90 basis points as a percentage of sales versus last year , again , at the lower end of our previous guidance range , driven by the lower sales growth expectations , partially offset by prudent cost management .", "we are continuing to invest in the business while controlling our flexible expenses commensurate with our sales volume .", "income from financial services is now expected to be down in the low 30s percent range , driven by the continued historically low dealer inventory levels , as well as lower retail financing income due to lower penetration rates of our retail providers , as i explained earlier .", "and we 're adjusting our income tax provision rate expectations for the full year to be in the range of 22 % to 22.5 % , an improvement over our previously issued guidance , reflecting the flow - through of favorable tax adjustments related to the r&d credit .", "guidance for the remainder of the p&l items remains materially unchanged from our previous issued guidance .", "our sales expectations for our segments have been lowered given the supply chain challenges with the exception of global adjacent markets , which remains unchanged for the year .", "while our adjacent market businesses are feeling the same supply chain challenges with our other businesses , they were in a better position with finished goods and dealer inventory given the b2b market has recovered at a slower rate than the consumer markets .", "our current plant capacity is adequate to meet the current demand .", "and when the supply chain constraints ease , we will have the needed capacity in place to ramp quickly and begin to fill the dealer channel with much needed inventory .", "we are expanding our monterrey facility by over 400,000 square feet , adding approximately 35 % more capacity for rzr in general over the next year to accommodate the model year ' 22 vehicles , the new rzrs coming in q4 and additional orv models expected to launch over the next couple of years .", "for boats , we added approximately 55,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity in elkhart , indiana to meet the demand for bennington , and we brought the syracuse , indiana facility back online to support strong demand for our hurricane deck boats .", "in addition to adding manufacturing space , we have also invested heavily in welding , vending , injection molding and painting capabilities to support higher assembly volumes .", "with these capacity adds , we will be ready to meet the anticipated strong demand when the supply chain improves .", "year - to - date third quarter operating cash flow finished at $ 153 million , down significantly , compared to the same period last year .", "the decrease was driven by an increase in factory inventory due to the increase in vehicles waiting for parts and our pre-buying of components to remove as much uncertainty around the component availability as possible .", "while share repurchases remains a lever we like to use to return capital to shareholders in the current supply constrained environment , we will concentrate much of our capital toward organic investments until the supply chain improves .", "with all the uncertainties surrounding the supply chain , forecasting 2022 is proving to be challenging .", "let me give you some preliminary views on next year , given where we stand today .", "first , the supply chain is likely to be an ongoing challenge into 2022 .", "supply chain issues have been with us to varying degrees since the pandemic first broke out in march of last year .", "but in the past quarter , the supply chain issues have intensified .", "additionally , we 're experiencing much higher costs than we anticipated .", "we 're taking steps to raise prices now that will benefit us next year .", "rest assured that we are working hand -
