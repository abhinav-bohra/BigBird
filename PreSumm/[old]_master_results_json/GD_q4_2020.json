year total of nearly $ 1 billion or 2.5 % of sales .", "you may recall , we had expected our capex to peak in 2020 at roughly 3 % of sales due to these shipyard investments .", "as you might expect , given the impact of the pandemic , we 've managed the timing of this capex spend prudently , and the result is three years , ' 19 , ' 20 , and ' 21 , at roughly 2.5 % of sales .", "this timing fully supports our columbia and block v build plan at electric boat .", "we then expect to trend back down and return to the more typical 2 % range by 2023 , consistent with our previous expectations .", "the net result is that we expect cash performance to continue to improve in 2021 to the 95 % to 100 % conversion range with year - over - year growth in free cash flow in 2021 and beyond .", "we ended the year with a cash balance of just over $ 2.8 billion and a net debt position of approximately $ 10.2 billion , reflecting a $ 1.7 billion reduction in the fourth quarter .", "our net interest expense in the fourth quarter was $ 120 million , bringing interest expense for the full year to $ 477 million .", "that compares to $ 110 million and $ 460 million in the comparable 2019 periods .", "our next scheduled debt maturities are for $ 2.5 billion in the second quarter and $ 500 million in the third quarter of this year .", "due to the timing of our cash flows , we may be in the commercial paper market for a transition period .", "but overall , we expect interest expense to drop to approximately $ 420 million in 2021 .", "we also paid $ 315 million in dividends in the fourth quarter , bringing the full year to $ 1.2 billion .", "and we repurchased 700,000 shares of stock in the quarter , bringing us to just over 4 million shares for the year for $ 600 million or $ 148 per share .", "with respect to our pension plans , we contributed $ 480 million in 2020 , and we expect that to decrease to approximately $ 360 million in 2021 , the majority of that in the second half .", "we had a 15.4 % effective tax rate in the fourth quarter , resulting in a full - year rate of 15.3 % , consistent with our previous guidance .", "looking ahead to 2021 , we expect a full - year effective tax rate of around 16 % .", "next , i 'd like to alert you to two accounting changes that we 've made in the fourth quarter , one related to segment reporting and the other related to pensions .", "the segment change is the one that phebe alluded to earlier and relates to our gdit and mission systems businesses .", "as the federal it services and defense electronics markets have evolved in recent years , we 've seen a significant increase in the customers ' prioritization of these capabilities and a shift to large - scale , end - to - end , highly engineered solutions that require critical mass and a broad array of technology services and hardware offerings to meet these customer demands .", "and more recently , the covid - 19 pandemic has only accelerated these trends with an expansion of remote connectivity and an added sense of urgency around required technology investments .", "as you 've seen , we 've responded to these trends over the past several years to further solidify our position as a market leader in this space , including the combination of our c4 and isr businesses to form mission systems and , of course , the acquisition of csra to reposition gdit as a leader in this market .", "with these integrations now complete , along with some considerable portfolio shaping and realignment , we are seeing the market dynamics continue to evolve .", "the two businesses share the same defense , intelligence , and federal civilian customer base and increasingly go to market together to meet these customers ' needs .", "in addition , we 're seeing considerable commonality and a significant complementary pull - through in their core offerings .", "so we will now be reporting them as one technology segment to better reflect the way we 're running the business as we position them to best compete in this robust market .", "to be clear , we 'll continue to provide transparency into the individual revenues and associated programmatic detail for each business , but of course , that becomes somewhat of a mixed bag as they increasingly engage in joint pursuits .", "with respect to pensions , we 've adopted an accelerated method for amortizing actuarial losses for our government pension plans to better align the timing under gaap with when the costs are allocated to contracts .", "because these costs are recovered on our contracts , this change had no impact on our net income or cash flow .", "however , you 'll note some differences between captions on the balance sheet and income statement as this accounting change has flowed through the financial statement .", "in particular , this reduces our corporate operating earnings , which we expect to be a negative $ 85 million in 2021 , and increases our other income , which is below the line , which we expect to be approximately $ 90 million in 2021 .", "the impact of these two income statement line items is equal and offsetting , so no impact to net income .", "and lastly , a little color on backlog .", "as of the end of the year , our funded backlog , total backlog , and total estimated contract value are all up compared to a year ago and , as phebe mentioned , at record highs .", "as an indication of the steady improvement since the peak of the disruption from the pandemic , aerospace book - to - bill returned to 1 times in the quarter , consistent with phebe 's remarks on what we 're seeing in terms of gulfstream demand .", "marine systems had an outstanding quarter with a book - to - bill of over 4 times due to the exercise of the $ 9.5 billion option for the columbia construction contract , providing opportunity for further long - term top - and bottom - line growth for marine systems .", "and a little bit of color on order activity for the technologies group for the quarter .", "they had a very nice quarter with some notable awards , including the final resolution on the deos program with a potential value of $ 4.4 billion ; the emits contract in support of the u.s. army in europe ; the state department 's gss 2.0 contract with a potential value of $ 3.3 billion ; and a contract with the air force to develop a digital engineering environment .", "importantly , given the conservative approach we take to reporting backlog , the preponderance of the value associated with these contracts does n't show up in orders or backlog at the time of award .", "in fact , only a portion of the awards shows up even in our idiq potential contract value .", "this is quite different from the way most of the peer group approaches this , so worth spending a moment on it .", "the way we book these awards is to conservatively estimate initial near - term value in the idiq category .", "then as the program progresses and the customer exercises orders , that value moves into the backlog and ultimately gets reported as revenue .", "and over time , incremental amounts of idiq value are added to that bucket as our visibility into the program evolves .", "as a result , over half of the group 's annual orders and revenue come out of this potential contract value category .", "so the headline numbers you see in the firm backlog belie the outstanding performance in the quarter , as reflected in the total estimated contract value for the group of just over $ 41 billion .", "with that , i 'll turn to our expectations for 2021 .", "so let me provide our operating forecast initially by business group and then on a companywide roll - up .", "in aerospace , we expect revenue to be about $ 8 billion , essentially flat with 2020 .", "operating margins will be about 12.5 % , leading to operating earnings of $ 1 billion , maybe slightly more .", "so what is driving this forecast and , in particular , the lower margins in 2021 when revenue is similar to 2020 ?", "you will recall that i told you last quarter , we will deliver 13 fewer g550s as that airplane is no longer in production .", "this leaves us with 13 fewer aircraft , not including the three slips from 2020 .", "so all up , 10 fewer aircraft .", "this reduction in revenue will be made up by a roughly $ 500 million increase in services across jet aviation and gulfstream at about 10 % lower operating margin .", "there are a lot of other puts and takes , but this gives you the big picture for the lower anticipated margins .", "by the way , our forecasted production delivery considers our backlog , our fourth - quarter orders , and our take on current demand .", "i fully expect 2022 will have better revenue and earnings , stimulated by the entry into service of the g700 in the fourth quarter and improving demand across the product lines as the economy recovers .", "in combat systems , we expect revenue of about $ 7.3 billion , an increase of approximately $ 100 million over 2020 .", "we expect the operating margin to be about 14.5 % and operating earnings to exceed last year by $ 20 million or 2 % .", "we look for revenue , earnings , and margin rate to grow quarter over quarter during the year with a particularly strong fourth quarter .", "after several years of good revenue growth , 2021 and 2022 will have modest growth .", "growth should resume in 2023 and beyond as several developmental programs move into production .", "the marine group is expected to have revenue of approximately $ 10.3 billion , an increase of over $ 300 million .", "operating margin in 2021 is anticipated to be around 8.3 % , driven in large part by increased work on the first two cost -
