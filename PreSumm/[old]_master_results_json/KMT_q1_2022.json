over - year and outpacing our normal quarter - over - quarter seasonal trend .", "year - over - year , we experienced growth in all regions and end markets due to our strategic initiatives and improvement in underlying demand .", "within our end markets , the strongest performance was in general engineering , energy and aerospace , with aero returning to growth this quarter after eight quarters of decline .", "transportation increased as well with 14 % growth year - over - year and outpaced the normal sequential decline .", "that said , increasing production cuts due to chip shortages and other supply chain challenges limited transportation customer demand in the quarter .", "our strong operating leverage resulted in adjusted ebitda margin improving significantly by 730 basis points to 18.6 % , demonstrating the benefits of the investments we have made over the last few years .", "operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased year - over - year to 21 % and sequentially was flat on lower sales .", "our target for operating expense remains at 20 % .", "adjusted earnings per share improved significantly to $ 0.44 compared to $ 0.03 in the prior year quarter .", "free cash flow was approximately breakeven , which is significantly better than our typical q1 use of cash .", "as a reminder , cash flow in the first quarter of the fiscal year is affected by the payment of performance - based compensation .", "we also began our recently announced share repurchase program , buying back $ 13 million of shares in the quarter , reflecting the high level of confidence we have in our growth and margin improvement initiatives and free cash flow generation .", "looking ahead , we believe the underlying market demand is strong .", "however , some customers ' production levels in the near - term are being affected to varying degrees by supply chain bottlenecks and other uncertainties .", "for example , there 's not yet been a notable improvement in the supply of semiconductor chips , which affects the metal cutting operations of our transportation and associated general engineering customers .", "and although we do not expect the situation to get worse , we believe it is likely to continue to constrain customer production levels in q2 .", "however , public comments for auto companies suggest the situation may start to improve in the second half of fiscal year 2022 .", "so , we expect revenue growth in transportation and associated general engineering to improve when our customers are able to increase production to meet the pent - up demand .", "another source of uncertainty is related to potential power disruptions in certain regions like china , where they are rationing power to varying degrees in some provinces , which could affect customer production levels .", "thus far , we 've not seen a material effect on customer demand , but it is a source of uncertainty going forward .", "nevertheless , despite the production slowdowns related to the chip shortages and other uncertainties , we expect q2 sales to be up 9 % to 14 % year - over - year and in line with the normal sequential growth pattern of 1 % to 2 % , which highlights the relative strength of our other end markets outside of transportation .", "now , as it relates to our own operations , inflation , supply chain bottlenecks and other uncertainties are presenting some challenges , but we believe to a far lesser extent than some of our customers and other manufacturers .", "we 're benefiting from our in - region / for - region local supply chain setup and inventory planning geared toward increasing on - time performance and availability levels .", "and our proactive pricing approach , we believe , will continue to be effective in dealing with inflationary pressures .", "so , as always , we 'll continue to focus on what we can control .", "and despite the existing market and supply chain uncertainties , we remain confident in driving strong underlying operating leverage for the full year .", "we 've always had world -

over - year to 21.2 % , approaching our target of 20 % .", "adjusted ebitda and operating margins were up significantly by 730 and 870 basis points , respectively .", "the strong year - over - year margin performance was due to significantly higher volume and associated absorption as well as strong manufacturing performance , including some simplification / modernization carryover benefits .", "price and mix were also positive contributors .", "these factors were partially offset by the removal of $ 15 million of temporary cost control actions taken in the prior year and a slight headwind from higher raw material costs beginning to flow through the p&l .", "the adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter of 26.9 % was lower year - over - year , primarily as a result of higher pre-tax income .", "we reported gaap earnings per share of $ 0.43 versus an earnings per share loss of $ 0.26 in the prior year period .", "on an adjusted basis , earnings per share was $ 0.44 per share versus $ 0.03 in the prior year .", "the main drivers of our improved adjusted earnings per share performance are highlighted on the bridge on slide five .", "the effect of operations this quarter were $ 0.33 , which included approximately $ 0.04 of simplification / modernization carryover benefits and the negative effect of approximately $ 0.12 from temporary cost control actions taken last year .", "the factors contributing to a substantial improvement are the same as the drivers of our strong margin performance this quarter that i just reviewed .", "taxes and currency contributed $ 0.04 and $ 0.02 , respectively .", "slide six and seven detail the performance of our segments this quarter .", "metal cutting sales in the first quarter increased 19 % organically year - over - year compared to a 23 % decline in the prior year period .", "a foreign currency benefit of 2 % was partially offset by fewer business days , which amounted to 1 % .", "all regions posted year - over - year sales growth with the americas leading at 22 % , followed by emea at 21 % .", "asia pacific posted more modest growth at 7 % , reflective of the timing of the economic recovery from the pandemic , reduced government subsidies for wind energy year - over - year as well as lower industrial activity , mainly in transportation .", "year - over - year , all end markets also posted gains this quarter with general engineering , leading with strong growth of 23 % .", "aerospace grew 19 % year - over - year and transportation , 14 % .", "energy grew 1 % year - over - year .", "adjusted operating margin increased substantially to 10.2 % , a 920 basis point increase over the prior year quarter .", "the increase was driven by higher volume , mix , favorable pricing versus raw material increases and manufacturing performance , including benefits from simplification / modernization carryover .", "these were partially offset by temporary cost control actions taken in the prior year .", "turning to slide seven for infrastructure .", "organic sales increased by 19 % year - over - year compared to a decline of 18 % in the prior year period .", "a foreign currency benefit of 3 % was partially offset by fewer business days of 1 % .", "again , all regions were positive year - over - year , with the americas leading at 28 % , emea at 8 % and asia pacific at 7 % .", "the strength in the americas was driven mainly by the improvement in the u.s. oil and gas market as seen in the continued increase in the u.s. land only rig count .", "by end market , energy was up 37 % year - over - year and general engineering was up 23 % .", "earthworks was also up 3 % , but down sequentially , reflecting the typical seasonal decline we experienced in q1 related to the traditional road construction season .", "adjusted operating margin improved by 760 basis points year - over - year to 14.1 % .", "this increase was driven by higher volume , favorable pricing exceeding raw material increases and manufacturing performance , including some simplification / modernization carryover benefits , partially offset by temporary cost control actions taken last year .", "now , turning to slide eight to review our balance sheet and free operating cash flow .", "we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position , healthy balance sheet and debt maturity profile .", "at quarter end , we had combined cash and revolver availability of $ 807 million and we 're well within our financial covenants .", "primary working capital decreased year - over - year to $ 608 million and was effectively flat on a sequential basis .", "on a percentage of sales basis , primary working capital was 32.1 % , a decrease both year - over - year and sequentially .", "net capital expenditures were $ 17 million , a decrease of approximately $ 22 million from the prior year .", "we continue to expect fiscal year ' 22 capital expenditures to be in the range of $ 110 million to $ 130 million .", "our first quarter free operating cash flow was negative $ 2 million , an improvement of $ 27 million from the prior year quarter , reflecting the strong sales and operating performance this quarter .", "we also paid the dividend of $ 17 million in the quarter .", "and finally , as chris noted , we repurchased $ 13 million of shares during the quarter under our recently announced repurchase program .", "the full balance sheet can be found on slide 14 in the appendix .", "starting with the second quarter , we currently expect sales to be up approximately 9 % to 14 % year - over - year and in the range of $ 480 million to $ 500 million .", "as chris mentioned , this implies sequential growth in line with our normal seasonality of around 1 % to 2 % , reflecting the challenges in the transportation end market and continued uncertainty in the general macro environment , offsetting strength in aerospace , energy and general engineering .", "at the midpoint , we 've assumed transportation sales to be approximately flat sequentially , given the continued production challenges our customers are dealing with due to the chip shortage .", "additionally , we do not expect disruptions due to supply chain or energy issues to worsen .", "lastly , given that we believe customers will continue to maintain their cautious behavior , we are n't forecasting meaningful restocking .", "adjusted operating income is expected to be a minimum of $ 46 million , implying continued strong operating leverage year - over - year , excluding $ 10 million of temporary cost actions taken last year .", "sequentially , higher raw material costs will begin to flow through the p&l as expected .", "when coupled with the timing of annual merit increases and incremental d&a , the sequential increase in costs will be approximately $ 10 million .", "lastly , for q2 , we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to remain in the range of 25 % to 28 % and free operating cash flow to be positive .", "turning to slide 10 regarding the full year .", "we believe the recovery is still underway , but the uncertainties we discuss make the pace and trajectory difficult to forecast .", "that said , we expect sales in the second half to exceed normal sequential patterns , assuming that transportation starts to recover in q3 and other market uncertainties do not worsen .", "on that basis , as chris mentioned , we expect year - over - year growth and strong operating leverage on an annual basis , excluding temporary cost control headwinds from the prior year .", "in terms of the sequential cadence , we continue to expect operating leverage to be more favorable in the first half due to the timing of strong net price versus raw material benefits and simplification / modernization carryover benefits .", "on a year - over - year basis , the second half will be affected by the above normal leverage we saw in the fourth quarter last year due to net price versus raw material benefits .", "the second half will also be affected by other inflationary pressures .", "nevertheless , we remain committed to driving strong operating leverage for the full year .", "the above average leverage in the first half and these effects in the second half serve as a reminder of the unevenness that can occur in year - over - year operating leverage comparisons from quarter - to - quarter .", "this is why , as we 've discussed , looking at leverage over a longer time frame , such as the full year , is more representative of the underlying performance of the business .", "moving on to other variables , they are essentially unchanged from last quarter .", "this includes depreciation and amortization increasing $ 15 million to $ 20 million year - over - year to a range of $ 140 million to $ 145 million , capital expenditures to be in the range of $ 110 million to $ 130 million and working capital to trend toward our 30 % goal by fiscal year - end .", "together , over the full year , these assumptions translate to free operating cash flow generation at approximately 100 % of adjusted net income , in line with our long - term target , further demonstrating our progress transforming the company .", "let me take a few minutes to summarize .", "we posted an excellent quarter and is demonstrated by our strong operating leverage , simplification / modernization investments are contributing to improved financial performance .", "furthermore , our product innovations and commercial and operational excellence initiatives have well positioned us to drive share gain and improve margins as markets continue to recover .", "and although supply chain bottlenecks and other uncertainties are limiting visibility , we currently expect to exceed normal sequential quarterly growth patterns in the second half of fiscal year 2022 and are confident in driving strong full year operating leverage .", "strength of our balance sheet and free operating cash flow gives us the flexibility to both continue investing in our strategic initiatives and optimize capital allocation .", "and i remain fully confident we will meet our adjusted ebitda profitability target of 24 % to 26 % when sales reached the range of $ 2.5 billion to $ 2.6 billion ."], "summary_gold": "q1 adjusted earnings per share $ 0.44 .<q>q1 earnings per share $ 0.43 .<q>q1 sales rose 21 percent to $ 484 million .<q>sees q2 sales up 9 to 14 percent .<q>q2 sales expected to be up 9 -
