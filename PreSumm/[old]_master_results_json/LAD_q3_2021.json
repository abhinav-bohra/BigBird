effectively move vehicles to better match supply and demand , and increase our retail versus wholesale mix .", "turning to parts and service .", "same - store revenues increased 7.3 % over last year .", "the growth was distributed across all business lines except warranty .", "we anticipate a continued tailwind benefiting service into 2022 , as the substantial losses in the miles - driven rebounds and well positions our highest profit margin business line .", "with sg&a , we are focused on improving productivity of our personnel , targeting investments in marketing , and further leveraging our fixed expenses .", "these actions will improve our gross profit throughput when margins subside .", "we believe that these actions reduce our normalized sg&a levels at least 300 basis points below pre-covid levels , or to approximately 65 % of gross profit .", "as our teams prepare their 2022 annual operating plans , they remain hyper - focused on executing to ensure the topline growth is aligned with further productivity improvements that result from our investment in the omnichannel model wherever , whenever , and however customers choose .", "these efforts , along with our exploration of adjacencies , translate to significant potential to increase leverage and drive additional profit as expected in our 2025 plan .", "for the quarter , we generated over $ 530 million of adjusted ebitda , a 104 % increase over 2020 .", "and $ 304 million of free cash flow defined as adjusted ebitda plus stock -
