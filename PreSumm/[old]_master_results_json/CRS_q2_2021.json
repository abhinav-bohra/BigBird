year fiscal ' 21 interest expense to be about $ 35 million .", "the second is depreciation and amortization .", "our guidance for fiscal year 2021 remains at $ 130 million .", "through six months , we reported depreciation and amortization of $ 60 million .", "now turning to slide 10 and our sao segment results .", "net sales for the quarter were $ 300.4 million or $ 251.6 million , excluding surcharge .", "compared to the second quarter last year , sales excluding surcharge decreased 34 % on 32 % lower volume .", "sequentially sales , excluding surcharge , were essentially flat on 11 % lower volume .", "the sequential results reflect similar demand conditions in our largest end - use market of aerospace and defense as the supply chain continues to deal with near - term reductions in oem build rates .", "this was partially offset by stronger shipments in transportation as north american light vehicle production continues to ramp back up .", "the industrial and consumer end - use market saw weaker demand in general industrial applications that was partially offset by higher demand for consumer applications .", "sao reported an operating loss of $ 11.6 million for the current quarter .", "the same quarter a year ago , sao 's operating income was $ 76.3 million ; and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 , sao reported an operating loss of $ 18.6 million .", "the year - over - year reduction in operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower volume as well as the negative income statement impacts of reducing inventory , partially offset by the actions taken to reduce operating costs .", "during the current quarter , sao reduced inventory by approximately $ 58 million and year - to - date has reduced inventory by $ 131 million .", "sequentially , the lower operating loss is principally the result of lower volume , offset by a favorable product mix and a less pronounced impact of the inventory reduction relative to the first quarter due in part to rising raw material prices .", "in addition , the current quarter 's results reflect approximately $ 3.2 million of direct incremental costs associated with our efforts to protect our facilities and employees in light of covid - 19 .", "this compares with $ 7.3 million in covid - 19 costs in q1 , which as we disclosed last quarter , included $ 3.1 million associated with a bad debt write off .", "looking ahead , we expect demand conditions across most end -

19 related costs in the upcoming third quarter .", "now turning to slide 11 and our pep segment results .", "net sales , excluding surcharge , were $ 54.1 million , which were down 48 % from the same quarter a year ago and down 12 % sequentially .", "the year - over - year decline in sales was driven by market headwinds , largely due to the global pandemic .", "additionally , sales in the energy end - use market declined as a result of our exit of the amega west oil and gas business in the first quarter of this fiscal year .", "the sequential decline in sales reflects near - term demand pressures in aerospace and defense and medical end - use markets due primarily to the impact of a global pandemic and its impact on aircraft oem build rates and medical elective procedures .", "these declines were partially offset by modest growth in sales in our distribution business .", "in the current quarter , pep reported an operating loss of $ 7.2 million .", "this compares to an operating loss of $ 3.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and operating income of $ 0.4 million in the same quarter last year .", "the sequential operating results reflect the unfavorable impacts of lower sales .", "we continue to drive opportunities for incremental cost reductions across the businesses while realizing the ongoing benefits of the cost reduction and portfolio actions already taken .", "as we look ahead , we believe that demand conditions will gradually begin to improve in the coming quarters , and we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce cost and manage working capital closely all while maintaining our ability to meet future anticipated demand .", "we currently anticipate pep will generate an operating loss of $ 3 million to $ 5 million in our upcoming third quarter .", "now turning to slide 12 and a review of free cash flow .", "in the current quarter , we generated $ 84 million of cash from operating activities .", "this cash generation was driven by improvements in working capital , primarily inventory .", "within the quarter , we decreased inventory by $ 71 million .", "this reduction is substantial on the result of considerable effort to continue to execute against our targeted inventory reduction programs across our facilities .", "over the last three quarters , beginning with our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 , we 've reduced inventory by $ 273 million .", "we remain in constant communication with key customers to ensure that we maintain the appropriate inventory levels and lead times are aligned as demand patterns change .", "in the second quarter , we spent $ 27 million on capital expenditures .", "we remain on track to spend about $ 120 million in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2021 as planned .", "as a reminder , our fiscal year 2021 capital spend includes completing the $ 100 million multiyear hot strip mill project , which will come online later this fiscal year .", "tony will comment on the capabilities of the new hot strip mill and how it fits into our strategy in the coming slides .", "with those highlights in mind , we generated $ 51 million of free cash flow in the quarter .", "from a liquidity perspective , we ended the current quarter with total liquidity of $ 665 million , including $ 271 million of cash and $ 394 million of available borrowings under our credit facility .", "our focus on liquidity is essential in the near -
