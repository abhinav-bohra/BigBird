driven volatility , allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency increased 47.3 % from the prior year quarter but is 21 % lower than the same period in 2019 .", "auto severity increases persisted relative to the prior year quarter and prepandemic periods across coverages , largely driven by the shift in mix to more severe , higher - speed auto accidents and rising inflationary impacts in both used car values and replacement part costs .", "the incurred severity increases are running higher than general inflation , which are reflected in the recorded combined ratio .", "to counteract rising severity , we are leveraging advanced claim capabilities , predictive modeling , advanced photo and video utilization and deep expertise in repair process management to enable a scaled response to inflation and supply constraints .", "targeted price increases will also be implemented , as necessary , to maintain attractive auto insurance returns .", "now let 's shift to slide 10 , which highlights investment performance for the second quarter .", "net investment income totaled $ 974 million in the quarter , which was $ 754 million above the prior year quarter , driven by higher performance -
