fought ability to execute , i am pleased to report that we are again raising our full - year earnings guidance .", "bob will give more details shortly .", "on a two - year basis , our retail is up 14 % , reflecting continued growth in powersports , driven by strong underlying consumer demand .", "as expected , our second quarter north american retail sales were down 28 % from the 57 % increase reported in the second quarter of 2020 .", "the gating factor for retail sales today compared to a year ago is low dealer inventory driven by supply chain impacts on delivery .", "retail sales would have likely been significantly higher without these impacts .", "despite the supply impacts to orv retail sales , market share again grew during the quarter .", "our orv business gained over 1 percentage point of market share in both atvs and side -

digit percent , which is similar to pre-pandemic levels .", "lastly , we have analyzed shipping patterns to our dealers by tiers , volumes and regions and were all within 1 % of pre-pandemic levels .", "the bottom line is that there 's high confidence in the presold order process , which is why it continues to be a competitive advantage in this very tight inventory environment .", "our manufacturing plants are operating at peak supply chain constrained capacity .", "our manufacturing , supply chain and logistics teams continue to execute at a very high level , managing the ever -

year pre-covid basis with approximately 300,000 new customers coming into the polaris family over the first half of 2021 .", "the mix of new to existing customers has remained high at over 70 % of the total customers for orv , motorcycles , snowmobiles and boats .", "our existing customers continue to grow at a healthy rate .", "and lastly , it 's exciting to see the diversity of our customers also grow , led by hispanic and female riders joining the polaris family .", "overall customer demand in total remains very strong .", "we track repurchase rates for our customers , which are increasing on a year - over - year basis .", "this provides us with the confidence that our customers intend to remain with the sport .", "the polaris team is battling each day for the components needed to meet the strong demand of our consumers .", "and as our results this quarter indicate , we are winning many of those battles .", "second - quarter sales were up 40 % on a gaap and adjusted basis versus the prior year .", "shipments and sales improved considerably across all segments orv , motorcycles , adjacent markets , aftermarket and boats .", "second - quarter earnings per share on a gaap basis was $ 2.52 .", "adjusted earnings per share was $ 2.70 , which was up 108 % for the quarter , exceeding our expectations .", "this strong performance was driven by a combination of revenue growth , lower promotional costs , increased pricing and operating expense leverage during the quarter partially offset by higher input costs .", "adjusted gross margins were up approximately 310 basis points year over year , primarily due to lower promotional and floor plan financing costs driven by low dealer inventory and strong demand , which requires minimal promotional dollars to drive retail .", "this was muted somewhat by higher input costs associated with supply chain constraints , including logistics , commodity and labor cost pressures .", "operating expenses were down considerably due to the goodwill and intangible asset impairments recognized in q2 2020 .", "adjusted operating expenses were up 33 % in the quarter relative to q2 2020 , which was heavily impacted by short - term cost actions taken to offset covid - 19 shutdowns .", "q2 2021 operating expenses grew sequentially versus the prior quarter due to the timing of legal , sales and marketing and engineering expenses along with staffing additions .", "operating expenses are expected to be down slightly versus the q2 run rate in the second half of 2021 .", "foreign exchange also had a positive impact on our quarterly results , primarily driven by the canadian dollar .", "from a segment reporting perspective , all segments reported increased sales for the quarter driven by strong demand .", "orv / snowmobile segment sales were up 38 % .", "motorcycles were up 50 % , adjacent markets increased 98 % , aftermarket was up 15 % and boats increased 49 % during the second quarter relative to q2 2020 , which was adversely impacted by covid - 19 closures .", "average selling prices for all segments were up , orv increased about 13 % , motorcycles were up approximately 8 % , adjacent markets increased 10 % and boats were up 14 % for the quarter .", "all segments benefited from continued lower promotional costs given high demand and the lack of product in the channel .", "pricing actions taken in the quarter and model mix also had a favorable impact .", "our international sales increased 64 % during the quarter , with all regions and segments growing sales as the heavily pandemic impacted countries began to open their economies again .", "currency added 15 percentage points to the international growth for the quarter .", "and lastly , our parts , garments and accessories sales increased 35 % during the quarter , driven by increased demand across all segments and categories of that business .", "moving on to our guidance for 2021 .", "given the stronger - than - anticipated performance in the second quarter , we are increasing our full - year adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2021 and now expect earnings to be in the range of $ 9.35 to $ 9.60 per diluted share .", "the increase is driven by the expectation that the even lower promotional environment we experienced in the second quarter will continue through the second half as demand is expected to remain high and dealer inventory levels low for the remainder of the year .", "additionally , we expect price increases and surcharges for the upcoming model year to provide incremental benefit in the fourth quarter .", "these benefits are partially offset by the escalating input costs , particularly component cost increases driven by both the global supply chain shortage and higher commodity prices , along with the increased cost from manufacturing inefficiencies , increased expedites and higher logistics costs .", "overall , for the full year , we are pleased that our product pricing and promotional cost reductions are offsetting the expected annualized incremental cost headwinds on a dollar basis .", "we are narrowing our total company sales growth guidance by holding the upper end of our sales guidance range at 21 % and raising the lower end of the range to 19 % given our sales growth performance to date .", "our dealers have ample presold orders in hand that combined with additional product would typically allow us to increase the top end of our sales guidance range .", "however , given the uncertainty around component supply , we are leaving the upper end of our sales guidance unchanged at this time .", "adjusted gross profit margins are now expected to be down in the range of 40 to 70 basis points .", "this is an improvement from our previously issued guidance and primarily due to the higher - than - expected margins in the second quarter which was driven largely by lower current quarter promotional costs and the timing of promotions accrual adjustments as dealer inventory continued to decline .", "adjusted operating expenses are now expected to improve 90 to 120 basis points as a percentage of sales versus last year given the higher sales growth expectations .", "income from financial services is now expected to be down in the mid-20s percent range driven by the historically low dealer inventory levels , as well as lower retail financing income due to lower penetration rates of our retail providers as more customers are buying with cash and / or have more time to shop their financing needs with other financing sources given the delays in delivery .", "guidance for the remainder of the p&l items remains materially unchanged from our previously issued guidance .", "while our full - year earnings guidance improved as a result of our year - to - date performance , and the pricing actions being implemented at the upcoming model year changeover , our second half performance is expected to be down compared to the second half of 2020 and sequentially from our reported first half results .", "let me give some clarity on the second half cadence for earnings .", "our first half 2021 earnings per share finished at $ 4.99 , a 228 % increase over the first half of 2020 .", "given our full - year revised guidance , the second half earnings per share equates to a range of $ 4.36 to $ 4.61 per diluted share , a decrease of 26 to 30 % on a year - over - year basis and an 8 to 13 % decline on a sequential basis from the first half of 2021 .", "this reduction in earnings per share on a sequential basis is driven by a number of positive and negative factors , including increases in input costs in the second half of the year , principally commodities , labor , expedite and rework costs related to supply chain shortages , as well as unprecedented ocean and truck transportation rates and the timing of operating expense spend .", "these costs are expected to be partially offset by increased product pricing through both low promotions , higher base prices and surcharges .", "on a two - year basis , our second half earnings per share results at the high end of the range are expected to be up over 30 % compared to the second half of 2019 .", "i would also add that the quarterly cadence for earnings per share in the second half of 2021 is more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter with approximately 60 % of our second half earnings per share occurring in q4 .", "this is driven by a couple of key factors : first , the majority of our high margins , no check snowmobiles wo n't ship until q4 as compared to a stronger q3 shipping quarter in 2020 .", "second , while we are increasing selling prices and adding surcharges to offset a portion of the cost increases .", "these increases do not take effect until late q3 , thus having a larger impact in q4 .", "let me quickly cover our sales expectations by segment .", "orv snowmobile sales guidance remain unchanged at up high teens percent .", "the only modification is the timing of shipments , as indicated earlier , with more snowmobiles being shipped in the fourth quarter of 2021 versus prior year , given the supply chain disruptions and the timing of our pricing actions hitting q4 more heavily than q3 .", "motorcycle sales are anticipated to be up low 30 % , down slightly from prior guidance .", "while we continue to expect our motorcycle business to grow and take share for the year , supply chain challenges are impacting production enough to possibly shift to some shipments into 2022 .", "in the remaining segments , global adjacent markets , aftermarket and boats , we are increasing our sales expectations given the sales growth realized through the first half of 2021 .", "year - to - date second quarter operating cash flow finished at 196 million , down 37 % compared to the same period last year , driven by an increase in factory inventory due to the supply chain inefficiencies .", "our expected full - year cash flow performance remains unchanged at down mid-30 % compared to last year .", "during the second quarter , we spent $ 111 million on share repurchases .", "we will continue to prioritize organic investments in our business , along with share buybacks throughout the remainder of the year , subject to market conditions .", "this quarter 's results demonstrated the drive and determination of the polaris team in the face of ongoing challenges .", "we will continue to effectively manage a challenging environment to meet consumer demand .", "the underlying earnings power of the company remains strong as does our financial health .", "demand for our products remains robust , and we do not see that changing in the medium to long term .", "our supply chain remains the top challenge for the company with component supply not expected to improve until sometime late 2021 or even early 2022 .", "and as a result , dealer inventories are not expected to return to normalized levels until sometime in late 2022 or even early 2023 .", "while much of the focus has been on the supply chain , innovation continues to be the lifeblood of polaris , and we have a number of new products coming , including the all - new electric ranger , along with exciting model year 2022 launches .", "let me close by reiterating that we 're winning in a challenging environment , and we remain focused on navigating through the current supply chain challenges and rising input costs to deliver products our customers are demanding while at the same time , delivering improved results and value to our shareholders ."], "summary_gold": "compname reports qtrly adjusted net income $ 2.70 / shr .<q>polaris second quarter 2021 earnings results .<q>q2 earnings per share $ 2.52 .<q>qtrly adjusted net income was $ 2.70 per share .<q>q2 adjusted sales increased 40 % to $ 2,117 million .<q>polaris increased its full year 2021 earnings guidance and now expects earnings to be in range of $ 9.35 to $ 9.60 per diluted share .<q>full year 2021 adjusted sales guidance was narrowed and is now expected to be up 19 % to 21 % over prior year .<q>supply chain -
