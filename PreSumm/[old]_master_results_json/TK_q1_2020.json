term view on tgp 's business and prospects .", "with a strengthening financial foundation and deleveraging that is expected to provide financial flexibility , market - leading positions and a very compelling valuation at a 4 times pe ratio based on the midpoint of its 2020 financial guidance , we believe tgp has significant long - term value potential which benefits teekay , given our full alignment of interest and position as the largest common unitholder .", "for every $ 1 per unit increase in tgp 's unit price , teekay 's equity interest would increase by $ 0.37 per share or 12 % based on yesterday 's closing price of $ 3.11 per share .", "teekay tankers reported the highest quarterly adjusted profit , generating total adjusted ebitda of $ 155 million , up from $ 63 million in the same period of the prior year , and adjusted net income of $ 110 million or $ 3.27 per share in the first quarter , an improvement from $ 15 million or $ 0.44 per share in the same period of the prior year .", "tnk 's results were driven by stronger spot tanker rates , with rates reaching the highest q1 levels in the past decade .", "we also expect tnk 's q2 results to be strong based on the spot rates secured so far in q2 , with 69 % of q2 suezmax days fixed that $ 52,100 per day and 62 % of our q2 aframax size vessels fixed at $ 33,600 per day compared to $ 49,100 per day and $ 34,500 per day in the first quarter , respectively .", "during the quarter , tnk continued to bolster its balance sheet from its strong operating cash flows and proceeds from asset sales .", "tnk reduced its net debt by approximately $ 200 million or over 20 % since the beginning of the year , and increased its total liquidity to $ 368 million and have subsequently continued to make meaningful progress on both fronts .", "tnk also took advantage of the market strength and fixed up another nine vessels on fixed rate contracts ranging between six months and two years , but most of which are for one year , at very attractive rates .", "in total , tnk has now fixed up 13 vessels on fixed rate contracts totaling approximately $ 170 million of forward fixed rate revenues .", "these new contracts also reduce tnk's free cash flow breakeven to approximately $ 10,500 per day , which is expected to enable tnk to create shareholder value in almost any tanker market .", "looking ahead , while teekay has lowered its breakeven through his time charter coverage , it continues to maintain meaningful operating leverage as highlighted in the graph on the bottom right -

in pricing .", "looking at the graph on the slide , teekay corporation has reduced its pro forma consolidated net debt by $ 830 [ phonetic ] million or 19 % since the beginning of 2019 and reduced its pro forma net debt to ebitda from a peak of 9 times to 4.5 times , while increasing our pro forma consolidated liquidity to over $ 900 million .", "we have also reduced teekay parent 's pro forma net debt by approximately $ 100 million or 25 % since the beginning of 2019 and reduced our daughter debt guarantees to under $ 90 million as of march 31 , which we expect will be completely eliminated by the end of 2020 , while also holding a healthy pro forma liquidity position of $ 150 million .", "in short , we have made great progress in reducing our debt , eliminating near - term maturities , reducing remaining exposure to the offshore segment and significantly improving our financial position all around .", "as you have heard , it was a very busy quarter , with record tgp and tnk earnings and executing on our strategic priorities , which included completing various asset sales securing new charter contracts across the group and eliminating tgp idrs in exchange for new tgp common units .", "in addition , in mid-april , we also published our 2019 sustainability report , which is our 10th consecutive annual sustainability report .", "as a leading oil and gas transportation company , teekay cannot separate ourselves from the longer -
