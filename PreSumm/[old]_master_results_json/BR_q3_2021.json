digit growth in data and analytics was offset by lower interest income from custodied accounts in our funds processing business .", "customer communications revenues were also flat with double - digit growth in our high - margin digital products , offset by lower print volumes due in part to the pandemic - depressed activity levels .", "we expect growth in both our data - driven solutions and customer communications business to pick up in the fourth quarter as these headwinds ease .", "wealth and investment management revenues rose 7 % , driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading .", "capital markets revenues fell 1 % of strong growth from international sales , was offset by $ 6 million in lower license revenues , which declined as expected .", "as we said last quarter , this flat revenue growth will continue in the q4 ' 21 before picking up in fiscal year ' 22 .", "let 's turn to page 10 , where we show more detail on volume trends .", "broadridge 's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends , including stock record growth .", "over the past decade , record growth across equity , mutual funds and etf has grown 6 % to 8 % .", "recently , equity record growth has accelerated to 11 % in q4 ' 20 and continued to increase through the year to 20 % in q3 ' 21 , surpassing the estimates from our january testing .", "as i said , we expect these growth trends to continue and reach 25 % in q4 ' 21 .", "mutual fund and etf record growth picked up as well to 7 % , more in line with our historical growth rates .", "we are modeling a return to more moderate mid-single - digit growth across both equity , mutual fund etf records for fiscal year ' 22 , with stronger growth in the seasonally smaller first half and more moderate growth in the second half .", "touching briefly on trade volumes , which you 'll see on the bottom of this slide .", "this is the fifth consecutive quarter of aggregate double - digit volume growth .", "this growth reflects the increase in volatility in retail investor engagement over the past year , which continued to be quite strong well into the third quarter .", "more recently , trading volatility subsided during the second half of march , and we expect tougher trading volume comps in q4 .", "let 's move to slide 11 for a closer look at the drivers of our recurring revenue .", "organic growth at a very healthy 7 % continues to be the largest component of our recurring revenue growth , and new sales remains the biggest driver with strong growth contribution from both ics and gto .", "we also continued our long track record of revenue retention above 97 % .", "internal growth contributed another three points as growth in ics regulatory volumes more than offset the decline in gto license revenue .", "we 've now fully lapped all of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions .", "looking ahead to the fourth quarter , we expect itiviti to add three points to fourth quarter recurring revenue growth .", "total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual , reaching 11 % , with distribution revenue contributing three points due to the increased mailings that correspond with the high record growth and the increased event - driven activity this quarter .", "moving forward , we continue to expect the low to no-margin distribution revenue to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher - margin digital revenue across our governance business .", "event - driven communications remain an integral part of our client offering .", "event - driven revenues have climbed over the past four quarters to be more in line with our historical norms of about $ 50 million a quarter and reached $ 74 million in the third quarter , well above last year 's unusually low $ 39 million .", "broadridge benefited from an increase in mutual fund proxy activity as well as a rebound in proxy contest volumes and capital markets transactions .", "we expect fiscal ' 21 event -

term growth , have a short - term impact on margin expansion , but we remain on track to deliver approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year , right in line with our fiscal year ' 21 guidance and 3 - year growth objectives .", "this formula , forgoing near - term margin expansion and consistently investing in our technology platforms and products to drive long - term sustainable recurring revenue growth , will continue to be an important part of how we manage our business .", "as a chief financial officer focused on long - term growth , it 's encouraging to see us making these types of investments across all of our product lines , giving us momentum toward future growth .", "our $ 124 million closed sales year - to - date are in line with our performance over the same period last year .", "we continue to see strong demand for our ics solutions , including regulatory and issuer communications and data solutions .", "we remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $ 190 million to $ 235 million for closed sales , which implies a fourth quarter range of $ 66 million to $ 111 million .", "historically , the closed sales performance in the last quarter of the year has been impacted by the timing of larger deals .", "a handful of larger signings could propel us to the top end of our guidance range , and conversely , delays could put us at the lower end .", "and i 'll also note that we continue to feel good about our recurring revenue backlog , which was 12 % of our fiscal ' 20 recurring revenues as of q4 ' 20 and gives us great visibility into our top line growth .", "moving to capital allocation on the following slide .", "we generated $ 136 million of free cash flow year - to - date , up $ 54 million over the first nine months of fiscal year ' 20 driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management .", "during the first nine months of the fiscal year , we invested $ 205 million in building out our industry platforms and another $ 71 million in capex and software spending .", "our m&a investment through the first nine months of the year was 0 , but that will change with our announced $ 2.5 billion acquisition of itiviti , which i 'll touch on in a moment .", "even after completing the itiviti acquisition , broadridge will remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy , which prioritizes internal investment , growing our dividend , m&a and returning excess capital to shareholders .", "importantly , we are also committed to maintaining an investment - grade credit rating , which means we 'll prioritize debt paydown over share repurchases and expect to limit ourselves to smaller tuck - in m&a opportunities over the next several quarters .", "given our strong free cash flow , we believe that we can comfortably achieve our new 2.5 times leverage target by the end of fiscal year ' 23 .", "turning to capital returns on the right - hand side of the slide , our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45 % payout ratio .", "on slide 16 , we are on track to close the itiviti acquisition in the coming weeks .", "so let me take a moment to give you some additional clarity about the expected impact that itiviti will have on our financial performance .", "i 'll start with fiscal year ' 21 .", "we expect itiviti to add $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion or one point to our full year recurring revenue growth , which equates to three points to our fourth quarter growth .", "and the acquisition is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted earnings per share growth .", "in fiscal year ' 22 , we expect itiviti to add approximately $ 250 million or about eight points to our recurring revenue growth .", "and we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately two to three points or roughly $ 0.10 to $ 0.15 to adjusted earnings per share growth .", "please note that itiviti's results in both fiscal year ' 21 and fiscal year ' 22 will be negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of acquired revenue , which will reduce revenue recognition by approximately $ 30 million in total with 2/3 of that impact in fiscal ' 22 .", "this revenue haircut is incorporated in the numbers that i just shared with you .", "finally , i want to reiterate the commentary that i gave you when we announced the deal , about the impact on our 3 -
