ready obligations to leases and therefore to apply lease accounting guidance .", "you will note that our income statement now has separate line items for cdmo services and cdmo leases .", "this change should also allow you to better understand the underlying fundamentals of our cdmo service - related revenue .", "under the lease accounting guidance , based on uncertainty regarding collectability of the full contracted amount , we converted to a cash basis of accounting for the barda task order .", "accordingly , in the third quarter we adjusted our revenue to align with the $ 315 million of cumulative cash collected under the barda task order from may 2020 through september 2021 .", "looking ahead to the fourth quarter , pursuant to the termination of the ciadm agreement , we expect to recognize $ 215 million of revenue , comprised of $ 155 million of task order closeout payments and the $ 60 million of deferred revenue and other i just discussed .", "termination of the ciadm agreement also results in asset write - downs of approximately $ 38 million .", "so we expect the net addition to pre-tax income in the fourth quarter related to this event to be approximately $ 177 million .", "during the quarter , our new business wins were $ 118 million , a very strong performance for the organization , primarily reflecting the impact of the providence therapeutics contract for covid - related work .", "as for backlog , the sequential change reflects the impact of the termination of the barda task order .", "regarding the opportunity funnel , the period - to - period decrease reflects both the conversion of opportunities into secured business as well as two large contract opportunities that we did not win .", "one is a company that decided to take the work in - house and the other is one that decided to defer the work to a future time .", "that said , we continue to identify new leads and secure new business and this period - to - period fluctuation is not surprising as we pursue opportunities .", "lastly , gross margins and profitability .", "as we have previously discussed , our gross margins are primarily driven by revenue mix across several dimensions : product sales proportion of products versus services and the types of services delivered .", "the adjusted gross margins on our products continue to remain stable and consistent with historical patterns .", "on the cdmo services side however , we are currently seeing several trends which are applying pressure to margins .", "these include : lower capacity utilization for drug substance production at bayview while it is solely dedicated to j&j 's covid - 19 vaccine candidate ; the additional investments we are making at bayview in support of our quality enhancement plan ; and higher raw material costs than originally anticipated .", "while these factors are currently producing cdmo gross margins below our expectations over time we anticipate that cdmo profitability will improve as we continue to grow our cdmo revenue base , increase network utilization drive a higher mix of drug substance manufacturing , realize scale efficiencies and improve productivity .", "with that let 's turn to the third quarter numbers .", "as indicated on slide 12 highlights include total revenues of $ 329 million below the prior year period and our guidance principally due to the $ 86 million reversal of revenue for the barda task order i mentioned earlier .", "and adjusted negative -- adjusted ebitda of negative $ 3 million and adjusted net loss of $ 19 million both significantly below the prior year period and due to a variety of factors which we will discuss in a moment .", "other key items in the quarter include : narcan nasal spray sales were $ 133 million an increase over the prior year reflecting a clear continuation of this franchise 's robust performance and driven by continued strong demand for this critical drug device combination product for opioid overdose reversal across both the retail and public interest channels in the united states as well as increased canadian sales .", "acam2000 sales were $ 81 million higher than the prior year due to timing of deliveries following our announcement in july of the us government 's exercise of the second option under the existing 10 - year procurement contract .", "as we have stated previously we expect to complete all related deliveries under this option exercise by the end of 2021 .", "anthrax vaccine sales were $ 16 million lower than the prior year due to timing of deliveries as the modifications of the barda contract for av7909 was not made until the last day of the quarter .", "other product sales were $ 41 million consistent with the prior year .", "and cdmo revenues came in at $ 42 million lower than the prior year period due primarily to our move to cash basis revenue accounting for the barda task order and partially offset by $ 38 million in out - of - period adjustments related to our change in cdmo services revenue recognition policy which will be detailed in our 10 - q filing .", "looking beyond revenue we are now breaking out cost of goods sold between product and cdmo services .", "product cost of goods sold in the quarter were $ 103 million a $ 17 million decrease from the prior year largely due to one - time charges in the prior year offset by increases in the current year due to higher product sales .", "cdmo cost of goods sold were $ 114 million an $ 86 million increase over the prior year reflecting the impact of out - of - period adjustments of $ 37 million as well as incremental costs at our bayview facility as mentioned previously .", "gross r&d expense of $ 50 million lower than the prior year primarily reflecting a non-recurring $ 29 million impairment charge in the prior year .", "net r&d expense of $ 33 million or 10 % of adjusted revenue in line with the prior year .", "sg&a spend of $ 82 million or 25 % of total revenues an increase over the prior year reflecting growth in headcount and professional services .", "and gross margin was 30 % in the quarter .", "as i mentioned earlier we are now providing two additional gross margin metrics .", "adjusted product gross margin was 62 % of product sales consistent with the prior period .", "and adjusted cdmo services gross margin was 10 % lower than the prior period primarily reflecting the impact of increased operating costs at our bayview facility and the implementation of our quality enhancement plan .", "turning to slide 13 we will now review our key cdmo metrics .", "in the third quarter we secured new business of $ 118 million reflecting robust demand for our services .", "as of september 30 the rolling backlog was just over $ 1 billion a 9 % decline from the second quarter reflecting the impact of the barda task order termination .", "and lastly as of september 30 the opportunity funnel was $ 284 million down from $ 672 million at june 30 as i said before primarily reflecting a significant new business win in the current quarter as well as the loss of two large opportunities .", "on slide 14 you can see the sequential trends in these metrics over the last five reporting periods .", "we look forward to making further progress in this important part of our business as we move forward from here .", "moving on to slide 15 , i 'll touch on select balance sheet and cash flow highlights .", "we ended the third quarter in a strong liquidity position , with $ 404 million in cash and undrawn revolver capacity of just under $ 600 million .", "our net debt position was $ 454 million , and our ratio of net debt to trailing 12 month adjusted ebitda was one times .", "our year -
