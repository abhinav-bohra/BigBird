year underwriting fees of $ 276.2 million each more than tripled year - over - year .", "this business experienced the true step up in 2020 , in large part due to the expansion of our capabilities that allowed us to work on a variety of assignments for our clients , including ipos , follow -

border deal since the onset of the pandemic .", "our restructuring team ranked number 2 in the league tables for number of announced us transactions in 2020 .", "we believe that our restructuring franchise is even stronger than the league table indicates due to our diversified business base of working with both debtor and creditor clients , as well as working on both in -
