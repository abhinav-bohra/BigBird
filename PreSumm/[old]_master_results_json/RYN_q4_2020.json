year result , which is attributable to a partial year contribution of our pope resources acquisition as well as a sharp increase in log pricing given strong domestic demand and robust lumber markets .", "in our new zealand timber segment , full year adjusted ebitda declined 27 % to $ 55 million .", "the year -
