up of staff , as scott has discussed .", "moving forward , we anticipate education segment profit margins will be approximately 6 % in fiscal 2022 , representing an increase of more than 100 basis points compared to pre-covid levels , resulting from a sustained uplift in labor efficiency and higher disinfection revenue .", "revenue within our technical solutions segment grew 21 % to [ technical issues ] million , aided by continued strong growth in our emerging electric vehicle charging infrastructure business , improved access to client sites and strengthened client demand for energy efficient solutions .", "segment operating income returned to profitability and generated an operating profit margin of 12.8 % .", "we ended the fourth quarter with $ 62.8 million in cash and cash equivalents , compared to $ 394.2 million with total debt of $ 1.06 billion as of october 31 , 2021 .", "our total debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda , including standby letters of credit was 1.9 times at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 .", "as for our dividends , i am pleased to report the board approved a 2.6 % increase in our quarterly dividend to $ 19.5 to be paid out in february .", "now , i 'll briefly discuss our outlook .", "as scott mentioned , our guidance for full year fiscal 2022 adjusted income from continuing operations is a range of $ 3.30 to $ 3.55 per diluted share .", "our adjusted earnings forecast reflects a favorable growth outlook across our business segments in fiscal 2022 , as well as an expected easing in covid -
