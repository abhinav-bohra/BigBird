through of glove cost begins to ease .", "the 2021 quarterly earnings pattern is contrary to our typical seasonality with most of the year 's profitability weighted toward the first half of the year .", "specifically , we continue to expect q3 earnings to be softer than q2 due to the timing of glove cost pass - through .", "however , we expect q4 to improve due to the seasonal impact of healthcare utilization across our businesses .", "also , remember that cash flow is expected to improve in the back half of the year , as working capital headwind soften as previously discussed .", "please note that these key modeling assumptions for full year 2021 have been summarized on supplemental slides filed with the sec on form 8 -
