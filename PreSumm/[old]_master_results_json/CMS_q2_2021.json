out , adding about eight gigawatts of solar by 2040 , two gigawatts from the previous plan .", "furthermore , this plan ensures reliability , a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on the grid .", "the purchase of over two gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and dramatically reduces our carbon footprint .", "existing natural gas generation is key .", "and like we 've done historically with the purchases of our zeeland and jackson generating stations .", "this is a sweet spot for us where we reduce permitting , construction and start -

related expenses , recovering commercial and industrial sales and the usual strong tax planning .", "year - to - date , we delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of $ 472 million or $ 1.64 per share , which excludes $ 0.19 per share from enerbank and is up $ 0.37 per share versus the first half of 2020 , assuming a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations .", "all in , we 're tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date , which offers great financial flexibility for the second half of the year .", "the waterfall chart on slide nine provides more detail on the key year - to - date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 .", "as a reminder , this walk excludes the financial performance of enerbank .", "for the first half of 2021 , rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year - over - year variance to the tune of $ 0.36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for electric and gas businesses .", "as a reminder , our rate relief figures are stated net of investment - related costs , such as depreciation and amortization , property taxes and funding costs at the utility .", "the rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety , reliability , customer experience and decarbonization .", "as a reminder , these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to $ 0.06 per share of negative variance versus 2020 .", "it is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings realized to date , largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the ce way , which are ahead of plan .", "we also benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $ 0.06 per share and recovering commercial and industrial sales , which coupled with solid tax planning provided $ 0.01 per share of positive variance in aggregate .", "as we look ahead to the second half of the year , we feel quite good about the glide path to delivering toward the high end of our earnings per share guidance range , as garrick noted .", "as always , we plan for normal weather , which in this case , translates to $ 0.02 per share of negative variance , given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020 .", "we 'll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief , which equates to $ 0.12 per share of pickup .", "and i 'll remind you , is not subject to any further mpsc actions .", "we also continue to execute on our operational and customer - related projects , which we estimate will have a financial impact of $ 0.21 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments in the second half of the year .", "we have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance , which as a reminder , now excludes enerbank .", "all in , we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021 .", "turning to our financing plan for the year .", "i 'm pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of $ 230 million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4.2 % , one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred offering of its kind .", "this transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs of cms energy , our parent company for the year and given the high level of equity content ascribed to the security by the rating agencies , we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to $ 100 million from up to $ 250 million .", "as a reminder , over half of the $ 100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year are already contracted via equity forwards .", "it is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the enerbank merger agreement in the event enerbank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction , we would have a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing , which could further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022 .", "closing out the financing plan , i 'll also highlight that we recently extended our long - term credit facilities by one year to 2024 , both at the parent and the utility .", "lastly , i 'd be remiss if i did n't mention that later today , we 'll file our 10 - q , which will be the last 10 -
