to - dealer platforms backlotcars and traderev the solid performance of our finance business afc and our continued diligence and management of a kar 's overall cost structure .", "so i 'll start with the second quarter .", "i was pleased with our second quarter performance particularly given the supply headwinds in our industry .", "despite operating in an environment of very constrained vehicle supply especially from commercial sellers we achieved the following results .", "for kar overall we generated $ 585 million in revenue an increase of 40 % from q2 of last year .", "we generated total gross profit of $ 252 million which represents 51.7 % of revenue excluding purchased vehicles .", "we generated $ 116.5 million of adjusted ebitda which was a 46 % increase compared to q2 of last year .", "we had another strong quarter of cash generation .", "cash flow from operations for the quarter was $ 131 million .", "within the adesa segment we facilitated the sale of 711000 vehicles representing for $ 11 billion in gross auction proceeds .", "53 % of our q2 sales were from off - premise locations .", "that was similar to our experience during q1 .", "we sold 119000 vehicles on the traderev and backlotcars platforms on a combined basis .", "this represents our strongest performance to date in our digital dealer - to - dealer marketplace .", "it represents a growth of 65 % compared to q2 of last year and sequential growth of 19 % versus q1 .", "i continue to be encouraged by our performance as part of the business .", "we generated $ 277 in gross profit per vehicle sold in the adesa segment .", "that represented an increase from the $ 264 in q1 .", "sg&a for kar overall was $ 140 million for the quarter .", "sg&a for the adesa segment was $ 131 million which was down $ 9 million from q1 resulting in sg&a of $ 185 per vehicle sold .", "so i 'd now like to speak about the supply dynamics of used vehicles within our marketplaces the headwinds that we faced in q2 and why i believe the medium and longer - term outlook is much more encouraging .", "in our last earnings call i mentioned that kar was operating in an environment of constrained vehicle supply across the wholesale used vehicle market particularly in regard to volumes being offered by commercial sellers .", "i said that the root causes varied but they all originated with the covid pandemic .", "those supply constraints worsened during q2 and they represented a significant headwind to our performance during the quarter .", "that 's why i 'm encouraged by our performance in spite of those headwinds .", "i also believe there 's increasing evidence that we 're now at the bottom of the cycle and that we should expect to see some recovery in those commercial volumes .", "and when that happens it should be a very positive thing for kar .", "to help explain all of this i 'd like to look back to q2 of 2019 and to what a more normal supply dynamic looks like for our company and our industry pre-covid .", "so in q2 of 2019 kar facilitated a sale of 994000 vehicles .", "over 70 % of those approximately 700000 vehicles were sold by commercial sellers .", "the remainder which was approximately 275000 vehicles were sold by dealer sellers .", "so from that statistic alone we can see that historically commercial sellers have represented the majority of kar 's used vehicle supply over 70 % .", "this is more so than our industry overall which is more like 50 - 50 .", "one challenge that kar has faced over the past few quarters is that those commercial seller volumes have been under much greater pressure than the dealer volumes for reasons i will discuss here in a moment .", "i believe that pressure is cyclical in nature and i believe that we are now at the bottom of that cycle .", "during q2 of this year the volume sold on behalf of commercial sellers was approximately 420000 vehicles a decline of over 40 % versus q2 of 2019 .", "so that 's a significant and painful decline .", "however a key question is how does that compare to the market overall ?", "a good basis for comparison is to look at the total volume of vehicles sold by commercial sellers at all u.s. auctions that is at adesa and its competitors .", "this data is published by auctionet .", "in q2 of 2021 the volume of vehicles sold by commercial sellers at all u.s. auctions was down by 48 % versus q2 of 2019 in our industry according to auctionet .", "based on that statistic kar 's decline in total commercial volume across all channels was less than the industrywide decline in commercial vehicles at u.s. auctions .", "so that tells me that we did not lose share with these commercial sellers .", "our performance in q2 should be judged against what i would consider to be historically low industry volumes of vehicle supply from commercial sellers .", "and viewed through that lens i am pleased with the performance .", "i also mentioned that there is evidence that we 're currently at the bottom of the cycle .", "the dynamics relating to off - lease vehicles repossessed vehicles and rental vehicles all point to an improving commercial supply picture over time .", "i believe that when this happens it will be very positive for kar given our digital shift our streamlined operations and our resulting lower cost structure .", "and i 'd like to go through that in a little bit more detail .", "i 'm going to start with off - lease vehicles .", "kar sells significant volumes of off - lease vehicles through openlane and also at adesa .", "the volume of off - lease vehicles flowing through both of these marketplaces has been severely impacted by the disruption to new car production brought on by the shortage in semiconductors .", "in the face of this supply shortage of new vehicles market values for used off - lease vehicles have increased by as much as 40 % versus one year ago .", "this means that consumers now have considerably more equity in their off - lease vehicles than at any point in history .", "based on our internal analysis the average equity in an off - lease vehicle increased to an all - time high of close to $ 8000 per vehicle in q2 and that was up from an average of less than zero two years ago .", "this makes lessees much less likely to return the vehicle from the lease sense .", "and if the lessee does return the vehicle it makes it much more likely that the grounding dealer will purchase the vehicle since many grounding dealers have a contractual option to purchase the vehicle at residual value .", "we saw both of these trends in q2 .", "the positive equity situation for lessees resulted in a reduction of over 50 % in off - lease vehicles being returned versus what we would normally expect .", "for those vehicles that were returned we saw upstream conversion reach an all - time high of approximately 80 % in q2 .", "so while we enjoy nearly 80 % market share in the upstream off - lease segment in north america a record number of vehicles were kept up by consumers where we received no fees or by the grounding dealers where we generate lower revenue .", "the results of both of these changes was that considerably fewer vehicles flow deeper into the marketing process where they would have generated stronger economics .", "so as we look ahead we believe that the semiconductor production issues are now being addressed and we expect production of new vehicles to start to improve starting in the second half of this year .", "while we believe it will take time ultimately this increased production will drive a normalization in supply and demand and a moderation in used vehicle values .", "this should in turn result in increased volumes of off - lease vehicles being returned and processed through our private label platforms and flowing into our higher - margin channels like adesa.com and our on - premise sales .", "but clearly this will take time .", "in the meantime we also know that lease originations continue to be strong meaning that off - lease vehicles will continue to be a strong source of supply for our industry well into the future .", "the second category of vehicles is repossessed vehicles .", "we sell a significant of repossessed vehicles at adesa given the large number of banks and lenders in our commercial seller portfolio .", "in just about every prior economic dislocation event our industry has experienced an increase in repossession volume .", "however this did not happen during the covid pandemic and i believe that the unprecedented level of government stimulus served to avert it .", "government stimulus coupled with other consumer protections has meant that consumers could continue to make their monthly payments and avoid repossession .", "in q2 based on our data repossession volume across our industry continued to be about 35 % below what we would consider to be normal levels .", "looking ahead after the current wave of government stimulus ends i think it 's reasonable to expect that repossession volumes will trend back toward normal levels over time and that our volumes in that segment should correspondingly improve .", "and finally there are rental vehicles .", "we have less exposure to this category but we still have a meaningful customer base in the segment and this segment offers us an opportunity for volume and profit when the rental market strengthens .", "rental supply within our wholesale marketplaces was very close to zero during q2 .", "in fact a number of rental companies were actively buying used vehicles within our marketplaces because they were unable to source new vehicles from motor manufacturers owing to the semiconductor shortage .", "the post -covid increase in travel has caused rental car companies to start rebuilding their fleets .", "i take this as a positive signal for our industry and our company .", "since it points to return toward normal at some point in the future .", "so as we look to all of these three segments off - lease repo and rental i believe that the fundamentals lead us to conclude that compared to our q2 experience we should expect to see considerably increased volumes over time .", "the key question is when will this happen and to what extent ?", "my best assessment is that it will take time but there are some key factors that we 're watching that may be predicted .", "the most significant factor in my mind is new vehicle production .", "we 're also monitoring used vehicle values and seeing the unprecedented high prices starting to moderate and even decline a little .", "lower used vehicle prices will help drive more off - lease supply into our marketplaces .", "finally we are monitoring for any further government stimulus and its impact on the repossession market .", "so now i 'd like to provide an update on our progress in the dealer vehicle category .", "we sold 292000 dealer vehicles in q2 of this year .", "that was an increase of 6 % versus the 276000 dealer - owned vehicles that we sold in q2 of 2019 .", "even if we were to include backlog cars in the 2019 number our total dealer volumes have increased versus q2 of that year .", "so our total dealer volumes have now recovered back to what we would consider normal and i 'm pleased that we 're showing modest growth .", "if we look at the digital dealer category only q2 represented our strongest performance yet with 119000 vehicles sold representing year - over - year growth of 65 % .", "and by the way that includes backlotcars volumes in the prior year number .", "i was pleased with this performance .", "q2 represented our first full quarter in the u.s. where we had migrated to the backlotcars platform .", "we saw record numbers of participating sellers and buyers and increased volumes of vehicles posted for sale .", "although these higher volumes of vehicles posted were offset by a slightly weakening conversion as the quarter progressed due to the high used vehicle value trends that i talked about earlier .", "in canada our traderev business performed very well in q2 .", "it delivered strong volumes and strong profitability .", "the fact that traderev has delivered profitability in canada which is a more mature digital dealer - to - dealer market makes me encouraged for our prospects in the u.s. market and at an even greater scale .", "our own analysis of the trends in both the u.s. and canadian markets also demonstrates that our offerings are helping us address a segment of vehicles that was not coming to our auctions in the past .", "we are attracting new sellers and new buyers on a daily basis and this reinforces our belief that the digital solution expands the total addressable market available to our business .", "i 'd like to spend a few moments talking about our cost structure .", "over the last several calls we have discussed our strategic focus on reducing our cost structure to reflect our transition to a digital marketplace company .", "the lower volumes in q2 coupled with the high percentage of offsite sales continue to reinforce the need for kar to be very focused on its operating model and its cost structure .", "so delivering that level of performance in that environment reflects our focus on operations and costs .", "i believe that this focus is reflected in our strong gross profit performance in the quarter both as a percentage of net revenue and also in terms of the gross profit per vehicle sold .", "our cost focus has also been reflected in the close management of our sg&a .", "this management of costs has enabled the business to deliver a stronger operating performance off of lower volumes .", "over the course of the quarter we 've also identified further savings opportunities principally relating to sg&a .", "these have now been acted on or are in the process of being addressed .", "i also believe that as we look to the future there will be opportunities to further refine our processes increasing our efficiency improving the customer experience and reducing our costs going forward and this will continue to be a focus .", "i want to stress however that these reductions have not come and will not come at the cost of strategic investments or of our customer commitments .", "we continue to invest in the technology the people and infrastructure necessary to extend our lead in the digital transformation and position our company for long - term growth .", "finally i 'd like to provide some updates relating to our finance business afc .", "i 've been pleased with afc 's performance in the present quarter but also over the past 18 months since the onset of the pandemic .", "afc continues to have healthy margins with gross profit for the quarter right at 80 % and with sg&a of under 13 % of revenue .", "in terms of its key metrics afc had 356000 loan transactions in the quarter .", "this was in line with the levels that we had expected .", "revenue per loan transaction was strong at $ 193 for the quarter .", "key drivers of this were higher vehicle values and lower risk levels .", "and finally speaking of risk we continue to experience lower - than - expected risks driven by current market conditions combined with strong operating processes at afc .", "so to summarize my key messages for today i am pleased with our performance for the quarter .", "specifically i am pleased that we were able to deliver this level of performance despite historically low levels of commercial seller vehicles which has always been our core business segment .", "i believe we are now likely at the bottom of the curve in terms of commercial vehicle supply .", "i believe that the outlook for off - lease repossessed and rental vehicles will be one of increasing volume over time ultimately returning toward historical levels .", "this recovery will take time but it 's clear to me that we should be a strong beneficiary of this when it happens .", "and i think that we 're now starting to see the very first signs that that recovery is nearing .", "when i look at dealer consignment we sold more dealer consigned vehicles in the same quarter pre-covid and we delivered our best quarter yet in terms of volumes in our digital channels .", "our traderev business had a strong profitable quarter in canada .", "and our data suggests that our digital model is expanding our addressable market across north america .", "i also believe that our q2 results and strong unit economics demonstrate that kar has the ability to be more profitable at lower volumes than was the case historically .", "what is important about this is that it also means that as we see the cyclical return of these commercial seller volumes we have the opportunity to be more profitable in the future than we have been in the past .", "finally notwithstanding the growth levers that exist for us we continue to be very focused on costs finding opportunities in q2 to further improve our operating model .", "we intend to maintain that focus and discipline going forward also .", "with that i will hand over to eric for a more detailed review of the financial results for the quarter .", "let me start by highlighting a few items that stand out this quarter .", "adjusted ebitda of $ 116.5 million represents approximately 20 % of operating revenue .", "given the volume and related revenue headwinds this was a solid performance for the quarter .", "gross profit for the quarter was 51.7 % of revenue net of purchased vehicles .", "the primary drivers of this strong performance gross profit per unit at adesa $ 277 up from $ 224 in the prior year and $ 264 in the first quarter .", "afc revenue per loan transaction was $ 193 up from $ 115 in the prior year and $ 177 in the first quarter and this more than offset a decline in the number of loan transactions compared to the prior year and the first quarter .", "peter mentioned the sequential decline in sg&a .", "however sg&a was up from the prior year as we had a substantial number of our employees on furlough for all or part of the second quarter of 2020 and many employees had temporary reductions in compensation last year as well .", "operating adjusted net income per share of $ 0.15 was negatively impacted by a reduction in net unrealized gains on publicly traded securities and an increase in our effective tax rate to 44 % primarily driven by nondeductible expenses related to the increased contingent consideration recorded for the carsontheweb acquisition .", "and last the working capital generated at kar continues to be a strength of our operating model .", "we have generated $ 296 million of cash from operating activities in the first six months of 2021 of which $ 131 million was generated in the second quarter .", "the free cash flow conversion of our business is worth pointing out .", "as our markets return to normal in the near future i am confident we have sufficient capital available to support our business and its growth for the foreseeable future .", "now let me give some color on the highlights of our performance .", "first our total volumes sold at adesa was up 10 % over the prior year .", "given the industry headwinds particularly around the commercial vehicles as peter mentioned we are pleased with 10 % year - over - year growth .", "i am not providing a same - store growth rate because we have integrated all of our u.s. digital dealer - to - dealer business on the backlotcars platform .", "if i include the backlotcars volume for the second quarter of 2020 in our denominator our growth in volume is 4 % .", "i think most impressive in our performance is the 65 % growth rate in digital dealer - to - dealer for the u.s. and canada .", "i have included the backlotcars volume in both years so this is an organic growth rate for the business .", "we benefited from strong auction fees in the adesa segment .", "auction fees per vehicle sold of $ 333 was up 21.5 % from the prior year .", "we benefited from strong used car pricing in our marketplaces .", "average selling price for all vehicles in the second quarter was $ 16400 compared to $ 14800 one year ago .", "as i dug into the details of our auction fees i found that increased average selling prices was not the biggest impact on average auction fees per vehicle sold .", "average auction fees on off - premise transactions increased from $ 119 in 2020 to $ 153 for 2021 .", "this increase was accomplished even though average selling prices for total off - premise transactions declined slightly as we grew the digital dealer - to - dealer channel 65 % while the off - premise commercial volumes declined 15 % in the second quarter .", "the average auction fees for the digital dealer - to - dealer marketplace our fastest - growing marketplace was $ 268 per vehicle sold an increase of only $ 1 from the prior year .", "i point this out as some may believe our increased auction fees is completely driven by record high used car values .", "while increased used car values is a factor it is not the most significant contributor as some of our digital marketplaces do not have auction fee structures that are highly correlated to used car values .", "our services revenue has also rebounded even though it is not near fully recovered due to the limited supply of commercial vehicles .", "the mix of revenues is contributing to our improved gross profit .", "our services revenue mix is less concentrated on the low - margin transportation revenue and more concentrated on value - added ancillary service .", "we have all seen the strong used car performance of public retailers .", "in some ways this is confusing when you look at the wholesale markets and we discuss a lack of supply .", "however this situation is creating an opportunity for adesa .", "a number of used car retailers have called upon us to provide retail - ready levels of reconditioning to help them meet consumer demand .", "based on our early successes with various retailers we expect to grow revenue from this service offering .", "afc 's strong performance was driven by tremendous growth in revenue per loan transaction as the provision for credit losses is a contra revenue account for a finance entity the significant reduction in the provision for credit losses was a key factor to improved revenue .", "however another key contributor was interest and fee income per loan transaction that increased to $ 191 per loan transaction from $ 155 per loan transaction last year .", "this demonstrates the impact of having over 50 % of the revenue for afc from fees creating less dependence on interest rates to drive revenue .", "lower interest rates on floorplan loans were offset by higher average loan balances due to the record high used car values .", "also contributing to the strong second quarter results for afc was lower direct cost and disciplined control over sg&a .", "now let me speak to the items that impacted operating adjusted net income per share .", "we currently hold a common stock of carlotz a publicly traded company that requires us to mark - to - market our investments .", "carlotz went public through a spac transaction in late january and this resulted in us recording our investment at market instead of costs .", "as the stock price of carlotz has declined since march 31 we have reduced the unrealized gain on investments by $ 11.9 million .", "this required adjustment to the carrying value resulted in a reduction of net operating adjusted net income per share of $ 0.04 net of income taxes .", "we also recorded $ 4.5 million of accrued contingent consideration related to the carsontheweb transaction as the performance of adesa europe formerly carsontheweb has exceeded the amounts recorded using a monte carlo simulation of possible outcomes at the time of purchase .", "our performance in europe continues to be strong despite the lack of supply and i expect we will record additional contingent consideration through the end of this year when the earn - out period ends .", "the earn - out is capped and we are recognizing the increase to the maximum earn - out payment amount ratably over the year so the quarterly expense should not increase from $ 4.5 million .", "this is purchase price and will be paid to the previous owners but gaap requires the adjustment to contingent consideration be recorded as other expense .", "it is not included in sg&a in our financial statements .", "let me close with comments on our capital situation .", "we continue to have a strong balance sheet with our focus on controlling costs and managing the business through a low point in supply in our industry .", "we deployed $ 100 million to purchase kar stock in the open market at an average purchase price of $ 17.77 in the second quarter .", "year - to - date we have repurchased $ 180.8 million of kar stock in the open market at an average purchase price of $ 16.66 .", "we have just under $ 110 million left on our share repurchase authorization .", "we have sufficient working capital available to support the business through the current economic cycle and also invest in strategic growth as opportunities arise .", "through the first half of 2021 our capital expenditures totaling $ 50.7 million have been focused primarily on our digital marketplaces .", "and preparing our platforms for growth we expect to be driven by a cyclical recovery over the next several years .", "we will continue to invest responsibly in the future of our business through capital projects and maintain or improve our leadership position in the wholesale used car digital marketplaces .", "although the root cause and duration of the current environment in our industry is much different than 2009 and the period that followed i also see many similarities in the impact on volumes trends in used car pricing and the prospects for recovery following a period where we are at the bottom of the down cycle in our industry .", "i continue to see great opportunity for kar and its investors once the cyclical recovery begins in the near future .", "stephanie you can open the line ."], "summary_gold": "q2 adjusted operating earnings per share $ 0.15 .", "summary_pred": "and i will also provide updates on the continued growth of our dealer -
