reliance on bank debt ; and two , addressing 2020 to 2022 maturities without meaningfully impairing existing liquidity .", "not surprisingly , these factors are the impetus for many travel and leisure companies entering the high - yield bond market , and i expect those conditions will remain a driver for capital markets activity in the industry in 2021 .", "for diamondrock , bank debt is less than 50 % of our net debt and net debt is just 22 % of our estimated replacement cost of our hotels .", "we have just one mortgage maturity in early 2022 , which has an extension option .", "more critically , our revolver matures in 2023 and our term loans mature in 2024 .", "each has extension options , too .", "in short , we are not seeking new debt capital commitments from our lenders at this time .", "we believe these facts , in combination with our strong liquidity and declining burn rate , greatly improve the likelihood diamondrock can avoid the issuance of dilutive capital and pivot to offense at the appropriate time .", "with that , i will turn the floor back over to mark .", "in late august , we announced a sweeping transaction with marriott international that has several features .", "let me hit the highlights of that deal .", "most significantly , we converted five of our managed hotel contracts to franchise agreements .", "these conversions were completed in september , and we have engaged a variety of leading third - party managers that are uniquely suited to each asset .", "in addition to the 50 basis point to 100 basis point improvement in residual cap rate for the five hotels that generally [ indecipherable ] to franchise properties , we believe the change will produce approximately $ 2 million of incremental profit on stabilized cash flows .", "we 've already started reaping benefits from the change , as we consolidated finance and management roles in alpharetta , denver , sonoma and charleston that will yield almost $ 400,000 of annual savings .", "the second biggest value creator from the deal is a new franchise agreement to up - brand the vail marriott resort to a luxury collection brand upon completion of the renovation next year .", "as you recall , we had undertaken the renovation of this hotel to a luxury standard over the past few years , and the lobby renovation next year is the final phase .", "we expect it to be done in late 2021 in time for the ski season .", "consistent with prior expectations , we estimate this repositioning and sale could result in $ 3 million of incremental ebitda , given the significant rate differential that exists today between the resort as a marriott and the luxury competitive set .", "the third benefit of the deal is that we have the right , but not the obligation , to convert the jw marriott cherry creek to a luxury collection brand with a small renovation .", "we are currently reviewing the roi on this opportunity .", "the final benefit to us is that we secured an explicit right to terminate the autograph collection franchise agreement encumbering the lexington hotel for a termination fee .", "we believe that this improves the residual cap rate of the property by greatly expanding the universe of potential buyers .", "in the aggregate , we calculate that the sweeping agreement adds at least $ 50 million of net asset value to the diamondrock portfolio .", "no cash payment was associated with this agreement .", "instead , diamondrock agreed to standard renovation scopes that will be completed over the next three to five years for the converted hotels at cost generally consistent with our normal internal expectations .", "in addition , we provided franchise extensions at our westin d.c. and westin san diego properties at market terms , ensuring that these hotels will remain dominant hotels in their respective markets .", "the second announcement we made in late august was the addition of mike hartmeier to the board of directors , effective october 2020 .", "mike is one of the most experienced lodging m&a bankers in the industry , and we believe he will be a valuable , unbiased voice in the boardroom to pursue options that maximize value for shareholders .", "turning to our outlook , while we saw improvement in the third quarter , we do not expect the industry to significantly rebound until there is a healthcare solution to the pandemic .", "our current view is that at least one of the 11 vaccines in phase iii trials could announce positive findings in the next 90 days with broad distribution by mid-2021 .", "this , in combination with improved patient outcomes and broader acceptance of safety protocols such as social distancing and wearing masks , should lead to increasing travel activity and improving financial performance .", "once profitability is restored , we expect to see a handful of well -
