we 're leveraging our high - performance teams , the combination of the natural work teams that we have in our plants and warehouses as well as the star point teams and kaizen.
two comments before we begin today.
first , as a reminder , regarding the pending meggitt acquisition , we are still bound by the requirements of the u.k. takeover code in respect to discussing certain transaction details.
as usual , today , tom is going to begin with highlights of the quarter and a few comments on the company 's transformation.
those closed in the quarter.
we did sell a few facilities that we restructured.
our meeting will now be held on tuesday , march 8 from 9 am to 12 pm eastern.
tom mentioned this , but adjusted ebitda margin was 22.7 %.
that 's up 180 basis points from last year.
it will be a virtual event.
there were some currency gains that were favorable.
so ownership of safety , but also ownership of quality , cost , delivery and engagement.
reconciliations for all non-gaap financial measures are included in today 's materials.
and it 's really this combination , this team structure plus kaizen , that is driving an ownership culture within the company.
and among the topics that we 'll cover will be the release of our new long - term financial targets.
and we do have reduced pension expense versus prior year.
