lastly , the hummingbird fpso continues to operate on the chestnut field under a fixed rate contract with the charterer having the right to terminate the contract with three months prior notice if the field is deemed uneconomic.
we also generated total adjusted ebitda of 202 million , up slightly from the previous quarter.
compared to q4 , we recorded higher results in each of our entities , supported by our large portfolio of long - term contracts in our gas shipping business , higher spot tanker rates in our oil shipping business , and higher revenues from our marine services business in australia.
all of this despite the continued weakness in the spot conventional tanker market.
in the first quarter , we reported consolidated adjusted net income of 11 million , or $ 0.11 per share , up from 3 million , or $ 0.03 per share in the prior quarter.
since reporting earnings in february , we have made significant positive progress toward the strategic objective of winding down our fpso segment , which we expect will result in a material reduction in our total asset retirement obligations in the second quarter.
as such , in q2 , we expect to incur approximately $ 5 million to $ 6 million of costs relating to the towage and initial milestone payments to the recycling yard , which represents the most part of our remaining cost associated with the unit , with only minimal cost expected to be incurred after q2.
however , we are pleased to say that the unit departed by tow for its final voyage from the u.k. on may 2 and will safely handed over to the mass recycling shipyard in denmark on may 11 , where it will be recycled in accordance with the eu ship recycling regulation over the next several months.
kenneth will discuss this in more detail on the next slide.
over the last couple of quarters , we discussed our esg strategy , and we are now excited to have published our 11th consecutive teekay group sustainability report last month , which aligns with global frameworks such as gri and sasb.
separately , in april , we entered into a conditional agreement with cnr , whereby the customer will take over our remaining phase 2 decommissioning responsibilities on the banff field , which , when finalized , will effectively conclude and eliminate our remaining obligations related to the banff field after over 20 years of successful operations.
we hope that you and your families are all safe and healthy.
before we begin , i 'd like to direct all participants to our website , www.
we have included a link to our latest sustainability report on this slide and it is also available on our website.
this agreement should enable cnr to achieve synergies when combining this with their own existing subsea decommissioning work scopes.
regulatory authorities that teekay has completed all of its obligations in relation to phase 1 of the decommissioning project.
