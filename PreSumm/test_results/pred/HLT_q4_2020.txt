to say i 'm deeply saddened by that loss , it would be an understatement.
as many of you know , had the opportunity to work with arne in a number of capacities throughout my career , including earlier on at host.
i think it 's very fair to say he was an exceptional leader , but also an incredible person and a great friend.
i want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the sorenson family and the thousands of marriott associates around the world following the heartbreaking news of arne 's passing.
our industry is better because of him , and i am a better professional and a better person because of him.
on behalf of everyone at hilton family , the entire marriott family are in our thoughts.
for the full year , systemwide revpar declined 57 % with adjusted ebitda down only modestly , more illustrating the resiliency of our fee - based model.
because of our amazing people , we 've been able to lean on our award - winning culture , which earned the number one best place to work in the united states for the second consecutive year and the number three world 's best workplace to help get us through these trying times.
as we all know , this past year has presented unique challenges , including a pandemic that devastated lives , communities , and businesses across the world , widespread economic declines and acts of social injustice.
while it 's certainly been a very difficult year , we 're proud of everything we 've accomplished , but we certainly could not have done it without the support of all of our stakeholders.
we also demonstrated the strength of our brands and power of our customer - centric strategy by achieving market share gains across every region , even in a distressed business environment.
due to the extraordinary levels of disruption , our industry experienced demand declines we 've never seen before in our 101 - year history.
as a result of these moves , we expect to recover from the pandemic as a stronger , higher - margin business that is even better positioned to deliver performance for our owners and strong free cash flow for our shareholders.
guided by our founding purpose , to make the world a better place through the light and warmth of hospitality , we acted quickly to ensure the safety and well - being of our people.
we also took steps to protect our business by rightsizing our cost structure and enhancing our liquidity position while continuing to drive net unit growth and increase our network effect.
