they had available capacity and pulled some work from q3 into q2.
these documents can be found on our website or at www.
i also want to point out that during today 's call , we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures , which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance.
as chris mentioned , we 're starting on slide four.
we will then open the lines for q&a.
and as of today , the company secured two of the three most recent large projects.
i commend the team that initiated and drove the strategy and those now executing the orders.
it was very nice to operate in q2 a normal capacity after running at approximately 50 % capacity in q1 due to covid - 19.
the strong order level in the quarter is the result of implementing effectively diversification strategy.
q2 sales were $ 28 million , up from $ 21.6 million in q2 of last year.
we discussed during the past couple of years actions taken to be successful in the more price - conscious segment of refining and chemical markets.
we plan to pursue principally large project work.
the quarter also benefited from an acceleration of some work at one of our asian subcontractors.
we would expect around 25 % of our sales to be for the navy for the full fiscal year.
another highlight was securing additional work for the u.s. navy.
both participation and market share were low , which afforded an opportunity to address this segment differently.
