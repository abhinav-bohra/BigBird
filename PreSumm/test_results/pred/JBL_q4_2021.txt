as adam highlighted , our business model is fundamentally structured to deliver core margin expansion and strong predictable cash flows , and our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility.
along this journey , we 'll discuss our approach to the end markets we serve , the uniqueness of our supply chain solutions , and the innovation underway within our global network of factories.
and we 'll kick that right off with the following brief video.
as we all know , the world is complex and only getting more so each and every day.
as usual , you will hear from both mark mondello , our ceo ; as well as mike dastoor , our cfo.
through over 50 million square feet of manufacturing space and 100 - plus sites , our people strive to make anything possible and everything better for over 400 of the world 's most recognizable brands.
over the next 60 minutes or so , we will review our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results , followed by yet another great outlook for fiscal 2022.
as a result of our efforts to diversify the business , revenue has grown rapidly.
so beginning roughly in the 2017 time frame , we embarked on a journey to grow and diversify our business in areas such as 5g , cloud , healthcare , packaging , connected devices , automotive , and semi-capital equipment.
this important characteristic was product diversification.
and since 2017 , we have added more than $ 10 billion in revenue across several key end markets.
these wide - ranging end markets represent a diverse and thoughtfully designed portfolio that , over the years , has helped reduce volatility and improve the reliability of our financial results.
in 2016 , our management team concluded that our model was missing an important characteristic if we were going to deliver upon our financial priorities consistently and sustainably.
and as an organization , we 're excited to provide you with a little extra detail about our business as typical for our september call.
we have a great session planned for you today.
and it 's important to note this growth has been very intentional and focused.
