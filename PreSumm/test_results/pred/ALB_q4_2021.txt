i 'll begin on slide 12.
and finally , i 'll walk you through our 2022 objectives.
2021 was a transformative year for albemarle.
our strategic execution and ability to effectively manage the challenges of the global pandemic enabled us to capitalize on the strength of the lithium and bromine markets and generate results that exceeded expectations.
scott will provide more details on our financial results , outlook , and capital allocation priorities.
for the year , excluding our fine chemistry services business , which was sold in june of 2021 , we increased net sales by 11 % to $ 3.3 billion , which was in line with our previous guidance.
adjusted ebitda grew 13 % in 2021 to $ 871 million , surpassing the upper end of our guidance.
now looking at slide 5.
please also note that some of the comments made today refer to non-gaap financial measures.
and we recently signed a nonbinding letter agreement to explore the expansion of our marbl joint venture with increased optionality and reduced risk.
for the fourth quarter , we generated net sales of $ 894 million , which is an increase of $ 15 million compared to the prior - year quarter.
the construction team is now dedicated to the second train , and we will be able to leverage our experience from train one to improve efficiencies and timeliness of this project.
the fourth - quarter net loss attributable to albemarle was $ 4 million , reflecting an increased cost estimate to construct our kemerton lithium hydroxide plant due to anticipated cost overruns from the impact of pandemic - related issues on the supply chain and labor.
we introduced this slide early last year to lay out our 2021 objectives designed to support the four pillars of our strategy : to grow profitably , to maximize productivity , to invest with discipline , and to advance sustainability.
in november , we achieved mechanical completion of the first train at kemerton.
to continue driving this growth , we are focused on quickly bringing capacity online with accelerated investments.
