first , i need to cover a few details with you.
and so , before ted discusses the details of our first quarter results , i 'll provide a few updates on our recent operational and regulatory developments.
and i 'll also touch on our progress toward achieving our 2021 goals.
spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work.
2021 has started off in line with our financial expectations.
and while we 've always had a robust summer preparedness program , resource adequacy has recently become a more visible topic , given the events in neighboring states over the past year.
to serve our customers with top - tier reliability , each year we perform preventative maintenance , emergency operation center drills , acquire critical spare equipment , conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders.
on the regulatory front , the commission continues to evaluate the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year.
it will also be available by telephone through may 12 , 2021.
we expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon.
we 're also procuring an additional 450 megawatts of seasonal peaking capacity , including hydro power , and we expanded our contract up to 60 megawatts for demand response from our commercial and industrial customers to help ensure that we 've got adequate resources through the 2021 summer season.
the response to these solicitations was robust and we 're in the process of reviewing the proposals.
our procurement process is another important way that we help ensure long - term resource adequacy.
we also announced two rfps last year , including an all - source rfp and a battery rfp.
development has begun and this project is on track to meet the expected 2022 in - service date.
our lean efforts continue for managing costs , combined with the key initiatives jeff highlighted for 2021.
