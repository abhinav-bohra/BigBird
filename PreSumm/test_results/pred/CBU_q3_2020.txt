wealth management , insurance services revenues were also up $ 0.5 million or 3.6 % between comparable annual quarters.
the quarter was also very good for mortgage banking , credit , deposit growth , consumer deposit fees and the steuben acquisition was also very additive to our performance.
the only real negative in the quarter , notwithstanding the litigation accrual that joe will discuss further , was credit demand , excluding mortgage lending.
the total loan book was off about 1 % , with slight declines in every business.
in fact , year - to - date are up 4 % on the topline and over 6 % on the bottom line , so a very solid performance for those businesses.
the mortgage business was quite strong , we sold over $ 100 million of lower rate , conforming production in the secondary market , where premiums are -- at the present moment -- very generous.
but our nonbanking businesses had a strong quarter.
so , overall , we 're satisfied with the quarter and with current operating trends , given the environment.
i will next touch on the company 's balance sheet , before providing additional details on the company 's earnings performance for the quarter.
as we head into the last quarter of the year and into 2021 , we will continue to be mindful and focused on the potential headwinds , including credit , the economic environment and interest rates.
these results were $ 0.01 per share higher than the third quarter of 2019 , fully diluted operating earnings per share of $ 0.84 and $ 0.09 higher than the linked second quarter 2020 , fully diluted operating earnings per share of $ 0.76.
despite the forward headwinds , we think we 're in pretty good shape to capitalize on opportunities that , we expect , lie ahead.
the company has an abundance of liquidity resources and is extremely well positioned to fund future loan growth.
the increase in total revenues between the periods was driven by increases in net interest income , banking - related noninterest revenues and noninterest revenues derived from our financial services businesses.
this was down from 10.08 % at the end of the second quarter , but up from 9.68 % one year prior.
this compares to $ 5.4 million or 11 basis points annualized for the nine - month period ended september 30th , 2019.
