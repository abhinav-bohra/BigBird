this quarter was a marked improvement from that pattern due in large part to the strong order activity at gulfstream and ongoing progress payments on our large international combat systems program , consistent with the contract amendment phebe referenced earlier.
to be a little more granular , revenue on the defense side of the business is up against last year 's first quarter by $ 444 million , and aerospace is up $ 196 million.
i will have more to say about this a bit later.
and we spent nearly $ 750 million on the repurchase of 4.6 million shares at an average price of just over $ 161 per share.
the operating margin for the entire company was 10 % , 70 basis points lower than the year - ago quarter.
they ended the quarter with over $ 30 billion in proposals awaiting customer decision , most of which also represent new business opportunities versus recompetition of existing work.
this was driven by a 250 - basis - point lower margin rate at aerospace , as was fully anticipated in our guidance to you , combined with $ 21 million more in corporate operating expense.
aerospace enjoyed revenue of $ 1.9 billion and operating earnings of $ 220 million with an 11.7 % operating margin.
it 's a very good start to the year.
it 's hard to find something not to like about it.
revenue is almost $ 200 million higher than anticipated by us and the sell side.
that 's down between 25 % and 30 % from the first quarter a year ago , but we 're still expecting full - year capex to be roughly 2.5 % of sales.
this is , in almost all respects , a very solid quarter.
i must confess that we also beat our own expectations rather handsomely.
additional information regarding these factors is contained in the company 's 10 - k , 10 - q and 8 - k filings.
so the quarter was nicely ahead of our expectations and reinforces our outlook for the year of free cash flow conversion in the 95 % to 100 % range.
