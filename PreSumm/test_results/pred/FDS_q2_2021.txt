the primary drivers include materially lower travel and entertainment costs and reduced spend due to office closures , offset in part by higher compensation costs.
i 'd now like to turn the discussion over to phil snow.
i 'm pleased with our solid second quarter and overall first half results.
and the investments we 've made to further advance our offerings in both content and workflow solutions are resonating.
to be fair to everyone , please limit yourself to one question plus one follow - up.
over the past 12 months , we 've proven our resilience and our ability to strengthen our value to clients and we begin the second half of this fiscal year with good momentum , greater visibility and continued confidence in our ability to execute.
moving on , our tax rate for the quarter was 16 % compared to last year 's rate of 14 % , primarily due to lower tax benefits realized from stock option exercises this quarter.
this acceleration was led by our sales team effectively growing wallet share with existing clients as well as capturing a higher price increase in the americas.
in our second quarter , our organic asv plus professional services growth rate accelerated to 5.5 %.
a replay of today 's call will be available via phone and on our website.
our content advances particularly in deep sector being well received by clients , especially across the sell - side , supporting workstation growth.
as noted on last quarter 's call , we 're also using a portion of the pandemic savings to invest further in both sales and new product development.
this was partially offset by cancellations largely across asset management firms.
this quarter , we are particularly pleased to see growth in our core workstation offering.
the market is looking for solutions that are both easy to integrate and unite the front , middle and back office and we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend.
our shift to the public cloud is progressing according to plan with the majority of our new storage and collection centers successfully migrated.
