i 'll now hand the call to our chairman , president and ceo , mike long.
i 'm pleased to report that our hardworking and dedicated team delivered strong financial results in the third quarter.
our reputation for reliability and consistency are the hallmarks that have allowed our customers and suppliers to place their trust in arrow for critical engineering , design and supply chain services.
arrow.com , along with the cfo commentary , the non-gaap earnings reconciliation and a replay of today 's call.
lastly , please note that cfo commentary includes information on our fiscal calendar closing dates for 2021.
in 2021 , the first , second and third quarters close on april 3 , july three and october 2 , unlike in 2020 , where they closed on march 28 , june 27 , and september 26.
as i mentioned on our prior quarterly earnings calls this year , arrow had faced adverse conditions many times in the past and has always emerged stronger than before.
our balance sheet is in great shape , and our liquidity position remains strong.
current committed and undrawn liquidity stands at over $ 3.4 billion , including our $ 227 million cash balance.
our business model is resilient and unique.
it also reflects a continued recovery in enterprise computing solutions margins back to prior levels.
these non-gaap measures are not intended to be a substitute for our gaap results.
our results this quarter showed just that.
full year comparisons are not affected as our year ends on december 31 , as always.
even during periods of decreased demand , our ability to generate substantial cash flow allows us to invest in areas that represent the best long - term opportunities.
