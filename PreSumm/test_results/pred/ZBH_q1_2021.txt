again , something we truly do believe will set us apart from the competition.
now it 's not over.
i think all of us realize that.
but i , for one , feel more optimistic than ever that we 're coming out , i think , on the other side of covid - 19 and with that , much better days ahead and i guess with that , probably it 's a good lead into our q1 call.
now of course , we 'd like to see this even more broadly on a worldwide basis , but it certainly feels like we 're making really important progress toward moving forward -- and ultimately , as a result of that moving , hopefully , on from the pandemic.
q1 was a stronger quarter than we initially expected and i 'm pretty excited to discuss it with you.
whenever you have a good quarter , obviously , earnings calls are a lot more fun.
so let 's start with navigating covid and how we 're executing inside of it.
i do n't think anybody can argue against that and is that shift toward what i would define as more stability , and i know that 's on a relative basis , kind of talk about stability here.
number one , i want to talk about the covid recovery just briefly and our execution inside of that recovery and then zb 's ongoing transformation and our progress against that.
i 'm going to try to keep it brief.
that 's really what it 's about.
joining me virtually today are bryan hanson , our president and ceo ; and cfo , suky upadhyay.
i hope you are all well and safe.
truthfully to remove pain from patients around the world and improving the quality of their life.
again , with multiple robotics launches , continuing success with persona revision , persona iq , new iterations of mymobility and just really the broader zb edge ecosystem to drive mix benefit , for sure , but also competitive conversions.
