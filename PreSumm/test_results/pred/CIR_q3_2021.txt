i 'm joined today by scott buckhout , circor 's president and ceo ; and abhi khandelwal , the company 's chief financial officer.
we continue to see strong demand for our mission - critical products with year - to - date orders in backlog up 11 % and 15 % , respectively.
while aerospace and defense orders were down in the quarter due to timing , we 're well positioned on growing commercial and defense programs and continue to launch new products for our customers.
circor delivered another strong quarter and executed well despite a challenging global supply chain environment.
in commercial marine , we expect to see growth as shipbuilding activity in asia continues to recover from historically low levels.
eps was up 39 % versus last year.
you can find a full discussion of these factors in circor 's form 10 - k , 10 - qs and other sec filings also located on our website.
finally , pricing is expected to net roughly 2 % and as pricing actions that were taken in q2 and q3 start to roll through our top and bottom line.
our strategic priorities on people , growth acceleration , margin expansion and free cash flow continue to be our guiding principles.
this is reflected in our revised full year guidance , which abhi will discuss later.
it 's important to note that revenue and earnings for the quarter were adversely impacted by supply chain disruptions that intensified through the last month of the quarter.
many of our midstream and downstream customers are prioritizing aftermarket projects in the near term and our oem project pipeline and backlog remain strong.
i 'll talk more about select accomplishments from q3 later in the call.
more specifically , we saw approximately $ 10 million of revenue pushed out of q3 due to supplier input delays , logistics constraints and ongoing labor availability challenges.
these expectations are subject to known and unknown risks , uncertainties and other factors and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied by today 's remarks.
our teams are working to mitigate the impact of supply chain issues by qualifying alternate suppliers , reengineering product with higher - grade materials and expediting shipping in order to continue delivering to our customers as committed.
