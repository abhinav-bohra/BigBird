i do want to point out that unlike some companies in the aerospace industry , heico did not have to go to the market to raise money at , what i consider , exorbitant rates of 8 % or more.
the effects of the outbreak and the related actions by governments around the world to mitigate its spread have impacted our employees , customers , suppliers , and manufacturers.
in response to the economic impact from the outbreak , we at heico have implemented certain cost reduction efforts , including layoffs , temporary reduced work hours , temporary pay reductions within various departments of our business , including within our entire executive management team as well as our board of directors.
with respect to the results of operations , approximately half of our net sales are derived from defense , space , and other industrial markets , including electronics , medical , and telecommunications.
i am confident that our future is bright and we will exit this covid - 19 period as a stronger and more competitive company.
once commercial air travel resumes , cost savings most likely will be a priority for commercial aviation customers , and we anticipate recovery in demand for our commercial aviation products , which frequently provides aircraft operators with significant cost savings.
as i previously mentioned , we have taken responsible measures to address these reductions in net sales at our affected businesses.
consolidated net sales for our businesses that operate within the commercial aerospace industry decreased by approximately 54 % during the third quarter of fiscal ' 20.
keep in mind that historically we have been able to make up and possibly collect some of that $ 7.5 million.
[ technical issues ] has caused significant volatility and a substantial decline in the value across global markets.
their dedication to heico 's customers and the safety of their fellow team members has been exemplary.
at this point , we do n't know how much that might be , if any.
connect tech designs , manufactures rugged small form factor embedded computing solutions.
its components are designed for very harsh environments and primarily used in rugged commercial and industrial , aerospace and defense , transportation , and smart energy applications.
in august ' 20 , we acquired 90 % of the equity interest of connect tech.
so , we just went through this financially sound and i think that has really helped us and has proven to be an excellent strategy.
