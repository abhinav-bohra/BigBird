my name is aaron howald , and i'm lp 's director of investor relations.
smartside net sales grew by nearly 50 % versus q1 of last year to $ 283 million and ebitda more than doubled to $ 90 million.
osb prices continued to climb throughout q1 , with the result that lp 's osb segment generated extraordinary cash flow.
robust customer demand for all of lp 's products has continued , driven by ongoing strength in homebuilding and remodeling , resulting in an outstanding quarter for lp.
as a result , lp exceeded $ 1 billion in sales , generated $ 461 million in ebitda and $ 314 million in operating cash flow and earned $ 3.01 per share , all of which are quarterly records.
rather than reading those statements , i will refer to you to those supplemental materials.
smartside has a long runway for growth ahead as we innovate , capture share , expand addressable markets and execute an aggressive capacity expansion strategy.
we 're also evaluating and prioritizing subsequent projects to add capacity by conversion and / or expansion of existing facilities as well as growing prefinishing capacity.
last quarter , we announced a phased integrated capacity expansion plan that included converting our mill in houlton , maine from lsl and osb to smartside , the restart of our peace valley osb mill in fort st. john , british columbia , and plans to convert our osb mill in sagola , michigan society.
given the strength of smartside demand , we are exploring options to accelerate the conversion of sagola.
process to resume osb reduction in peace valley is also going quite well.
let me briefly update you on those projects.
we are excited about the capacity expansion of these investments in houlton represent , and we are gratified by the enthusiastic responses from local and regional suppliers and community stakeholders.
all these materials are available on lp's investor relations website , www.
houlton conversion is under way and on schedule despite some expected difficulties with travel and contractor access presented by covid.
we expect to begin smartside production at houlton less than a year from now in late q1 of next year.
