our investable cash position also remained strong.
and this aligns with our businesses.
today , wherever and whenever strategy meets talent , korn ferry is at that cross section , enabling agility in a world that will undoubtedly be in transition for the next several years.
our strategy in the new year will be to continue to innovate , replicate , and scale , allowing people and organizations to exceed their potential in this rapidly changing world.
i think our performance over recent quarters has reached a new level of scale and it speaks to the resiliency and agility of our colleagues , as well as our operational excellence , amid a time of enormous transition and secular change.
elements of our strategy will include driving a top - down go - to - market strategy , through our marquee and regional accounts , which represent about 36 % of our portfolio and that not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships , but is also key to more scalable and durable revenues.
and our adjusted ebitda margin was 21.1 %.
looking ahead , i truly feel we have the strategy , the people , the diversity of solutions and expertise to help our clients drive performance in this new world and our results clearly reflect this reality.
and lastly , we 're going to deploy a balanced capital allocation strategy , including a disciplined approach to m&a.
and with that , i am joined by bob rozek and gregg kvochak.
it 's one of the reasons we acquired the lucas group during the quarter , a move that adds breadth and depth to korn ferry 's search portfolio.
revenue was up 47 % and our diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $ 1.38 and $ 1.53 , respectively.
from esg to de&i to m&a services and we 're also going to further push the monetization of our ip and move more of our digital business to a subscription offering.
i 'm pleased to report that korn ferry once again achieved all - time financial performance highs.
let me start with a few comments before i jump into the second quarter results.
so , i 've always felt that the best way to measure success is through performance and if you look at our performance coming out of the covid recession , it 's really been and continued to be exceptional and that 's reflected in our q2 results.
