i 'm quynh mcguire , vice president of investor relations.
joining me for our call today are leroy ball , president and ceo of koppers ; and mike zugay , chief financial officer.
i 'll now turn over this discussion to leroy.
as the pandemic continues , i hope that you and those you care about remain safe and healthy.
references may also be made today to certain non-gaap financial measures.
and i 'd also like to wish all of you a happy healthy and prosperous 2021.
our next call will be on february 24th , to report final 2020 results and provide our view into 2021 at that time.
as indicated in our announcement , we 've also posted materials to the investor relations page of our website that will be referenced in today 's call.
so let 's move to slide 6.
as the starting point for today is shown on slide 4 , koppers has continued to retain its designation as an essential business as determined by the u.s. cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency or cisa within the department of homeland security.
collectively , we 're all happy to move past 2020 and step closer to seeing return to our new normal.
as i usually do , i 'd like to start with an update on a number of achievements related to our zero harm culture.
through a different lens , there were also periods where it seems the time stood still as many team members adjusted to the different stress points of working virtually.
we at koppers , take great pride in carrying out this critical responsibility.
in many ways , last year , seemed like a whirlwind of activity as we work to adapt to the many changes brought on by the pandemic while serving our essential customer base with critical products and services.
