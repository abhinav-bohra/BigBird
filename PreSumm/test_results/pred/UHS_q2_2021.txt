and yesterday , our board of directors authorized a $ 1.0 billion increase to our stock repurchase program , leaving $ 1.2 billion remaining authorization.
this robust recovery in volumes exceeded the pace of our original forecast and drove the favorable operating results even in the face of continuing labor pressures in both of our business segments.
as a result , most of our key volume metrics , including acute and behavioral patient days , emergency room visits and surgical cases grew to levels approaching those that we were tracking before the pandemic began.
our cash generated from operating activities was $ 119 million during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $ 1.45 billion during the same period in 2020.
even if one chooses to ignore the favorable impact entirely , our earnings during the quarter still exceeded our internal forecast by a wide margin.
we spent $ 482 million on capital expenditures during the first six months of 2021.
i would note that during the past four to six weeks , many of our hospitals have experienced significant surges in the number of covid patients , and it is not evident that this surge has yet reached its peak.
given the uncertain impact of this most recent surge on non-covid volumes and on labor shortages , we based our guidance for the second half of the year , primarily on our original internal forecast.
as a consequence , we also raised our full year earnings guidance , including an approximately 6 % to 8 % increase in our full year forecasted adjusted ebitda.
we 'd like to highlight just a couple of developments and business trends before opening the call up to questions.
