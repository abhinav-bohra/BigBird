as i reflected on the past year , it 's hard to contextualize what our country has been through in the opening weeks of 2021 , let alone all of 2020.
the company does not intend and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.
so we feel all the more fortunate to have emerged from such an unprecedented year in a renewed position of strength.

this has already caused ripple effects across both the residential and commercial property sectors , especially in major metropolitan areas.
we expect much of that demand to be durable , as families choose to move away from dense urban areas , and more people are able to work remotely out of their homes regardless of proximity to the workplace.
we exited 2020 with momentum building across both of our platforms , including record lock volumes in residential lending and very strong originations and contribution from business purpose lending.
that 's why our primary focus for 2021 will remain on our operating platforms.
strategically speaking , the covid - 19 pandemic has only further validated our core investment thesis , as demand for single - family detached housing has grown significantly.
gaap earnings for the fourth quarter were $ 0.42 per share , well in excess of our $ 0.14 per share dividend , and our gaap book value increased $ 0.50 per share from the third quarter to $ 9.91 in the fourth quarter.
based on the trajectory of our operating businesses and our expectations for sustainably higher net interest income throughout the year , we are confident that we can safely support a stable to growing dividend in 2021.
a reconciliation between gaap and non-gaap financial measures is provided in our fourth quarter redwood review available on our website.
we plan to announce our first quarter dividend in march.
