i hope you are all well and safe.
the world has not returned to normalcy yet , but travel is returning.
we have more team members in our offices , and i am personally looking forward to attending the aaos meeting in about a month in san diego.
we have a lot of great technology that we 're going to be able to showcase there and just really happy it 's going to be in person again , finally.
you , our team members are the driving force for this progress that we 've seen in our own facilities and certainly in our communities as well.
and then i 'll come back to close out the call with some updates on our active portfolio management and product in pipeline highlights.
and i think most importantly , our 2021 guidance view on a go - forward basis.
as we 're all aware , obviously , given the news recently , covid is still very much with us , and we 're watching it very closely , as you can imagine.
also , i want to say that i hope in our investor community that you 're continuing to stay safe and have been hopefully able to travel over the last few months to see family and friends.
our updated earnings per share guidance reflects our performance to date , our expectation of improved growth in the second half and that discretionary operating expenses remained consistent with q2 through the balance of the year.
and with that , i think it 's a good lead into our q2 call.
i 'll wait to do that after he provides the guidance information.
and every single day , we are supporting our customers and patients that they serve.
e also expect to see seasonality impact in the third and fourth quarter as we have observed in prior years.
but recovery may not be linear by region and / or by product category.
joining me virtually today are bryan hanson , our chairman , president and ceo ; and evp and cfo , suky upadhyay.
