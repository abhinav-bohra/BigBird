while our prior facility only funded large loans , the new facilities fund multiple collateral types , including small loans , large loans , convenience checks , and digitally originated loans.
in the first quarter , we generated record bottom - line results of 25.5 million of net income and $ 2.31 of diluted eps.
our growth initiatives helped to reduce our typical first - quarter seasonal liquidation and the impact of new stimulus payments , which in turn drove strong revenue performance.
at the same time , we maintained a superior credit profile with historically low 30 - plus day delinquencies.
following our strong performance in the second half of last year , we carried forward the momentum into 2021.
despite pressure from a combination of tax refunds and two stimulus payments in the quarter , our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $ 18 million , or 2 % , over the prior - year period , and was down only $ 28 million , or 2.5 % , quarter over quarter.
this strong result was driven , in part , by the new growth initiatives that we implemented in 2020 , which continued to perform very effectively.

these statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not place undue reliance upon them.
we plan to open 15 to 20 net new branches in 2021.
we also expect to enter up to two additional states by the end of 2021 and an additional four to six states over the next 18 months.
as we communicated previously , we entered illinois , our 12th state , in mid-april and are excited to begin offering our valuable loan products to millions of new consumers in the state.
we are very pleased with this outcome.
it represents yet another step in the evolution of our capital structure as we continue to pursue new avenues of funding diversification and additional capacity to support our business growth plans and our capital return program.
