today 's presenters are chairman and ceo , chris martin ; president and chief operating officer , tony labozzetta ; and senior executive vice president and chief financial officer , tom lyons.
and performance was augmented by several factors , including an improving economy as it continues to decline out of covid restraints , better credit metrics and the achievement of earnings acceleration from the acquisition of sb one.
the quarter was marked by growth in net interest income and a strong return on average assets of 1.11 % and return on average tangible equity of 12.04 %.
based on their confidence in our earnings outlook , our board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $ 0.24 per share , representing an increase of 4.3 %.
earnings of $ 0.49 in the quarter exceeded last year 's results by 32 %.
and during the quarter , we also repurchased approximately 630,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $ 22.04 per share.
provident 's third quarter results were strong , and we believe the business climate is promising as we look into q4.
our capital position is strong and comfortably exceeds well capitalized levels.
the market remains aggressive and our lenders face competition on rates from banks and on structure from nonbanks.
in terms of pricing , the weighted average rate on our loan pipeline has increased , reflecting movement in the treasury curve.
as tony and tom will detail in their remarks , we are dealing with excess liquidity , not unlike many other financial institutions.
in spite of the challenging environment , we win deals because of our relentless focus on delivering a best - in - class customer experience.
we have diligently deployed a portion of that liquidity into securities , but obviously , loan growth would be our preferred investment.
with a fairly neutral interest rate , risk position , excess liquidity and stable low - cost deposit funding , we continue to be well positioned to benefit from a rise in interest rates , while remaining well protected if rates remain low.
now it 's my pleasure to introduce chris martin , who will offer his perspective on the third quarter.
we anticipate the fed will commence tapering their quantitative easing purchases in the fourth quarter , which we hope will result in a steepening of the yields curve.
