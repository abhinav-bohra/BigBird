and then , adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends , and then we will take questions.
our margins in the cable segment continue to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and sudden increase in commodity and logistics costs , which have not yet been offset by pricing actions.
adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
given the dynamic economic environment , we are very proud of the company 's performance.
i will provide some financial commentary.
this is craig lampo amphenol 's cfo , and i 'm here together with adam norwitt , our ceo.
the year - over - year decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment in 2021 , together with the slight margin dilution of recent acquisitions , including mts which are currently operating at a lower operating margin than the company average.
total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $ 2.9 billion , which included cash and short - term investments on hand of $ 1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities.
third quarter 2021 gaap ebitda was $ 686 million and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times.
coming out of this quarter , i 'm just extremely proud of our team around the world.
and these are both important benefits , especially amid such a dynamic market environment.
net of capital spending , our free cash flow was $ 238 million or 59 % of adjusted net income.
as previously discussed , due to the pending sale of the mts test & simulation business , that business is being reported as a discontinued operation and therefore it 's expected results are excluded from our q4 guidance.
gaap diluted earnings per share was $ 0.67 , an increase of 20 % compared to $ 0.56 in the prior year period.
