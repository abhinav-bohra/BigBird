over the coming months , my leadership team and i are going to be developing a strategy aimed at doing what is best for u.s. cellular to continue to be a formidable competitor over the long - term.
from tds telecom , vicki villacrez , senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer.
we provide guidance for both adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization or oibda and adjusted earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization or ebitda to highlight the contributions of u.s. cellular 's wireless partnerships.
we have updated our safe harbor statements to include specific risks related to covid - 19 and its impacts on our businesses and provided that here specifically on slide 3.
in terms of our upcoming ir schedule , slide 4 , we will be virtually attending the morgan stanley 's corporate access day on august 13th and then doing a virtual morgan stanley non-deal roadshow on august 20th , which will include a fireside chat and our open - door policy is now more of a open phone or a open video policy , so please reach out to us and we can arrange them.
please let us know if we can do anything to provide more timely and important information.
we took a number of steps earlier this year to solidify our overall liquidity and feel confident we are in a stable and sound position for the rest of the year.
as you can see on slide 5 , at june 30th , tds had $ 1.7 billion in available funding sources , including cash and cash equivalents , available credit facilities , undrawn term loans and the undrawn portions of our eip securitization.
over the years , we have worked to retain relatively low leverage levels , long - dated debt maturities , sufficient undrawn revolving credit facilities and significant cash balances , while at the same time making sure we have the financial resources we need to fund our businesses.
we also repurchased a little over 500,000 tds common shares at favorable prices during the quarter , balancing the need to retain liquidity with a pricing opportunity offered by the market.
as we 've talked about before , maintaining financial flexibility is one of the pillars of our corporate strategy.
the pandemic has highlighted the criticality of our products to our customers and the teams have stepped up and continued to deliver on their typically outstanding service levels.
now to the balance sheet.
we want to send out our very best wishes that you and your families are well.
let me touch briefly on the quarter.
many aspects of our second quarter performance were impacted by the pandemic , yet we were able to generate very solid results.
