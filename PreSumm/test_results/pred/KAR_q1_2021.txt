i 'm going to start with the first quarter.
consistent with our announcement earlier this year , peter kelly has transitioned into the role of ceo of kar global beginning april 1.
it has been my pleasure getting to know so many of you and sharing kar 's story with you.
i also want to congratulate peter kelly and all of kar on what i would call a seamless leadership transition.
today on the call , we have jim hallett , executive chairman ; peter kelly , ceo ; and eric loughmiller , cfo.
peter has been an inspirational leader in our company for over a decade and is a true industry pioneer.
this is particularly true for commercial sellers , who have the greater need for these services and who have typically been the principal customers for these services in the past.
so this leads me to our overall competitive position and our points of differentiation.
he has been the architect of our digital transformation and has a clear bold vision for kar 's future , which i know he will begin sharing with you today.
we facilitated the sale of 753,000 vehicles , representing gross auction proceeds of $ 11.4 billion.
despite operating in an environment of constrained supply across our industry , we achieved the following results.
this is the right time for this transition , and peter is the right leader for our customers , for our investors and for our employees.
while off - premise sales are likely to continue to increase , and we are well positioned for this , there is still a role for bringing vehicles on - premise to our facilities and for providing related services.
i was pleased with our first quarter performance.
we generated $ 582 million in total revenue and $ 489 million in net revenue.
i appreciate that , jim.
