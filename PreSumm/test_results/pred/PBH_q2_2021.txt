our toolkit is wide ranging.
i 'll now hand it over to our ceo , ron lombardi.
let 's start on slide five.
i 'm pleased to report our long - term strategy and business positioning continued to deliver solid results as seen in q2 , where we experienced strong earnings growth and a stable revenue performance.
additional information concerning risk factors and cautionary statements are available in our most recent sec filings and most recent company 10 - k.
we continue to focus on the critical near - term factors that i 've previously discussed in order to successfully navigate the pandemic environment.
our multiyear investments around e-commerce are delivering impressive results.
these investments have led us to achieve market shares above our brick - and - mortar share in many categories.
we have reduced leverage levels to the lowest point since 2014 , which continues to increase our capital allocation optionality.
this means that results could change at any time and the forecasted impact of risk considerations is the best estimate based on the information available as of today 's date.
finally , our strong operating model and disciplined capital strategy continue to reward stakeholders.
in the second quarter and first six months , we were able to successfully engage with consumers as their spending patterns continue to shift online.
meanwhile , our business continuity efforts have been paying off.
we are benefiting from these agile investments in channels such as e-commerce , and our portfolio remains well positioned for the long time.
in this example , the end goal is to remind consumers how our leading brands help them avoid a doctor 's visit.
these items include shutdown impacts from many areas of the economy , ongoing changes to consumer purchasing habits , the potential for disruptive supply chain , heightened unemployment and many other economic factors.
