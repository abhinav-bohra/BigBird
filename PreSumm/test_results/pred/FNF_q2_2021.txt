we had a 17 % increase in direct orders closed , driven by a 57 % increase in daily purchase orders closed and a 65 % increase in total commercial orders closed , partially offset by a 5 % decrease in daily refinance orders closed.
we are excited about our second quarter performance as our title business continues to produce record results , and f&g set records for its retail annuity sales , while expanding into new institutional channels , further validating our decision to acquire the company just over one year ago.
their dedication has allowed us to continue to lead the title industry in revenue , earnings , margins and market share , and produce the best performance in the history of not only the company , but the entire industry.
it will also be available through phone replay beginning at 3:00 p.m. eastern time today and through wednesday , august 11.
in the second quarter , we generated record adjusted pre-tax title margins of $ 688 million compared to $ 378 million in the year ago quarter and a 22.7 % adjusted pre-tax title margin compared with 18.4 % in the second quarter of 2020.
given our strong earnings and cash flows through the first half of the year , yesterday we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.40 per share , an increase of 11 % from our previous quarterly dividend and our board authorized a 3 - year share repurchase program of up to 25 million shares.
looking forward , we will continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy as we remain committed to long - term value creation for our shareholders , while also focusing on supporting the future growth of our business.
turning to f&g , when we closed on our acquisition in june of 2020 , we expected f&g to provide a counterbalance to our earnings , which are highly sensitive to mortgage interest rates.
we also believe that our acquisition would accelerate f&g 's ratings upgrades and open new channels of distribution to enhance their sales growth.
there is significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of this pandemic.
f&g has also entered the institutional market with a $ 750 million funding agreement - backed note issuance , and was just awarded its first pension risk transfer deal over the past week.
we 'll begin with a brief strategic overview from randy , mike will review the title business , chris will review f&g , and tony will finish with a review of the financial highlights.
f&g has far exceeded our expectations as we have gained significant momentum in the bank and broker - dealer channels in the first year of launch , as well as strong sales growth in existing channels.
while delivering record retail sales , we have maintained attractive spreads despite the low interest rate environment that we continue to experience.
randy touched upon our record second quarter results as we continued to benefit from low interest rates , driving strong origination demand , the continued rebound in commercial real estate activity and the efforts and focus of our employees in taking care of our customers.
let me provide a few brief details.
