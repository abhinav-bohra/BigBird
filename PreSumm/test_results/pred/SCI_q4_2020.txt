as the year unfolded , actions we took in response to in - person meetings limitations yielded noncustomer - facing efficiencies.
however , before i begin , i would like to say a few words about this past year.
2020 has certainly been one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember.
as i reflect back on the last 10 months , i can say with certainty that our results are a testament to our team 's incredible hard work and to the resilience of our underlying business.
then i 'll offer some commentary on our 2021 outlook , with the understanding that there remains substantial uncertainty surrounding these effects of the covid - 19 pandemic , which could change guidance significantly.
i 'm extremely proud of our entire sci team for going above and beyond the call of duty in 2020.
in this difficult period , we stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best , helping our client families gain closure and healing through the process of grieving , remembrance and celebration.
the success and acceleration of these enhanced service offerings have highlighted the importance of innovation in our industry.
we hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy.
the health , safety , and well - being of our sci family was a top priority.
although we were greatly restricted in our ability to have large gatherings in 2020 , we heard loud and clear from our consumers that they still have a desire to memorialize and to celebrate the lives of their loved ones.
we will continue to invest in technologies that enhance how we interact with consumers digitally , providing a better customer experience -- contact to the arrangement conference and beyond while also enhancing efficiencies in our operations.
we did not see a wholesale shift in the consumer preferences , and our cremation remains stable.
one thing that became clear throughout 2020 is that our fundamental business has not changed.
with that out of the way , let me pass it on now to our chairman and ceo , tom ryan.
this is debbie young , director of investor relations for sci.
