our $ 1 billion brands tyson , jimmy dean and hillshire farms have driven strong share growth with consumers buying more than ever before.
today , on my first earnings call as ceo , i am incredibly proud to stand alongside our team members to continue that legacy.
it 's an interesting time to be in this industry and we have a leadership team that together can capitalize on the strengths of this company and the opportunities ahead.
let 's begin with the view of our overall performance this quarter.
we 've always believed in our mission and the vision of john w. tyson , who founded this company nearly a century ago because he wanted to find a better way to feed a growing country.
first , our retail performance.
last quarter , we highlighted the impact of lower hatch rates on our chicken operations.
we have begun to deploy new male parent stock , where this stock has been deployed , hatch rates are improving.
12 consecutive quarters of retail share gains in our core business lines is driven by strength of our brands , along with solid execution from our team.
fourth , we continue to build financial strength.
and in that time , i 've led every business segment.
the second imperative is to improve operational performance.
we are in a market that has demonstrated strong demand for protein and people are reaching most for brands they trust.
we expect a full rollout of this breeder stock to be complete this fall with harvest capacity improvements occurring by mid-fiscal 2022.
third , the diversity of our portfolio demonstrated its value during the quarter , led by beef , we delivered an exceptional result as the strong us and export demand , coupled with ample cattle supply , supported elevated margins in that business.
the steps we 've taken positioned us with a very strong balance sheet and high levels of liquidity.
