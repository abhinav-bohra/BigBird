as i said before , growth was certainly a theme for the second quarter.
together with our recent investment in boston common , a long - term leader in impact investing , we expect that these new affiliates will contribute over 90 million in ebitda in 2022 and contribute meaningfully to our organic growth over time.
and we are only halfway through 2021.
with the addition of parnassus , our run-rate ebitda is now over 1 billion , increasing our opportunity to invest in new affiliates and areas of secular growth and in resources to enhance the growth of our existing affiliates , including strategic growth capital and distribution.
as evidenced by our seven new partnerships , which we 've established over the last two years , our model is resonating with the highest quality independent investment firms in the industry.
looking ahead , we see an even greater opportunity to execute on our new investment opportunity set , given the favorable transaction environment , amg 's strong competitive position , and the increasing demand for our partnership solutions.
year to date , our affiliates excellent absolute and relative investment performance has resulted in higher asset levels , enhanced organic growth , and meaningful performance fees.
as it preserves the alignment between clients and partners across multiple generations while maintaining unique entrepreneurial cultures of partner - owned firms.
we believe that amg 's partnership approach is the best solution in the market today for independent firms.
and this will be especially important to parnassus given its leading market position and responsible and impact investing.
we have known ben allen , todd alston , and their partners for nearly a decade.
economic earnings per share of $ 4.03 grew 47 % year over year and represented the strongest second quarter in our history , primarily driven by ebitda growth of 40 % and ongoing share repurchase activity.
a pioneer in sustainable investing , parnassus has a 37 - year track record of investing based on principles and performance , achieving attractive risk - adjusted returns by building portfolios that also have a positive societal impact.
outflows from certain quant strategies totaled 11 billion and had a de minimis impact on our earnings.
and this is just one example of shareholder value creation through investments in our affiliates growth.
for the first time since 2016 , the majority of our cash flow will be deployed in new affiliate , investments already announced with additional high - quality prospects in our transaction pipeline.
