greater scale in this industry provides more capital for us to fund our growth priorities.
now on to our report.
i am pleased to share that watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter , achieving new records in virtually every performance metric.
earnings per share jumped 64 % to a record $ 3.71 per share on a 66 % increase in net income.
now as we normally do , before we start , we need to read our cautionary statement.
this was by far our most successful quarter ever.
and with me is a.j. nahmad , who is our president ; and our two executive vice presidents , paul johnston and barry logan.
gross profits increased 50 % with gross margins expanding 220 basis points.
they have a rich and successful history and we will help them any way we can.
looking ahead , we are engaged in a very fragmented $ 50 billion north american market.
they performed very well , and we cannot be happier that they are now part of an important part of watsco.
this is al nahmad , chairman and ceo.
operating income increased $ 88 million or 68 % to $ 217 million.
now we have two new companies in our family , tec and acme.
hope everyone is having a safe and good day.
and we hope to find more great companies to join us.
