1.5 years ago , we began simplifying our business strategy to reposition at&t for growth.
as you can imagine , this was a significant undertaking requiring us to not only focus our operational efforts toward growing customers , but also doing so in a manner that set us up for an improved profit trajectory in the coming years.
we added more than one million fiber subscribers for the fourth consecutive year , and full year broadband revenues were up 6.5 % as we returned our consumer wireline business to revenue growth.
in fiber , we ended the year with a great build velocity , passing more than 2.6 million additional customer locations.
before we begin , i need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement.
we achieved this growth the right way with full year mobility ebitda up about $ 1 billion.
we also surpassed our high - end guidance for global hbo max and hbo subscribers , adding 13.1 million subscribers in 2021 , more than any year in hbo 's history.
that 's more customers than we added in the prior 10 years combined.
we finished last year with strong momentum in growing customer relationships , achieving outstanding yearly subscriber growth across mobility , fiber , and hbo max.
in mobility , strong network performance and a consistent go - to - market strategy helped us lead the industry with about 3.2 million postpaid phone net adds.
apart from warnermedia 's contributions , our communications segment ebitda was up approximately 2 % for the quarter.
