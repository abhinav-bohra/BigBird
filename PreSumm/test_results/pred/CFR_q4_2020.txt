in the second half of 2020 , we discussed the non-energy portfolio segments that have had an increased impact in the economic dislocations brought on by the pandemic : restaurants , hotels , entertainment and sports and retail.
average deposits in the fourth quarter were $ 34 billion , an increase of 25 % compared with the $ 27 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.
this growth reflects it for us has always been a safe haven for customers in times of uncertainty , and also our success in building new relationships.
our team continues to manage expenses , while at the same time pursuing the expansion of market share and investing for long - term growth.
those numbers remain within our standards and comparable to what we 've experienced in the last several years.
a year ago , non-performer stood at $ 109.5 million.
for the full year of 2020 cullen / frost earned $ 323.6 million or $ 5.10 a share , compared with earnings of $ 435.5 million or $ 6.84 a share reported for 2019.
nonperforming assets were only $ 62.3 million at year - end , down 35 % from the $ 96.4 million at the end of the third quarter.
the decrease was driven by a decrease of $ 296 million in average ppp loans as a result of those balances being forgiven.
to put that in perspective , total problem energy loans peaked at nearly $ 600 million early in 2016.
for example , despite currently representing only about 16 % of our total consumer households , houston contributed 34 % of fourth quarter total company consumer household growth.
we 're great at building relationships.
throughout 2020 , the pandemic 's economic impacts on our portfolio were negative but manageable , and our overall outlook for credit quality is stable to improving.
we continue to work hard to rationalize our company 's exposure to the energy segment to appropriate levels.
it 's what we do.
here again our houston expansion is helping this growth.
