we will review how we closed 2020 and discuss 2021 financial guidance.
as you know , [ indecipherable ] this difficult year and as we navigated through the pandemic , we tried to be as transparent as possible and provide you visibility to our expected financial performance.
this is all the more remarkable since last year 's fourth quarter was so strong.
in such highly unusual circumstances , the default reaction would normally be to draw guidance and watch from the sidelines.
we delivered double - digit growth in all key financial metrics , and once again reported results above our financial targets.
so we did the same at the end of the third quarter when we decided to provide 2021 outlook as soon as we had some visibility , which was a full quarter earlier than usual.
demand for field reps continues to be soft in the current environment.
as a result , business development activity has slowed but the businesses performed modestly better than we expected as the clients have largely retained existing field reps.
fourth quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $ 2.11 grew 21.3 %.
i 'm pleased to report , we finished the year with a very strong quarter.
the $ 25 million beat above the high end of our guidance range was entirely due to the stronger organic revenue performance.
today , this outlook has become clearer and we 've decided to update and raise the guidance.
for the full year , csms revenue of $ 741 million was down 9 % at actual fx rates and 9.2 % at constant currency.
the beat here entirely reflects the adjusted ebitda drop through.
let 's start by reviewing our fourth quarter results.
a little over 70 % of this beat came from strong organic performance , less than 30 % from favorable foreign exchange.
