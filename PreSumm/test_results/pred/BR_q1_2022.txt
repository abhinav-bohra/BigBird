as a result , we 've built a 24/7 proxy and fund information infrastructure , which delivers highly accurate voting for thousands of annual meetings and whose efficiency saves funds and corporate issuers hundreds of millions of dollars each year.
finally , i 'll close with some thoughts on how broadridge is continuing to drive long - term sustainable growth.
our first quarter results marked a strong start to the fiscal year.
recurring revenues rose 16 % and adjusted earnings per share rose 9 %.
second , our top line growth continues to be propelled by a combination of our own actions and strong underlying market trends.
data , analytics , and ai are transforming how clients make decisions and power their investment processes.
the move to the cloud enables a scalable and variable cost computing architecture , which is changing our clients ' business models.
the biggest driver of our 7 % organic growth across all three of our businesses was the onboarding of closed sales as we continue to convert our $ 385 million backlog into recurring revenue.
our governance business had a very strong first quarter.
generating those returns requires consistent execution.
it 's being facilitated by the rapid adoption of next - generation technologies.
we also benefited from the continued tailwind of very healthy position growth in governance , driven by ongoing trends.
it also keeps us on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3 - year growth objectives.
i 'll provide an update on our execution steps in a few moments.
it 's reducing costs for our clients , broadening their reach and accelerating processes from account opening to trade settlement and communications.
we will also be referring to several non-gaap measures , which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of broadridge 's underlying operating results.
