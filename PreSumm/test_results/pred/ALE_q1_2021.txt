our corporate and other businesses , which includes bni energy and allete properties recorded a net loss of $ 600,000 in 2021 compared to a net loss of $ 2.9 million in 2020.
as you know , in february of this year , a polar vortex brought extreme cold and icing conditions to much of our nation with areas , especially in the south and southwest experiencing some of the coldest temperatures in decades.
these temperature extremes caused major disruption in the power and gas markets , resulting in significant operational challenges and power price volatility in a very short period of time.
although allete was affected by the extreme weather during the quarter , the effects varied greatly depending on locations and the nature of our operations.
for example , our regulated operations performed well and customers at minnesota power and superior water , light and power were largely unaffected , while extreme weather in the southwest and lower wind availability in the midwest negatively affected our allete clean energy operations and related earnings.
allete 's strategic geographic diversity and our diverse business mix were certainly major factors in our ability to successfully navigate this extreme event , and we believe they will continue to differentiate allete with our ability to remain resilient and manage adverse economic risk.
in a few minutes , steve and bob will provide additional insights in the key financial drivers for the remainder of the year.
minnesota power is the first minnesota utility to provide 50 % renewable energy to our customers.
there are many differing views on the preferred speed and means of the global clean energy transformation needed to address climate change.
this bold vision and its timing reflects how seriously we take our responsibilities to the climate , our customers and our communities.
as we execute allete 's sustainability strategy , it 's critically important to us that this transition truly be sustainable for allete 's businesses.
last year 's results were $ 1.28 per share on net income of $ 66.3 million.
whether we 're talking about allete 's regulated or non-regulated businesses , our sustainability and action strategy provides optionality and allows time for advances in technology as well as time for our communities and our employees to transition to a secure and carbon - free energy economy.
as detailed in our last conference call , minnesota power filed its integrated resource plan with the minnesota public utilities commission in february.
this irp outlines our plans to further transform minnesota power 's energy supply to 70 % renewable by 2030 and to be coal free and 80 % lower carbon by 2035.
these decreases were partially offset by earnings from the south peak wind energy facility , which commenced operations in april 2020.
