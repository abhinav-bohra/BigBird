rent collections continue to drift higher.
occupancy was 98.3 % at the end of the quarter , which remains above our long - term average of 98 % and while our occupancy rate ticked down 20 basis points from december 31 , we 're seeing impressive activity in our leasing department including interest by a number of strong national tenants in some of our vacancies.
our portfolio of 3,161 freestanding single - tenant retail properties continued to perform exceedingly well.
our impressive collection results continue to compare very favorably to other retail real estate companies , including those with a significantly higher percentage of investment - grade tenants.
the majority of the remaining uncollected rent in the first quarter was simply deferred rent that we expect to collect when the tenant 's repayment obligation kicks in later this year.
turning to the highlights of our first quarter financial results.
recently , our two largest bankruptcies were resolved in favorable fashion.
in an unsettled post - pandemic environment , where cap rates remain at all - time lows , we will continue to be very thoughtful in our underwriting and primarily pursue sale - leaseback transactions with our relationship tenants.
kudos to kevin and his team for once again raising well - priced capital when it 's available.
kevin will have more details on this increase in his remarks.
almost all of our acquisitions were from relationship tenants with which we do repeat programmatic business.
a portion of those bond proceeds were used to redeem our 2023 debt maturities.
so on very good liquidity and leverage position , i have no need to raise any additional capital to meet our 2021 acquisition guidance.
net debt to gross book assets was 34.7 % at quarter end.
first , we collected $ 2.2 million of receivables from cash basis tenants that relate to prior quarters.
our next debt maturity is $ 350 million , with a 3.9 % coupon in mid-2024.
