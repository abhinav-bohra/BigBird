cfo , glenn macinnes and i will review business and financial performance for the quarter.
we 've paid all of our employees at 100 % of pay , including those who are home because of illness , quarantine , higher health risk or to take care of loved ones or kids home because of school closures.
this included moving to drive through an atm service with bank lobbies open by appointment only.
we 've increased the daily pay of those bankers on the front line and have added pto time to those workers as a future benefit.
we immediately took action at the outset of the pandemic to support our employees , customers and the communities we serve.
we swiftly moved 80 % of our workforce to remote or at - home work thereby creating a safer socially distance work setup in our buildings for those who need to be on - site to execute the central operations.
i 'll now introduce webster 's president and ceo , john ciulla.

we have not reduced our workforce by a single fte during the crisis.
