in november , through a partnership with semcap private equity , we invested in purely elizabeth , a category - leading organic consumer products brand.
in 2021 , we posted robust double - digit operating income growth compared with 2020.
we demonstrated agility and industry leadership in navigating the current challenging macroeconomic environment as we focused on mitigating industrywide supply and labor headwinds.
we implemented inflation - justified price increases toward the end of the year , made investments targeted at automation , and focused relentlessly on productivity.
with that , i 'm pleased to turn today 's call over to mohammad.
in the first half of 2021 , despite these pressures , gross profit benefited from strong performance across all of our segments , particularly higher per-unit selling prices in our banana segment.
on the site , you can also register for future distributions.
the fleet also enabled us to expand our third - party freight services.
as previously mentioned , six out of the 13 vessels are new , putting us in a stronger , more agile position as we continue to provide reliable quality service to our customers.
in keeping with our shareholder accretion approach , in the second half , we increased our quarterly cash dividend from $ 0.10 per share to $ 0.15 per share , bringing our total dividend payout for the year to $ 0.50 per share , and the same approach will continue in 2022.
joining me in today 's discussions are mohammad abu- ghazaleh , chairman and chief executive officer ; and eduardo bezerra , senior vice president and chief financial officer.
as a result , adjusted ebitda margin increased 40 basis points to 4.9 % from 4.5 %.
as an offset , sales of fresh - cut vegetables decreased during the fourth quarter compared with the prior - year period.
as chantal mentioned , i am ana miranda , vice president , global fp&a , and investor relations with fresh del monte produce.
melon net sales increased in north america driven by higher sales volume and per-unit sales prices , and pineapple net sales increased across most regions driven by higher per-unit sales price.
the primary drivers were increases in our melon and pineapple product lines.
