i 'll give some detail here as we see our growth concentrated in several areas.
mark will give some details of our comparisons to pre-pandemic levels.
our revenue for the quarter of $ 493 million was above our internal expectations as was our adjusted ebitda of $ 73 million.
in fact , for mednax as a whole , our patient volumes , revenue and adjusted ebitda were all ahead of the same period in 2019 , which suggests that at this time , our business has more than recovered from the significant negative impact to the covid - 19 pandemic that we experienced in 2020 and earlier this year.
we also fully expect adjusted ebitda next year to exceed $ 270 million , absent any major external events.
this is still a preliminary view into 2022 , and we 'll be in a better position to provide a more specific outlook after we finish our budgeting process , but i believe we 're building momentum in our business.
key metrics such as payer mix and rate of admissions continue to be favorable compared to last year.
the sum of these efforts is continuing to ramp up post -covid.
acquisitions have n't been a major part of our activity so far this year , but they could play just as important role as organic growth when we do see them strategically.
demand for the critical services that our affiliated clinicians provide not only recovered from last year 's disruptions , but continues to grow.
and third , we look for acquisition opportunities where we see a clear combination of bolstering hospital relationships , adding to our patient care and support and a demonstrable growth path within that acquisition.
and importantly , after all of our reorganization activities , pre-covid.
we also estimate that the broader growth efforts we have in place have supplemented this demand so far in 2021.
second , in our daily operations , we strive to provide the best 24/7 support possible to our practices , which combines our patient service access initiatives , improving technology support , improving revenue cycle management efficiency , recruiting the best talent and old - fashioned focused managerial actions.
total births at the hospitals where we provided nicu services were up 2.8 % on a same - unit basis , and our nicu days were up 5.6 %.
first , we target opportunities to expand practices or add practices and enhance our hospital relationships and also directly improve care through the coordination of different subspecialties that many patients need to access.
