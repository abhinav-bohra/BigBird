when we introduced this business back in 2018 , we set a target of $ 300 million from procurement savings and essentials revenue.
tom , will you please begin ?<q>the fourth quarter closed out a year of record - setting activity across our business.
core ffo was $ 1.12 per share , with net promote earnings of $ 0.05.
and in accordance with reg g , we have provided a reconciliation to those measures.
excluding promotes , core ffo grew 14 % year over year.
in light of our success with procurement and the fact that we have embedded this initiative into our platform , we will not provide specific procurement reporting going forward , instead focusing on essentials.
we also have a long development runway of $ 26 billion , much of which comes from our international opportunity set , positioning us for continued strong value creation well into the future.
using this new definition consistently applied , our net effective lease mark - to - market at year - end jumped almost 800 basis points sequentially to 36 %.
these statements are based on current expectations , estimates and projections about the market and the industry in which prologis operates as well as management 's beliefs and assumptions.
this now aligns with how rent change on rollover is expressed.
this current rent spread represents embedded organic noi of more than $ 1.2 billion or $ 1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rent growth.
this collaboration is an extension of the work we 've done to harmonize other property operating metrics.
cash same - store noi growth remained strong at 7.5 % for the quarter and 6.1 % for the full year.
i want to point out that we 're modifying our in - place to market rent disclosure to standardize this metric among logistics reits.
