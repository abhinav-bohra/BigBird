now let 's turn to our third quarter results , where we will provide comparisons to both prior year and where appropriate 2019.
we are appreciative of the resiliency of the entire skechers organization.
without them we would n't have achieved our strong results and do what we do best ; design , deliver , and market what we believe is the most comfortable and innovative footwear available today.
before we share details of our record third quarter sales , it is important to note that the pandemic continues to impact our business globally.
as the pandemic remains a challenge in our business and personal lives , we are focused on the safety of our teams around the world.
while many markets , including the united states and europe eased restrictions , others particularly the asia pacific region experienced extended and even renewed lockdown measures.
quarterly gross margin remained strong at 49.6 % primarily driven by higher average selling prices and fewer promotions in our direct - to - consumer business , partially offset by increases in freight costs.
i hope you , your colleagues and loved ones are all doing well.
for the nine months period we also achieved a sales record of over $ 4.6 billion.
transit times doubled from what they were in the pre-pandemic period.
skechers third quarter revenue of $ 1.55 billion was a new record for the period and a remarkable achievement given the ongoing global supply chain disruptions just discussed.
we are optimistic given our strong start to the fourth quarter.
factory production in south vietnam has restarted , albeit at a reduced capacity in some areas and the congestion at some global ports has improved.

both markets delivered meaningful improvements in gross margins and strong year - over - year average selling price growth.
i will now read the safe harbor statement.
