it bears repeating that we could not be more in awe of their responses to the extraordinary challenges they have faced over the last many months.
mary took a part - time dishwashing job so that she could spend time with her husband amid visitation restrictions.
because the governor of florida recently eased covid - related restrictions for senior housing and care visitation , mary completed her professional dishwashing career and can now visit her husband at will , adhering to all proper safety protocols , of course.
the community rosecastle at deerwood , which is operated for us by alg senior , has maintained close ties with mary.
i would also like to quickly update you on the story we told you last quarter about mary daniel , the wife of an alzheimer 's patient at one of our communities.
she continues to be active in the media , speaking positively about rosecastle as well as advocating for families across the nation who are trying to find ways to see and visit their loved ones.
we wish mary and steve nothing but the best.
and we know they will valiantly face several months to come as some areas experience resurgence of cases and we enter the winter and flu season.
while some of the biggest operators in the country may have the resources to take on such projects on their own , smaller regional operators often do n't have the same bandwidth.
this initiative comes from ltc 's desire to assist operators in upgrading their buildings for state - of - the - art infection control protocols.
unfortunately , there has not been a consistent meaningful decrease in covid - 19 cases around the country.
for example , we 're in the process of rolling out a new program called smart design , which was conceived by our executive vice president and managing director of business development , doug korey ; and our vice president , marketing and investor relations , mandi hogan.
with that in mind , we are partnering with avenue development to assist our operators with turnkey and customized retrofitting options.
in fact , many states and regions are seeing spikes in new cases.
ltc is continuing to provide support where we are needed.
while our industry continues to face cost challenges , related to supplies , testing and staffing , i believe our operating partners now have better tools and a much better understanding of how to manage in the world of covid.
