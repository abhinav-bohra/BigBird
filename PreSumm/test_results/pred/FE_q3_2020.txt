we have updated our funds from operations and free cash flow forecast for 2020 , to reflect the impacts of higher storm costs of approximately $ 145 million and higher costs associated with the pandemic , including uncollectibles of approximately $ 120 million , most of which are deferred for future recovery.
i appreciate the opportunity to participate in today 's call.
i 'm going to start out by discussing the leadership transition the company announced last week , my role with the company and the board 's governance efforts.
first , i will note that the doj investigation prompted a number of shareholder and customer lawsuits , and we are also responding to a subpoena we received from the sec on september 2nd , related to the investigation in the firstenergy by the sec division of enforcement.
for those of you who do not know chris , he has been an independent member of the firstenergy board since 2011 and he retired in 2019 as president and chief executive officer of trinseo sa.
we are cooperating with the doj and the sec.
we also have several other executives available to join us for the q&a session.
i look forward to working closely with him in my new role as executive director.
in his various leadership roles at the company , including his recent tenure as cfo and president , steve has supported the execution of firstenergy 's long - term customer - focused growth strategy and demonstrated his commitment to delivering value to all stakeholders , including employees , customers , communities and shareholders.
when we determine that employee conduct is inconsistent with our policy and values , no matter how senior the individual , we have a duty to take action , and that is what we have done here.
he became president in may 2020 as part of the company 's ordinary course succession planning process.
as a result , firstenergy announced on thursday that ceo chuck jones , along with dennis chack , senior vice president of product development , marketing and branding ; and mike dowling , senior vice president of external affairs , were all terminated effective immediately.
concurrently , steve strah , who many of you know from his roles as firstenergy 's president and previously cfo , was appointed acting ceo.
steve has the experience , credibility and the support of the board in this role.
we will also discuss certain non-gaap financial measures.
the board is already conducting a full review of its governance and oversight processes to look for areas of improvement going forward.
