we continue to see our membership program gaining traction as enrollment increases.
andrew page , executive vice president and chief financial officer , will then review our second quarter results and provide guidance for the current fiscal year.
we are pleased to report that our momentum continued into the second quarter , leading to excellent top and bottom line results that reflect the health of our category , the deep engagement we have with our customers and the strategic nature of our vendor partnerships.
the broad - based growth was driven by strong performances in women's and kids footwear , coupled with strong demand across apparel and accessories.
in addition , with further gains in our inventory productivity and meaningfully low levels of promotional activity , we were able to deliver significant margin gains in a truly impressive bottom line performance.
we are also making meaningful progress on our north america portfolio and fleet transformation strategy.
our u.s. fleet was open close to 100 % of the possible operating days , while our canadian business was impacted by closures in ontario , resulting in doors being opened approximately 70 % of possible operating days.
with economies reopening to a greater extent throughout most of the markets in which we operate , we saw a low double - digit lift in traffic compared to fiscal 2020 , which demonstrates the ongoing importance of our stores , where our customers enjoy spending time after connecting with us digitally.
as we discussed last quarter , we made the strategic decision to wind down our footaction banner by the end of fiscal 2022 and focus our resources on our core concepts.
turning now to some highlights of our three geographies.
our digital sales penetration rate was 20.1 % , normalizing from the peak levels we saw in 2020 while remaining well above 2019 levels , a trend we expect to continue going forward.
i 'm proud of the great progress our teams have made against the ongoing challenges created by the covid - 19 pandemic , delivering great customer experiences despite lean inventory levels and temporary store closures in certain countries.
we just completed our first footaction store conversion , reopening it as a foot locker format.
and we have approximately 50 more conversions planned for the back half of the year , along with 130 footaction store closures.
the management team has built a strong and scalable business model , led by their off - mall real estate strategy , full family offerings , focus on the hispanic customer and the commitment to elevating the communities that it serves.
moreover , together , these acquisitions will expand our ability to service the entire retail price value spectrum.
