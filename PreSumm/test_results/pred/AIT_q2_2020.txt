over time , we continue to expect mixed benefit margins , reflecting the positive contribution of expansionary products , growth among our technical service oriented solutions and ongoing actions to expand business across our local customer base.
i 'll begin with some brief thoughts , and then dave will follow to review our financial results in more detail.
our second quarter was characterized by cost discipline , margin control and solid cash generation within a persistent soft end market backdrop.
execution in these areas is providing a path to deliver our earnings and cash commitments for the year and should support accretive growth once demand rebounds as well as capital deployment opportunities going forward.
we appreciate you joining us.
we also remain highly focused on accelerating our company - specific out growth potential regardless of the industrial cycle.
as highlighted in recent quarters , our leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control , fluid power , flow control and now automation puts us in a unique position to capture greater share organically as our customers outsource their technical mro and production infrastructure needs.

we also saw greater weakness across our international operations during the quarter within canada and mexico.
while softness remains broad - based declines were most notable within metals , mining , oil and gas , machinery and process - related industries.
after seeing some stabilization during october and november , customer activity was unusually weak during december and remained subdued with organic sales trending down in the mid-single digits year - over - year , so far in january.
some of the recent softness likely reflects demand abnormalities that occurred this time a year , given seasonality , plant shutdowns and customer budget resets , in turn making it difficult to fully gauge the underlying direction of current demand.
a replay of today 's broadcast will be available for the next two weeks.
we also entered our second half of fiscal 2020 with a strong balance sheet , having reduced outstanding debt by $ 115 million over two years , post our acquisition of fcx , with net leverage down to our stated target of 2.5 times.
combined with our cash generation trajectory , we have notable flexibility for additional deleveraging , acquisitions and pursuing other opportunities to enhance shareholder returns in the back half of our fiscal year.
this modest headwind was partially balanced by ongoing execution on pricing and other margin expansion initiatives.
