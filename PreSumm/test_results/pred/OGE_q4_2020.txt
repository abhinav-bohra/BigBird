we 're more active in advancing our esg objectives and initiatives.
over the course of a couple of weeks , the region , including our service territory , experienced an unprecedented prolonged cold spell that disrupted natural gas supplies , resulting in extreme natural gas prices.
the cold spell also resulted in a record winter peak demand for electricity.
so turning to the business.
when you look over the last five or 10 years , we 've delivered compounding annual growth rates between 5 % and 6 % , and we expect to keep true to our commitment to deliver on our earnings growth target of 5 % by investing in lower - risk investments that improve our customers ' experience.
and so did our customers , heeding the call to conserve natural gas and electricity so that more serious shortages could be avoided.
we proposed to continue to carry the remaining balance on our books and defer the cost to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a 10 - year period and collect it through our fuel adjustment clause beginning in january 2022.
to help mitigate the impact on og&e customers , we are requesting alternative regulatory treatment to avoid our customers having to bear the entire cost of the 2021 weather event over the balance of the calendar year.
every day , we had generation online at each of our power plants.
to that end , yesterday , we filed an application at the oklahoma corporation commission , requesting an intra-year fuel adjustment for a portion of the weather events cost.
we have a solid and compelling investment thesis backed by a track record of performance.
you , our shareholders , should be confident in your decision to own and invest in og&e.
our fuel and purchase power costs for this event alone were more than all of our fuel and purchase power costs in 2020.
we anticipate the regulatory asset that will be created as a result of the storm to be in the range of approximately $ 800 million to $ 1 billion.
in addition , the conference call and accompanying slides will be archived following the call on that same website.
we 'll be sharing these stories more regularly going forward.
