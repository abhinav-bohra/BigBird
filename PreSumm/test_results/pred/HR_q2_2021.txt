we 're building a 106,000 square foot leed - certified mob with a subterranean parking garage.
and i 'll close by touching on a few of our internal initiatives.
first , we 're pleased to see that most providers are back to normal in terms of utilization.
healthcare providers have proven their ability to operate throughout the pandemic.
we now have over 1 million square feet with centura and expect to add more over time.
even more encouraging , physicians and health systems are telling us their businesses are growing and they need more space to meet demand.
year - to - date , we 've acquired 21 properties for over $ 400 million.
today , i 'll discuss current healthcare utilization trends , our second - quarter results and our external growth momentum.
this underscores our view that healthcare utilization is poised to continue growing on a consistent annual basis propelled by aging demographics.
as an example , we acquired five buildings associated with centura health , a leading system in colorado , that we have worked with for over a decade.
we 're well on our way to meet or exceed our 2020 acquisition volume , which was our best year ever.
this insulates us from new supply and facilitates steady rent growth.
we continue to see the benefits of operating in dense markets with high barriers to entry.
these assets also illustrate our cluster strategy and the depth of our existing health system relationships.
our budget is $ 44 million and construction will take approximately two years.
these acquisitions had a blended initial cap rate of 5.2 % with another 30 basis points of embedded upside through lease - up.
