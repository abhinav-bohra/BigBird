the guidance assumes no extraordinary weather events in 2021 and also assumes a flat equity market for gaap eps.
as a reminder , discussions today on adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share are on a non-gaap basis and exclude effects from unrealized and realized gains and losses on investments and any extraordinary reinstatement premiums and related commissions.
these results were highlighted by a 16.4 % annualized return on average equity in the quarter.
our business expenses were lower from continued expense management controls , including lower agency commissions and employee productivity gains , in addition to lower executive compensation accruals.
we ended the third quarter with total revenue down 7.8 % to $ 287.3 million , driven primarily by the realized gain on investments of $ 53.8 million in the third quarter of the prior year versus a $ 4.3 million realized gain in the current quarter.
we have now filed for more than 34 % in primary rate increases in florida over the past 18 months while simultaneously continuing to shape our underwriting risk with total policies in force relatively flat year - over - year.
in regards to capital deployment , during the quarter , the company repurchased approximately 101,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $ 1.4 million.
the company 's current share repurchase authorization program has $ 17.8 million remaining as of september 30 , 2021 , and runs through november 3 , 2022.
the improvement was driven by a 30.9 point improvement in the net loss and lae ratio from decreased weather events and lower prior year 's reserve development , partially offset by current year strengthening and higher reinsurance costs impact on the ratio.
our third quarter results , reported yesterday , demonstrate continued execution of our multiyear strategic priorities , including disciplined growth and operational improvements.
the expense ratio improved 3.7 points on a direct premiums earned basis due to continued focus on operating efficiencies , as steve mentioned in his remarks.
as mentioned in our release yesterday , we are maintaining our guidance for 2021.
if weather events exceed plan , we expect to see both the benefit from our claims adjusting business and increased loss costs.
