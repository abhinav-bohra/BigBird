from my perspective , the operating and financial focus for the company remains as follows.
this , in turn , enabled us to operate continuously , and to serve our customers reliably in all regions.
by comparison , the top 5 public companies in our sector were on average , flat on both the top and bottom line.
while david will be giving you more detail on this and other aspects of our financial performance , i would like to cover a few highlights.
we met our critical objective of keeping the workplace safe and healthy for our employees with virtually no work - related transmission.
over the course of 2020 , we committed to improving our balance sheet and i 'm pleased to report that we succeeded in doing so.
we generated a nine - fold increase in cash from operations versus the prior year due , in part , from inventory and factory management , controlled operating expenses , and record high customer early pay participation.
as we have noted in previous calls , the company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries , in which we operate.
2020 was a year that was fraught with changing demands and conditions , and our people weathered the storm admirably.
with regard to our public filing , we plan to file our form 10 - k for 2020 within the next few days.
i will then close with my 2021 outlook , and then take questions from our listeners.
we are able to make these improvements while , at the same time , concluding two key strategic acquisitions ; agnova , for market access in australia , and agrinos , a green solutions company.
further , we defined an environmental , social and governance platform , which includes extremely promising products and technology solutions.
such factors can include weather conditions , changes in regulatory policy , competitive pressures , and various other risks that are detailed in the company 's sec reports and filings.
we continue to follow a disciplined approach to planning our factory activity , balancing overhead recovery with demand forecasts and inventory levels.
with that said , let 's have our usual cautionary reminder.
