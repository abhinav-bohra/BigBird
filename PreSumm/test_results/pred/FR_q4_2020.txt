today 's statements may be time - sensitive and accurate only as of today 's date , thursday , february 11th , 2021.
we hope you 're doing well and staying healthy.
2020 was a year unlike any other and one which we would each like to put in our very distant memory.
notwithstanding the turmoil , fear and uncertain operating environment , the fr team remain focused , executed the plan and performed admirably generating outstanding results for shareholders.
also on the call today are jojo yap , our chief investment officer ; peter schultz , executive vice president ; chris schneider , senior vice president of operations ; and bob walter , senior vice president of capital markets and asset management.
our portfolio performance was strong.
we maintained high occupancy levels , grew cash rents and collected over 99 % of build rents , more on that in a moment.
for the full year , net absorption was 224 million square feet , 15 % higher than 2019.
we assume no obligation to update our statements or the other information we provide.
we capped off 2020 with an excellent fourth quarter.
we are also pleased to announce all tenants with deferral agreements and paid back those obligations in full and we currently have no other agreements outstanding.
in our markets , we 're seeing well located and highly functional space being absorbed by e-commerce and other traditional users and their efforts to optimize supply chain.
we delivered year - end occupancy of 95.7 % , up 70 basis points from the guidance midpoint provided on our third quarter call.
these metrics reflect consistently strong tenant demand for high - quality logistics space.
this was driven primarily by leasing at our developments and one of our replacement tenants in southern california taking occupancy earlier than anticipated.
and effectively it would be 100 % if we factored in reserves.
