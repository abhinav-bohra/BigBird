gross margin of 35.4 % for q1 was down from 35.9 % q1 of last year , which is in line with our expectations and communication.
for us , our top priority is to protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers , while ensuring our business continuity to meet our customers ' needs.
i am very proud of what the quaker houghton team has done to continuing servicing our customers as well as continuing with our integration , which has not missed a beat.
a great deal has changed in the world with the covid - 19 pandemic since our last quarter 's conference call.
but in the second half of march , we began experiencing impacts everywhere around the world.

in the first quarter comparison , you can see this difference is only 0.5 percentage point.
concerning gross margins , you may recall from our comments in the past that the combined gross margins of quaker houghton were expected to be about 1 % lower than stand - alone quaker.
this is indicative of our raw material savings from our integration starting to come through.
we have gone through a customer - by - customer analysis to see what our gains and losses and market share were at the customer and product levels.
we were also impacted by boeing temporary halting the 737 max production , which impacted sales by approximately 1 %.
these were the two main drivers of our volume decline in our pro forma comparisons.
joining me virtually today , as we are all working from home , are mary hall , our cfo ; robert traub , our general counsel ; and shane hostetter , our head of finance and chief accounting officer.
people are everything in our business and by far our most valuable asset , and ensuring their safety and well - being is and will continue to be a priority for us.
and the answer is that it really has n't negatively impacted our integration in any way , especially in the timing.
essentially , all discretionary expenses have been eliminated.
