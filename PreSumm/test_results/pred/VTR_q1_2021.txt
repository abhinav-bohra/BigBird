our canadian shop portfolio , which has maintained occupancy of over 91 % , tempered the full shop occupancy growth because canadian clinical conditions and regulatory measures are currently lagging those in the u.s.
these steps include making smart portfolio and capital allocation decisions , capturing the embedded upside in our high - quality senior housing portfolio , focusing on operational excellence and initiatives , investing in value - creating development and acquisition opportunities across our demographically driven asset classes , attracting diverse , attractive capital , and maintaining financial strength and flexibility.
i also think it 's important to reiterate our gratitude and optimism.
the widespread administration and efficacy of covid - 19 vaccines have dramatically benefited the health and wellbeing of our senior residents and their caregivers , and also laid the foundation for sustained economic recovery.
the whole ventas team is actively engaged in taking steps to win the recovery for our stakeholders.
let me first address senior housing trends and results.
with respect to health and safety , i 'm thrilled to report that our confirmed new resident cases in shop have fallen to literally a single person per day out of a resident population of 40,000.
while many of these positive trends began in the first quarter and therefore did not fully benefit first quarter results , we are also pleased with those results.
you have no idea how good it feels to say those words , even though we recognize that significant uncertainty remains.
in fact , move - ins during april at 1,880 totaled more move-ins in a single month than we 've experienced at any time since june 2019.
and all our communities are now open to new move-ins and most have reintroduced expanded visitation and communal activities.
notably , for the whole portfolio , march and april were the first two consecutive months when shop move-ins exceeded both , pre-pandemic move - in levels and move - outs since the start of the pandemic.
our first quarter normalized ffo per share and shop performance came in ahead of our expectations.
as a result , the natural , resilient and demographically based demand for senior living has revised , and we 've reached the cyclical pandemic occupancy bottom in our shop portfolio in mid-march.
we do expect those to catch up over time.
since then , led by our u.s. shop community , which posted 280 basis points of growth , we grew shop spot occupancy 190 basis points through april 30th to nearly 78 %.
