our current net debt leverage remains low.
i 'm going to begin today by providing some detail on our second quarter results before turning the call over to jennifer to provide her perspective on our performance , market conditions and thoughts on the rest of the year.
in summary , we delivered another outstanding quarter with operating results exceeding our expectations despite dramatic increases in commodity costs and ongoing supply chain disruption , including factors linked to the global shortage in semiconductors.
as a reminder , in the prior year quarter , we also took several cost saving actions in response to the uncertainty created by the pandemic , which reduced our costs in q2 last year by approximately $ 14 million.
in addition , we will file our form 10 - q later today.
while most of these savings were either temporary cost reductions or volume related , some were more permanent actions.
in q2 this year , the return of many of these costs represented a year - over - year expense headwind of approximately $ 5 million.
these documents are available on our website.
on an adjusted basis , earnings per share for the quarter was $ 0.50 per share , an improvement of 19 % compared to $ 0.42 per share last year.
consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter set a new company record at $ 437 million.
also with me on the call today is jennifer sherman , our president and chief executive officer.
i 'm ian hudson , the company 's chief financial officer.
we ended the quarter with $ 169 million of net debt and availability under our credit facility of $ 268 million.
we have also increased investments in our rental fleet , given the improving utilization levels we are experiencing.
turning now to the consolidated income statement , where the increase in sales contributed to an $ 11.3 million improvement in gross profit.
another area of notable strength during the second quarter was in our aftermarkets business.
