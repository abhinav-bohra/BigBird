reduced volumes due to well freeze - offs , especially in the mid-continent and gulf coast permian regions , increased electricity cost and customer facility outages presented challenges during the quarter.
but while the quarter 's results were positive , winter storm uri did provide us with significant operational challenges that i want to highlight.
our employees ' preparation before the extreme weather event and hard work during it enabled us to operate with very few interruptions.
operations teams ensured our assets were weatherized for extreme conditions , and that our employees were on - site and prepared to make the necessary adjustments to keep our assets running.
even without the weather - related earnings impact in the first quarter , our base business earnings increased compared with the fourth quarter.
despite these extraordinary winter -- weather conditions , we continued to meet the critical needs of our customers , including natural gas utilities and electric power plants.
volumes on our system and our outlook for the year continues to improve , supporting the increase to our financial guidance which we announced yesterday.
the opportunity for earnings growth without the need for significant investment is unique to oneok and our strategic assets in key operating areas.
the opportunities available to us are from a robust drilled but uncompleted well inventory , increased natural gas capture and rising gas to oil ratios in the williston basin and increasing ethane demand.
our natural gas pipeline and storage assets were particularly well positioned to address the needs for natural gas.
as i 've said before , oneok 's earnings growth in 2021 is not dependent on increased rig activity or increasing commodity prices.
with yesterday 's earnings announcement , we raised expectations for 2021 and now expect adjusted ebitda growth of more than 17 % compared with 2020.
oneok 's solid first - quarter results are providing positive momentum as we enter warmer operating months.
kevin will provide more details in a moment.
as always , we appreciate your continued trust and investment in oneok.
our higher guidance expectations include the latest producer forecasts and drilling plans , and our earnings range also includes the potential impact from a shutdown of the dakota access pipeline.
