the second category of vehicles is repossessed vehicles.
and i will also provide updates on the continued growth of our dealer - to - dealer platforms backlotcars and traderev the solid performance of our finance business afc and our continued diligence and management of a kar 's overall cost structure.
so i 'll start with the second quarter.
i was pleased with our second quarter performance particularly given the supply headwinds in our industry.
despite operating in an environment of very constrained vehicle supply especially from commercial sellers we achieved the following results.
in just about every prior economic dislocation event our industry has experienced an increase in repossession volume.
however this did not happen during the covid pandemic and i believe that the unprecedented level of government stimulus served to avert it.
for kar overall we generated $ 585 million in revenue an increase of 40 % from q2 of last year.
let me also mention that throughout this conference call we will be referencing both gaap and non-gaap financial measures.
we sold 119000 vehicles on the traderev and backlotcars platforms on a combined basis.
that was similar to our experience during q1.
we sell a significant of repossessed vehicles at adesa given the large number of banks and lenders in our commercial seller portfolio.
we generated total gross profit of $ 252 million which represents 51.7 % of revenue excluding purchased vehicles.
53 % of our q2 sales were from off - premise locations.
government stimulus coupled with other consumer protections has meant that consumers could continue to make their monthly payments and avoid repossession.
within the adesa segment we facilitated the sale of 711000 vehicles representing for $ 11 billion in gross auction proceeds.
