the combination of abm and able expands our core engineering and janitorial capabilities in attractive geographies.
as anticipated , demand for virus protection eased slightly in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2021 , but remain well above pre-pandemic levels.
the emergence of the delta variant and rising covid - 19 cases nationally have gains heightened interest in the need for disinfection prevention measures , particularly in high traffic areas.
as we look forward to 2022 and beyond , we believe that virus protection services will remain a contributor to our overall revenue as disinfection becomes a standard service protocol and facility maintenance programs.
our team members once again executed well and continue to provide exceptional service to our clients.
in this evolving environment , our flexible labor model enabled us to capitalize on staffing efficiencies and the associated benefit to our margins.
while revenue in our aviation segment remains below pre-pandemic levels , we expect to see continued growth , driven in part by new airport transportation and janitorial contracts.
our strong performance in aviation reflected a seasonal improvement in air travel as well as our strategic shift toward securing high margin and more stable service contracts with airports and related facilities.
in light of the current pause in the return to the office trend , we anticipate a more gradual ramp in office occupancy levels during 2022 , providing an opportunity for a longer tailwind of rising from labor efficiencies.
at the same time , we are proactively addressing current dynamics in the labor market , which include heightened competition for available talent.
as a reminder , roughly half of our revenue is generated from union labor accounts , which mitigates concerns around labor inflation and availability.
revenue growth was broad - based as each of our five business segments achieved year - over - year gains in revenue , aided by an improving business environment and the gradual reopening of the economy.
as i noted in last quarter 's conference call , abm has developed a task force model that leverages our substantial internal resources and cross-functional expertise to identify and implement solutions rapidly and effectively.
earlier this year , we established a human resources task force with a specific focus on recruiting and retention , and this task force has been instrumental in helping us to manage our staffing needs and ensure our resources are allocated efficiently and cost effectively.
the majority of this increase reflects a more normalized expense level in this year 's third quarter as furloughs and other cost saving measures taken at the beginning of the pandemic reduced corporate expenses in the same period a year ago.
with the reopening of schools and educational facilities , education segment revenue grew solidly from the prior year period , driven by increased demand for our services.
