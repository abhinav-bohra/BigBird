we expect to open two more in this quarter , with the remaining three opening in early 2021.
we understand that the banking industry has seen broad increases in deposit levels , as authorities implemented comprehensive fiscal and monetary responses to the pandemic.
however , it 's also been our experience that frost has historically been a safe place in times of uncertainty , and i believe this will always be a part of our growth in challenging times.
for the first time , our total assets have surpassed $ 40 billion , up 41 % in the last five years , and all of that representing organic growth.
average deposits in the third quarter were $ 32.9 billion , also up by 25 % from the $ 26.4 billion in the third quarter of last year and the highest quarterly average deposits in our history.
and speaking of organic growth , i 'll discuss our houston expansion in more detail later in the call.
however , even excluding this impact , loans managed a 3.3 % increase from a year earlier.
but i 'd like to point out that we were pleased to see our deposit market share in houston has now moved up to # 6 , up from 10th place a year ago.
even with the challenging environment , we and others in our industry have seen pressure on profitability.
those numbers remain within our standards and comparable to what we 've experienced in the past several years.
when they 've done the miraculous , what merely seems extraordinary tends to be taken for granted.
in total , we granted 90 - day deferrals to more than 2,500 borrowers for loans totaling $ 2.2 billion.
the fact that we 've been able to continue our expansion plans through the pandemic and see very promising results is due to the dedication and skill of frost bankers.
new relationships are up by 38 % compared with this time last year , largely because of our strong efforts and reputation for success in helping small businesses get ppp loans.
to put that in perspective , the year - end 2016 total problem energy loans totaled nearly $ 600 million.
the dollar amount of new loan commitments booked through september is up by about 2 % compared to the prior year.
