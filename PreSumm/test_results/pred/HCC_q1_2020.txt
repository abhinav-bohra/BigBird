we 're also appropriately adjusting operational needs , including managing expenses , capital expenditures , working capital , liquidity and cash flows.
our adjusted ebitda margin was 27 % in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 48 % in the first quarter of 2019.
the quarterly decrease was primarily driven by a 31 % decrease in average net selling prices and a 13 % decrease in sales volumes.
as you may recall , last year 's first quarter saw stronger met coal demand and higher pricing.
the increase quarter over quarter was primarily due to the high level of capital spending during 2019.
we expect this will continue to drive significant free cash flow conversion over the next several years.
and as a result , the unprecedented level of uncertainty in our customers ' markets has made the job of forecasting , which was already challenging , even more difficult.
of note , our balance sheet remains strong with a leverage ratio of 0.52 x adjusted ebitda.
we continue to expect the utilization of our nols will reduce our federal and state income tax liability to 0 until the nols are fully utilized or expired.
we are clearly seeing the impact of covid - 19 on global steel production and overall met coal pricing in light of reduced automobile manufacturing and a slowdown of construction projects.
in addition , we have ample liquidity without the fixed costs associated with legacy liabilities with the low and variable cost structure.
while we were pleased with our first quarter results , the rest of the year is less certain.
as i mentioned earlier , we drew $ 70 million on our abl facility as a precautionary measure to increase liquidity and reduce risk during these unprecedented times.
before we move on to q&a , i 'd like to make a few more comments.
