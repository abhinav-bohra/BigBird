similar to the first and second quarters of fiscal ' 22 , our third quarter performance reflects the benefits of our balanced business portfolio where softness in one segment is generally offset by strength in the others.
our consolidated adjusted ebit growth was driven by three of our four segments : construction products , performance coatings , and specialty products , which leveraged selling price adjustments and operational improvements to the bottom line.
our consumer group is the outlier.

these results were driven by our associates worldwide who persevered despite an extremely challenging operating environment , including ongoing raw material and labor shortages , omicron - related disruptions that were particularly acute in the third quarter as well as material wage , and freight cost inflation.
