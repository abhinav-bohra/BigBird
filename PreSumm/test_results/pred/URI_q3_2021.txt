clearly our people are executing well through the busy season.
we fully expect our momentum from the third quarter to continue through the fourth quarter and into the coming years.
that 's evident in the latest guidance we provided.
and as jess walks you through the outlook you 'll see that the updates are driven by our expectation of higher core rental results this year.
and that 's the predominant theme today not just our growth in key metrics like rental revenue where we gained 22 % year - over - year , but also the growth we see going forward.
bear in mind that this increase is on top of our july revision , which already accounted for the acquisitions.
rounding out the change in oer is the normal inflation impact of 1.5 % , which cost us $ 24 million.
also within rental , ancillary revenues in the quarter were up about $ 71 million , or 29 % , and rerent was up $ 20 million.
that tells you we 're looking forward to a strong finish to the year.
used sales helped adjusted ebitda by $ 4 million , and other non-rental lines of business provided $ 8 million.
this is a strong competitive advantage particularly in tight labor markets.
the best - in - class workplace culture we 've built for more than a decade delivers tangible benefits because we 're known as an employer of choice.
before i get into operations , i want to spend a few minutes on our culture because the quality of our organization is key to our strategy.
our average fleet size was up 8.7 % , or a $ 137 million tailwind to revenue.
results like this showcase the caliber of our team and the value of our people.
we 've grown our team by almost 2,000 employees this year including 500 employees over and above our acquired people and our turnover rate has remained in line with pre-covid levels.
