i 'm hallie miller , evercore 's head of investor relations.
as we 've noted previously , our results for any particular quarter are influenced by the timing of transaction closings.
it is certainly a very different world today compared to our last earnings call in january.
the vast majority of our firm is working remotely , and we are conducting our earnings call from widely varied locations.
we continue to believe that it is important to evaluate evercore 's performance on an annual basis.
i 'll comment on our first quarter results in a few minutes ; but first , i want to talk about our firm and how we have approached the covid - 19 pandemic from both an operational and a business standpoint.
our global team has performed extraordinarily well in very challenging conditions and adapted quickly to our remote working arrangements.
these factors include , but are not limited to , those discussed in evercore 's filings with the sec , including our annual report on form 10 - k , quarterly reports on form 10 - q and current reports on form 8 - k.
the economic issue that the united states and much of the world faces today is the rapid and unprecedented increase in unemployment , and the equally rapid decline in economic activity.
and fourth , maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet.
despite working from more than 1,800 offices globally , we are effectively communicating with our clients and each other.
third , operating collaboratively , effectively and securely , leveraging the technology in both new and old ways.
the statistics related to unemployment are truly sobering.
roger , john , and i could not be more proud of our entire team.
second , pivoting our services to address the evolving needs of our corporate , institutional investor , and wealth management clients.
first , assuring the health and safety of our team and their families.
