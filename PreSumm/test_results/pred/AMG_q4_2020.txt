as you know , amg is a leader in partnering with independent asset management firms.
that investment alpha is best generated by differentiated active managers and that the entrepreneurial investment - centric cultures of independent partner - owned firms offer clients the greatest opportunity for alpha.
as a result , we remain focused on executing our long - term strategy with excellence and discipline.
that investment performance is about skill , not scale.
throughout this period , amg remained committed to our fundamental principles.
in the second half of 2020 , business activity and client flows in private markets , wealth management and specialty fixed income were particularly strong.
amg had a strong finish to 2020 but the results do not fully capture the magnitude of the earnings power heading into 2021 , during which significant market , business performance and new investment tailwinds will further contribute to our earnings growth.
overall , amg emerged from the unprecedented events of 2020 in an even stronger position than we entered the year.
these areas collectively account for more than one - third of our ebitda and are becoming a more significant contributor to our overall growth profile.
and we entered 2021 with significant momentum across our business and substantial capacity and flexibility to generate meaningful additional earnings growth and shareholder value.
we also capitalized on the market environment in 2020 to strengthen our balance sheet and improve flexibility for the benefit of our shareholders.
complex operating conditions in volatile markets accelerated transition across the investment management industry with a number of our peers and competitors pursuing scale while others look to divest or exit businesses altogether.
these collective actions contributed to year - over - year growth in ebitda of 27 % in the fourth quarter , driven by growth in management fees and performance fees , as well as operational efficiency.
our fundamental equity and liquid alternative strategies are better positioned today given their improved track records , increased performance fee opportunity and enhanced potential to generate organic growth.
in addition to the building momentum of our existing affiliates.
with our unique competitive position and proprietary relationships , our new investment activity remains high.
