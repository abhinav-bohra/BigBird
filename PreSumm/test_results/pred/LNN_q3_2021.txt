in north america , margin headwinds are diminishing as multiple price increases implemented over the past several months are being realized.
the increase resulted from a combination of higher irrigation equipment sales volume and higher average selling prices.
this increase was partially offset by lower engineering services revenue of approximately $ 4.5 million related to a project in the prior year that did not repeat.
in the international irrigation markets , revenues of $ 52.8 million increased $ 20.2 million or 62 % compared to the same quarter last year.
we expect this margin pressure to continue through the first quarter of fiscal 2022 until price increases are fully realized.
however , as randy mentioned , we have also experienced significant cost increases in brazil that have compressed margins and will continue to do so as we work through a large backlog of orders.
