this obviously is a huge endorsement on the sustainability aspects and of course , a huge endorsement on the technology itself and is an important step forward.
now you should all be very familiar with those zero harm sustainability program by now under 10 pillars that fit within it across the esg spectrum.
at our recent investor day , we highlighted that being a good corporate citizen was the floor and not the ceiling at kbr , and i wanted to prove on that side a little bit more today.

but today i 'll highlight just one example to give you a flavor and that 's on sustainable fibers.
these risks are discussed in our most recent form 10 - k available on our website.
so in other words , it 's highly monetizable at lower investment and operating costs translating into a higher roi for our clients and at the same time advancing their sustainability agenda altogether very compelling.
and we could spend the entire call and i do n't plan to do that talking about these technologies.
how to recover valuable chemicals and water from what would have been a waste stream at the end of their process to produce manmade fibers.
this is very exciting on its own right and this excitement i think was compounded with the recent announcement that dow is also investing unimportantly committing to off - take.
all are proprietary , differentiated , disruptive and market - leading.
