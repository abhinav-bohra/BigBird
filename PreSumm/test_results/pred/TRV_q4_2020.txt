let 's hope yesterday marks the beginning of our political leaders on both sides of the aisle , taking a constructive approach to addressing these challenges.
before i address our fourth quarter and full year results , a quick comment on current affairs.
yesterday , we witnessed the most american of events.
the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected administration to the next.
also in our remarks or responses to questions , we may mention some non-gaap financial measures.
it 's not a political statement , but a patriotic one to say that we want to see this next administration succeed.
we have significant challenges to overcome.
they will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.
our ability to deliver these results in the face of an historic pandemic , a record - high number of pcs catastrophe events and record - low interest rates is a testament to the strength of our franchise.
we 're also pleased to report full year core income of $ 2.7 billion , generating core return on equity of 11.3 % , a substantial margin of the risk - free rate and our cost of equity.
a pandemic threatening the health and safety of our loved ones and neighbors.
more specifically , to our talented and committed workforce , the value of our hard to replicate competitive advantages and our expertise in balancing risk and reward to achieve industry - leading returns over time.
a distressed economy imperilling the lives and livelihoods of millions.
and with that , i 'll turn to results.
speaking today will be alan schnitzer , chairman and ceo ; dan frey , chief financial officer ; and our three segment presidents , greg toczydlowski of business insurance , tom kunkel of bond and specialty insurance and michael klein of personal insurance.
and a deeply divided society , which undermines our collective sense of security and well - being.
