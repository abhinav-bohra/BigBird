ryanair took delivery of its first 737 max 8200 and had positive feedback.

the u.s. air travel recovery has been strong and has come back faster than some expected.
turning to the 787 program.
we currently have about 125 units in storage , all of which boeing owns.
this benefit is included in both gaap and adjusted eps.
in the first half of this year , we delivered 64 737 shipsets compared to 37 in the first half of last year , a 73 % increase.
as we have discussed before , we are trailing boeing in terms of 737 production rate to burn off the inventory of storage shipsets in wichita and tulsa.
