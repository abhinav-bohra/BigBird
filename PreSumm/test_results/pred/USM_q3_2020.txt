this decrease is partially mitigated by increased demand for connected devices.
i 'm going to make some brief comments about the balance sheet and our liquidity position.
but before doing so , i 'd like to recognize the impressive operational and financial results of both businesses during the quarter.
as we 've discussed on past calls , maintaining financial flexibility is one of the pillars of our corporate strategy.
before turning the call over , i do want to remind everyone that due to the fcc's anti-collusion rules related to the rdof auction and auction 107 , we will not be responding to any questions related to fcc auctions.
over the years , we have worked to retain relatively low leverage levels , long - dated debt maturities , sufficient undrawn revolving credit facilities and significant cash balances , while at the same time making sure that we have the financial resources we need to fund our businesses.
as you can see on slide 4 , on september 30 tds continued to have a strong financial position including $ 2.2 billion in immediately available funding sources consisting of cash and cash equivalents , available credit facilities , undrawn term loans and undrawn portions of our eip securitization facility.
it 's kind of hard to believe but i 've been on the job for four months already and i 'm really looking forward to providing all of you with a brief update on the progress we 've made over that time.
in the quarter , uscellular took advantage of favorable market conditions and issued $ 500 million of 6.25 % retail senior notes due in 2069.
while shorter in term than some of our other financings , this is our lowest cost financing facility and we have a solid pool of receivables against which we can raise funds.
but before we pass by this page , page 5 , i just want to point out the new logo that we introduced in september and this logo is just another aspect of our program to elevate and evolve the uscellular brand.
it is very typical for us to opportunistically tap the market for funding when conditions are favorable , as they certainly were in august.
in october , uscellular upsized its eip securitization agreement from $ 200 million to $ 300 million.
in this instance , given market conditions , we judge that the retail debt market was relatively favorable taking into account all factors including term , call ability , ease of execution , lack of impact on the business operations , lack of meaningful covenants and of course , the all - in cost of financing relative to our other potential alternatives.
we provide guidance for both adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization or oibda and adjusted earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization or ebitda to highlight the contributions of uscellular 's wireless partnerships.
this provides i think a much more modern look , reflects the rapidly evolving technologies in the services we provide to our customers.
