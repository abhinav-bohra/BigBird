so , we 're certainly capable if this is prolonged in the ethanol business of making a pivot.
sales were based upon 65.9 million gallons this year versus 72.6 million gallons in the prior year fourth quarter.

in terms of refined coal , the plants are running -- currently running idle.

total ethanol production in 2019 was 15.8 billion gallons compared to 16.1 billion gallons in 2018.
we believe that 's due to low natural gas prices and lower - than - expected demand.
