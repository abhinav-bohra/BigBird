with that , i would like to turn this teleconference over to david.
when we reported our second quarter 2020 operating results , i noted that the pandemic and related economic lockdown severely impacted our april 2020 operating results.
since april , both vitas and roto - rooter have reengineered their operating procedures to safely care for our patients and customers during the pandemic.
these operational changes have allowed chemed to generate sequential operational improvement starting in may 2020 , and this improvement has continued and has , in fact , accelerated throughout the third quarter and continued into october.
i will begin with highlights for the quarter , and dave and nick will follow - up with additional operating detail.
david will provide updated earning guidance later in the call.
kevin mcnamara , president and chief executive officer of chemed corporation ; dave williams , executive vice president and chief financial officer of chemed ; and nick westfall , president and chief executive officer of chemed 's vitas healthcare corporation subsidiary.
we anticipate admissions to normalize when these types of facilities return to their pre-covid occupancy levels.
the slight decline in census is a result of soft admissions from the second quarter as well as supressed referrals from nursing homes and assisted - living facilities.
fortunately , the federal government , specifically hhs and cms have been exceptionally supportive in terms of relaxing regulations , allowing the use of telehealth where appropriate and providing pragmatic flexibility in caring for our 19,000 patient census.
our average daily census did decline two - tenths of 1 percentage point in the quarter.
overall , our third quarter 2020 admissions increased 4.7 %.
in addition , management may also discuss non-gaap operating performance results during today 's call , including earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization or ebitda and adjusted ebitda.
before we begin , let me remind you that the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 apply to this conference call.
i believe this has proven to be the correct strategic course.
we are currently estimating $ 8.6 million for medicare cap billing limitations for calendar year 2020.
