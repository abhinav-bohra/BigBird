the underlying health of our business is strong , and it 's getting stronger.
unless we say otherwise , all comparisons are on a year - over - year basis and revenue comparisons are made on an organic basis.
second quarter organic revenue comparisons adjust only for foreign currency , as there were no acquisitions or divestitures made in the last four quarters that had a significant impact on total company or individual segment quarterly revenue growth.
today 's event should last about an hour.
and all references to share gains or losses refer to revenue share in the third calendar quarter of 2021 compared to the third calendar quarter of 2020 unless otherwise stated.
and finally , our earnings per share guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-gaap adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year.
in the midst of these market headwinds , we focused on managing what was in our control and executed to advance our pipeline , launched new products and win share.
and our emerging market growth is up 9 % versus pre-pandemic levels in q2 fiscal ' 20.
with that , let 's head into the studio and get started.
we delivered 6 % revenue growth outside the us , including mid teens growth in emerging markets.
and when you look at our sequential revenue performance , our 2 % decline was slightly better than most of our large cap medtech competitors.
while the us market was a headwind , many of our international markets were much stronger.
procedure volumes were lighter than expected in markets , where our technology is used in more deferrable procedures like our spine business or those that require icu bed capacity like tavr.
joining me are geoff martha , medtronic's , chairman and chief executive officer ; and karen parkhill , medtronic 's chief financial officer.
i 'm ryan weispfenning , vice president and head of medtronic investor relations.
while the pace of the recovery from pandemic headwinds is hard to predict , our markets will recover , and as that happens , medtronic is one of the best - positioned companies in healthcare.
