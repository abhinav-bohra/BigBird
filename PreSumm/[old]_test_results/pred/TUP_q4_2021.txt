yet despite these outside distractions , we delivered growth in three of our four regions , with apac being the outlier , as it was the hardest hit by the most recent covid variant.
and in 2022 , we will expand our efforts and increase our investments to make our products available to consumers wherever they choose to shop.
and while we focus on building a strong foundation in 2021 , we reported both top and bottom - line growth in 2020 and in 2021.
most important to me and to our board at this point are accomplishments , what we 've learned and what we see ahead of us in the second half of our turnaround plan.
first , what has been accomplished.
we had to rightsize our cost structure to survive in 2020 , carry that fiscal rigor into 2021 , and successfully stabilize the company.
and we have been working with retailers around the world to take limited amount of products into new channels , and we closed the year ahead of our objective of $ 50 million in b2b revenue , which is product sales sold through retails in their loyalty programs.
we reorganized and upgraded talent to help us fix and stabilize our direct selling business.
additionally , we made important changes and investments while navigating unprecedented operating conditions , such as covid lockdowns throughout the world.
we started building new capabilities to open up our iconic brand to new channels of distribution , with the goal of dramatically increased consumer access to our products.
we restructured our debt twice , first , to provide a bridge loan in late 2020 , and again in late 2021 , to provide critical funding for growth , increasing our financial flexibility and reduce our cost of capital.
we divested non-core assets and reclassified the company 's beauty business as discontinued operations in our financials as we work to complete remaining sales transactions in 2022.
it is great to be here with you today to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results.
and our gross profit was dramatically impacted both by higher resin prices and logistic costs.
now to our financial results.
when we started the turnaround plan , we had 18 markets that we 're losing money.
