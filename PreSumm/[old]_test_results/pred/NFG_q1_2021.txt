the second rig will focus principally on tioga county.
operationally , we had a really strong quarter , particularly at seneca and nfg midstream , where in spite of 4 bcf of pricing - related curtailments , production and the associated gathering throughput was up 36 % over last year.
most of that growth was the result of last year 's tioga county acquisition , which continues to trend better than our initial expectations.
the team has been focused on high - grading our consolidated development program , optimizing our firm sales and transportation portfolio and driving down unit costs.
national fuel 's first quarter was a great start to our fiscal year , with operating results up 5 % year - over - year.
you can see our success in seneca 's updated guidance.
there is n't an individual that i 've met who has been more dedicated to the company and the industry.
over his 47 - year career , he led by example and was a main driver of our corporate culture , particularly as it relates to employee safety.
we increased the midpoint of our production range and lowered our forecasted unit costs , all while holding our capital range constant.
as our production grows in 2022 and 2023 , we expect this level of free cash flow to similarly increase.
seneca added a second drilling rig in january , with first production permit scheduled to come online in early fiscal 2022.
also , john pustulka , our chief operating officer , is retiring effective may 1.
obviously , our ability to generate cash is heavily dependent on the direction of commodity prices.
i wish them both the best in retirement.
the goal is to fill our leidy south capacity as soon after it goes in service , and thereby , capture the premium winter pricing in the east coast markets.
looking beyond fiscal 2022 , absent new firm takeaway capacity , seneca 's program will likely average between 1.5 and 2 rigs , which will keep our production flat to slightly growing.
