we expect q2 to be challenging and in preparation , we reinforced our cost program earlier in q1 , so we were in some sense prepared for the battle.
top line trends are very much in line with our expectations entering the quarter.
revenue declined 16 % organically and bookings declined 21 %.
trends have improved in the quarter and we saw a material sequential improvement in june.
from an operational point of view , we are not out of the woods yet , but a significant majority of our facilities are up and running moving into q3 which is positive to operating leverage as compared to this quarter.
we still carry a strong backlog across all segments and that increases our confidence for the second half.
most of our in - flight growth and productivity capital projects were completed in the second quarter.
margin performance for the quarter was acceptable considering the state of business activity in april and may.
let 's take a look at the segment performance on slide 4.
we ended the quarter with a comprehensive set of actions to manage through the turbulent times and focused on what we can control , our operations , costs and importantly safety of our employees.
after profitability gains in q1 on lower revenue , we targeted 25 % to 30 % decremental margin for the full year.
capital expenditures were $ 79 million for the first six months of the year , a $ 12 million decline versus the comparable period last year.
engineered products at a tough quarter particularly in the shortest cycle on capex - levered businesses like vehicle aftermarket , industrial automation and industrial winches.
lastly now on slide 8.
that puts us on track to exceed our initial full - year target.
along with our cost actions , our proactive working capital management resulted in cash flow improvement in both absolute and conversion terms.
