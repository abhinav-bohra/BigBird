that puts us on track for double - digit full year organic and an ebitdac margin nicely above 19 %.
and if you add in the pending willis reinsurance merger , that number would be pushing $ 1 billion.
so the team continues to execute at a very high level , growing organically , growing through acquisitions , improving our productivity , raising our quality and , most importantly , constantly building upon our unique gallagher culture.
a terrific quarter on all measures.
and we completed five new mergers in the quarter , bringing our year - to - date closed merger count to 19 , representing nearly $ 200 million of annualized revenue.
let me provide a brief update on our agreement to purchase willis re.
just an exceptional quarter from the team.
looking forward , while our fourth quarter comparison is somewhat more challenging , the recovering global economy , improving employment situation and excellent new business production should result in fourth quarter organic over 10 %.
on the regulatory approval front , we received competition clearance in five of six jurisdictions required to close , including clearance by the u.s. department of justice.
it 's really exciting to think about all the talent and expertise that will be joining us.
net earnings growth of 22 % , adjusted ebitdac growth of 13 %.
we 're looking forward to welcoming 2,200 new colleagues to gallagher as a family of professionals this holiday season.
the final jurisdiction in the u.k. where the cma is reviewing the transaction , that 's the final jurisdiction.
results continue to benefit from late 2020 and early 2021 new business wins , in addition to further improvement in new arising claims within general liability and core workers ' compensation.
integration is in our dna.
it 's going to be incredible for our combined organization and our clients.
