gross profit was $ 227.1 million or 15.9 % of sales in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $ 195.3 million or 14.5 % sales in the first quarter of 2020.
consumer demand for light trucks remained strong and our customers are building them as much and as fast as possible.
you can also find supplemental slides for this conference call on the investor page of our website as well.
furthermore , light truck inventory and a number of the key platforms that we support remained extremely low.

the metal portion of this column reflects these elevated pass - throughs on a year - over - year comparison.
we believe the demand environment for these products will continue for an extended period of time.
although the industry is facing continuity of supply issues , we continue to navigate through these challenges while delivering very strong results.
you may recall , we hedged this risk by passing with our customers bypassing through the majority of index related changes.
