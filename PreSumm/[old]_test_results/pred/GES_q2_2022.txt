and our product development , marketing , visual merchandising and buying are integrated more closely than ever before.
we are very proud of our team and our accomplishments.
we just closed a great quarter and we plan to review what drove our performance in detail.
but most importantly , i want to share with you where we are today and how we see the future , both short and long - term.
we hope to see you there.
let me start with our results.
these projects should be complete by the end of next year.
for the second quarter , we reported adjusted earnings from operations of $ 89 million.
the star of this quarter was the north america retail segment that reported an operating profit of $ 38 million versus $ 6 million in the lly period and almost 540 % increase.
before turning the call to carlos , i would like to mention that we will be participating in the fireside chat at the goldman sachs annual global retailing conference on friday , september 10 at 03:20 pm eastern.
some examples of these upgrades in store technology include enhanced wifi networks , extended payment methods and mobile check outs.
as you know , we resonate across three distinct customer groups : heritage , millennials and generation z and we develop our product assortment to support the unique lifestyle needs of these customers.
this was well ahead of our expectations.
this is in spite of being significantly less promotional during the period in all of our direct - to - consumer businesses.
the entire decline to lly was due to a timing shift of european wholesale shipments into q3 and permanent store closures , which are accretive to operating profit.
for example , in europe , we are seeing improved conversion rates , especially from mobile , which represents over 80 % of our traffic.
