before we start the formal part of the program , here is a brief video that is a look back on 2020.
2020 was a turbulent year.
we emerged from 2020 much stronger as a company.
we like to say that we do our best work and we 're going to jam.
we have a lot of slides and several presenters but i 'm going to give you the short story upfront.
that 's true for 2020.
four , some brands will rebound where social distancing really impacted sales.
with vaccines coming , consumers will socialize more.
we protected our people , we found a way to run the plants and warehouses safely , we set production and shipping records , we figured out how to make hand sanitizer in our u.k. plant , we operated the company with 2,000 remote employees , we pivoted our marketing messages to support a 60 % increase in e-commerce sales , we installed the new packaging lines with the assistance of off - site engineers using google classes , we added overflow warehouses , and we validated new suppliers and co-manufacturers.
four categories will stay on elevated levels , five categories will come down from covid peaks but some to higher levels , five categories will bounce back from covid impact , three categories will be steady.
our evergreen model is intact.
and this is on top of almost 10 % organic growth and 15 % earnings per share growth in 2020 , which exceeded our 2020 outlook when we last spoke in october.
we have our entire management team on the call today available for q&a after the formal pitch.
three , flawless sales will benefit from new products , a great influencer boost and a rebound of footfall.
in our communities , we delivered masks and hand sanitizers to hospitals where we live and donated to food banks , and recently our mason city , iowa plant loaned an ultra-cold freezer to a local hospital to store the covid - 19 vaccine.
and five , last but most importantly , we strengthened our brands and improved our media spend effectiveness.
