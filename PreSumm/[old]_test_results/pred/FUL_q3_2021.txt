these actions are expected to result in more than $ 400 million of pricing revenue on an annualized basis.
in a world where there are unprecedented supply chain shortages and significant inflationary pressures impacting every portion of our business , h.b. fuller delivered double - digit growth and met our bottom line commitments.
last evening , we announced strong third quarter results led by 20 % year - over - year revenue growth.
organic revenue was up 16 % versus 2020 and was up 13 % versus the pre-covid - 19 environment in the third quarter of 2019.
many of these risks and uncertainties are and will be exacerbated by covid - 19 and resulting deterioration of the global business and economic environment.
we also reported adjusted ebitda of $ 111 million and adjusted earnings per share of $ 0.79.
unless otherwise specified , discussion of sales and revenue refers to organic revenues and discussion of eps , margins or ebitda refers to adjusted non-gaap measures.
we are also demonstrating our ability to price based on the value our critical adhesive solutions provider our customers.
at the same time , our team is managing the raw material supply chain exceptionally well , enabling us to meet high customer demand without impacting our sales volumes.
these results were slightly ahead of our implied guidance.
these wins are driving our growth.
our margins in the quarter were reduced as expected and we expect to see significant margin recovery in q4 and 2022 as our price increases begin to outpace raw material increases and other inflation.
our adhesives wins this quarter are in products ranging from new consumer electronics and globally produced solar panels to sustainable food packaging and electric vehicles.
we believe that discussion of these measures is useful to investors to assist their understanding of our operating performance and how our results compare with other companies.
we are leveraging our technical capabilities and global footprint as well as our operational speed and agility so that our customers can continue to innovate and build new products.
first , a reminder that our comments today will include references to organic revenue , which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues.
