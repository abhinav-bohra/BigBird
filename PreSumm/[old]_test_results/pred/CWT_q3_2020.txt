the earnings power of the company , and again we 're a predominantly regulated utility in all four states.
we get to talk quite a bit about our california general rate case and some of the other things that are going on in the quarter.
so , as most everyone knows at this point , on october 14 , the california public utilities commission published a proposed decision in our california grc , that 's a delayed grc that should have been effective on january 1 , 2020 and the proposed decision approved the settlement that we had announced back in october of 2019.
so , a pretty exciting quarter here for us at california water service group.
and it also proposed to adopt cal water 's positions on the disputed financial matters in the case.
i 'm going to pass it over to tom to begin.
and for the first two quarters of the year , we had been reluctant to record regulatory assets for some of our continuing balancing account mechanisms , such as the wram and the mcba decoupling mechanism , as well as our pension and medical cost balancing accounts , because those accounts we did not know whether they were probable for recovery.
and while they gave extensive comments on a variety of areas , they did not comment on the three major areas that we 're recovering here.
and so , we 've also booked a regulatory asset for the interim rate memorandum account.
because these statements deal with future events , they are subject to various risks and uncertainties , and actual results could differ materially from the company 's current expectations.
in addition , the commission will grant us interim rate recovery.
as a reminder , before we begin , the company has a slide deck to accompany the earnings call this quarter.
in addition to california , we have about $ 110 million of rate base in other states that should earn a similar equity return , again , on a normalized test year kind of basis.
and that is -- drives most of our revenues and net income.
and that means , our earnings per share is $ 1.66 on a year - to - date basis as compared to $ 1.08 on a year - to - date basis in 2019.
i do want to emphasize that these assessments of probability do have some risk associated with them.
