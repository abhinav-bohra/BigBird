with these in mind , we created a long - term plan and targets to track our progress along the way.
before i review our 2019 achievements and provide operating and regulatory updates , i want to look forward to the future and share more information about our focus areas and priorities.
our strategy is anchored by four concepts that align with industry trends and shape the way we do business.
those concepts can most simply be stated as clean , affordable , reliable and customer - focused.
it will also be available by telephone through february 28.
let me talk briefly about each one.
as a result , the reduction in fuel costs as we use less fossil fuels and more renewables will be a source of cost savings to our customers in the future.
our journey to a carbon - free future will require intelligent investments in renewable resources and developing technologies.
as jim will discuss , we expect this plan will require considerable capital investment.
note that the slides contain reconciliations of certain non-gaap financial information.
importantly , our plan includes flexibility to ensure that we 're able to execute in a way that maintains affordability for customers.
affordable is planning and operating our business to maintain reasonable electricity prices for the people , businesses and communities we serve.
part of that plan includes ending our use of coal - fired generation seven years earlier than previously projected.
this goal includes a near - term target of 65 % clean energy with 45 % coming from renewables by 2030 and a commitment to exit coal by 2031.
as you can see on slide 14 , we rolled forward our capex forecast for one year.
reliable means serving our customers with dependable power safely and efficiently.
