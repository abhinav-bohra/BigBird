there was significant investor interest in the transaction , which enabled ari to both upsize the deal and tighten pricing.

ari completed an eight year $ 500 million debut offering of senior secured notes priced at 4.5/8 %.

turning to the balance sheet.
three loans totaling approximately $ 260 million repaid during the quarter , including one hospitality loan and two subordinate residential for - sale loans , one of which was a large new york city project , and the other was for a condominium development in los angeles.
demolition is moving forward at the property on fulton street in brooklyn , which will be developed into an approximately 50 story , 600 unit multifamily tower.
given the pace of development and the strength of the brooklyn submarket , we reduced the original reserve against this asset by $ 20 million.
