we saw strong revenue growth from the emerald card and wave and effectively managed costs while appropriately investing in our growth initiatives.
over the past several months , we 've met with many investors and analysts.
and today , beyond our thoughts on the quarter , we 'll address many of the themes that have emerged.
i 'll begin by summarizing our results and providing thoughts on tax season ' 22.
we 're really happy to be with you today and excited to talk about our first quarter , and we have a lot to share.
then i 'll share perspective on the value we have created over the last several years and the levers we have to achieve our long - term revenue growth target of 3 % to 6 %.
i am more confident now than ever in our plans for block horizons 2025.
lastly , i 'd like to mention that we published our second annual corporate responsibility report in september.
we pivoted quickly and learned to operate more efficiently during the pandemic.
please note , some metrics we 'll discuss today are presented on a non-gaap basis.
we 're continuing to execute against our strategic imperatives and are gaining momentum.
we recognize the importance of environmental stewardship , social responsibility and sound corporate governance.
and our customers have taken note as we have gained market share and just completed our best tax season in over a decade.
we continue to see momentum in the business.
on the capital allocation front , which we 'll dig into in a minute , we reduced shares outstanding by another 4 % this quarter.
as a reminder , given that the tax season extended through july 15 last year versus only may 17 this year , our quarter ending september 30 is not comparable and does not clearly depict our performance and progress as we 're off to a great start.
