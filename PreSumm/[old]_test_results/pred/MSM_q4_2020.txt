we also benefited from a large reduction in receivables.
after that , we 're going to look forward and we 're going to look forward to the next three years to discuss what is the next stage of our transformation journey.
we 've completed the heavy lifting of our sales force transformation and are now focused on accelerating market share capture and improving profitability.
this is a companywide effort that we 're calling mission critical.
and let me start by saying that i hope everyone remains safe and healthy.
and mission critical is more than just a project name , it 's reflective of our business strategy of serving as a mission - critical partner to our customers on their plant floors.
given the stabilizing environment , we paid down over $ 300 million of our revolving credit facility in august , as well as , $ 20 million of maturing private placement debt.
sales of safety and janitorial products also continued growing , with year - over - year growth of roughly 20 % each month on average and for the quarter.
the risk factors include our comments on the potential impact of covid - 19.
a lot more is coming on this shortly , but i 'll first turn to the quarter , and we 've provided some highlights on slide 3.
we continue to manage our liquidity very closely.
looking at our performance by customer type.
cash and cash equivalents were $ 125 million , so our net debt was $ 494 million.
our fiscal fourth - quarter financial results continue to reflect solid execution in a tough environment.
excluding one - time adjustments , our operating margin was 11.2 % , down just 30 basis points from 11.5 % in the prior year due to implementing effective cost controls.
as on our last call , we are all remote , so bear with us if we encounter any technical difficulties.
