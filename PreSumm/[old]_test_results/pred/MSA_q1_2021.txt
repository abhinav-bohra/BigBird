we saw that pressure in january and february , followed by a strong recovery in march.
it was a challenging start to the year.
today , i 'll provide a quick overview of the quarter then i 'll highlight three areas that give me confidence in our business.
quarterly revenue was down 10 % from a year ago.
the connection our associates have with our mission was a highlight of the survey.
keep in mind , q1 2020 reflects a pre-pandemic environment for msa.
now let 's take a closer look at the financial results in the first quarter , and let 's start with a focus on revenue.
so it 's a challenging comparison.
we know the pace of deliveries and revenue performance could be impacted by the challenges in our supply chain but i am especially encouraged by the improvement in demand levels across our international or -- i 'm sorry , our industrial - related products.
we 're staying close to the challenges associated with the supply chain.
that said , on the whole , we 're optimistic that the worst is behind us from a demand perspective.
in addition , our business is seasonally lower in q1.
the strength of our balance sheet positions us very well to pursue additional growth opportunities across the portfolio.
in constant currency , revenue in the americas was down about 9 % , while international was down 16 %.
at the same time , the situation remains challenging in europe , latin america and some other smaller markets with covid lockdowns.
economic conditions and covid impacts created additional pressure.
