demand rebounded throughout september and has strengthened further as we move into the fourth quarter.
i 'm energized and really excited about the bright future for alg as a part of hyatt.
the cultural fit between our two companies with a joint focus of care could not be better.
and the timing is proving to be very auspicious as leisure demand continues to be durable and a growing proportion of our segment mix.
as i reflect over the past several months during which i 've gotten to know the alg team much better , met with hotel owners and toured a number of stunning amr collection resorts.
we look forward to keeping you well informed on the progress of our integration efforts and performance of the alg platform moving forward.
we are another quarter into the recovery and have again produced results that demonstrate the strength of our business and reinforce that we are emerging from this challenging period as a more agile and stronger company.
we closed on the acquisition of apple leisure group on november 1 , and we are collectively even more thrilled about the prospects for the combined company today than we were when we first announced our plans back in august.
as discussed on our last earnings call , we experienced a wave of leisure demand during the summer with systemwide revpar eclipsing $ 100 in july , which was approximately 75 % recovered as compared to 2019.
revpar in the third quarter continued to recover at a robust pace , accelerating nearly 30 % compared to the second quarter and doubling revpar levels in the first quarter.
before diving deeper into the progress on our strategy , let 's take a look at the latest business trends.
we 've worked tirelessly to evolve and reimagine aspects of our operating model and the financial results and our momentum demonstrate our progress.
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our comments.
these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties as described in our annual report on form 10 - k , quarterly reports on form 10 - q and other sec filings.
however , this deceleration was short - lived.
as i mentioned earlier , we 've been actively positioning hyatt for the future with intense focus on advancing three pillars of our long - term strategy , namely : first , to maximize our core business ; second , to integrate new growth platforms ; and third , to optimize our capital deployment.
