i 'm very grateful for the dedication and hard work of our associates as they continue to work to deliver value for all of our constituents ; clients , communities , and shareholders and help drive the momentum to achieve our long - term performance objectives.
and with that , i 'll hand things over to bryan.
i 'm pleased with the continued progress across our company this quarter and believe that our results demonstrate the benefit of our more diversified model.
our attractive base of specialty businesses and higher growth markets are starting to drive our performance.
and last , but not least , you need to understand that our comments reflect our current views and that we are n't obligated to update them.
we delivered earnings per share of $ 0.50 a share and a return on tangible common equity of over 18 % on an adjusted basis , despite the near - term headwinds that the industry is facing with continued pressure on short - term rates and strong competition given growing levels of excess liquidity and muted loan demand.
given the continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment as markets reopen , i 'm increasingly confident that our client - focused value proposition with a broad product set positions us well to be nimble and focus on the key segments where we can differentiate.
it 's also important to note that we 're well positioned to benefit in a rising rate environment and ended the quarter with interest rate sensitivity profile of a 16 % increase in net interest income and a 100 - basis point shock across the yield curve.
as a result , there were several bright spots in the quarter that i think are worthy of noting.

our team remains strongly focused on serving clients and anticipating their needs to continue to deepen relationships across our expanded footprint.
we really appreciate you joining us on such a busy day.
we continue to see momentum in our commercial pipelines and the quarter ended with unfunded commitments up 5 % to just over $ 19 billion.
our current plan is to put a total of $ 1 billion of excess cash to work in securities by year - end , and we will continue to reevaluate opportunities to redeploy additional cash as we move forward.
reported nim was down 7 basis points linked quarter with core nim down 8 basis points , driven by a 5 basis point impact tied to higher excess cash.
and now , anthony will run through the financial details.
