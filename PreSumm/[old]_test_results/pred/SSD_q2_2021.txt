we are continuing to acquire higher priced raw materials which we currently anticipate will result in gross margin compression beginning in late fiscal 2021 and into fiscal 2022.
brian will then walk you through our financials and updated full year 2021 business outlook in greater detail.
we experienced strong business momentum in the second quarter , generating net sales of $ 410.3 million which grew 18 % over the prior quarter and 25.8 % over the prior year period.
