since you last heard from us in june , our refreshed board of directors and new management team have settled in.
we are focused on positioning gamestop to scale while obsessing over competitive pricing , expansive selection , and fast shipping.
our actions included continuing to add technology talent across the organization , including individuals with experience in e-commerce , ui , ux , operations , and supply chain.
we appreciate how everyone is stepping up and embracing gamestop 's new operating principles.
we also continued to expand our fulfillment network by adding a 530,000 - square - foot facility in reno , nevada.
net sales increased 25.6 % to $ 1.183 billion , compared to $ 942 million during the same period in 2020.
we achieved this growth while overcoming a roughly 9 % reduction in our global store fleet due to de-densification efforts and ongoing store closures across certain international markets due to the pandemic.
this new facility , which is expected to be operational next year , will position us to further expand selection and expedite shipping.
