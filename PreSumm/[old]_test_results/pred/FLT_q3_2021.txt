obviously , fuel prices are high.
they are not guarantees of future performance , and you should not put undue reliance upon them.
these documents are available on our website and at sec.gov.
so up - front here , i 'd like to run through four subjects : first , i 'll give you my take on our q3 results along with the rest of your outlook ; second , take you into a bit deeper dive into our sales results ; third , give you an update on the three acquisitions that we 've completed year - to - date ; and then lastly , an early preview of 2022 and beyond.
all statements about our recovery , outlook , new products and acquisitions and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information.
and then i mentioned the acquisitions , particularly afex and ale , together contributing probably about $ 0.50 of incremental accretion next year.
so look , taken together , the early 2022 set up is quite good.
we reported q3 revenue of $ 755 million , up 29 % and cash earnings per share of $ 3.52 , up 25 % , so both of those all - time record highs for the company.
these statements reflect the best information we have as of today.
same - store sales strengthened plus 5 % for the quarter , which further adds to the same - store sales rebound we saw in q2.
and again , our global fuel card business inside of that also coming at 93 %.
also , the q3 results annualized , finally above $ 3 billion , so past the $ 3 billion mark in revenue and $ 14 in cash eps.
fx is generally holding , so setting up well there.
if we look just a little farther out into the midterm , we 're kind of also encouraged there for a couple of reasons.
credit losses low again at three basis points , continuing to run below historic levels.
sales finishing at record levels , up over 50 % versus q3 last year and over 30 % against the baseline of q3 ' 19.
