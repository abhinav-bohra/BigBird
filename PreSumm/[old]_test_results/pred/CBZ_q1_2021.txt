while it is still too early to tell if this trend will continue throughout the year , all signs are positive and we remain encouraged based on the general level of optimism we are hearing from our clients and the external signs of economic recovery.
these results provide important momentum for the remainder of the year.
our results demonstrate the fundamental attributes of our business model that i 've emphasized throughout the past year.
these characteristics continue to enable our positive performance during both favorable and less favorable business conditions.
we experienced growth in total revenue , same unit revenue , earnings per share and adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of 2021.
our high client retention rates , our broad geographic footprint , the diversity of our client base in terms of industry and size of business , our strong and consistent cash flow and the substantial amount of variable expenses in our business.
joining us for today 's call are jerry grisko , president and chief executive officer , and ware grove , chief financial officer.
this year , the irs tax filing deadline was extended to may 15 , so a portion of our tax compliance revenue work will extend beyond the traditional mid-april time frame.
within our discretionary and project - based businesses , we continue to experience increasing demand for our litigation support business and are seeing returning interest in our private equity advisory services and our valuation services.
now i will turn to the performance of our two primary practice groups.
as recovery continues , and we return to some level of normalcy , these expenses will begin to return as well , albeit at somewhat reduced levels compared to 2019.
a more detailed description of such factors can be found in the filings with the securities and exchange commission.
many factors could cause future results to differ materially.
so we have plenty of dry powder to address strategic acquisition opportunities as well as continue with share repurchases.
as jerry commented , our investment in additional producers that has occurred in recent years is resulting in stronger pipelines of new business.
we are continuing to invest in bringing additional producers onboard to further enhance growth prospects.
