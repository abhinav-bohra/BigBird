i will now turn to the combined tobacco financials for liggett group and vector tobacco.
we also held investment securities and investment partnership interests with a fair market value of $ 212 million at june 30 , 2021.
the $ 283.8 million increase in revenues was a result of an increase of $ 266.8 million in the real estate segment and $ 17 million in the tobacco segment.
we maintained significant liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of $ 490 million , including cash of $ 155 million at douglas elliman and $ 108 million at liggett.
net income attributed to vector group was $ 93.3 million or $ 0.61 per diluted common share compared to $ 25.8 million or $ 0.16 per diluted common share in the second quarter of 2020.
nick will then summarize the performance of our tobacco business.
as a result , liggett 's year - to - date retail share has declined slightly to 4.13 % from 4.29 % in the corresponding period last year.
as we regularly note , we believe retail shipments are a better indicator of short - term industry trends , because inconsistent wholesaler purchasing patterns typically do not impact retail sales.
we have strong cash reserves , have consistently increased our tobacco market share on profits over the long term and have taken the necessary steps to position our real estate business for future continued success.
the net loss in the 2020 period included pre-tax charges for noncash impairments of $ 58.3 million and pre-tax restructuring charges of $ 3 million.
to date , we remain pleased with the market 's response to montego , which is now sold in nearly 30,000 stores.
montego is competitively priced in the growing deep discount segment , and we are taking a carefully targeted approach with expansion.
however , we do expect this trend to abate throughout the second half of this year as we expand montego markets.
we expect this to reverse in the third quarter as inventories normalize.
it is currently the third largest discount brand in the u.s. and is sold in approximately 85,000 stores nationwide.
despite price increases , eagle 20's retail volume remained strong.
