we grew revenue 15 % operationally , which is once again above the anticipated growth rate for the animal health market , and these results were highlighted by 27 % operational growth in our companion animal portfolio with 1 % operational growth in livestock.

in the study , 92 % of respondents said there was no reason they could ever be convinced to give up their pets and 86 % said they would pay whatever it takes if their pet needed extensive veterinary care.
