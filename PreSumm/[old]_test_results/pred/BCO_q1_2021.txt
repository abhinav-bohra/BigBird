finally , i 'm happy to report that we plan to host an investor day in october when we will provide the details behind our three - year strategic plan and prevent -- and present financial targets.
our strong first quarter results were driven by the ongoing successful integration of g4s acquisitions and our fixed cost reductions , which more than offset the impact of extended pandemic shutdowns , mostly in europe.
on a reported basis , revenue was up 12 % , operating profit grew 43 % , reflecting a margin increase of 200 basis points to 99.2 %.
accordingly , our comments today focus primarily on the non-gaap results.
it 's important to remember that we 're comparing to a year ago quarter that was not materially affected by covid - 19.
in fact , until the last week or so of march we start seeing those impacts.
together g4s and pai are expected to add approximately $ 130 million in adjusted ebitda this year and more next year as revenue growth returns and full run rate synergies are full -- are realized.
i 'll cover pai in more detail in a few minutes.
pai is a great platform on which we can accelerate our 2.3 strategy in north america.
we are increasing our 2021 guidance at mid-point to over $ 700 million of ebitda and earnings per share of approximately $ 5 per share , which includes the positive impact of the pai acquisition as well as a cross-currency swap.
we forecast organic revenue and profit growth to accelerate as we move through this year 2021 , especially in the second - half , supported by continued recovery from the pandemic.
we 're also providing our results on a constant currency basis , which eliminates changes in currency exchange rates from the prior year.
pai provides managed services for approximately 100,000 atms and brings its strong management highly scalable business model and cross-selling opportunities to brink's.
during the quarter , we completed the final phase of the g4s acquisition these businesses which stand 17 countries have been largely integrated well ahead of schedule and we 're on track to exceed our original synergy targets of $ 20 - plus million.
i 'll review guidance more on the next slide.
and importantly , when it comes to in - person transactions , the most used form payment still is cash at about 35 % , ahead of both debit and credit.
