also , as you may recall , as part of our 2021 live events calendar , we announced that summerslam would be taking place for the first time from an nfl stadium , from allegiant stadium in las vegas on a saturday night , august 21.
you should know that all comparisons are versus the year ago quarter unless otherwise described.
we generated solid second quarter financial results as we focused on fan engagement and increasing efficiency in our content production.
we have positive trends in our oibda and the demand for our live event ticket sales as well as our television ratings and digital consumption.
additionally , the matters we will be discussing today may include non-gaap financial measures.
live events that have aired through july 26 have been at closure at full capacity.
without a main event or even a card announced , we have sold over 40,000 of 45,000 tickets and we 'll have a record gate for a non-wrestlemania event.
as always , we 'd like to start with some industry perspective.
actual results may differ materially and undue reliance should not be placed on them.
nice to speak with you all again.
saturday is a new night for us in terms of a pay - per - view event.
television ratings for our initial shows were up significantly.
do you want to go , nick ?<q>in our last earnings call , we discussed how earlier this year the nfl , nhl and major league baseball realized substantial increases in the rights fees for their license programs even with lower linear television ratings.
first - time we played before large crowd on july 16 , it was up 42 % increase in 18 to 49 demo , which was extraordinary , raw of 15 % as well.
looking ahead , we believe we can take advantage of the evolving business environment as we always have crowd engagement developing business and will drive growth.
