this release is available on the company 's website at dhigroupinc.com.
as such when the pandemic began to unfold in mid-march , we at dhi jumped into action to aid our communities by launching covid - 19 resource centers on each of our brand sites to assist both clients and candidates alike with information relevant to their needs in these challenging times.
our foremost concern at dhi is to ensure the health and safety of our dhi community.
these sites provide information on virtual career fairs , open remote job posts , real - time hiring trends , industry insights , articles , and hiring resources.
we also launched a campaign to provide free recruitment services to u.s. hospitals to help them find technologists in fields like electronic medical records , healthcare administration and computer system processing.
also , all of our employees have been working from home using the best possible remote communication and collaboration tools and our team members , including sales and support , marketing and product development continue to be highly effective.
as always , we appreciate your interest in dhi.
a recent report released by microsoft in july predicts that the worldwide digital jobs will grow from 41 million in 2020 to 190 million in 2025.
these efforts will , of course , require technologists.
it 's clear that our collective future will be more online and businesses will accelerate their efforts to digitize.
of the 149 million new digital jobs created , 98 million are forecast to be in software development.
i 'll dive more into these product releases later in the call , but first let me provide a quick update on the current market environment for tech jobs.
many firms serving highly impacted industries have paused or reduced their hiring plans and we believe that our bookings are highly correlated to the state of geographical restrictions and reopenings , which certainly remain in flux.
the pandemic is certainly challenging the way we all live and work.
we saw job postings drop in the early part of the quarter but come back to the trailing 12 - month average levels in june and july as companies became more confident in their hiring strategies.
lastly , during today 's call , management will be referring to specific financial measures , which include adjusted ebitda , adjusted ebitda margin and net debt , which are not prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap.
