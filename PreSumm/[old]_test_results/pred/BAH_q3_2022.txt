i am extremely proud of our workforce for achieving complete compliance with our covid vaccination requirement.
today , lloyd and i will share our third quarter results in the context of our fiscal year 2022 guidance and our multi- year investment thesis.
we will also describe the underlying dynamics of our business and the progress we are making on our volt strategy.
we are now on slide 4.
as a reminder , volt stands for velocity , leadership , and technology.
it is a strategic program booz allen has launched to capitalize on our first mover advantage in helping the federal government transform core missions through the use of new technologies.
gross revenue growth in the 7 % to 10 % range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $ 4.10 to $ 4.30.
over the next few years , we look to grow faster by building scaled positions in critical areas such as national cyber and digital battlespace.
we expect this increase to be accomplished through 5 % to 8 % annual organic revenue growth , adjusted ebitda margins in the mid-10s , and $ 3.5 billion to $ 4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions.
we are in the early stages of this journey , but are already making strides and seeing strong progress.
that 's approximately a 50 % increase.
as part of volt , we have set new multi- year financial goals that deliver both strong profit growth and continued investment in our business.
i 'm laura adams , chief accounting officer and interim head of investor relations.
revenue declined by 2.2 % year over year and has been trending down quarter over quarter.
