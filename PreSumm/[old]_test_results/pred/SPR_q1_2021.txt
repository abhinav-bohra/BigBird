on the a350 , schedule changes this year and next year contributed to the forward loss of $ 29 million that we announced this quarter.
additionally , boeing has secured several new orders from airlines , including large orders from southwest , alaska air and ryanair , who will take delivery of their first newly certified 737 max 8200 aircraft in the near future.
the covid - 19 pandemic has had a significant global impact.
the aviation industry saw more than 19,000 aircraft grounded and air traffic down more than 95 % at the worst point last april.
today the 737 max is certified in the u.s. , u.k. , europe and many other parts of the world.
we continue to see encouraging news on the return to commercial air travel with domestic routes , primarily flown by narrow - body aircraft leading the way.
in addition , our a320 production rate was lower in the first quarter of this year compared to last year.
international air traffic demand still remains at relatively low levels versus pre-pandemic times and is expected to take longer to recover.
we have observed a similar domestic recovery in china.
now , let 's move to our first quarter 2021 results.
consequently , we have experienced and believe there will continue to be pressure on our wide - body programs.
we have regular conversations with boeing on the current environment and we 'll work closely with them to make any necessary rate adjustments as the year progresses.
with the current outlook , we should be at our targeted number of a permanent buffer to cushion the production system toward the second half of 2022.
this plan allows for us to burn down the boeing inventory of 737 max shipsets stored in wichita and tulsa.
