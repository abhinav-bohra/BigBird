in addition to sephora and active , let me share some of our other key initiatives , starting with men's.
during today 's call , i want to leave you with three things.
we 've proven that kohl 's is an incredibly strong and resilient company and has a very bright future.
first , we have fundamentally restructured our business to be more profitable.
i am proud of how our team has remained agile and focused in a challenging environment during the past couple of years.
in 2021 , we delivered an all - time record adjusted earnings per share of $ 7.33 , eclipsing our previous high of $ 5.60 in 2018.
we look to build on this momentum in 2022 by dedicating more space and expanding each of these brands.
let me now turn to women's , which is an important business for kohl's.
and our operating margin of 8.6 % exceeded our goal of 7 % to 8 % two years ahead of plan.
in addition , we are focused on running our business the right way.
second , our strategy is building momentum.
our men's business has continued to be a strong performer and benefit from our recent brand introductions of tommy hilfiger , calvin klein , and hurley.
the board has approved a 100 % increase in our dividend , which equates to an annual dividend of $ 2 per share.
we have a long - standing commitment to esg stewardship , including a strong environmental platform , diversity and inclusion strategy and focus on giving back to communities.
sephora is driving impressive results , which gives us a lot of confidence as we expand the partnership to more than half of our store base this year.
we are also pleased with the ongoing strength in our active business , which grew more than 40 % relative to last year.
