during the last two months , fsp has witnessed a significant increase in property tours , submitted rfps and counter proposals.
as a reminder , all of our debt is unsecured and we have no debt maturities until november 30 , ' 21 when $ 155 million of term loans will become due.
as the vaccinations against covid - 19 continue to steadily rise in the u.s. , so too , are we seeing a slow but steady increase in existing office tenants personnel returning to work at our properties and corporate decision makers more actively considering there are future locational office space needs.
at quarter end , between cash on hand and availability on our line , we had a total liquidity of about $ 577 million.
trying to determine the ultimate strength , timing and longevity of the post - pandemic u.s. and global economic reopening is a significant challenge for companies trying to make intelligent new leasing decisions today.
we also believe that along with meaningful dividends that may be distributed during 2021 , the remaining lower leverage property portfolio moving into a post -covid 2022 , has a significant value - add proposition associated with it , that if achieved , could meaningfully enhance shareholder nav values further from 2021 levels.
and while losing some of the current positive ffo spread that is generated between rental constance and debt constance from the property disposition debt pay down plan , we believe shareholders should maintain our nav per share with less risk to their nav from lower debt levels capitalizing the remaining property portfolio , while the company gains more overall flexibility in it 's ongoing real estate investing activities.
as 2021 progresses , assuming continued successful vaccination efforts against the virus , fsp is optimistic that one of its two major objectives for 2021 , that is leasing progress , will achieve positive results.
at this time , due primarily to the uncertainty surrounding the timing and the amount of proceeds from property dispositions , we are continuing suspension of net income and ffo guidance.
our other primary objective for 2021 is debt reduction.
we reported funds from operations or ffo of $ 18 million or $ 0.17 per share for the first quarter of 2021.
i 'm going to give a very brief overview of our first quarter results and afterward i 'll pass the call to george for his comments.
we are reaffirming our previously announced 2021 disposition guidance to be in the range of $ 350 million to $ 450 million in aggregate gross proceeds.
fsp remains committed to its sunbelt and mountain west office focus that emphasizes markets and properties with compelling long - term population and employment growth potential.
we continue to look forward 2021 with anticipation and optimism.
however , we do anticipate that if we are successful with our efforts under way , that fsp would satisfy our disposition guidance for 2021.
