elevated demand for hygiene and health products , packaging , paper tissues and towels will likely continue into 2021 as consumers continue to spend more time in their homes.
last evening , we reported strong fourth quarter results with organic revenue up 5 % , ebitda up 9 % and earnings per share up 21 %.
these results exceeded our expectations and each of our segments delivered positive organic growth and strong margin performance in the quarter.
this performance is especially strong given its comparison against a pre-covid environment and is a result of the work we 've done to gain market share and reduce our cost structure.
many of these risks and uncertainties are and will be exacerbated by the covid - 19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result.
during today 's call , and in the months ahead , we will explain and demonstrate why you should continue to expect differentiated performance from h.b. fuller.
throughout the year , our portfolio of innovative adhesive solutions in hygiene , health and packaging has enabled h.b. fuller to continuously meet high levels of demand for essential consumer products.
we believe that discussion of these measures is useful to investors to assist the understanding of our operating performance and the comparability of results with other companies.
we outperformed the market in meeting these needs.
our strong cash flow performance continued in the fourth quarter.
our culture of collaboration , our broad adhesive technology portfolio , our applications expertise and our global operational agility proved to be differentiators in this current environment.
during this time , we also worked with customers in other markets to accelerate our product qualification processes for electronics and durable goods.
our work in 2019 , in advance of the pandemic , to reorganize into three gbus , instead of five , has enabled us to grow faster while reducing costs.
first , a reminder that our comments today will include references to non-gaap financial measures and references to organic revenue , which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures.
our speakers are jim owens , h.b. fuller president and chief executive officer ; and john corkrean , executive vice president and chief financial officer.
the spikes in demand that we saw in the second quarter , however , are unlikely to repeat.
