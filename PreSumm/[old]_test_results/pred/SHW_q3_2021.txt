net operating cash grew to $ 2.1 billion , or 13.5 % of sales in the first nine months of 2021.
let me briefly summarize the quarterly numbers.
starting with the top line.
third quarter 2021 consolidated sales increased 0.5 % to $ 5.15 billion.
we 're confident in the demand outlook and even more confident in our strategy , our people and our position in the market.
raw material availability negatively impacted sales by an estimated high single - digit percentage , with about 75 % of the impact in the americas group.
the remaining impact was largely in the consumer brands group with an immaterial impact to performance coatings group.
we will continue to evaluate additional pricing actions as needed.
while these conditions challenged our quarterly results , we continued to strengthen our customer relationships and take actions that strongly position us for the long term.
the third quarters of 2021 and 2020 both included acquisition - related depreciation and amortization expense of $ 0.21 per share.
consolidated gross margin decreased 630 basis points to 41.6 % , driven by lower sales volume , raw material cost inflation outpacing our price increases near term and supply chain inefficiencies.
we realized a mid-single - digit increase in price in the third quarter resulting from our february one and august one price increases and our mid-september surcharge.
diluted net income per share in the quarter decreased to $ 1.88 per share from $ 2.55 per share a year ago.
we 've opened 50 net new stores year - to - date.
from a product perspective , interior paint sales performed better than exterior sales , with interior being the larger part of the mix.
while sales are down in all regions , sales were less impacted in north america , our largest region , compared to europe and asia , where covid restrictions were more impactful.
