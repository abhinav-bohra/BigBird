to put that in perspective , total problem energy loans peaked at nearly $ 600 million early in 2016.
but excluding ppp loans first quarter average loans of $ 14.9 billion represented a decline of just over 1 % compared to the first quarter of 2020.
obviously , macroeconomic factors over the past year have impacted our deposit growth but it's also been our experience over our history that our frost that we 're safe haven for customers and times of uncertainty.
economic impacts of the pandemic continue to affect loan demand.
to date , we 've taken in about 12,400 new loan applications in the second round of ppp with over $ 1.3 billion funded.
combined with our total from the first round last year , we funded more than 31,000 loans or $ 4.6 billion , just amazing.
and a year ago , nonperformers stood at $ 67.5 million.
our team was ready to respond when sba reopened the application process in january.
in general , problem assets are declining in number and new problems have dropped significantly and are at pre-pandemic levels.
in a very challenging economic environment , our team not only continued to execute on our strategies , but also achieved some extraordinary accomplishments that i 'll discuss in detail as we go through the call.
this will put us on a path to triple our number of locations in that dynamic market over that time.
i 'm extremely proud of what our organization has been able to do in houston , and i believe you should be , too.
and you can see that its profitability will be driven by small and midsized businesses.
we 've built a platform that will add to shareholder value for years to come.
and that 's why i 'm happy to share that we will be taking the lessons and skills we 've learned in the houston market to a very similar opportunity we have before us in dallas early next year with 25 new locations over a 30 - month period.
it 's just what we do.
