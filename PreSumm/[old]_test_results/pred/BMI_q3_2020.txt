not surprisingly , and as we anticipated , most flow instrumentation end markets remain challenged.
bob will walk you through the details of the quarter and after that , i 'll come back and talk further about the market outlook and what we 're hearing from customers in the current environment.
as you can see on slide 4 , total sales for the third quarter were $ 113.6 million compared to $ 108.6 million in the same period last year , an increase of 5 %.
we improved manufacturing output and experienced more consistent order demand after the trough in activity last quarter stemming from the rapid onset of widespread pandemic lockdowns.
as a matter of fact , we delivered a record quarter in terms of earnings per share and tied the record for quarterly sales.
in municipal water , overall sales increased 11 % , a roughly equal combination of improved order rates and recovery of the backlog built in q2 , which as we noted last quarter was the result of lockdown induced manufacturing disruptions which limited our output.
while copper prices , which serve as a proxy for brass have been increasing.
positive revenue mix trends continued with further adoption of smart metering solutions including orion cellular radios and beacon software - as - a - service revenue along with ultrasonic meter penetration.
finally , a reminder that prior year 's results included a non-recurring discrete warranty provision associated with the products sold only outside north america.
as noted and as anticipated , flow instrumentation sales declined 18 % year - over - year , reflective of the broadly challenged markets and application served globally.
margins benefited from higher sales volumes and positive sales mix.
while the majority of our production employees continue to work from home , we have many dedicated employees at our manufacturing sites and with customers all adhering to the many layered health and safety protocols.
i hope you are all doing well and staying safe.
