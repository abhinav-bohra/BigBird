let 's get started on slide three.

i 'm going to start off with a quick look back at 2021 and update you on a few of our long - term strategic priorities.

and we are capitalizing on strong secular trends for healthy buildings , decarbonization and smart connected equipment and buildings.
additionally , all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis.
despite the challenging external environment , our end market demand remains strong.
