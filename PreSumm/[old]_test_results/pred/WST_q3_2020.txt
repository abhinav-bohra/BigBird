on slide 12 , we have listed some key cash flow metrics.
before we dive into our q3 results and raised 2020 guidance , i like to make clear the importance of our mission at west and the values that formed the pillars in which we operate.
in today 's uncertain environment and what seems like a new set of challenges each day , we remain focused on two key priorities : keeping our team members safe and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we currently serve.
moving to slide 5 , west is uniquely positioned to satisfy increasing market demand by leveraging our global operation of scale and our resources.
during today 's call , management will make reference to non-gaap financial measures , including organic sales growth , adjusted operating profit , adjusted operating profit margin , and adjusted diluted eps.
our team recognized at the outset of the pandemic that need to increase production capacity.
we were already supporting the growth trajectory of our base business and the future demand for our products required for covid - 19 vaccines and therapeutics meant that we needed to act quickly and very decisively.
while we 're early in our digital journey , i would like to share a few examples of the recent success , starting with our manufacturing automation strategy.
the company 's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company.
we have been investing in digital technology and automation with two objectives in mind , bringing new connected products to market , as well as enhancing the productivity of our operations at every level of the organization.
we made great strides over the past year and helping us to achieve continuous improvements and quality , safety , service and cost.
customers can come to west for a scientific and technical expertise , and this differentiates us in the market.
and now turning to slide 6 , the disruption caused by the pandemic has impacted the way all of us conduct business in our daily lives.
as of this week , that capacity is operational and we have additional equipment being installed at a second hvp site with more installations planned in the coming months at other global sites.
working capital of $ 790.6 million at september 30 , 2020 was $ 73.5 million higher than at december 31 , 2019 , primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales activity and inventory , mainly as a result of increasing safety stock.
the strength of our performance this past quarter demonstrates the forward momentum we have built over time with our market led strategy and also one west team approach to satisfy market demand.
