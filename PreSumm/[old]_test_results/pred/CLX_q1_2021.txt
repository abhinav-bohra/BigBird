we 're spending for our u.s. retail business coming in at 11 % of sales.
turning to today 's discussion of our results.
i 'll start by covering our usual top line commentary , with highlights in each of our segments.
kevin will then address our total company results , as well as our fy ' 21 outlook.
in addition , we may refer to certain non-gaap financial measures.
finally , linda will offer her perspective and we 'll close with q&a.
for the total company , q1 sales increased 27 % , reflecting about a point of benefit from the acquisition of majority interest in our joint venture in the kingdom of saudi arabia , and about a point of headwinds from unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
on the innovation front , our bleach complexion effort is now complete.
we 've been investing behind this momentum to convert new users to loyal consumers , and we 've been seeing very strong return on our investment.
these statements are based on management 's current expectation , but may differ from actual results or outcomes.
this quarter 's 27 % organic sales growth is supported by double digit sales growth in eight of our 10 businesses.
despite those constraints , our clorox brand continues to see increases in both household penetration and repeat rates.
the clorox fabric sanitizer platform and clorox disinfecting wet mopping cloth , both continue to show strong growth.
i 'll now go through our results by segment.
while we continue to make progress expanding supply , we 're still not at a point where we can fully meet ongoing elevated demand.
our cleaning business had another quarter of double digit growth behind continued strong demand , for our disinfecting products.
