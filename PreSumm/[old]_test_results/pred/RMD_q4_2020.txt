and while we are still working on current and future contracts with hospitals , as well as city and national health authorities for these ventilators , the volumes will be significantly lower in the september quarter for these ventilators.
during this global pandemic , caused by a novel coronavirus and covid - 19 , the disease state it leads to , i hope that you , your family and your friends remain safe and healthy during these times.
since that time , seven months ago , our global team has provided vital support globally to combat this coronavirus , not just across china , but across asia , then across europe , across north america.
however , our actual results may differ.
and now we are just starting to -- preparing to -- actually , we 're in the midst of continuing that battle in latin america in , sub -sahara and africa and parts of the middle east and asia that still have that , what we call , the peak impact ahead of them in terms of hospitalizations and ventilator needs.
we believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions.
during q4 , during this june quarter , we produced around 100,000 invasive and noninvasive ventilators , including bilevel positive pressure ventilators.
that brings our cumulative total to over 150,000 ventilators that we produced since the beginning of calendar year 2020.
through all that analysis , i 'm happy to say that we 're confident in our resmed ability to execute across the full range of potential scenarios for all of our customers and for all of our global businesses.
for our flagship ventilator , which is the astral life support ventilator , we reached a peak of over five times our weekly production rate during the period.
other members of management will be available during the q&a portion of the call during today 's call , we will discuss some non-gaap measures.
so we 've delivered on our promise to triple our production.
and in fact , if you take the period from january 1 to june 30 , for 2020 , that is a 3.5 times increase over the period for 2019 , so 3.5 times.
joining me on the call today to discuss our quarterly results are ceo mick farrell and cfo brett sandercock.
the tailwinds for ventilation in the march quarter and the june quarter from both the ventilator devices and the ventilation mask systems are starting to recede.
we have grown connectivity to our digital health ecosystem by over 26 % this fiscal year , and we now have over 12 million 100 % cloud - connectable medical devices in the market.
