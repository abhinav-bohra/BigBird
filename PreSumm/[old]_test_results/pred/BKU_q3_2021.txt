we have to take a pause.
i 'm happy to report three months into it now , delta seems fairly in the rearview mirror.
i think they have come down to even lower than they were three months back.
so we 're happy about that.
and there was a lot of concern as to whether that will impact the economy and to what extent.
but what we were most happy about is also that does not actually have the same kind of impact that previous surges have had on the economy.
last year , i think we were at about 26 basis points.
so good news on the net charge - offs front as well.
i think the economy is learning to deliver these surges at when they happen.
we will start that but not even for board meetings , we 've not had in - person board meeting since the start of the pandemic.
florida seemed to be in -- caught up in it more than probably any other state.
our expectation is that by january -- first week of january , we will be in the new normal , and typically now that slowly started bringing people back.
hopefully , there wo n't be anymore , but at least over the last three months , we did not see a significant impact to the local economy here or in other parts of the country where we do business.
yesterday , the board met telephonically and decided it was time to -- to start meeting in person.
capital , book value has grown to $ 34.39 , tangible is at $ 33.53.
but it 's good to see delta behind us obviously with a fair amount of pain that we wanted to of the healthcare side.
