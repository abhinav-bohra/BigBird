he is under great care , but we expect this will be a long recovery process for him.
improved visibility is helping us size our expected demand more effectively , and as a result , we can project our inventory needs more accurately , which is key to optimizing future sales , margins and profitability.
i 'm very proud that our teams around the world continue to rise to the challenge imposed by this crisis in an extraordinary way.
almost across the board , we have seen a significant reduction in customer traffic from the comparable prior - year period , partially offset by the improved conversion rates.
and improved visibility gave our board the confidence to reinstate our quarterly dividend.
among those things that changed , the most important one is visibility , which has improved meaningfully.
we continue to believe that our brand dna and our obsession for inclusivity , sustainability and celebrating customer diversity represent a significant strength in today 's environment.
