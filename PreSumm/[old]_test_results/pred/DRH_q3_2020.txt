switching gears , let 's look at each of our segments of demand in the quarter.
second , we reduced our monthly burn rate , significantly beating our prior expectations.
third , we reopened five additional hotels.
and fourth , we struck a sweeping deal with marriott that not only increased the nav of our portfolio by $ 50 million but distinguishes diamondrock 's portfolio as the least encumbered by long - term management agreements among all full service public lodging reits.
first , we increased our total liquidity and decreased our total debt through a successful preferred equity offering.
now , while we have made good progress and remain optimistic about the future of travel , the pandemic we are living through has obviously created tremendous dislocation in near - term demand.
in the third quarter , there were some encouraging early signs of a recovery in travel demand.
we currently have more than enough liquidity to carry the company until such time as we are cash flow positive once again.
i 'll highlight just four.
that experience is why diamondrock has always embraced a low - leverage and conservative balance sheet strategy.
the relative bright spot has been in leisure travel , which of course is elective travel.
personally , this is my fourth downturn , and we know how to manage through these environments.
guests have been checking into the drive - to resorts diamondrock is known for.
so , we believe there is a chance for a meaningful snap back on the other side of the healthcare solution.
interestingly , we are seeing signs of pent - up demand.
leisure is unquestionably the strongest performing segment in the portfolio.
