the each are challenging , went in them.
we will then open the lines for q&a.
these documents can be found on our website or at www.
i also want to point out that during today 's call , we will discuss some non-gaap financial measures , which we believe are useful in evaluating our performance.
jeff will start with the financial overview of the period.
as jim and i have noted on our update calls in march and june , due to covid - 19 the covid - 19 pandemic , we 've reduced our facility staffing to approximately 10 % in late march and after implementing new work practices , enhanced cleaning and safety procedures and educating all of our employees on these changes , we gradually began to increase our staffing.
customer behavior is less predictable this time.
i imagine that is because no one has experienced this type of demand disruption or turmoil in the past.
by the end of may , we were back at near - normal on - site staffing and have continued at that level over the past two months.
as i noted , we ran at half capacity in batavia.
in the first quarter , we had a loss of $ 1.8 million or $ 0.18 per share.
i want to compliment alan smith and his team for ensuring a safer production environment in this difficult time as well as our human resources team for their continued focus on improving safety in our workplace.
however , this current downturn feels rather different.
we will be reporting the level of our navy sales on a quarterly basis going forward , which for this year , we expect to be approximately 25 % to 30 % of total sales.
a couple of examples can illustrate well what we face.
on a positive note , our defense or navy sales were 21 % of this total or $ 3.5 million.
