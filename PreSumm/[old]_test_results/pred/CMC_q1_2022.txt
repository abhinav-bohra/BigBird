currently , we expect to close on the acquisition during the fiscal third quarter.
i 'm pleased to report that cmc 's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings were the best in our company 's 106 - year history.
earnings from continuing operations were 232.9 million or $ 1.90 per diluted share on net sales of 2 billion.
after which , we will open the call to questions.
cmc generated core ebitda of 326.8 million , an increase of 109 % from the year - ago period and an improvement of 28 % from the prior quarter.
this was the third consecutive quarter in which our company has reported record bottom - line earnings , core ebitda , and segment - level ebitda.
paul lawrence will then cover the quarter 's financial information in more detail , and i will conclude with a discussion of the current market environment and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022.
while we are proud of the performance to date , let me take a moment to explain why i believe cmc 's best days are still ahead of us.
we are certainly proud of cmc 's record financial results delivered by strong execution of our strategic initiatives , as well as solid market fundamentals.
our team members continue to tightly manage controllable costs , reflecting changes to costs on a per-unit basis , better than most industry and macro benchmarks we track.
i 'll start with sustainability.
strong market conditions and strong margins across several product lines certainly contributed to these exceptional results.
to back up this statement , cmc achieved an annualized return on invested capital of 25.1 % during the first quarter and an annualized return on equity of 35.6 %.
i will begin today 's call with a few highlights from the quarter and commentary on cmc 's strategic growth projects.
this significant improvement over the past six years underscores the enhanced earnings power of cmc today , and it is our objective to produce better returns with higher highs and lower lows through the economic cycle.
hopefully , each of you had a wonderful holiday season.
