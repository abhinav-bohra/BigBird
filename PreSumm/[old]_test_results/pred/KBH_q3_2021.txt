this compares to starts in the year - ago quarter of about 3,400.
before i get into the highlights for the quarter and there are many , i want to address our shortfall in deliveries and revenues.
disruptions to our supply chain intensified as the quarter progressed and along with municipal delays resulted in our build times extending by about two weeks sequentially.
this pushed many deliveries into our fourth quarter and will similarly delayed some fourth quarter deliveries into our 2022 first quarter.
these results will help drive our returns focused growth as we continue to expand our scale , while generating a higher return on equity.
our performance in the third quarter reflected significant year - over - year increases across the majority of our key metrics as we produced solid results in housing market , experiencing great demand , while also facing industrywide challenges in getting homes completed and delivered.
we produced total revenues of $ 1.47 billion , up nearly 50 % as compared to the prior year period and diluted earnings per share of $ 1.60.
in addition to these investments , we returned a significant amount of cash to stockholders through both our regular quarterly cash dividend and the repurchase of $ 188 million of our stock.
we expanded our lot position to almost 81,000 lots owned or controlled , with our inventory continuing to rotate into a higher quality portfolio of communities.
this was accomplished even with the leverage we lost from the delayed deliveries.
and with that , here 's jeff mezger.
our related gross margin of 22 % was a particular highlight and demonstrates that we are effectively managing pace , price and starts to optimize each asset.
on the call are jeff mezger , chairman , president and chief executive officer ; matt mandino and rob mcgibney , executive vice presidents and co-chief operating officers ; jeff kaminski executive vice president and chief financial officer ; bill hollinger , senior vice president and chief accounting officer ; and thad johnson , senior vice president and treasurer.
kb home received a record 25 energy star market leader awards from the epa , further demonstrating our leadership position as the most energy efficient national homebuilder.
switching gears for a moment.
the operating environment within our industry has become more complex over the past 18 months , given the supply chain issues and municipal delays that i mentioned earlier and their impact on build times.
