so moving to first quarter results , organic sales grew 4 % , volume contributed two points of sales growth , pricing and mix each added one point.
growth was broad - based across business units with nine out of 10 product categories growing organic sales.
personal health care up double - digits ; fabric care grew high - singles ; baby care , feminine care and grooming up mid-singles ; home care , oral care , hair care and skin and personal care organic sales each up low - single - digits.
earnings growth should improve sequentially through the balance of the fiscal year as price increases go into effect and productivity programs ramp up.
family care declined mid-singles comping very strong growth in the base period.
the degree and timing of these moves are very specific to the category , brand and sometimes the product form within a brand.
this is not a one - size - fits - all approach.
our superiority strategy continues to drive strong market growth and in turn share growth for p&g.
we experienced the full impact of rising commodity and transportation costs this quarter , but healthy top - line growth and strong cost savings kept earnings per share growth nearly in line with the prior year.
36 of our top 50 category country combinations held or grew share for the quarter.
on a two year stack basis , u.s. organic sales are up 20 %.
in the last few weeks , we 've also announced to retailers in the u.s. that we will increase prices on segments of our grooming , skin care and oral care businesses.
global aggregate market share increased 50 basis points.
we 're also taking pricing in many markets outside the u.s. to offset commodity , freight and foreign exchange impacts.
freight costs have also continued to increase.
