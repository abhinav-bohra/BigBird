we continued to expect to invest over $ 1 billion in capital expenditures and research and development , highlighting our commitment to driving innovation and growth in the future.
at this time , all participants are in a listen - only mode.
as a reminder , we ask that participants ask no more than two questions.
before we discuss our first quarter business results , i 'd like to take a moment to discuss the volatile industry dynamics and our decisive response plan.
listeners are directed to the supplemental information package posted on the investor relations section of our website for the reconciliation of non-gaap items to the most directly comparable gaap measures.
in the first quarter , global semiconductors and resin shortages amplified existing supply constraints and thus impacted our product availability.
further , we all faced the rapidly rising inflationary pressures primarily in steel and resins.
we are highly confident in our ability to manage through the supply constraint and cost inflationary environment.
additionally , we delivered record ongoing ebit margin of 12.4 % , the third consecutive quarter of double - digit margins.
we also think the adjusted measures will provide you a better baseline for analyzing trends in our ongoing business operations.
we delivered strong revenue growth of 24 % , driven by sustained consumer demand and previously announced cost - based pricing actions.
and let me just recap what you heard over the past few minutes.
i firmly believe that we have the right actions in place to protect our operating margins , which is once again demonstrated in our record q1 results.
these actions propelled our q1 results and give us high confidence to significantly increase our full year ongoing earnings per share guidance by 18 % to a range of $ 22.50 to $ 23.50.
lastly , we have delivered on our long - term gross debt leverage goal of 2 times.
our actual results could differ materially from these statements due to many factors discussed in our latest 10 - k and other periodic reports.
