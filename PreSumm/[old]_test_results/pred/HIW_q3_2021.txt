we will partner with the city of franklin to reimagine ovation as one of the premier mixed - use addresses in the country and anticipate working with high - quality retail , multi-family and hotel developers to realize the tremendous potential of this live - work - play property , while retaining full control of the development -- office development sites.
while the progression of the pandemic and the resulting impact on office utilization remain difficult to predict , customers and prospects fortunately continue to sign leases and our parking revenues continue to recover nicely.
as i mentioned on our last call , leasing activity has been healthy , particularly for new deals.
we now do not expect usage to meaningfully increase until the new year.
in total , we signed 96 leases during the quarter , including 46 new deals , consistent with our long - term average.
given the emergence of the delta variant , utilization across our portfolio did not increase as much in the third quarter as we anticipated , leveling off around 40 %.
as we noted last quarter , we continue to believe net effective rents have stabilized.
we do n't track apples - to - apples net effective rent spreads.
as you may have seen from local media reports , two customers in our top 20 announced this quarter plans to move out upon exploration and relocate to new developments.
in addition to healthy volume , rents on signed leases increased 19.3 % on a gaap basis and 4.3 % on a cash basis.
the release and supplemental include a reconciliation of these non-gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures.
leasing capex increased , but this was offset by higher face rents and longer terms.
in both cases , we have at least three years of lease term remaining , in - place rents are substantially below market and these buildings are among the best in their bbds.
as the war for talent accelerates , we are strong believers that well - located office space in highly amenitized best business districts , will become a competitive recruiting advantage for employers.
developing , operating and owning bbd - located and talent - centric workplaces has proved our portfolio's resiliency in the face of unprecedented times , provides a strong foundation for future growth.
as you know , we plan to bring our balance sheet back to pre-acquisition levels by accelerating the sale of $ 500 million to $ 600 million of noncore assets by mid-2022.
