our results were better than expected due to a combination of continued end - market strength and excellent operational execution by the entire jabil team , along with lower tax and interest expense.
with that , i 'd now like to shift our focus to our strong quarter and outstanding results.
first off , the team delivered $ 400 million of core operating income on roughly $ 8.6 billion in revenue , resulting in a core operating margin of 4.7 %.
these results were primarily driven by broad - based strength in several key end markets , including healthcare , industrial and semi cap , and of course , mobility , as customary for our first fiscal quarter.
an extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on form 10 - k for the fiscal year ended august 31 , 2021 and other filings.
and finally , it 's worth noting that our team was able to accomplish all of this in spite of the chaotic global supply chain environment.
as adam just highlighted , q1 was an exceptional quarter.
in a few moments , both mike and mark will provide more details on the quarter , while also addressing our improved outlook for the year.
as we move ahead , we anticipate continued supply chain challenges , which have been incorporated in our guidance similar to previous quarters.
but before i hand it over , i 'll pass along some thoughts from jabil 's procurement and supply chain team , as you may find it helpful when modeling our year.
so far , we have been extremely successful.
in short , demand continues to outstrip supply , particularly as it relates to semiconductors , an issue that has persisted since 2019.
that said , jabil continues to leverage best - in - class tools and relationships to maximize our allocation and keep the factories in production to the best of our ability.
at the conclusion of today 's call , the entire call will be posted for audio playback on our website.
we 've also increased revenue to $ 31.8 billion , up from our initial guide of $ 31.5 billion.
