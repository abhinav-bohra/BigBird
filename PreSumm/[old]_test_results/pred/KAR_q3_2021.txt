also , california has almost as many new vehicle registrations as the next two largest markets , which are texas and florida , combined.
i 'll also provide updates on the continued growth in our dealer - to - dealer business with a focus on our digital dealer - to - dealer businesses , backlotcars and traderev.
i 'll provide an update on our acquisition of carwave and the solid performance of our finance business , afc.
and i 'll close out with some updates relating to our cost structure.
so , i 'd like to start with the third quarter.
we also see an opportunity to continue to move up market and sell a larger number of higher value vehicles.
this in turn will help drive further increases in revenue per unit sold and stronger margins.
within the adesa segment , we facilitated the sale of 586,000 vehicles , representing over $ 9 billion in gross auction proceeds.
let me also mention that throughout this conference call , we will be referencing both gaap and non-gaap financial measures.
cash generated from operations for the quarter was $ 57 million.
these industrywide volume challenges are tied to the disruption of new vehicle production , and i spoke to these dynamics in detail at our analyst day event back in september.
now , these volumes are down 33 % versus q3 of last year.
we generated $ 96.6 million in adjusted ebitda.
however , i will say that the situation remains largely as i described at that time.
we generated a total gross profit of $ 222 million , representing 50.1 % of revenue , excluding purchased vehicles.
it 's in our diligence that carwave platform delivers excellent performance for the sellers and buyers.
