overall , our cost of raw materials have increased an additional 10 % since our last call in may when our original expectation was that it will begin to stabilize in june.
despite the challenging conditions caused by covid as well as the current year global supply chain pressures that have impacted raw material availability.
our results for the second quarter were stronger than we expected.
all of our plants around the world are operating and we are continuing to meet our customers ' needs.
this was primarily being driven by continued strong sales.
while sales volumes were down 3 % from the first quarter , the first quarter was unusually strong as we believe some of our customers were replenishing their inventories.
so we continue to feel good about our ability to deliver on our historical performance of consistently growing 2 % to 4 % points above the market due to our share gains.
we are also seeing higher selling prices , which we estimate increased an overall 6 % in the quarter , with increases in all 4 segments.
a great deal has changed over the past year with the covid pandemic for us.
we have slides for our conference call , you can find them in the investor relations section of our website at www.
looking at our second quarter performance , we had another strong quarter.
so i can't help but reemphasize my pride for our quaker houghton team and what we have and will be able to accomplish for our customers and investors both now and going forward.
additional costs associated with our recent acquisitions , and higher sg&a due to the impact of foreign exchange , which were partially offset by additional savings from integration cost synergies.
i do now see the 3rd quarter as our lowest quarter of the year , both in terms of gross margin and profitability.
as i begin to discuss our quarterly performance , i 'll point you to slide 6 , 7 and 8 in our call charts , which provide a further look into our financials.
so overall , we 're very pleased with the quarter given the raw material issues we are facing as we achieved our second highest quarterly adjusted ebitda ever.
