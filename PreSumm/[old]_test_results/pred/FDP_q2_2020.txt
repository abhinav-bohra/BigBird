in our pineapple product line , net sales were $ 114 million compared with $ 126 million in the prior - year period , primarily due to lower selling prices and sales volume in north america and europe.
the message we want to deliver today is one of resiliency.
fresh del monte produce is driven by a team that understands there will always be challenges somewhere in the world and we operate under a model and philosophy in line with that understanding.
even with the new challenge brought on by the covid - 19 pandemic , our vertical integration and portfolio diversification strength helped to maintain our business continuity in the second quarter of 2020.
with that , i am pleased to turn today 's call over to mohammad.
you may also visit the company 's website at freshdelmonte.com for a copy of today 's release , as well as to register for future distribution.
this will offer us the unique advantage of processing fresh - cut fruit and fresh - cut vegetables in one facility in the salinas valley.
despite these challenges , our global firms , plants and distribution centers remained operational with minimal disruptions in our shipping and logistic operations.
another highlight of our transformation is consolidating two facilities in phoenix , arizona , which we believe will offer significant savings.
we also strengthened our liquidity position and we were able to reduce our debt despite the market disruption.
joining me in today 's discussion are mohammad abu- ghazaleh , chairman and chief executive officer ; and eduardo bezerra , senior vice president and chief financial officer.
we capitalized on our new avocado processing facility in mexico , ramping up production four months sooner than expected.
during the quarter as the pandemic took hold , we remained focused on our business transformation plan for 2020 and beyond to respond to the economic environment and position us for better performance as we work through the global impact of the pandemic.
we identified several opportunities to drive efficiencies and improve utilization of our assets that will de-leverage our business and provide liquidity to fund our investments with the potential sale of available properties we do not intend to use in the future.
in early july , we received the first of our six new containerized vessels.
we are scheduled to receive three additional vessels spread over the next five months , which will replace existing chartered vessels.
