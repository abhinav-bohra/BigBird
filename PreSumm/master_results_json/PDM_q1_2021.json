size space request in the 15,000 to 25,000 square foot range and starting to conduct tours with these tenants .", "while we saw consistent upticks in tour activity across the portfolio as the first quarter progressed , a 30 % increase actually from january to march , we still anticipate it will take two to three more quarters for piedmont leasing volumes to approach pre-pandemic levels .", "with the usd gdp expected to grow 6.2 % in 2021 , per bloomberg 's april economist survey , u.s. feels like it 's getting back to a new normal .", "the company completed approximately 678,000 square feet of leasing , with new tenant leasing accounting for approximately one - quarter of that activity .", "we are finding that medium - size enterprises are having the greatest difficulty in reaching a conclusion and as such , these customers typically requiring 15,000 to 25,000 square feet are those most often requesting shorter - term renewals of two to three years .", "as i noted in our last call , we continue to see the smaller user market , defined as those being less than 10,000 square feet remain rather resilient , almost approaching pre-pandemic levels of activity .", "and in a large user segment , to find as those needing more than 50,000 square feet , we continue to see the companies who know their business well , use this market disruption as an opportunity to negotiate more favorable terms from their landlords .", "i am pleased to share that one example of this phenomenon has resulted in an early seven - year renewal of raytheon 's approximately 440,000 square foot lease , comprising the entirety of our 225 and 235 presidential way assets in boston .", "looking ahead , our only expiration of any significance over the next 18 months is the city of new york lease of approximately 313,000 square feet , that remains in holdover at 60 broad street .", "finally , following our playbook , on the state of new york 's lease in 2019 , we continue to work with dcas on a potential 20 year extension at the building beyond this extension .", "this is the first time that that tenant has executed renewal that provides a total of 10 years of remaining lease term at the buildings .", "as the two assets represented by this renewal are now 100 % leased to a single credit - worthy tenant with significant term , we believe that value has been maximizing the properties and we have a unique opportunity to realize that value which has been created .", "therefore , we began marketing our 225 and 235 presidential way properties for sale late in the first quarter and we received a good deal of interest .", "on the sustainability front , out of 1,000 of participants in the u.s. energy star program , piedmont was recently named one of 70 company 's designated the 2021 energy star partner of the year and piedmont is the only office reit headquartered in the southeast u.s. to receive this designation .", "approximately three -

store net operating income increased almost 4 % on a cash basis and was down slightly on an accrual basis .", "the increase in cash basis , same - store noi was primarily attributable to the burn off of significant abatements at 11.55 perimeter center west in atlanta and arlington gateway in washington d.c. , along with income associated with wework 's termination in orlando .", "these increases were partially offset by reductions and transient parking and retail revenues as a result of the lingering effects of the pandemic , and by 0.8 % decrease in portfolio occupancy during the first quarter of this year .", "we continue to believe that same -
