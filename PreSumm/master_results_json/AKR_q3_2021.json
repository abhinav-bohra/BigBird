add projects where tenant demand warrants it .", "finally , keep in mind , at our size , roughly every $ 100 million of new investments , whether core or fund , adds about 1 % to our earnings .", "i will start off with a discussion of our third quarter results , followed by an update on our continued progress on the $ 25 million of anticipated internal core noi growth and then closing with our balance sheet .", "our third quarter earnings of $ 0.27 a share exceeded our expectations , landing us in the upper end of the $ 0.25 to $ 0.27 range that we had guided toward on our most recent call .", "and this was driven by rent commencement on new leases , continuous improvements in our cash collections , along with some accretion from the approximately $ 140 million of external investments that we completed during the quarter .", "in terms of near -
