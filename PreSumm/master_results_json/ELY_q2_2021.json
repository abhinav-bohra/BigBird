in sales and continued recovery in the event business .", "looking forward , and this assumes no major restrictions from covid upticks , we feel same venue sales for q3 will be above q2 results , while we expect q4 sales to be slightly slower than q2 due to the corporate events mixed in that quarter and that the full year should end at approximately 90 % .", "to put this in context , this is considerably above our expectations for the year and , we believe , a strong performance .", "domestic venue expansion continued as planned during the quarter , with four new venues opening .", "another venue , holtsville , long island , opened recently , and yet another , colorado springs will open later this week .", "we then expect to open one more venue in q4 for a total of nine new domestic venues this year .", "at the end of the year , we will have 67 domestic venues in operation across three owned upa venues for a total of 70 owned venues in operation .", "internationally , our u.k. venues had an excellent quarter as they reopened strongly after covid induced shutdowns in q1 , and our franchise international venue business continues to build capability and momentum despite various covid challenges .", "overall , the venue business is very healthy , with profitability exceeding our expectations .", "the toptracer business had a successful quarter as well , with over 2,000 bays installed in q2 , setting a new record as we continue to see strong demand and excellent customer feedback .", "while some challenges remain on the installation front due to covid , we expect to meet or exceed our target of 8,000 new bays for the year .", "one of the highlights for the quarter was the successful installation of toptracer into what we believe is the world 's largest driving range , golf club daiju located outside nagoya in central japan .", "lastly , topgolf 's unique position in the market as a gateway to golf is continuing to introduce new players in the sport , and we see excellent long -
