basis - point decline in deposit pricing that occurred over that time frame , our synovus forward initiatives drove additional product and customer level repricing , which represented 3 basis points of that decline , contributing $ 15 million in incremental pre-tax run-rate benefit by the end of the quarter .", "additional balance sheet management efforts have largely been centered around increasing the risk - adjusted yield of the loan portfolio .", "targeted remixing of a subset of consumer loans throughout 2021 has translated into relative higher yields , resulting in an incremental pre-tax run-rate benefit of $ 16 million .", "we remain committed and on track to achieve the cumulative pre-tax run-rate benefit of $ 175 million by the end of 2022 and are confident about the opportunities ahead to achieve those benefits .", "consistent with our reporting today , we will provide more detail on each initiative as they are sized and realized .", "some of the future initiatives are a function of our renewed focus on innovation .", "i 'm excited to provide more details regarding new products and solutions later in the year as we work toward their respective rollout .", "our 2021 outlook on slide 12 remains unchanged from the prior quarter .", "however , i 'd like to share some additional updates on how we expect to end the year .", "in july , we mentioned that we expected 2021 loan growth , excluding balance change from p3 and third - party consumer loans , to be at the low end of the 2 % to 4 % guidance .", "while payoff activity remains a significant headwind , recent productions , client conversations , and our loan pipeline leads us to expect loan growth to be in the lower half of our guidance .", "although excluded from the guidance , it 's important to note that we 've increased third - party consumer loans more than $ 1 billion year to date , and our total loans at the end of the third quarter were up 4 % , excluding changes in p3 balances .", "total adjusted revenues are expected at the higher end of the negative 1 % to 1 % guidance , as the balance sheet management efforts we 've taken throughout the year to monetize excess liquidity and reduce the cost of funds are being complemented by broad - based fee revenue growth outside of the normalization of mortgage revenues .", "similarly , total adjusted expenses are expected to end the year within the existing guidance of negative 1 % to negative 2 % , thus providing the opportunity to achieve positive operating leverage .", "we expect to achieve this reduction while making longer -
