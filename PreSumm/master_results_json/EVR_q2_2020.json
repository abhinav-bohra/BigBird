needs in currently challenging economic and financial markets .", "as a general matter , previously announced m&a transactions continued toward completion and the broader advisory capabilities that we have built and strengthened over the last several years have allowed us to continue to serve our clients on their most pressing financial and strategic issues .", "let me turn specifically to the numbers .", "second quarter adjusted net revenues of $ 513.9 million , decreased 4 % versus the second quarter of 2019 .", "for the first six months of 2020 , adjusted net revenues of $ 948.9 million

ratio for the first six months of 2020 is 63.6 % .", "a word of explanation about the compensation ratio , the 63.6 % accrual in the first half reflects , as it has in past years , an estimate for the full - year compensation ratio , which includes an estimate for 2020 incentive compensation .", "given the uncertainty about revenues for the remainder of the year and the uncertainty about the level of market compensation for our younger employees in 2020 , we have significantly more uncertainty about the full - year compensation ratio than at this time in prior years .", "our intention is to pay our younger employees at market rates as we always have , and to pay our more senior employees in a way that fairly balances the short - term and longer - term interests of our shareholders .", "the short - term interest being higher earnings this year and the longer - term interest being keeping the team together that has produced more than $ 2 billion of revenue in 2018 and 2019 and investing

, consistent with prior quarters , and reflective of our results for the quarter .", "our board and management will continue to evaluate the dividend on a quarterly basis , as the effect of the pandemic on revenues becomes more clear .", "although the current expectation , absent any extraordinary steep decline in revenues and a significant reduction in our cash position , is that our current dividend will be maintained .", "the volatile market environment has created opportunities across products , geographic regions , and industry sectors .", "as the quarter began , merger

quarter , both institutional and wealth management , and trading activity remained high .", "significantly , during the quarter , the level of announced m&a activity slowed dramatically , as clients appropriately turned inward driving many of the activities i just summarized .", "announced m&a volumes were down 41 % in the first six months of 2020 , and the number of announced transactions is down 15 % .", "the second quarter was particularly weak , announced global m&a volumes were down more than 50 % , compared to last year 's second quarter and the number of announced transactions declined 29 % .", "several of the key conditions necessary for a healthy m&a market were absent in the most -- in most sectors of the economy during the quarter and remain generally absent today .",

have begun to slowly pick up during the last few weeks and processes involving financial sponsors are beginning anew .", "i am , for the moment , guardedly optimistic about the merger market overall .", "when the markets began to show sustained stability , ceo confidence will grow , which will drive an increase in strategic activity .", "until then , we will continue to actively communicate and
