related lockdowns in some regional markets during the third quarter of 2021 .", "supply chain disruptions and labor constraints impacting north america plants that supply apac also limited our ability to meet orders across the region with the largest impact experienced in china and japan .", "even so , the region experienced strong results for parts and consumables and service with strength in the australian market across all product categories .", "reported and adjusted gross margin in the third quarter were both 40.1 % compared to a reported gross margin of 39.6 % and adjusted gross margin of 39.8 % in this year ago period .", "although the comparison to the prior year was favorable , the year ago period was unfavorably impacted by certain strategic investments and pandemic - related productivity challenges .", "as we highlighted during our last conference call , our third quarter adjusted gross margin was lower than the adjusted gross margin in the first half of 2021 .", "this decrease was primarily due to increased material and freight costs and productivity challenges caused by parts availability .", "as for expenses , during the third quarter , our adjusted s&a expenses were 28.3 % of net sales compared to 29.3 % in the year ago period .", "the year -
