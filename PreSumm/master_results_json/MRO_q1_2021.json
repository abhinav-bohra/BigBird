year benchmark maintenance scenario that can deliver around $ 5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $ 50 per barrel wti price environment or closer to $ 7 billion of free cash flow at the current forward curve , along with a corporate free cash flow breakeven of less than $ 35 per barrel throughout the period .", "we made tremendous strides during 2020 , reducing our overall ghg intensity by approximately 25 % .", "we are hard at work to achieve our ghg intensity - reduction target of 30 % in 2021 , a metric hardwired into our compensation scorecard , as well as our goal for a 50 % reduction by 2025 , both relative to our 2019 baseline .", "and we have included $ 100 million of investment over the five years of the benchmark scenario to support this goal .", "at the center of our capital allocation and reinvestment rate framework is our objective to return at least 30 % of our cash flow from operations back to our investors .", "when considering our updated debt - reduction target on recent base dividend increase , we 're actually on track to return well over 40 % of our cash flow back to investors this year .", "first , we accelerated our 2021 gross debt - reduction objective of $ 500 million , fully retiring our next significant maturity and we 're now targeting at least another $ 500 million of gross debt reduction , bringing our total 2021 debt -
