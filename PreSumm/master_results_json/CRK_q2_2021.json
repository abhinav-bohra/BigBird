forward with our 5.875 % senior notes being issued in the second quarter 2021 .", "with the refinancing in place , we reduced our interest costs per mcfe by 25 % this quarter to $ 0.36 and are

the remainder of this year , we have natural gas hedges covering 976 million cubic feet per day , which is around 70 % of our expected production in the second half of this year .", "59 % of those hedges are fixed price swaps , but 41 % are collars , which give us exposure to the higher prices we 're now seeing .", "for 2022 or next year , we have about 40 % to 45 % of our expected production hedged .", "and almost half of those or 49 % are in the form of collars , which give us substantial exposure to the higher prices that we 're kind of now seeing for next year .", "we had only 52 million a day shut - in during the second quarter , which is 3.8 % of our production , and that came down substantially from the 6.4 % we had shut - in , in the first quarter .", "our operating cost per mcfe averaged $ 0.54 in the second quarter , and that was $ 0.01 lower than the first quarter rate .", "gathering costs were $ 0.25 , taxes $ 0.08 and the other lifting cost in the field were $

senior notes , which are due in 2025 .", "we assumed as part of the covey park acquisition , $ 1.25 billion of new 6.75 % senior notes due in 2029 that we issued in march .", "and then the new $ 965 million of new 5.875 senior notes due in 2030 that were issued right at the end of the second quarter .", "we currently plan to retire the 2025 7.5 % bonds , probably sometime early next year , just using -- targeting the free cash flow that 's generated and using that as a permanent debt reduction moved by the company .", "and so you can see now that our weighted average maturity of our senior notes is now 7.6 years after the recent refinancing , right at the end of the second quarter .", "so we did end the quarter with about $ 20 million in cash on the balance sheet .", "so our current liquidity is at $ 945 million .", "so in the second quarter , we spent $ 165 million on our development activities and $ 154 million of that relates to our operated haynesville shale properties .", "so we drilled 21 or 15.7 net operated horizontal haynesville wells , and then we returned 16 or 14.2 net operated haynesville wells to sales in the recently completed second quarter .", "we also spent about $ 10.9 million on nonoperated activity and other development activity .", "in addition to funding our development program , we 've also invested $ 7.6 million on leasing new exploratory acreage .", "given the tremendous success of that leasing program , we have decided to increase our budget up to a maximum of $ 20 million to spend on putting new leases in to support our haynesville shale drilling program in the future .", "so based on this current operating plan , we expect to spend about $ 525 million to $ 560 million on this year 's drilling plan , which will drill 55 net wells and turned to sales about 48 net wells .", "and with the current gas prices , we now anticipate significantly exceeding our original target of $ 200 million of free cash flow for this year .", "since the last call , we 've turned 21 new additional wells to sales .", "the 21 wells were tested at rates ranging from 15 million cubic feet a day up to 32 million cubic feet a day with a 22 million cubic feet per day average ip rate .", "the wells at lateral lengths ranging from 4,580 feet all the way up to 11,388 feet , and we had an average for the quarter of -- or for this list of 8,251 feet .", "so in addition to the wells we have listed here , we currently have 13 additional wells that we have in various stages of completion .", "our fiscal duc count currently stands at 23 wells , and we 're currently we 're actively running three frac crews .", "these are our laterals greater than 8,000 feet in length .", "through the end of the second quarter , 73 % of all the wells turned to sales this year have been long lateral wells .", "during the second quarter , our total d&c cost averaged $ 1,051 a foot .", "this represents a 3 % increase compared to the first quarter .", "and is 2 % higher than the full year 2020 total d&c cost .", "our drilling costs in the second quarter increased by 7 % compared to the first quarter .", "this is primarily attributable to a lower average lateral length versus the first quarter , but still 15 % less than our drilling cost in 2020 .", "our completion costs remained relatively flat with only a 2 % increase from the first quarter .", "but we 're still running 16 % higher than 2020 .", "so by building on our basin leading drilling performance and keeping our current completion cost in check , we expect to maintain our total d&c cost for our benchmark long lateral wells in this 1,025 , 1,050 foot range .", "also , i want to add that we 're currently drilling two , 15,000 foot laterals that we spud in june .", "we also have two additional 15,000 foot wells that we will spud later this month that will be completed in the first quarter of next year .", "our operating plan for this year is expected to provide for around 8 % to maybe 10 % production growth and most importantly , generate in excess as roland said , $ 200 million of free cash flow and maybe a lot more than that .", "our june refinancing transaction was another significant step to reducing our cost of capital with the $ 28 million annual savings and interest payments .", "if natural gas prices stay at current levels , we would expect our leverage ratio to improve to less than a 2.5 times at the end of 2021 , down from that $ 3.8 million at the end of 2020 .", "we 'll also focus on lowering our greenhouse gas emissions and are currently evaluating participating in one of the programs to certify our gas as responsibly sourced and we have very strong liquidity , as roland mentioned , at $ 945 million .", "production guidance remains at the 1.33 to 1.425 bcfe per day number that we had previously provided .", "as mentioned on the call , our development capex guidance is $ 525 million to $ 560 million .", "and at the same time , as
