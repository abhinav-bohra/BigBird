over - year comparisons also benefited from this amortization expense , following the asset impairment charge we took during the quarter .", "for your reference , our second quarter depreciation and the amortization expense of $ 13.5 million is a good quarterly run rate to assume going forward .", "overall , our strong cost control combined with improving sales trends during the quarter resulted in mid-single digit decremental margins on adjusted operating income or high - single digit decrementals when excluding depreciation and amortization expense .", "going forward , we will remain prudent and disciplined in managing our cost structure as we continue to roll off temporary cost actions to align with our recent performance and a more constructive outlook .", "since the start of our fiscal year , we have gradually eliminated the temporary cost actions as the business environment has slowly recovered and expect to discontinue the vast majority of the remaining temporary cost actions during this current fiscal third quarter .", "adjusted ebitda in the quarter was $ 68.3 million , down 8.4 % compared to the prior year quarter , while adjusted ebitda margin was 9.1 % , up 14 basis points over the prior year or virtually flat when excluding non-cash lifo expense in both periods .", "on a gaap basis , we reported an operating loss of $ 0.14 per share , which includes the previously referenced non-cash impairment and non-routine charges .", "on a non-gaap adjusted basis , excluding these items , we reported earnings per share of $ 0.98 , which compared to $ 0.97 in the prior year quarter .", "our adjusted tax -

term .", "moving to our cash flow performance and liquidity .", "cash generated from operating activities during the second quarter was $ 77.5 million , while free cash flow totaled $ 72.7 million or approximately 190 % of adjusted net income .", "this was up from $ 55 million and $ 48 million respectively , as compared to the prior year quarter and represents record second quarter cash generation .", "year - to - date , free cash generation of $ 151 million is up over 60 % for prior year levels and represents a 206 % factor of adjusted net income .", "the strong cash performance year - to - date reflects solid operational execution , significant ongoing contribution from our working capital initiatives and that counter - cyclical cash flow profile of our business model .", "given the strong free cash flow performance in the quarter , we ended december with approximately $ 289 million of cash on hand .", "of note , this is after utilizing cash during the quarter with two acquisitions .", "net leverage stood at 2.1 times adjusted ebitda at quarter - end , consistent with the prior quarter and below the prior year level of 2.5 times .", "in addition , our revolver remains undrawn with approximately $ 250 million of capacity and an additional $ 250 million accordion option .", "combined with incremental capacity under our uncommitted private shelf facility , our liquidity remains strong .", "this provides flexibility to fund incremental working capital requirements in coming quarters as customer demand continues to improve as well as to pursue strategic m&a and fund other growth initiatives .", "our m&a focus near - term remains on smaller bolt - on targets that align with our growth priorities , including additional automation and fluid power opportunities .", "this represents the 12th dividend increase since 2010 and under - stores our strong cash generation and commitment to delivering shareholder value .", "transitioning now to our outlook .", "based on month - to - date trends in january and assuming normal sequential patterns , we would expect fiscal third quarter 2021 organic sales to decline by 3 % to 4 % on a year - over - year basis .", "this includes an assumption of low - single digit organic declines in our service center segment and mid-single digit organic declines in our fluid power and flow control segment .", "again , this direction is meant to provide a starting framework on how third quarter sales could shape up if trends follow normal seasonality going forward .", "in addition , we expect our recent acquisitions at acs and gibson engineering to contribute approximately $ 10 million to $ 11 million in sales during our fiscal third quarter .", "we expect gross margins to remain relatively unchanged sequentially into the second half of fiscal 2021 .", "we continue to see some incremental price announcements from suppliers , so the magnitude of the increases are not materially different from what we 've seen over the past year .", "our history highlight strong management of supplier inflation and price cost dynamics reflecting our industry position , internal initiatives and positive mix opportunities .", "as it relates to operating costs , based on the 3 % to 4 % organic sales decline assumption , we would expect selling , distribution and administrative expense of between $ 170 million and $ 175 million during our fiscal third quarter .", "in addition , if sales follow normal sequential patterns for the balance of the year , we would expect a similar to slightly higher sd&a range in our fiscal fourth quarter .", "this represents an increase from second quarter levels and partially reflects the ongoing roll off of temporary cost actions .", "as indicated , we will continue to take a mindful and balanced approach to managing our operating costs going forward .", "we were encouraged by our cost and margin execution year - to - date , which is providing a strong position to further discontinue temporary cost actions as we take an offensive approach to an emerging recovery and our strategic growth targets .", "lastly , from a cash flow perspective , we expect free cash to moderate in the second half relative to first half levels .", "working capital will likely become a use of cash as their level start to cyclically build , and we begin to replenish inventory in support of our growth opportunities , and the recovery as the year moves forward .", "we remain confident on our cash generation potential and reiterate our normalized annual free cash target of at least 100 % of net income over a cycle .", "approximately three quarters ago , during the initial weeks of the pandemic , i stated my belief that applied has never been in a better position to manage through the current environment and exit the pandemic - driven downturn in an even stronger position .", "our performance since then provide strong confirmation of disposition , the tremendous team we have at applied , and the earnings potential that lies ahead .", "this includes record cash generation and a 30 % reduction in our net debt , our strong cost execution supporting relatively stable ebitda margins despite the meaningful end market slowdown .", "during this time , we also completed two acquisitions , supplementing our long - term growth profile , while advancing other key growth initiatives , including optimizing our cross-selling opportunity and strategic end - market positioning .", "we are delivering on our requirements and commitments while moving the organization toward our longer -
