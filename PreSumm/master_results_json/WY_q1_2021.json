.", "first quarter adjusted ebitda for this segment improved by $ 7 million compared to fourth quarter 2020 .", "this improvement was mainly due to lower corporate function and variable compensation expenses , partially offset by higher charges for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and lifo .", "this charge was primarily driven by higher lumber inventory in the south , where customer takeaway was disrupted after the severe winter weather .", "turning now to our key financial items , which are summarized on page 14 cash from operations totaled nearly $ 700 million for the first quarter .", "this is our highest quarterly operating cash flow since fourth quarter 2006 , and our highest first quarter cash flow on record .", "we generally expect cash from operations to decrease significantly in the first quarter , primarily due to seasonal working capital increases .", "however , operating cash flow improved by over $ 250 million compared with the fourth quarter ,

performance , has resulted in a net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio of 1.5 times .", "although our leverage ratio is significantly below our over the cycle target of 3.5 times net debt to

.", "domestic average sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared with the first quarter .", "additionally , while we expect average sales realizations for large logs to improve , we believe that this will be offset by an unfavorable mix of small logs as we continue to work through salvage wood .", "we anticipate second quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher and that forestry and road spending will increase as we enter the spring and summer months .", "moving to the export markets .", "in japan , log demand remains strong .", "japanese douglas - fir

first quarter .", "for china , average export log sales realizations are expected to increase significantly .", "demand for imported logs is strong due to significant economic growth , limited lumber imports , and continued disruptions in the supply of imported log .", "however , our average log sales volumes are expected to be lower compared with the first quarter .", "with strong us domestic demand for large log and high ocean freight cost , we 'll flex more logs to the domestic market to capture the highest margin .", "in the south , we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher than first quarter due to seasonally higher thinner activity -- thinning activity , as well as the deferred harvest activities related to the adverse weather we experienced during the first quarter .", "we expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter .", "forestry spending in the south is expected to increase , which is typical coming into the spring months .", "in the north , average log sales realizations are expected to increase slightly compared to first quarter while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season .", "i 'll wrap up the timberlands segment with a few comments on our recent timberland transaction .", "in the second quarter , we will report a cash outflow of approximately $ 149 million for the 69,000 acre alabama timberlands acquisition that we completed this week .", "and as devin mentioned , we have also announced the sale of our north cascades acreage and we expect to complete that transaction in the third quarter .", "the gain on sale will be reported as a special item within the timberlands segment .", "turning to our real estate energy and natural resource segment .", "real estate markets remain strong into the second quarter , as the sale preferences during this time , continue to drive robust demand for rural recreational properties .", "we expect second quarter net earnings and adjusted ebitda to be moderately lower than first quarter due to timing of transactions .", "we continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted ebitda of approximately $ 255 million , although we now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 35 % to 45 % for the year due to the mix of properties sold .", "we continue to anticipate our 2021 real estate activity will be heavily weighted to the first half of the year , similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020 .", "for our wood products segment , new residential construction activity has remained at very favorable levels and our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong second quarter following the already strong first quarter .", "in repair and remodel markets , we are seeing a shift from small do - it - yourself improvement project to larger remodel activity , further solidifying the demand for structural wood products within this market .", "excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board , we expect second quarter adjusted ebitda will be significantly higher than the first quarter .", "for lumber , we expect production volumes to increase during the quarter as operating rates are expected to improve following weather related mill downtime in the first quarter .", "we expect these higher production volumes to have a favorable impact on our manufacturing costs .", "we also anticipate this increased supply as well as higher seasonal inventory drawdown to drive higher sales volumes during the quarter .", "oriented strand board is expected to have a slightly lower production level and sales volume and slightly higher manufacturing costs due to an extended outage to complete a planned capital project at our elkin osb mill .", "this equipment has been on - site but installation has been delayed multiple times due to covid related travel restrictions and vendor resource availability .", "log costs are expected to be comparable to the first quarter .", "entering the second quarter , benchmark pricing for oriented strand board and the framing lumber composite

our solid section and i - joist products as we continue to capture the benefit of price increases announced in august 2020 and january 2021 .", "additionally , in march 2021 , we announced a third increase , which ranges from 10 % to 25 % and will be captured over the next several quarters .", "this will be partially offset by higher raw material costs .", "i 'll wrap up with a few additional
