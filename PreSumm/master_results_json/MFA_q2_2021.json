cost financing .", "interest income on our loan portfolio was also approximately $ 5 million higher , primarily driven by higher prepayments and lower delinquency levels on purchase credit deteriorated and purchased nonperforming loans .", "similarly to the prior quarter , interest income from our securities investments included approximately $ 8 million of accretion on an msr term note investment that was redeemed at par but that we have taken an impairment charge on in q1 of 2020 .", "our net interest spread increased to an impressive 3.02 % this quarter .", "and while additional securitizations will continue to meaningfully benefit funding costs , overall spread levels should moderate in future periods as prepayment speeds declined in line with seasonal factors .", "we reduced our overall cecl allowance on carrying value loans to $ 54.3 million , reflecting lower loan balances and adjustments to estimated levels of future unemployment and home price appreciation used in our credit loss modeling .", "this reversal and other net adjustments to our cecl reserves positively impacted net income for the quarter by $ 8.9 million .", "after the significant increase in cecl reserves taken in q1 2020 when uncertainty related to covid -

changing environment and a testament to our strong originator relationships in a competitive market environment .", "our rpl portfolio of $ 1 billion has been impacted by the pandemic but continues to perform well .", "eighty - one percent of our portfolio remains less than 60 days delinquent .", "and although the percentage of 60 -- the portfolio 60 days delinquent in status was 26 % , a quarter of those borrowers continue to make payments .", "prepayment speeds in the second quarter moderated a bit , but continue to be elevated at a three - month cpr of 15 as mortgage rates continue to be historically low and more borrowers gained equity with the increase of home prices .", "while 30 % of our rpl borrowers were impacted by covid , we have worked with our servicers to provide assistance to borrowers and have seen improvement in delinquency levels over the quarter .", "our asset management team continues to push performance of our npl portfolio .", "the team has worked in concert with our servicing partners to maximize outcomes on our portfolio .", "this page shows the outcomes for loans that were purchased prior to the year ended 2019 .", "thirty - eight percent of loans that were delinquent at purchase are now either performing or paid in full .", "forty - seven percent are either liquidated or reo to be liquidated .", "our sales of reo properties have continued at an accelerated pace at advantageous prices .", "we have been able to cut the reo portfolio in half since the pandemic began .", "fifteen percent are still in nonperforming status .", "our modifications have been effective as almost three - quarters are either performing or paid in full .", "we are pleased with these results as they continue to outperform our assumptions at the time of purchase .", "we closed the previously announced acquisition of lima one on july 1 .", "we 're very excited about this transaction , and i would like to give a shout - out to the entire msa and lima one teams that work diligently and collaboratively toward closing this transaction quickly .", "lima one is a leading nationwide originator of business purpose loans , or bpls , with a strong brand recognition in the bpl borrower community .", "they serve the needs of short - and long - term borrowing strategies in the bpl space by offering a diverse set of products , including fix and flip and new construction loans , longer - term rental loans , and small balance multifamily value - add and bridge loans .", "lima 's originated over $ 3 billion since inception and has shown that they can reliably originate over $ 1 billion annually with a clear path to grow significantly beyond that .", "the acquisition enhances our position as a significant capital provider to the bpl space , which we believe offers some of the most attractive opportunities to deploy capital in the residential mortgage space .", "this acquisition will provide mfa with reliable access to high - quality high - yielding assets that are difficult to source in the marketplace .", "at closing of the acquisition , we added $ 152 million of business purpose loans to our balance sheet .", "the integration of lima one into the mfa family has been smooth and efficient .", "the working relationship we 've built over the last four years across our organizations has been a tremendous asset in the integration and allowed lima one to continue to originate high - quality loans and service customers without any issues .", "one of the key initiatives has been to quickly use mfa 's balance sheet and reputation to substantially improve the financing of lima 's assets and origination going forward .", "we 've already refinanced expensive financial , a bpl securitization , and subordinated debt that lima needed to put in place during 2020 , which will save over 500 basis points in financing costs over time .", "and we are in the process of adding additional financing lines to meet the expected growth of business going forward .", "turning to page 17 , where we will discuss the fix and flip portfolio .", "our portfolio declined modestly by about $ 32 million in the second quarter as principal paydowns continue to exceed loan acquisitions .", "limited acquisitions last year led to our current seasoned loan portfolio where we see completed projects getting sold quickly into a strong housing market , leading to high repayment rates .", "we expect this trend to change going forward as purchase activity has picked up meaningfully .", "second - quarter loan acquisitions more than doubled from the first quarter as we acquired $ 68 million in upb and $ 118 million in max loan amount in the quarter .", "as a reminder , fix and flip loans financed the acquisition , rehabilitation , and construction of homes .", "typically , a certain amount of the loan is held back in the form of a construction holdback , which explains the difference between upb on day one and the max loan amount , which represents the fully funded loan at the completion of project .", "third - quarter acquisitions are on track to increase even further as we 've already added in excess of $ 150 million max loan amount of fix and flip loans and fuel others .", "with the acquisition of lima as well as other seller relationships , we expect purchase activity to be strong going forward and expect the fix and flip portfolio to grow again in the third quarter .", "the fix and flip portfolio delivered strong income in the second quarter with average portfolio yield of approximately 6.4 % in the quarter .", "the housing market continues to be extremely strong with record - low mortgage rates and low levels of inventory supporting annual home price depreciation in excess of 15 % .", "in addition , we continue to see unemployment declining and overall economic activity improving across the country .", "the combination of these positive economic fundamentals , low initial ltvs on our loans , and the efforts of our experienced asset management team continues to lead to acceptable outcomes on our delinquent loans .", "sixty - plus day delinquent loans continue to decline and dropped $ 29 million to $ 120 million at the end of the second quarter .", "and what is really encouraging is that we continue to see a solid amount of loans pay off in full out of 60 - plus .", "the loans paid off in full from serious delinquency we often collect default interest , extension fees , and other fees of payout .", "for loans where there is meaningful equity in the property , these can add up .", "since inception , we have collected approximately $ 4.8 million in these types of fees across our fix and flip portfolio .", "sixty - plus day delinquency as a percentage of upb declined 4 % to 28 % and remains elevated .", "but keep in mind that we have purchased over $ 2.1 billion of fix and flip loans and had over $ 1.5 billion pay off in full .", "due to the short - term nature of fix and flip loans with expected payoff in about six to 12 months , delinquent loans can be outstanding for longer than performing loans due to the time it takes to complete foreclosure .", "as our purchase activity was limited last year and performing loans paid off , the delinquency percentage increase as one would naturally expect as our portfolio shrank .", "as we now grow our portfolio again and continue to have positive outcomes on seriously delinquent loans , we expect those in dollar amount as well as the percentage delinquency to continue to decline going forward .", "and so far in the third quarter , we continue to see positive delinquency trends .", "finally , the fix and flip loan reserves continued to trend down in the second quarter , declining by $ 2.1 million , primarily due to improved economic expectations and a strong housing market .", "our single - family rental loan portfolio continues to deliver attractive yields and strong credit performance .", "the portfolio yield has remained steady in a mid- to high 5 % range post - covid and was 5.76 % in the second quarter .", "underlying credit trends remained solid and 60 -
