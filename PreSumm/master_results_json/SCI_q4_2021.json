4 % comparable funeral volume growth , even growing over a covid - impacted 2020 , the primary drivers of our revenue was mid-20 % growth in both preneed and atneed cemetery revenues , combined with a strong 7 % increase in our funeral sales average .", "we generated adjusted earnings per share of $ 1.17 , a 4 % increase over the prior year quarter and a 95 % increase over a pre-pandemic fourth quarter of 2019 .", "compared to the 2020 fourth quarter , funeral results drove the earnings per share increase as a healthy 8 % increase in the funeral sales average offset slightly lower volumes and cost increases associated with staffing and energy .", "total comparable funeral revenues grew $ 47 million , or about 9 % over the prior year quarter , exceeding our expectations as core revenues , non-funeral revenues from sci direct and general agency revenues all saw impressive growth in the fourth .", "comparable core funeral revenues were $ 32 million , led by an impressive 8.4 % increase in the comparable funeral sales average , the core sales average continues to climb sequentially and is up about 5 % over the 2019 pre-covid fourth quarter .", "comparable core funeral volume declined 1.5 % compared to the prior year quarter , slightly offsetting the positive impact of the funeral sales average .", "keep in mind , the 2020 fourth quarter we were comparing against was acutely impacted by covid and saw a 17 % higher core funeral volume increase over the 2019 fourth quarter .", "from a profit perspective , general gross profit increased $ 10 million while the gross profit percentage dropped 60 basis points to 27 % .", "in the fourth quarter of 2020 , those costs were actually down 2 % versus the 2019 fourth quarter even with 17 % more volume as the pre-vaccine era of the virus restricted both the consumers and our ability to provide a full service funeral .", "in the 2021 fourth quarter , these costs increased by 8 % compared to the 2020 fourth quarter .", "so overall , our fixed costs have increased 6 % over the two - year period , or let 's say , 3 % on a compounded annual basis while we are caring for 17 % more customers than we did in 2019 .", "preneed funeral sales production for the quarter exceeded our expectations , growing $ 30 million from nearly 14 % over the fourth quarter of 2020 .", "our core preneed funeral average revenue per contract [ inaudible ] the backlog now is over $ 6,300 .", "this is an 8 % increase over 2020 and more than $ 300 higher than our atneed average for the quarter .", "comparable cemetery revenue increased $ 21 million , or 5 % , in the fourth quarter .", "in terms of the breakdown , atneed cemetery revenue generated $ 13.5 million of the growth , driven by a higher quality core average sale and a modest increase in contract velocity .", "recognized preneed revenues generated about $ 8 million of the revenue growth , primarily due to higher recognized preneed merchandise and service growth .", "so preneed cemetery sales production grew 30 -- $ 39 million or 13 % in the fourth quarter .", "this growth is on top of a 2020 fourth quarter , which grew by 16 % over 2019 .", "however , we were still able to grow the velocity of contract sold by almost 5 % , which accounted for the remainder of the sales production .", "for the full year 2021 , they produced $ 1.3 billion cemetery preneed sales production .", "this represents a 28 % increase over and above the very strong 15 % growth in 2020 .", "cemetery gross profits in the quarter declined slightly by $ 1 million and the gross profit percentage dropped 200 basis points to 36.8 % .", "at the midpoint , this represents a 20 % increase from our previously mentioned model midpoint $ 2.80 in our third quarter conference call .", "the $ 3 midpoint reflects a $ 0.165 compounded annual growth rate over the pre-covid earnings per share base in 2019 of $ 1.90 , well above our historical guidance range .", "as you think about the cadence for the year as we compare back to a $ 4.57 2021 , we would expect negative comparisons for each quarter .", "so how are we going to grow earnings per share at a 16.5 % compounded annual growth rate from the 2019 base ?", "and finally , we forecast preneed funeral sales production to grow in a 3 % to 5 % range for the year .", "we continue to believe that after establishing a new base here in 2022 , we will return to earnings growth in the 8 % to 12 % range in 2023 .", "so operating cash flow is approximately $ 190 million in the current quarter , compared to $ 245 million in the prior year with the primary decline due to an increase in cash tax payments during the quarter of $ 97 million versus the $ 36 million in the fourth quarter of last year .", "excluding cash taxes in both periods , operating cash flow before taxes increased almost $ 6 million to $ 287 million in the fourth quarter , driven by modest increases in earnings and favorable working capital , partially offset by $ 6 million of higher cash interest payments .", "so as we step back and look at the full year of 2021 , we generated $ 912 million in adjusted operating cash flow , representing a substantial increase of $ 108 million or 13 % over the prior year .", "deducting recurrent capex of $ 260 million , which again represents maintenance , capex and cemetery development capex , we calculate free cash flow for the full year to be an impressive $ 652 million in 2021 , up $ 33 million from $ 619 million in 2020 .", "and the fourth quarter was no exception , deploying nearly $ 500 million , which is the highest quarterly capital deployment we have seen in recent history .", "we invested $ 110 million in our businesses with $ 65 million of maintenance capital and $ 45 million of cemetery development capital spend during the fourth quarter .", "so i 'm happy to report , as you 've seen , that those acquisitions closed , bringing the total investments during the quarter to $ 112 million and again expecting low double digit to mid-teen irrs on each of these transactions .", "these businesses added almost $ 40 million of full year revenues from 28 funeral homes and two cemeteries in ohio , california , illinois , oregon , and rhode island .", "we also deployed about $ 16 million toward new builds in texas , colorado , washington , and florida .", "this brings total 2021 spend on new builds to $ 43 million with again low double digit to maintain irrs , which also helped drive additional earnings and cash flow growth for the company .", "finally , we deployed $ 248 million of capital during the quarter to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and $ 700 billion for the full year of 2021 .", "for the last two years alone , we meaningfully reduced our outstanding shares by about 10 % through timely execution on our repurchasing strategy .", "since the inception of our repurchase program , we have now reduced our shares outstanding by just over 50 % .", "as tom mentioned , at the midpoint of our earnings guidance range of $ 3 , we expect to meaningfully exceed our 8 % to 12 % earnings growth framework for earnings per share when comparing back to pre-covid 2019 base of $ 1.09 .", "so from a cash flow perspective , our 8 % to 12 % earnings growth framework generally translate historically into about a 4 % growth in adjusted cash flow before cash taxes .", "so adjusting for $ 150 million of expected cash taxes in ' 22 , our adjusted cash flow from operations before cash taxes is expected to be about an $ 850 million at the midpoint .", "this equates to a 6.5 % cagr over our pre-covid 2019 adjusted cash flow from operations before cash taxes of $ 700 million , which is similarly in excess of this normalized 4 % annual growth that we normally expect .", "first , we 'll be required to pay the remaining half for about $ 20 million of payroll taxes that were deferred in 2020 as allowed under the cares act .", "and as i just mentioned , cash tax payments in ' 22 are anticipated to be about $ 150 million based on the midpoint of our earnings guidance , or $ 115 million lower than the $ 265 million of 2021 .", "and from an effective tax rate standpoint , we continue to model in the range of 24 % to 25 % in 2022 .", "now historically , we 've guided to around $ 125 million to $ 130 million of annual recurring corporate general administrative expenses .", "as a result of this review that is ongoing , we have identified about $ 20 million to $ 25 million of costs , which we believe may be more appropriately characterized as corporate in nature versus field - related expenses that is primarily related to certain technology , risk , and governance areas .", "therefore , when you 're modeling 2022 at this point , i would expect annual corporate g&a to increase to maybe around $ 145 million to $ 150 million per year with the corresponding dollar for dollar decrease in costs and the segment margins .", "so looking forward to 2023 , we expect to return to a normalized cash flow growth trajectory with an expected 4 % growth and adjusted cash flow from operations before cash taxes , which again is in line with our 8 % to 12 % earnings growth framework per share that we just mentioned .", "our expectations for maintenance and cemetery development capital spending is $ 270 million to $ 290 million for the year .", "at the midpoint , cemetery development capex comprises about $ 120 million of this amount , and maintenance capex makes up the remaining $ 160 million .", "this maintenance capex of $ 160 million includes about $ 110 million of normal routine maintenance capital used at our funeral and cemetery operating locations , as well as another $ 50 million for field and corporate support capital .", "this $ 50 million is primarily being deployed toward technology to not only improve the customer experience with ultimately customer - facing technology , but also toward network infrastructure at our operating locations .", "in addition to these recurring capital expenditures of $ 280 million at the midpoint , we expect to deploy $ 50 million to $ 100 million toward acquisitions , and roughly $ 50 million more in new funeral home construction opportunities , which together , as i continue to say , drive meaningful after - tax irrs , well in excess of our cost of capital .", "and of course , this strategy is predicated on our stable free cash flow , our robust liquidity , which is over $ 1 billion at the end of the year , as well as our favorable debt maturity profile .", "lending additional support to this strategy , our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter landed just under 2.6 times from a net debt to ebitda perspective .", "and as we 've noted in the past , looking beyond the impacts of this pandemic , we continue to expect to increase back to our targeted leverage range of 3.5 to 4 times toward the latter part of this year as we lap stronger ebitda quarters moving forward ."], "summary_gold": "q4 adjusted earnings per share $ 1.17 .<q>qtrly revenue grew $ 73 million , or 8 % , over prior year quarter to $ 1,043 million .<q>sees 2022 adjusted earnings per
