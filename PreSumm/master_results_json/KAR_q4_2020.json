week period and our technology teams had to make sure our systems were always available and there were no service disruptions caused by the increased use of our networks .", "i 'm extremely proud of the collective effort of all kar employees to make this happen .", "in the past , many investors have asked me what keeps me awake at night , and technology and digital disruption have always been at the top of the list .", "well , while the challenges of 2020 took technology and digital disruption to a new level , we responded quickly , and today we have the best collection of digital assets in the entire industry .", "we were able to accelerate the transition of our legacy physical auction business to a digital operating model in the matter of weeks instead of the three years to five years that we anticipated at the beginning of 2020 .", "another challenge that we faced in 2020 was handling our workforce .", "in late march , we closed all of our auctions and sent our employees home with pay to evaluate the impact of covid -

office functions .", "changes in the business operations and especially , all of our support functions led us to permanently eliminate 5,000 positions , reducing our annual payroll costs by over $ 150 million .", "by fall , we had our headcount and cost structure aligned with the business and our digital auction process .", "we saw the impact of the permanent changes in our cost structure in our third quarter results and expect this to contribute to an improved financial performance going forward .", "and then we saw a resurgence of covid - 19 with the impacts that went beyond what we had experienced in the spring .", "we saw the supply of used vehicles tighten and our inventory levels continue to decline as retail demand remains strong , resulting in strong conversion rates and high wholesale prices .", "lower transaction volumes led to reduce performance in the fourth quarter despite all the reductions that we 'd made to our cost structure .", "in any organization , people are the most valuable asset .", "in this environment , the strain and the uncertainty , our people are feeling is the most challenging aspect of running the business today , and it looks like it will be a while longer before we see relief from the strain of covid -

over - year in q4 by $ 25 million .", "this decrease was achieved despite adding $ 5 million of sg&a in the fourth quarter related to backlotcars .", "even though our costs , we 're able to -- even though we were able to reduce our costs , our fourth quarter performance fell below our expectations as we saw the supply of wholesale vehicles decline throughout the entire industry .", "our volumes in q4 reflect the slowing of the economy in response to the increased covid cases .", "i do not believe the lower volumes reflect the seasonal impacts or the permanent disruption of our marketplaces .", "i believe the factors that negatively impacted our supply in q4 are transitory .", "now , let me give you a real - time update on traderev and backlotcars .", "first , we are migrating all u.s. dealer - to - dealer transactions that previously took place on traderev to the backlotcars platform .", "we ran a pilot migration in three u.s. markets in january to refine our migration playbook .", "we were pleased with the results of the migration and the acceptance of backlotcars platform by our traderev customers in these markets .", "beginning february 1st , we initiated the migration of all u.s. traderev customers to the backlotcars platform .", "we expect the migration activities to be completed in march .", "by moving our u.s. customers from the traderev application to the backlotcars , we will be moving from a timed auction format to a 24/7 bid-ask marketplace .", "our analysis of the performance on the two platforms supported this move .", "we believe running a single dealer - to - dealer digital marketplace will maximize liquidity .", "utilizing the inspection process developed by backlotcars should lower our inspection cost per vehicle and provide greater consistency in the inspection reports for cars sold on backlotcars platform .", "and most important , we believe the price realization on the backlotcars platform in the u.s. outperforms the competition in the u.s. market .", "the early results on the migration activities has been very positive .", "initially , there was a small reduction in volumes as former traderev customers began using backlotcars platform .", "the learning curve for our customers seems to be about five days to seven days and in the second week , we began seeing our combined volumes increase in the markets that we are in the first wave of migrations .", "we believe the backlotcars is the fastest growing dealer - to - dealer platform in the u.s. market .", "we want backlotcars to be the number one digital dealer - to - dealer marketplace in the u.s. just to be clear , we will continue to operate traderev in canada .", "to sum it all up , after 90 days of owning backlotcars , we are pleased with the performance and the fit with kar .", "we have focused -- we have a focused and energetic team leading our efforts to be the leader in the digital dealer - to - dealer transactions in the u.s .", "our customers have been receptive to change in the early days of integration activities and bringing the strength of the kar organization to the outstanding team at backlotcars is a winning combination that should accelerate the already fantastic pace of growth in the digital dealer -

to - dealer platforms , backlotcars in the u.s. and traderev in canada are expected to grow substantially over 2020 levels .", "we expect to continue -- to continue gaining market share in this channel throughout the year .", "we are committed to expanding the use of simulcast + in 2021 .", "we are targeting an increased number of events using this technology platform .", "there is tremendous value to using the simulcast + platform for multi-location sales events , targeted marketing for similar vehicles that allow us to create events that have high buyer interest and expand the geographic reach of the typical physical auction .", "and our growth internationally , especially at adesa europe , formerly , carsontheweb is very strong and we expect this to continue throughout all of 2021 .", "we have not given a range of guidance , it is difficult to set an upper end of the range with the uncertainty on when operations will return to normal levels .", "we still have more questions and answers on what our markets will look like , especially in the first half of the year .", "but we have had -- have an opportunity to outperform above the adjusted ebitda and operating adjusted net income per share provided in our guidance once volumes start improving .", "as a team , we will focus on controlling our costs , increasing our market share , we expect our market share to be driven primarily by digital dealer - to - dealer platforms , backlotcars and traderev , and we will be disciplined around capital deployment .", "we think our balance sheet , excuse me , is an asset in the current economic environment .", "and as we look to deploy capital , we expect uses of capital to have a strong connection to our strategic priorities around the digital transformation of the wholesale used car industry .", "we are a digital marketplace business that utilizes data and analytics and value -

to - quarter were like riding a roller coaster .", "we experienced both ups and downs in performance this year .", "in review , we started the first quarter strong and performed very well until the middle of march .", "uncertainties created by covid - 19 caused us to shut down our operations for the last two weeks of march .", "we lost approximately $ 35 million in those two weeks as revenue was minimal and all employees were paid for two weeks despite all locations being closed .", "we lost money in the month of april .", "we had negative adjusted ebitda of approximately $ 25 million for the month .", "we then saw a relatively fast rebound during may as weekly volumes rebounded to over 90 % of the prior year , followed by june , where volumes and our financial performance exceeded the prior year .", "volumes and financial performance remained strong in july , as we saw strong used car demand , low new car inventories , used car values were increasing and we were selling inventory that had been on our properties through the pandemic .", "while volume started to decline in august , we finished the third quarter with volumes over 90 % of 2019 levels for the quarter and adjusted ebitda that was 8 % above 2019 levels .", "we had gross profit of over 50 % of net revenue and adjusted ebitda margin that was 23.5 % of total revenue .", "we feel this performance demonstrates the performance characteristics of our business model going forward when volumes are at or near 2019 levels .", "unfortunately , the fourth quarter saw volumes dropped to 75 % of the prior year , excluding acquisitions .", "and our financial performance deteriorated due to the low revenue levels .", "gross profit declined to 40 % -- 46 % of net revenue .", "even though we have improved our cost structure and reduced direct labor , there is a fixed component to our direct cost and the volume levels experienced in the fourth quarter did not generate sufficient revenue to maintain our gross margins .", "in terms of sg&a , we 're able to control cost and hold the sg&a below the prior year by $ 25 million .", "this was accomplished despite recording approximately $ 16 million in incentive pay in the fourth quarter compared to $ 7 million in the prior year .", "this increase in incentive pay reflects the proposal by management to adjust the threshold for payment to 50 % from approximately 95 % of target for 2020 .", "we felt the sacrifices and contributions of our employees should be recognized with the opportunity for a performance - based incentive payout .", "the threshold set at the beginning of the year did not reflect the challenges we faced in 2020 .", "the compensation committee of the board of directors approved the adjustments of threshold .", "the total payout for employees with annual incentive programs was approximately 70 % of target for the year .", "we also recorded an adjustment to contingent purchase price related to the acquisitions of carsontheweb and dent - ology , that was a net increase in expense of $ 4.7 million .", "this represents an increase in the expected contingent purchase consideration for carsontheweb as performance has exceeded the expectations set at the time of the transaction , offset by a reduction in contingent purchase consideration related to dent - ology , where payments are expected to be less than estimated at the time of the acquisition .", "our effective tax rates for the fourth quarter and full - year were unusual in 2020 .", "the contingent purchase consideration and the write - off of goodwill totaling $ 25.5 million for our u.k. operations that we recorded earlier in the year are not tax deductible and increased our effective tax rate .", "as we look forward , we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30 % , unless , the u.s. federal income tax rate is increased from current levels .", "i know the big question in everyone 's mind is what does kar 's performance look like post - pandemic ?", "we believe our performance in june and through the third quarter gave us insight on what we can do going forward .", "we believe when volumes get back to 90 % or more of 2019 levels , our business can generate gross profit of approximately 50 % of net revenue with adjusted ebitda margins in the mid 20 % range .", "our focus on operating a digital marketplace business and maintaining processes that leverage technology for a more efficient cost structure will allow us to perform at this level .", "now we need the markets to get back to what we would call normal , so we can prove to you the changes we have made will generate these results .", "we are providing auction fees , service revenue , purchased vehicle revenue and finance - related revenue .", "this will give a clear picture of the major components of revenue in our businesses .", "in terms of key metrics provided in md&a , we 're now disclosing volumes for on - premise and off - premise vehicles sold .", "we are reporting auction fee per vehicle sold as a key performance metric .", "we will no longer be utilizing physical revenue per vehicle sold as a key metric .", "while the number is easy to calculate , a significant portion of services revenue is generated from off - premise activity and not related to the on - premise vehicles sold .", "we are also computing the gross profit dollars per vehicle sold and including that in md&a .", "this is a key indicator of performance and trends in this metric will be important going forward as volumes increase .", "this metric will capture both the impact of auction revenue and services revenue on our performance .", "we have also simplified our segment reporting to be consistent with the simplification of the kar businesses post spin of insurance auto auctions .", "all holding company costs are reflected in the adesa business segment other than costs specifically related to afc .", "this simplified segment reporting better reflects the kar organization structure and how the businesses are being managed .", "we want to maintain a cost structure that reflects the revenue and performance of the business .", "aligning our costs directly with the reportable segments simplifies our reporting and matches the cost structure of kar with the revenue produced by our businesses .", "let me close with some comments on guidance .", "however , one item that creates confusion is the computation of weighted average diluted shares .", "generally accepted accounting principles require us to compute per share numbers using either the two - class method or the if - converted method when determining the impact of the series a convertible preferred stock .", "for clarity , we use both calculations and for gaap , are required to use the number that produces the lower earnings per share .", "for gaap purposes , we reduced net income by the preferred dividend and exclude the preferred shares from the calculation of fully diluted shares outstanding when we used the two - class method .", "in computing operated adjusted net income per share , we are utilizing the if - converted method .", "in this method , we do not adjust for the preferred dividend , but do include the conversion of the preferred shares into common shares in the calculation .", "to the extent , preferred dividends are paid in kind , we include the accrued dividends in the conversion calculation .", "in summary , the only difference between the two weighted average diluted shares numbers is the conversion of the convertible preferred stock to common shares using the conversion price of $ 17.75 per share .", "we did buy back $ 10.2 million of common stock in the fourth quarter at an average price of $ 17.50 per share .", "we acquired the shares in the open market within the parameters we established during our open window during the quarter .", "one last item that i will provide in the call , because it will be included in the 10 -
