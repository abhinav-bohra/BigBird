term cash flow generation , as evidenced by our liquidity position , it negatively impacts our operating income performance .", "sg&a expenses were $ 47.8 million in the third quarter , down $ 3 million from the same period a year ago , reflecting the actions we took to reduce costs , including the elimination of about 20 % of our global salaried positions late last fiscal year , managing discretionary spend closely as well as the impacts of remote working conditions that reduced certain administrative costs such as travel and entertainment .", "sequentially , sg&a costs were higher by $ 5.6 million , reflecting incremental costs in the quarter associated with going live with our new erp implementation as well as the incremental depreciation costs associated with the erp system .", "the current quarter 's operating results include $ 7.6 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges , including inventory writedowns , associated with our ongoing actions to reduce cost and narrow focus in our additive business unit within our pep segment .", "in addition , our results for the third quarter include $ 2.7 million in covid - 19 - related costs , which are down slightly from the $ 3.9 million of covid - 19 costs incurred in our recent second quarter .", "as a reminder , these costs include direct incremental operating costs , including outside services to execute enhanced cleaning protocols , isolation pay for employees potentially exposed to covid - 19 and additional personal protective equipment and other operating supplies necessary to maintain the operations while keeping employees safe against possible exposure .", "the operating loss was $ 40 million in the current quarter when excluding the impact of the special items , namely the restructuring and asset impairment charges and the covid -

use market of aerospace and defense as the supply chain continues to deal with near - term reductions in oem build rates .", "this was partially offset by stronger shipments in transportation as north american light vehicle production continues to drive strong demand conditions for our materials .", "sao reported an operating loss of $ 9.9 million for the current quarter .", "the same quarter a year ago , sao 's operating income was $ 76.4 million .", "and in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 , sao reported an operating loss of $ 11.6 million .", "the year - over - year reduction in operating income primarily reflects the impacts of lower volume as well as the negative income statement impacts of reducing inventory , partially offset by the actions taken to reduce operating costs .", "during the current quarter , sao reduced inventory by approximately $ 15 million and , year - to - date , has reduced inventory by $ 146 million .", "sequentially , the lower operating loss is principally the result of lower volume , offset by a favorable product mix and a less pronounced impact of the inventory reduction relative to the second quarter due in part to rising raw material prices .", "in addition , the current quarter 's results reflect approximately $ 2.1 million of direct incremental costs associated with our efforts to protect our facilities and employees in light of covid - 19 .", "this compares with $ 3.2 million in covid - 19 costs in our recent second quarter .", "looking ahead , we expect demand conditions across most end - use markets will stabilize and begin to gradually recover beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 .", "based on current expectations , we anticipate sao will generate an operating loss of approximately $ 5 million to $ 7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 .", "for clarity , i want to highlight a couple of key points in this guidance .", "first , this estimate includes similar sequential covid - 19 - related costs in the upcoming fourth quarter .", "and second , as we continue to reduce inventory , we expect that we will be required to record a noncash lifo decrement charge in our upcoming fourth quarter .", "given the significant inventory reductions we expect to generate for the full fiscal year , we are liquidating lifo layers that include inventory costs that are higher than the fiscal year 2021 cost and , as such , a noncash charge will be recorded to the income statement .", "the guidance we provided excludes the impact of any noncash lifo decrement charges .", "now turning to slide 10 and our pep segment results .", "net sales , excluding surcharge , were $ 64.9 million , which were down 39 % from the same quarter a year ago and up 20 % sequentially .", "the year - over - year decline in sales was driven by market headwinds , largely due to the global pandemic .", "additionally , sales in the energy end - use market declined as a result of our exit of the amega west oil and gas business in the first quarter of this fiscal year .", "the sequential increase in sales reflects increasing demand for titanium materials used in the aerospace and defense and medical end - use markets .", "in addition , our distribution business drove higher sales due to growing demand related to the strong activity in the automotive supply chain .", "lastly , our additive business saw a modest increase in sales as demand improved .", "in the current quarter , pep reported an operating loss of $ 3.3 million .", "this compares to an operating loss of $ 7.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and an operating loss of $ 0.3 million in the same quarter last year .", "the sequential operating results reflect the favorable impacts of higher volumes across all the pep business units .", "as we look ahead , we believe that demand conditions will gradually begin to improve in the coming quarters , and we currently anticipate pep will generate an operating loss of $ 0 million to $ 1 million in our upcoming fourth quarter .", "also , as i mentioned for sao , the pep guidance includes covid - 19 costs in line with the recent quarter but excludes any noncash lifo decrement charges .", "now turning to slide 11 and a review of free cash flow .", "in the current quarter , we generated $ 4 million of cash from operating activities .", "as you can see within the cash flow generated from operations , we continue to reduce inventory , although less pronounced than we have executed in the last several quarters .", "over the last four quarters , beginning with our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 , we have reduced inventory by just under $ 300 million , including $ 182 million of reductions to date in fiscal year 2021 .", "in terms of other working capital , with the implementation of our new erp system , we experienced some challenges with customer collections that reduced cash from accounts receivable collections .", "those challenges are largely behind us , and we expect to realize the benefits of that catch - up in our upcoming fourth quarter .", "in the third quarter , we spent $ 19 million on capital expenditures .", "we expect to spend about $ 110 million to $ 120 million on capital expenditures for fiscal year 2021 depending on the timing of certain projects expected to be completed in the balance of this fiscal year .", "the actions we have taken to generate cash in the current environment have been essential .", "it should not be lost that we believe in the value of returning capital to our shareholders .", "and despite the challenging economic conditions , we have continued to pay a quarterly dividend to our shareholders .", "the quarterly dividend demonstrates the confidence we have in our ability to deal with the near - term impacts of market conditions and the long - term prospects for our business .", "with those details in mind , we reported negative $ 25 million of free cash flow in the quarter .", "as i mentioned , we dealt with some challenges in the quarter related to cash collections of accounts receivable .", "as we look at the fourth quarter , we believe we have addressed those challenges , and we 'll continue to execute on opportunities for further inventory reductions .", "with that in mind , we are targeting at least $ 50 million of positive free cash flow in our upcoming fourth quarter .", "from a liquidity perspective , we ended the current quarter with total liquidity of $ 539 million , including $ 244 million of cash and $ 295 million of available borrowings under our credit facility .", "keep in mind , in the current quarter , we amended and extended our credit facility and reduced the size of our facility from $ 400 million to $ 300 million , which is reflected in the sequential change in liquidity .", "with that , i 'll move on to the next slide , slide 12 , to talk about our capital structure .", "over the years , we maintained a balanced view of capital allocation .", "and as the global pandemic emerged a little over a year ago , we quickly shifted our focus toward building liquidity , which was enabled by our strong capital allocation philosophy .", "in addition to the actions we took to reduce costs and focus on cash generation earlier this year , we took action to extend our maturity profile and add incremental cash to our balance sheet with our july 2020 notes offering .", "this extended our notes due in july 2021 to july 2028 .", "last month , in march 2021 , we executed another important step in our strategy by completing an amended and extended credit facility .", "the previous credit facility was set to expire in march 2022 .", "the new facility matures in march 2024 .", "with those actions behind us , we have no near - term maturities and have significant liquidity with opportunities to generate even more .", "as we all know , different demand recovery time lines and customer ordering patterns will continue to influence our shorter - term quarter - to - quarter mix .", "i want to share a bit more on our enthusiasm related to midterm and longer - term outlooks in the end - use markets we serve .", "let 's start with aerospace .", "during the downturn , we continue to improve our already strong position .", "most market participants and experts believe that demand will rebound to and through pre-covid - 19 levels which , if you recall , was already exhibiting constrained dynamics .", "longer term , the industry will continue to need improved fuel efficiency and emissions , driving the need for better engine materials where we are strongly positioned .", "defense will continue to experience market resiliency on key platforms that require increases in strength , customers and fatigue performance .", "longer term , we are monitoring funding patterns as governments reassess their budgets after significant covid - 19 - related spending .", "in medical , as orthopedics and dental follow the cardiology recovery , we continue to secure additional share and identify more upside , largely due to the breadth of the high - value material solutions we offer in support of the industry innovation in this space .", "longer term , we see this continuing as quicker patient recoveries and improved patient outcomes will be the key drivers .", "in transportation , with the recovery well under way in north america and china , regulations drive the near - term movement to higher efficiency powertrains , which is a positive for our portfolio of high - temperature materials .", "longer term , as electric vehicle adoption grows , it is natural they will take more and more share away from the large internal combustion engine base .", "we have a good view of the life cycle decline of those products and are balancing our focus accordingly .", "as i mentioned earlier , our new hot strip mill brings capability and capacity to support significant future electric vehicle volume growth .", "moving to energy , which experienced a significant decline in demand this past year .", "oil prices have increased by 50 % in calendar year 2021 , and we have seen limited capital expenditures released for some major projects that offer up specific opportunities .", "with that said , there will likely continue to be a supply and demand imbalance over the next couple of years .", "longer term , we expect to see continued emphasis to move away from oil to natural gas and other alternative fuel sources .", "in industrial submarkets , specifically with semiconductor and fluid control products , the relatively steady demand we experienced through the pandemic is expected to increase driven by manufacturing for 5g , internet of things connectivity and more efficient power plants that require better - performing materials .", "the consumer submarket is expected to continue its seasonal cyclicality .", "however , we 're seeing more and more applications that have tighter design envelopes that require the removal of wave interference and that make use of our materials to offer automated sensory feedback responses .", "longer term , with the proliferation of digital and data management , we expect to see more devices with more sensors requiring exponentially more connectivity .", "i 've spoken in prior quarters about our soft magnetics products and their relevance within increasing electrification trends .", "we believe this capability will well position us in the long term to capitalize on the growth in these areas .", "in the electrification space , we are participating in an increasing amount of prototype and initial low rate production initiatives that utilize our products to provide power dense propulsion in a manner that relies upon reduced mass or where there is limited space for the motor .", "and we see current drone , air taxi and other related applications becoming more and more relevant , especially where our options to extend range or boost performance are being exhausted .", "and lastly , in additive manufacturing , while we 've seen some projects cancel or delay indifferently , along with some industry consolidation , we believe the competitive space has been narrowed , thus providing a focus on the value of our quality and life cycle management platform where data and knowledge management will be vital to the success of any additive program .", "despite the challenges the pandemic has created , we have continued to strengthen our foundation for long -
