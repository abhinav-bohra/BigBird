over - year .", "also , our adjusted operating margins expanded 80 basis points year - over - year to 17 % , and this was driven by margin expansion in both our transportation and communications segments .", "i also believe that you 're going to continue to see us demonstrate our strong cash generation and truly evident of that is our year - to - date free cash flow , which was approximately $ 1 billion , which is also a company record for the first half of the fiscal year .", "with that as a little bit of a backdrop , i do want to take a moment to frame out the current market environment and our business relative to where we were just 90 days ago when we last spoke .", "in our transportation segment , consumer demand in autos continues to remain strong , and auto production is remaining stable in the range of 19 million to 20 million units per quarter globally , even with the well - documented semi shortages , and we 've also seen further strength in our commercial transportation end markets .", "second quarter sales of $ 3.7 billion were better than our expectations in each of our segments .", "they were up 17 % on a reported basis and 11 % organically year -

over - year .", "during the quarter , the segment continued to be impacted by the decline in the commercial aerospace market , with our aerospace , defense and marine business declining 21 % organically year - over - year .", "and when you think about our industrial equipment market , it was very strong and up 16 % organically , with growth in all regions and increasing strength in factory automation applications where we 're benefiting from accelerating capital expenditures in areas like semiconductor equipment as well as along the auto manufacturing supply chain .", "we continue to see weakness in our medical business in our industrial segment , and it was down 13 % organically year - over - year , and this is being driven by ongoing delays in interventional elective procedures caused by covid , and the dynamics we 're experiencing in medical are consistent with what our customers are seeing , and we expect this market to return to growth as these procedures start to increase later in the year .", "and lastly in the industrial segment , our energy business , we saw 4 % organic growth , and this was driven by increase in penetration of renewables , especially benefiting from solar applications around the world .", "from a margin perspective , in industrial solutions our margins declined year - over - year to 12.5 % , and that was really driven by the significant drop in commercial aerospace volumes .", "sales in the segment grew 29 % organically year - over - year , with strong growth in both data & devices and appliances .", "in data & devices , our sales grew 24 % organically year -
