over - year , which continues to grow at a faster pace in segment net operating income .", "as previously reported , we began our investment in the [ technical issues ] capability this quarter .", "however , due to the timing of the rollout , most of our associated start - up costs will occur in the third quarter .", "these costs primarily relate to technician hiring and parts sourcing .", "we do expect these costs to meaningfully impact connected livings profitability as we end the year .", "in addition , we expect our effective tax rate to return to a more normal level , approximately 23 % .", "looking ahead to 2022 , we expect earnings expansion to continue , but more likely at more moderated levels as we continue to invest for growth including additional implementation start - up costs for in - store service and repair .", "moving to global housing , net operating income excluding catastrophe losses was $ 81 million for the third quarter , including the $ 78 million of pre-announced catastrophe losses mainly from hurricane ida , net operating income totaled $ 3 million .", "excluding catastrophe losses , earnings decreased $ 19 million due to anticipated higher non-cat losses , which returned to levels more in line with historical averages .", "as a reminder , favorable non-cat losses in 2020 were not representative of historical trends and third quarter 2020 marked the lowest point of last year , mainly driven by loss experience within lender placed and specialty products .", "the year - over - year earnings decline was nearly all driven by unfavorable non-cat loss experience from several factors .", "the largest driver which contributed close to half of the increase was from the expected normalization of the non-cat loss ratio .", "the balance of the decline was split relatively evenly between increased reserves related to our specialty p&c offerings , primarily in our on - demand sharing economy business as well as higher claims severity .", "claims severity included moderate impacts from inflationary factors such as higher labor and material costs .", "while there is always a lag .", "if this trend continues , we would expect higher loss cost to be offset by increased rates over time .", "in multifamily housing , underlying growth was offset by increased investments to further strengthen our customer experience , including our digital first capability .", "global housing revenue decreased slightly year - over - year from lower specialty p&c revenues as well as a cat reinstatement premium resulting from hurricane ida and lower reo volumes in lender placed .", "this was partially offset by higher average insured values and premium rates in lender placed and growth in multifamily housing .", "we continue to expect global housing 's net operating income excluding cats to be flat for the full year compared to 2020 .", "for the fourth quarter and into 2022 , we would expect non-cat losses to continue to be above 2020 , but in line with year - to - date 2021 experience , which is consistent with long - term trends .", "we also continue to monitor the reo foreclosure moratoriums and any additional extensions that may be announced .", "at corporate , the net operating loss was $ 21 million , an improvement of $ 4 million compared to the third quarter of 2020 .", "this was driven by two items .", "first , lower employee - related expenses and third - party fee .", "and second , expense savings associated with reducing our real estate footprint .", "in the fourth quarter , we do anticipate a higher loss due to the timing of spend .", "for the full year 2021 , we now expect the corporate net operating loss to be approximately $ 80 million , driven by favorable year - to - date results mainly from the one - time tax and real estate joint venture benefits in the second quarter .", "this compares to our previous estimate of $ 85 million .", "as we look forward to 2022 , we would expect our net operating loss in corporate to be closer to $ 90 million , more in line with historical trends .", "turning to the holding company liquidity , including the net proceeds from the sale of preneed in august , we ended the third quarter with over $ 1.3 billion , well above our current minimum target level .", "in the third quarter , dividends from operating segments totaled $ 127 million .", "in addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses , we also had outflows from three main items , $ 323 million of share repurchases , $ 39 million in common stock dividends and $ 11 million mainly related to assurant ventures investment .", "in addition to completing our 2019 investor day objective of returning $ 1.35 billion to shareholders from 2019 through 2021 , we have also completed roughly one -
