of the significant impact of covid - 19 shutdowns on the cinema industry .", "now looking at total company quarter - over - quarter , revenue was down by about $ 105 million from q2 , roughly half of that was driven by timing of revenue under contracts , as well as lower recoveries , and roughly the other half of that was attributable to the impact from covid - 19 , which includes lower royalties from unit shipments across a variety of devices , lower sales of cinema products and services and lower revenue from box office share at dolby cinemas .", "now looking at total company year - over - year , revenue was down by about $ 55 million versus last year 's q3 , and that was predominantly attributable to covid - 19 , and similar to what i said a minute ago , lower unit shipments , lower products and services and lower dolby cinema revenue .", "the composition of q3 revenue was $ 235 million in licensing ; and $ 12 million in products and services .", "broadcast represented about 38 % of total licensing in the third quarter .", "broadcast revenues were down about 34 % year - over - year , and that was driven by lower recoveries and lower unit volume due to the pandemic , despite

lower unit volume .", "mobile represented approximately 33 % of total licensing in q3 .", "mobile was up by about 65 % over last year , due to higher recoveries and revenues from our patent programs ,

revenues from gaming due to console life cycles .", "on a sequential basis , other markets was down by about 16 % driven by lower revenue from dolby cinema and from via admin fees and those are the fees in the patent pool program that we administer .", "beyond licensing our products and services revenue was $ 11.8 million in q3 , compared to $ 23 million in q2 , and $ 30.3 million in last year

range from minus $ 6 million to minus $ 9 million .", "products and services gross margin on a non-gaap basis was minus $ 3.5 million in the third quarter for the same reasons as i just went over in the gaap discussion , and there as a reminder , our guidance for non-gaap product gross margin was minus $ 5 million to minus $ 8 million .", "operating expenses in the third quarter on a gaap basis were $ 182.9 million , compared to $ 209 million in q2 .", "operating expenses in q3 were about $ 8 million less than the low end of the range we 've guided , mostly driven by timing of certain

revenue in q4 is a range of $ 225 million to $ 255 million .", "if i compare that to last year 's q4 actual revenue of $ 299 million , the majority of the potential decline would be attributable to the economic ripple effect of the pandemic , and the remainder would largely be due to lower recoveries .", "gross margin for q4 on a gaap basis is estimated to range from 85 % to 86 % ; and non-gaap
