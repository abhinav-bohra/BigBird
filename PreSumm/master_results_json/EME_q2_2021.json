21 % over quarter two 2020 .", "our second quarter results included $ 53.8 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired , pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by emcor

8.6 million , this segment 's revenues increased 17.2 % quarter - over - quarter .", "significant increases in revenue contribution from projects within the commercial , institutional and healthcare market sectors , were the primary drivers of the period - over - period improvement .", "we continue to see strength in the telecommunications submarket sector as we experience sustained customer demand for data center projects driving the growth in commercial market sector activity within this segment .", "united states mechanical construction segment revenues of $ 958.7 million increased $ 168.2 million or 21.3 % from quarter two last year .", "revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in commercial and healthcare market sector activities .", "with respect to the commercial market sector , consistent with the growth experienced by our electrical construction segment , this segment also continues to see strong demand for data center project work , given growth in data storage and cloud computing across the country .", "in addition , the continued build out of our customers ' e-commerce supply chains has resulted in an increase in the number of fire protection project opportunities for this segment within various warehousing and distribution facilities .", "with regard to the healthcare market sector , consistent with the trends we experienced during the first quarter of this year , we are engaged in a number of projects ranging for mechanical system retrofits to complete installations in both new and existing healthcare facilities .", "second quarter revenues for emcor 's combined united states construction business of $ 1.45 billion increased $ 247.3 million or 20.6 % .", "this revenue performance represents an all - time high for our combined construction segments .", "despite this record revenue performance , we increased remaining performance obligations , which tony briefly covered , within each of these segments as a result of strong project bookings .", "united states building services quarterly revenues of $ 624.4 million increased to $ 145.5 million or 30.4 % .", "excluding acquisition revenues in this segment of $ 45.2 million , this segment 's revenues increased almost 21 % organically .", "this performance also represents a time quarterly record for this segment 's revenues .", "revenue gains within each of the divisions due to the resumption of maintenance and project activity as compared to 2020 's covid - impacted quarter augmented by incremental projects aimed at improving customers indoor air quality as well as increased building automation and controls activity were the primary drivers of this quarter 's strong revenue performance .", "emcor 's industrial services segment revenues of $ 235.2 million decreased to $ 5.9 million or 2.5 % as this segment has yet to return to pre-pandemic revenue levels due to prolonged adverse market conditions within the oil and gas and related industries .", "although still below the prior year , this 2.5 % quarter - over - quarter revenue reduction is significantly less then the more abrupt quarterly revenue declines experienced in other quarters post quarter one of 2020 .", "as tony previously indicated , we are beginning to see positive signs of demand returning as we look forward toward our turnaround planning for early 2022 .",

from last year 's quarter .", "resumption of maintenance contract activity that began during quarter one of this year strengthened in quarter two as project work that was deferred in 2020 has recommenced .", "additionally , revenues of this segment benefited from $ 14.5 million of favorable exchange rate movement during the period .", "selling , general and administrative expenses of $ 242.9 million represent 10 % of revenues and reflect an increase of $ 37.7 million from quarter two 2020 .", "adjusting for incremental expenses attributable to companies acquired , inclusive of intangible asset amortization , emcor 's organic sg&a increase was $ 33.4 million .", "as a reminder , the prior year period benefited from substantial cost reductions resulting from actions taken in response to the covid - 19 pandemic .", "a significant percentage of such actions pertain to employment costs including furloughs , headcount reductions and temporary salary reductions .", "additionally , 2020 second quarter included reduced levels of incentive compensation expense as a result of the downward recalibration of our internal forecasts driven by the uncertainty created by the pandemic .", "in contrast , the results for the second quarter of 2021 include significant included a significant growth in revenues as well as profitability forecasts , which equips emcore 's previous earnings performance records across numerous of our operating companies .", "these factors have necessitated headcount additions to support such growth as well as increased levels of quarterly incentive compensation accruals .", "just so that there is no misunderstanding , at this time last year , we were either reversing the previous quarter 's incentive accruals or accruing at significantly reduced rates .", "while at this point in 2021 , based on our performance for the first six months of the year and our projections for the remainder of the year , our incentive compensation levels are tracking more linear with our current year earnings expectations .", "in addition to these increases in employment costs , our results for the second quarter of 2021 included a $ 4.1 million provision for credit losses due to the bankruptcy filing of a customer within our u.s. industrial services segment which negatively impacted our quarterly consolidated sg&a margin by 20 basis points .", "reported operating income for the quarter of $ 133.4 million compares to an operating loss of $ 122.6 million in 2020 second quarter due to the $ 232.8 million noncash impairment charge recorded in the prior year .", "excluding 2020 's impairment charge , operating income for the current period represents a $ 23.2 million or 21.1 % improvement over last year 's adjusted non-gaap second quarter operating income of $ 110.1 million .", "for the second quarter of 2021 , operating margin represents 5.5 % of revenues and is consistent with our adjusted non-gaap operating margin in last year 's quarter .", "consistent with our quarterly revenue performance , the operating income of each of our reportable segments , other than u.s. industrial services , has increased by double - digit percentages .", "specific quarterly operating performance by reporting segment is as follows : operating income of our u.s. electrical construction services segment of $ 42.7 million for the quarter ended june 30 , 2021 , increased by $ 11.1 million from the comparable 2020 period .", "reported operating margin of 8.7 % represents a 100 basis point improvement over last year 's second quarter due to an improvement in gross profit margin given a more favorable revenue mix and continued strong project execution .", "second quarter operating income of our u.s. mechanical construction services segment of $ 79.3 million increased $ 12.3 million from the comparable 2020 period .", "reported operating margin of 8.3 % represents a slight reduction from last year 's quarter .", "our over 20 % increase in quarterly revenues was the major driver of our period - over - period operating income improvement , while the slight reduction in operating margin resulted from a modest decrease in gross profit due to the composition of work performed during each period .", "each of our electrical and mechanical construction segments established new second quarter records in terms of operating income dollars .", "our total u.s. construction business is reporting $ 122 million of operating income and an 8.4 % operating margin .", "this performance has improved by $ 23.4 million and 20 basis points from last year 's second quarter .", "operating income for u.s. building services is $ 30.3 million or 4.9 % of revenues .", "this represents a $ 3.7 million improvement quarter - over - quarter and like most of our other reporting segments represents a new second quarter record for operating income dollars .", "increased gross profit from the mechanical services and commercial site - based services divisions due to a strong resumption in demand as compared to 2020 's challenging second quarter was the primary reason for the period - over - period increase in operating income .", "the 70 basis point reduction in quarterly operating margin is due to revenue mix , which included a larger percentage of fixed - price capital projects that traditionally have a lower gross profit margin profile than the segment 's call - out service work .", "our u.s. industrial services segment operating loss of approximately $ 200,000 represents a decrease of $ 3.5 million from last year 's second quarter operating income of $ 3.3 million .", "while this segment experienced an increase in both gross profit and gross profit margin during the current quarter , its results included an increase in credit losses due to the aforementioned customer bankruptcy , which negatively impacted operating income by $ 4.1 million and operating margin of the segment by 180 basis points .", "u.k. building services operating income of $ 7 million or 5.4 % of revenues represents an improvement of $ 1.7 million with a slight reduction in operating margin over 2020 second quarter .", "approximately $ 800,000 of this period - over - period improvement is due to positive foreign exchange movement with the remainder attributable to an increase in project activity primarily within the commercial market sector .", "the decrease in quarterly operating margin is a result of an increase in the ratio of selling , general and administrative expenses to revenues in the current quarter as the prior year benefited from certain short - term cost - cutting initiatives and acute response to the covid - 19 pandemic .", "we are now on slide nine .", "additional financial items of significance for the quarter not addressed on my previous slides are as follows : quarter two gross profit of $ 376.3 million was higher than 2020 's comparable quarter by $ 61 million or 19.3 % .", "gross margin of 15.4 % is 30 basis points lower than last year 's quarter due to shifts in revenue mix in both our u.s. mechanical construction and u.s. building services segment within the quarter .", "diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 is $ 1.78 as compared to a loss per diluted share of $ 1.52 in the year ago period .", "on an adjusted basis , after adding back the impairment loss on goodwill , identifiable intangible assets and other loan of assets recorded last year , 2020 's non-gaap diluted earnings per share was $ 1.44 .", "when compared to our current year 's when compared to our current quarter 's performance , we are reporting a $ 0.34 or 23.6 % quarter - over - quarter earnings per share improvement .", "this 2021 quarterly diluted earnings per share of $ 1.78 represents a new all - time record for any quarterly period in our history despite some of the headwinds we continue to face .", "with the quarterly commentary complete , i will touch on some high - level highlights with respect to emcor 's results for the first six months of 2021 .", "revenues of $ 4.74 billion represent an increase of $ 427.9 million or 9.9 % .", "operating income of $ 250.4 million or 5.3 % of revenues represent sizable increases from both 2020 's reported and as - adjusted non-gaap six - month results .", "year - to - date diluted earnings per share was $ 3.32 .", "although not shown on this slide , and my last comment on our results for the first six - month period is with respect to our slightly negative operating cash flow as compared to 2020 strong cash flow performance during the first half of the year .", "with substantial organic revenue growth in this year 's second quarter , we have experienced an increase in working capital investment as both our accounts receivable and contract asset balances have elevated in concert with our project and service volumes .", "further , it is important to note that our cash flow for the prior year period was favorably impacted by certain government legislation passed in light of the covid - 19 pandemic , which allows for the deferral of the employer portion of social security taxes throughout the majority of 2020 and also extended the deadline for making estimated federal tax payments from the second to third quarter of last year .", "these measures , along with the united kingdom 's deferral value - added tax in the prior year , favorably impacted both our second quarter and six - month operating cash flows in 2020 by almost $ 100 million .", "my expectation for full year 2021 is that we will generate operating cash flow in excess of $ 300 million .", "emcor 's balance sheet remains strong and liquid .", "cash on hand is down from year - end 2020 , driven by cash used in financing activities of approximately $ 157 million , inclusive of $ 138 million used for the repurchase of our common stock and cash used in investing activities of approximately $ 71 million most notably due to payments for acquisitions net of cash acquired , totaling just shy of $ 56 million .", "working capital levels have increased modestly as increases in accounts receivable and contract assets resulting from our substantial organic growth during the period were offset by the decrease in our cash balance just referenced .", "the increase in goodwill is predominantly a result of the three businesses acquired during the first six months of this year .", "net identifiable intangible assets have increased slightly as the impact of additional intangible assets recognized , in connection with the previously referenced acquisitions , were largely offset by $ 31 million of amortization expense during the year - to - date period .", "total debt , exclusive of operating lease liabilities , is virtually unchanged since year - end 2020 .", "as a result of our consistent outstanding borrowings and the growth in our stockholders ' equity due to our net income for the first six months of 2021 , emcor 's debt - to - capitalization ratio has reduced to 11.7 % and from 11.9 % at the end of last year .", "emcor remains in a position of strength which allows us to continue to invest in our business , return capital to shareholders and execute against our strategic objectives , both in the near and the long term .", "i 'm going to be on pages 12 to 13 , i 'm going to talk about remaining performance obligations by segment and market sector .", "i 'll give you a top summer here .", "they 're at their highest level ever .", "we have a strong mix .", "our bookings were strong for both small and large projects .", "we have a book - to - bill , 1:12 .", "and what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to intermix comments from what would be page 13 and we talk about some of those sectors we 've been talking about into my overall rpo commentary .", "we sort of had an rpo triple play here with rpos increasing in three comparable periods .", "the year period , that 's versus 2020 -- for june 2021 , june 2020 , six - month period , 2021 june versus december ; 21 and sequentially from march 2021 .", "all five of our business segments are rpo growth for each of these measurement periods .", "but that , to be fair , we 've said this many times , this is not a quarter - to - quarter or month - to - month business , movement is not something we draw sweeping conclusions from month - to - month or quarter - to - quarter .", "but the reality is with the kind of bookings we had and the level we 're at , we feel pretty good about the forward view of our business .", "and i had a quarter one statement where i talked about the nonres market .", "and i think i talked about it also as we moved through last year , that we would n't know what the impact of that second quarter would be until we got to the second quarter .", "and i think we can now say that we expect growth in the nonresidential market .", "i would guess that growth is going to be somewhere in the mid-single digits , and we 're clearly outperforming that mid-single - digit growth .", "as mentioned , total company rpos at the end of the second quarter were just over $ 5.1 billion .", "they 're up $ 516 million or 11.2 % when compared to the year ago level of $ 4.6 billion .", "they increased $ 511 million for the first six months of the year .", "and really important to look at is the organic rpo growth , which increased $ 409 million or 8.9 % .", "and again , i talked about our book - to - bill well over one .", "our domestic construction segments had rpo growth in the quarter , $ 301 million since june 30 , 2020 , and that was both in the electrical and mechanical construction segments .", "and we 're seeing it being driven by strong overall bookings in data centers , manufacturing , industrial , water and wastewater , healthcare and logistical infrastructure work .", "we also expect strength to continue in our small project short - duration work , and a lot of that centers on commercial and manufacturing , is where we see that work .", "building services is 13 % of total rpos in the second quarter , increased $ 202 million , $ 114 million of that $ 22 million was organic .", "pre-pandemic , small project demand is active .", "there 's one other way of saying it across the country .", "and you 're also getting more value now because of the indoor air quality and air movement work that we 're doing in addition to the energy efficiency work .", "our customers are executing both types of these projects as a result of an expectation of increased energy costs , a desire to reduce their carbon footprint and a strong belief that iaq solutions will improve their employees ' productivity by approving their ease of mind and their safety .", "one of the things i 'd point out is we are one of the key problem solvers for energy efficiency work and iaq work and as you demand , more energy efficiency from your facility .", "we bring concepts from ideas and things that people think about to real projects for our owners and tenants .", "we 're uniquely positioned to help our customers reduce their carbon footprint , a key cost reduction goals and have better and cleaner buildings .", "every time we service repair or replacement an hvac unit or install or service a newer or updated building control systems , and this is exactly what mark told you we were growing in building services , we are making facilities , healthcare facilities , factories and office buildings , less carbon intense and more efficient .", "the other thing we 're seeing is the combination of these energy savings projects with more on - site generation .", "whether it be renewable generation like solar or combined heat and power , which takes waste heat and turns it into either hvac or power generation .", "it is important to note that most of our industrial service segment field services work would not be in rpos as it is executed via time and material contracts .", "and in that case , we 're seeing strong demand for us to schedule for people as we go from the back half of this year into next year .", "what we 're seeing across the rpos is we 're winning at a rate that we believe is much faster than the underlying nonresidential market growth and then we have durability to move within these sectors and flexibility and that will continue to benefit us as we move through the remainder of 2021 and into 2022 .", "with that , i 'm now going to wrap up on pages 15 and 16 .", "as we assess our performance at the half , we are performing very well across our business .", "and as a result of that performance through the first half we will be raising our earnings and revenue guidance for 2021 .", "we will raise our revenue guidance to $ 9.5 billion in revenues , which exceeds our previous range of $ 9.2 billion to $ 9.4 billion in revenues .", "we will raise our earnings per diluted share guidance from $ 6.35 to $ 6.75 to a new range of $ 6.65 and to $ 7.05 .", "previously , we had told you that we would know more at the conclusion of the second quarter .", "and with greater visibility that we now have , we can raise our guidance .", "for us to achieve the middle to the top end of that guidance range , a large percentage of the following must happen .", "i think most of you know , i 'd like to talk about what we control and what we do n't control .", "we like to focus on the things we do n't control and prepare contingency plans for those things that we do n't control .", "so we focus on the things we control and have contingency plans for the things we do n't control .", "well , we like to think we control our costs .", "and we 're known for keeping our costs in check , whether that be direct and indirect labor costs , material costs , we 're pretty good at this .", "and it 's been an operating fundamental here at emcore for a long time .", "we need to continue to have success in navigating the supply chain challenge with respect to pricing and availability .", "i talked about that earlier in my opening commentary , it 's a challenge .", "i mean i 've listened to a bunch of calls , you listen to more calls .", "we 're positioned well to navigate it .", "we think we 'll continue navigating a well , but it is a challenge .", "we also need to continue to be able to find the right labor at the right time .", "we 've always been very successful with that .", "it 's a question you all asked .", "i 'll answer it for you now .", "we expect to continue to be successful with that .", "we will always struggle to find hvac technicians in the summer like everybody else .", "and our route technicians and our operating engineers , we always are looking for because we 're growing that business pretty healthily right now .", "and so those are the two areas we always look for people , but we have great labor relations at the local level , and we expect to be able to man our construction projects with the right people at the right time and the right skill mix .", "we are an employer of choice .", "we expect the booking momentum to continue , especially with respect to quick term project work .", "and for us , that means projects really less than $ 2.5 million or so .", "it 's very strong right now .", "we expect that to continue .", "and that 's what gives us conviction to talk about the underlying strength in the market overall .", "i 'm humble enough that our team is home enough to know that there 's a whole bunch of things we do n't consume .", "we do n't control whether the nonresidential market will continue to be strong .", "we expect it to be .", "but if it 's not , we will react and have a contingency plan to adapt to that .", "we do n't control what will happen in industrial services .", "we know what we see with respect to what people want us to do .", "but we 've been doing this long enough to know that , that can change .", "and look , we 're a little shy about being overly optimistic as what weather has done to us in the gulf coast over the last three years .", "we do n't expect any major covid disruptions in our business or our geographies .", "i do expect that there will be increased demand from our customers for us to supply vaccinated people , and we are advocating that strongly in our business and for our employees , safety is one of our key corporate values .", "and we think keeping our employees safe and asking them to be vaccinated .", "we 've had pretty good success .", "we need to have better success .", "we also do n't think the supply chain issues as of today will be more pronounced than they are .", "they could be , but we do expect them to last for the balance of the year .", "and clearly , we do n't control everything that goes on with the supply chain .", "as far as capital allocation , we spent nearly $ 57 million on acquisitions year - to - date .", "they were right down the pipe are the kind of things that we like to do .", "we returned $ 138 million year - to - date on share repurchases , and mark talked about .", "and we 've also returned $ 14.2 million in dividends back to our shareholders .", "we expect to continue to be balanced capital allocators as the year progresses , and we have a decent pipeline of acquisitions that we are working on .", "i will tell you unequivocally right now that one of the strengths of our company is our balance sheet .", "our customers look to that balance sheet .", "it 's one of the reasons we can grow as fast as we can organically .", "and it 's one of the reasons we 've had so much success on a lot of the quick - term work in these large data center projects and healthcare projects because people know that we will have the working capital and the
