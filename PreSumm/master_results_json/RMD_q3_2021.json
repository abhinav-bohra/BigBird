response relationship from cpap therapy , the data are also unequivocal .", "in 2019 , a study was published in the journal of clinical sleep medicine showing a quantified dose - response relationship from cpap therapy .", "so for every additional hour of positive airway pressure use , there was an 8 % decrease in hospital inpatient visits and a 4 % decrease in overall physician visits .", "in other words , treating sleep apnea with our cpap therapy not only improves lives , it also saves money for the healthcare system by lowering total healthcare utilization costs .", "during the quarter , we saw the publication of a draft technology assessment from the agency for healthcare research and quality , or ahrq , here in the u.s. market .", "ahrq sort input and resmed - filed public comments , along with comments from many physician groups , sleep apnea patient advocates , provider groups , and beyond .", "i wo n't repeat all the details of those public comments , but i will say this , we presented peer - reviewed and published data showing that cpap therapy improves quality of life , reduces healthcare costs , and even reduces mortality .", "in short , these data prove that in partnership with our physician and provider colleagues in the market , we are saving lives and saving money for the healthcare system through our medical technology .", "we have peer - reviewed and published data showing that a reduction in incidence of heart attack , a reduction in hypertension , as well as a reduction in the incidence of solid cell cancer tumors .", "all of these are logical sequelae of the elimination of hypoxia that is associated with cpap therapy in treated sleep apnea patients .", "just last month , nice made public their 2021 draft guidelines that recommend that cpap therapy , along with telemonitoring , is the frontline treatment option for patients with mild osa .", "that would be an expansion of coverage in the u.k. and also an expansion of the use of digital health technology in that market .", "similarly , the ministries of health in france , germany , and japan have seen the value of digital health in sleep apnea therapy and have begun investing reimbursement funds in this space .", "it 's great to see this expansion of coverage for sleep apnea therapy and digital health around the world as governments see improvement in outcomes and reductions in total healthcare system costs with this technology .", "while we respect the work of ahrq , we , along with many other academic research - focused institutes and practicing physician groups , believe that they bypassed a generation of data in real - world evidence that needs to be taken into account , along with their own select group of rcts in the draft report .", "we are optimistic that the final report when issued will reflect the preponderance of real - world evidence and broader rcts , showing both the clinical and economic benefits of treating sleep apnea with positive airway pressure .", "let me now update you on our top - three resmed strategic priorities .", "these are , one , to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea , copd , and asthma businesses ; two , to design , develop and deliver world - leading medical devices , as well as globally scalable digital health solutions ; and three , to innovate and grow the world 's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and preferably , in a person 's home .", "in our core market of sleep apnea , we continue to see sequential improvement in new patient diagnosis trends as we seek to provide solutions for the 936 million people worldwide who suffocate every night .", "was impacted by the typical seasonality that we see in the march quarter , primarily as a result of insurance deductibles resetting at the start of each calendar year .", "this seasonal impact affects devices more than mass systems , given the incremental cost of diagnosis and the relative price points of the two categories .", "we expect sequential growth in sleep and respiratory care as we move past this typical seasonality .", "new patient flow during the quarter was impacted by the recent covid - related case surges in select countries in asia and europe , including two large markets , france and germany .", "we see that impact the number of patients going for clinic - based diagnosis pathways in these affected countries .", "we expect to see these markets reopen , along with hospitals , as vaccines continue to roll out and as we see further scaling of the remote home - based diagnostic capacity .", "clearly , the kinetics of opening of these economies and the rate of vaccination rollout are beyond our control .", "however , we can control our investments in digital solutions for our physician and provider partners , which we are doing at increasing velocity and with scalable systems and processes .", "more broadly , we are seeing growth in total sleep -- total new sleep apnea , copd , and asthma patient flow .", "and we expect to see this improve over time in our portfolio of 140 country markets each quarter .", "importantly , our market - leading share position has remained stable across both masks and devices , and we 're excited about our future pipeline .", "we rarely talk about our future pipeline as those who followed us for a period of time know .", "but today , i would like to open up the curtain just a little bit on our next - generation sleep apnea platform .", "regulatory filings that we made for our next - generation flow generator platform called the airsense 11 .", "clearly , there are multiple steps in the process to bring this new platform to global markets and these public regulatory filings are simply one important step , but we are making good progress .", "earlier this month , we started a limited controlled product launch of the airsense 11 in certain parts of the united states .", "and then to country markets worldwide in sequence after that .", "for now , i can say that as a personal user of our cpap therapy , i have firsthand knowledge that the airsense 11 device will benefit patients and their bed partners .", "and our early data show that the device and software platform combination will benefit physicians , providers , payers , and beyond , and ultimately continue to catalyze resmed 's global leadership in digital health solutions for sleep apnea and then also accelerate our success in digital health solutions for copd , asthma , and other key chronic diseases .", "we make the smallest , quietest , smartest , and the most comfortable devices on the market .", "importantly , they are all cloud connectable with the latest and greatest digital health technology to increase adherence , improve clinical outcomes , and deliver proven cost reductions within our customers ' own healthcare systems .", "let me turn now to a discussion of our respiratory care business , focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million copd , or chronic constructive pulmonary disease , patients and the 340 million asthma patients worldwide .", "our goal is to reach more patients with our core respiratory care solutions , including both noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation , as well as newer therapeutic areas , such as cloud - connected pharmaceutical drug delivery devices and high - flow therapy devices .", "our respiratory care business benefited in the march 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilated devices and ventilation mask solutions to meet growing demand worldwide as a result of the pandemic .", "during the march 2021 quarter , covid - related ventilator sales were not material to the global business .", "however , we are seeing some demand in select countries affected by these latest covid surges , such as just this month with the surge in india .", "we 're getting many thousands of devices to those in need .", "the demand is there in that country .", "but as in q3 , we do not expect the revenue to be material to our global business , even though the broader impact , particularly with preservation in life in these countries is clearly priceless and incredibly important to not only our local team in india but to all of us here at resmed worldwide .", "demand for our core noninvasive ventilator and life support ventilator solutions for copd and other respiratory insufficiency are experiencing the same steady recovery in new patient flow as in sleep apnea .", "we are balancing the growth in patient demand there with the supply of ventilators that we made to the market throughout 2020 as customers balance their inventory and their core ongoing patient needs .", "we continue to see rapid adoption of the airview for ventilation software solution that we launched in europe in the midst of the pandemic this time a year ago .", "we are now seeing that this technology has expanded to regions around the world .", "the value being provided through this cloud - based software solution has been fruitful not only during the covid pandemic and the peak part of the crisis , but it 's also valuable on an ongoing - value basis for physicians , as well as the healthcare systems they operate in .", "we are hoping to ensure that digital health is now the new standard of care for respiratory care .", "let me now review our software -
