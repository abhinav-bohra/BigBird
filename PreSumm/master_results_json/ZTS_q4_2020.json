european union and several other markets , and solensia 's authorization for cats in switzerland .", "we also continue to build on our vaccine portfolio in livestock with the approval of our circomax myco swine vaccine in the european union .", "meanwhile , in diagnostics , we successfully launched vetscan imagyst , a breakthrough platform using cloud based artificial intelligence for veterinary clinics .", "we were able to do all this while staying anchored to our purpose and advancing the five long - term priorities , that i set out at the beginning of the year , including sustainability , where we made important progress in our esg programs and metric reporting .", "we look forward to sharing our long - term esg goals in the coming weeks .", "and finally , we delivered financial results for 2020 that were in line with the guidance we provided last february , before the impact of the global pandemic was known .", "for the full year , we generated 9 % operational growth in revenue primarily based on new products in our companion animal business , the continued strength of our key dermatology portfolio and growth in china .", "and as part of our long - term value

confidence in our growth drivers and strong momentum for 2021 .", "we expect to continue growing revenues faster than the market in 2021 , driven by ongoing strength in petcare , continued expansion

normalize and people eventually return to the workplace .", "the specialty care regimens and chronic care treatments that began in the pandemic should continue , and our innovative portfolio across dermatology , parasiticide , pain , vaccines and diagnostics have us well positioned for continued growth and capturing share as these shifts occur .", "in terms of livestock market , we expect low single digit market growth in 2021 as the impact from covid - 19 will still be felt , and a number of products experience loss of exclusivity .", "we expect zoetis to grow in line with the market even as we faced increased headwinds from generic competition for draxxin , our leading anti-infective product .", "we are confident we can leverage our lifecycle innovation strategies together with the

2021 , and advancing the regulatory process in the u.s. and other markets .", "while we remain confident in the eventual u.s. approval of these products based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted , at this point , we believe it is unlikely we will receive approvals for solensia or librela in the u.s. in 2021 .", "we continue to work through regulatory reviews and manufacturing

from acquisitions , with other in - line products flat for the year .", "we again saw broad - based revenue growth with the u.s. growing 11 % and international growing 7 % operationally .", "the innovation we brought to the market and the diversity of our portfolio was key to our strong performance , as companion animal grew 17 % while livestock was flat on a year - over - year basis .",

modest growth in 2021 as the recovery from african swine fever in china continues and consumption patterns normalize .", "operational growth and adjusted net income of 10 % were driven mainly by

contributions to revenue with reference lab expansion and double - digit growth in consumables and instrument revenue .", "the recovery in wellness visits continued to be a catalyst for growth following the slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year .", "as we noted on our previous earnings call , the early fall cattle run pulled a portion of fourth quarter sales into the third quarter , leading to a weaker quarter in cattle than we would typically expect .", "this was the primary driver of the 5 % operational decline in livestock for the fourth quarter .", "for the remainder of the livestock portfolio , swine posted a second consecutive quarter of growth with the herd rebuild continuing key accounts , as the market recovers from african swine fever in china

point - of - care instruments and consumables .", "u.s. livestock declined 15 % in the quarter driven primarily by cattle , which had a portion of q4 sales pulled into the third quarter as a result of the earlier movement from pasture to feedlot .", "the remaining species declined as well with covid - 19 and pricing pressure negatively impacting our swine business .", "poultry declines are largely

expense .", "this was partially offset by favorable product mix and price increases .", "adjusted operating expenses increased 10 % operationally , resulting from increased advertising and promotion expense for simparica trio and apoquel , partially offset by t&e savings .", "return on investment from our dtc campaigns has been very favorable and we remain -- and will remain an important investment to support future growth of the business .", "the adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.5 % , a decrease of 70 basis points , driven by the impact of net discrete tax benefits

simparica trio sales .", "we believe market dynamics for companion animal will remain strong in 2021 allowing for further expansion of our key dermatology products as well as our diagnostics offerings , which we anticipate will grow faster than the overall animal health market .", "while we expect the pace of certain trends that accelerate in 2020 to moderate , such as increased spend per visit , our view is that 2020 has a status [ phonetic ] of the higher base for future growth .", "we anticipate livestock will return to global growth in 2021 , primarily driven by more normalized food consumption patterns .", "geographically , we expect total company sales growth to be relatively balanced between our u.s. and international segments .", "however , we do expect continued and meaningful growth in china and other emerging markets .", "i 'd like to touch upon the key assumptions that underpin our expectations for revenue growth .", "beginning with dermatology , our guidance does not assume a meaningful competitive entrant in 2021 and with continued investment behind the franchise , we believe revenue will exceed $ 1 billion for the full year .", "we also do not assume a triple combination product will launch in the u.s. in 2021 to compete against simparica trio .", "we 're extremely excited about our monoclonal antibodies for pain with both librela and solensia having long term blockbuster potential .", "however , as kristin mentioned , while both products will launch in the first half of 2021 in the eu and other international markets , we do not currently

supporting primary drivers of revenue growth , including recent and future product launches , key brands and recent acquisitions and reference lab expansion in diagnostics .", "adjusted r&d expense for 2021 is expected to be between $ 500 million and $ 520 million as we remain committed to investing in pipeline opportunities for new therapies and lifecycle innovation .", "adjusted interest and other income deductions is expected to be approximately $ 260 million with the increase over 2020 driven by increased interest expense as well as lower interest income .", "our adjusted effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be approximately 20 % .", "the increase in 2021 is primarily related to the impact of favorable non-recurring discrete items that occurred in 2020 .", "adjusted net income is expected to be in a range of $ 2.08 billion to $ 2.13 billion , representing operational growth of 9 % to 12 % .", "our guidance reflects our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue , during a year when we 'll be making meaningful investments to support future growth .", "consistent with 2020 , we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures in 2021 to support investments in manufacturing , focused on internal sourcing of api , capacity increases and facilities to support pipeline opportunities

to be in the range of $ 4.36 to $ 4.46 , and reported diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $ 4.02 to $ 4.14 .", "while guidance represents full year expectations , we do anticipate growth will be more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year .", "this is largely due to full year simparica trio sales and a favorable comparison versus q2 2020 as a result of covid - 19 .", "to summarize , 2020 was another exceptional year in which we delivered 9 % operational revenue growth and 10 % operational growth in adjusted net income .", "in the year that presented a unique set of challenges .", "our guidance for 2021 highlights our ability to grow revenue organically above the market and grow adjusted net income faster than revenue , even during times of elevated investment
