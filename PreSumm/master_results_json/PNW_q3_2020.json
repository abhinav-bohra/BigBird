customer programs .", "we relied heavily on our base load and fast ramping assets including four corners , ocotillo and palo verde , and those assets were ready when we needed them .", "our fossil fleets equivalent availability factor which is the percentage of time that a fossil generation unit is available and ready to perform when called upon was 95.3 % from june through september .", "and palo verde generating station capacity factor for the same timeframe was 100.2 % .", "not only were our generation plants there when we needed them , our customers were as well .", "out of an abundance of caution and to better prepare for potential unforeseen events , on august 18th and the 19th , we asked our customers to voluntarily conserve energy during peak hours .", "it came as no surprise to me that our customers were an amazing partner .", "their response reduced peak demand on august 18th by approximately 240mw , creating a meaningful reduction on a day when the entire western grid was challenged .", "in addition to successfully navigating the capacity shortfalls that were created by the heat , we also used our careful planning in close coordination with the forest service and first responders to mitigate the potential impact from wildfires this season .", "to reduce fire risk , our teams performed vegetation management activities , we held wildfire prevention training and we continue to expand our clearance around poles program , and it was an incredibly active wildfire season with over 900,000 acres burned to - date compared to an average over the last five years of 250,000 acres .", "despite the above average wildfire activity , we actually experienced minimal impact to our assets , and i think that was due in part to our effective planning and risk management program .", "despite a worldwide pandemic , a record hot summer , regional capacity shortage and wildfires , our team continues to focus on how to make lasting impacts that benefit our customers , our shareholders and the company .", "palo verde consistently provides examples of this type of continuous improvement and forward thinking , as a recent example , steve is a palo verde procurement engineer challenged our traditional procurement process and conducted a cost analysis in engineering evaluation for a micro switch replacement .", "the technical evaluation allowed palo verde to purchase commercial grade switches at approximately 7 times lower than the alternative .", "over the next three years alone , this change is expected to save the company $ 2.5 million .",

testimony on november 6 and staff and intervenors will file surrebuttal testimony on november 20 .", "the hearing is scheduled to begin on december 14 and i expect it to continue into 2021 .", "while testimony is certainly an important part of the process and it does provide visibility in each party 's priorities , we 're still very early in the case and we expect that many of the issues will certainly be discussed further as the case progresses .", "i do want to note that yesterday the commission voted on several amendments to a proposed energy rules package .", "the amendments include new carbon reduction standard of 100 % by 2050 with interim targets of 50 % by 2032 and 75 % by 2040 .", "the reductions are based on a 2016 to 2018 carbon emissions level benchmark .", "the amendments also require electric utilities to install energy storage systems with the capacity equal to 5 % of each utilities 2020 peak demand by 2035 .", "and 40 % of the required energy storage must be customer owned or customer leased distributed storage .", "another approved amendment modifies the resource planning process including requirements for the acc to approve utilities load forecast and resource plan and for utility to perform an all sorts requests for information to guide its resource planning .", "earlier this month , the commission also voted on another amendment to establish a new energy efficiency standard .", "the standard requires electric utilities to implement demand side management resources equivalent to 35 % of their 2020 peak load by 2030 .", "eligible demand side management resources include energy efficiency , demand response and load shifting , and just importantly the commission must vote and i expect they will vote soon to approve a final energy rules package before any of these amendments can take effect .", "as we look to wrap up 2020 , we will continue to work with the commission on implementing a clean energy transition for the benefit of their constituents and for our customers .", "recall that we 've spent an aspirational goal of 100 % carbon free by 2050 and 65 % clean by 2030 .", "to do so we 'll require a strong regulatory partnership

month .", "the above average temperatures this quarter added $ 0.26 to earnings year - over - year .", "for the nine months ended september 30 , 2020 , weather added $ 91 million of pre-tax gross

see a reduction in weather normalized commercial and industrial sales of 5 % , offset by an increase in weather normalized residential sales of 6 % during this period .", "the strength and speed of our return for positive growth numbers reflects the continued expansion of our local economy , following the full covid closure period earlier this year .", "further evidence of our recovery can be seen in the increased number of single - family building permits and commercial construction activity .", "in 2020 , we expect a total of 32,000 housing permits , an increase of about 1,200 compared to last year and the highest number since 2006 .", "the labor market in arizona has also started to gradually recover from the pandemic impacts as well .", "for 2020 through the end of august the

4.95 per share to $ 4.95 to $ 5.15 per share .", "the weather benefit has more than offset the additional costs and the reduction in sales due to covid - 19 .", "we are also increasing our 2020 weather normalized year - over - year sales growth expectations to be between zero and 1 % .", "in light of the weather benefit , we have accelerated the timing of near term o&m initiatives .", "for example , we 're pulling forward some spend in 2020 that was previously anticipated for future years , particularly around project work and customer experience initiatives as well as one time opportunities , like our $ 10 million contribution to the aps foundation , which supports our community non-profits .", "our revised 2020 o&m guidance range of $ 870 million to $ 890 million reflects these items .", "while we believe this increase in o&m demonstrates prudent , planning and flexibility through this challenging year , we do remain focused on our lean initiatives and continue to see our core o&m trend down .", "we are executing our plan to reduce 2020 o&m expense by $ 20 million , including $ 10 million through improved procurement and contract management activities , and another $ 10 million in several small operating efficiencies across the enterprise .", "we also continue to partner with arizona state university to train our workforce on lean skills and are excited about the long - term potential in continuing to streamline our business .", "while we do n't enter a year counting on whether it would be a driver , we do enter the year prepared to take advantage of above normal weather when it makes sense to do so .", "this can help us mitigate the impacts of mild weather in future years , while also enabling our investment in certain key initiatives that improve customer experience , a focus area for our company .", "our resource planning and capital expenditure forecast have also been revised .", "the delay in our clean energy procurement impacted by the mcmicken investigation , slightly reduced our 2020 capital expenditure forecast by $ 68 million .", "however , we do remain committed to our clean energy commitments that have made progress with our resource acquisition activities .", "in september , we executed a 200 megawatt wind ppa with a 20 - year term .", "this is a repower of an existing wind facility and is expected to be fully upgraded with additional capacity in 2021 .", "we also plan to issue two new rfps .", "one outsourced rfp and an additional utility owned energy storage rfp at our existing solar facilities .", "while it was
