from - home options and store brands .", "let 's take a closer look at these trends , starting with the population changes .", "millennial and gen z consumers are a large and growing cohort .", "these consumers are starting to settle down , buy homes and start families .", "as we presented in the past , when people enter the family formation phase , they increase the amount of food they eat at home with an outsized increase in the consumption of frozen foods .", "and what we find particularly important about reaching millennial and gen z consumers is that we believe they will remain more value focused than their predecessors .", "first , let 's talk about the near term .", "as you can see in the chart on the left , millennial and gen z consumers are earlier in their careers and earning less than the older generations of working - age people .", "this is natural , but it bodes well for food - at - home trends in the shorter term .", "we believe that even as foodservice bounces back , younger consumers will be value conscious in their food choices .", "fewer younger consumers are expected to achieve the financial success of the generations before them .", "the data on the right suggests that millennials are more likely to earn less than their parents .", "we believe this means that these savvy consumers will look to stretch their food dollars further even as they age .", "the data also shows that younger consumers are already eating more at home .", "compared to the population as a whole , gen z and millennials have decreased restaurant visits more and sourced a larger percentage of their meals at home .", "as these younger consumers have made the shift to at - home eating , the data shows that they 're finding comfort in the quality , reliability and familiarity that national brands provide .", "we believe this makes a lot of sense .", "national brands provide value while replicating many of the on - trend flavors and modern food attributes that consumers are used to experiencing in away - from - home dining .", "when consumers make trades like away - from - home to in - home eating , trust is paramount .", "in short , national brands , particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio , deliver on this trust imperative and that 's because they offer superior relative value versus other food options .", "as consumers seek to stretch their household balance sheets in the face of broad - based inflation , one of the single largest levers available to them is the reduction in spending on food away from home as food - away - from - home prices are typically over three and a half times more expensive than food - at - home prices .", "this trade will likely become even more important for consumers as food - away - from - home prices have already increased faster than at - home prices in calendar 2021 and they are expected to increase at nearly twice the rate as at - home prices in calendar year 2022 .", "our aggressive modernization of the conagra portfolio over the past several years has put us in a strong position to capitalize on these structural shifts .", "our portfolio has shown its competitive advantage with excellent trial , depth of repeat and share gain performance .", "overall , we believe conagra is well positioned to leverage these shifts to create meaningful value for shareholders .", "and slide 25 shows you the data to support our claim .", "conagra is attracting more younger consumers than our peers and getting them to repeat at more attractive rates .", "by appealing to younger consumers now , we 're building superior consumer lifetime value .", "importantly , the data shows that these new , younger buyers are stickier across our portfolio .", "we believe this comes back to the investments we 've made and continue to make in our products and our brands .", "the conagra way has positioned us to win .", "as i discussed earlier , we 're reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of approximately $ 2.50 for the full year with a few updates on how we expect to get there .", "we 're increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 3 % , up from approximately 1 % .", "we 're slightly adjusting our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15 and a half percent , down from approximately 16 % .", "and we 're updating our gross inflation guidance to about 14 % , up from approximately 11 % .", "i 'll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on slide 28 .", "as sean mentioned earlier , there were a number of factors that influenced our results this quarter .", "first , we were encouraged to see that consumer demand for our products remain strong .", "and second , elasticities were better than anticipated .", "however , we also continued to see inflation rise across a number of key inputs and the dynamic macro environment created challenging conditions for the supply chain .", "the team remained agile in response to these dynamics , including the decision to make additional investments during the quarter to meet the elevated demand and maximize the food supply to our consumers .", "overall , our actions favorably impacted our top line during the quarter with organic net sales up 2.6 % compared to the year ago period .", "an important part of the top line success we 've realized throughout the pandemic is our ongoing commitment to the conagra way .", "we 've remained focused on building and maintaining strong brands across the portfolio .", "we continued these efforts in the second quarter with continued product innovation and by further increasing our spending on advertising and promotion , primarily focusing on e-commerce investments .", "we show a breakdown of our net sales on slide 29 .", "the 4.2 % decline in volume was primarily due to the lapping of the prior - year surge in demand during an earlier stage in the covid - 19 pandemic as volume increased approximately 1 % on a two - year cagr .", "the second quarter volume decline was more than offset by the very favorable impact of brand mix and inflation - driven pricing actions we realized this quarter , driving an overall organic net sales growth of 2.6 % .", "on last quarter 's call , we noted that the domestic retail pricing actions were just starting to be reflected on shelves at the end of the first quarter .", "those increases were reflected in our p&l this quarter , driving the 6.8 % increase in price mix .", "the divestitures of our h.k. anderson business , the peter pan peanut butter business and the egg beaters business resulted in a 70 - basis - point decline and foreign exchange drove a 20 - basis - point benefit .", "together , all these factors contributed to a 2.1 % increase in total conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago .", "slide 30 shows our net sales summary by segment both on a year - over - year and on a two - year compounded basis .", "as you can see , we continue to deliver strong two - year compounded net sales growth in each of our three retail segments , which resulted in a two - year compounded organic net sales growth of 5.3 % for the total company .", "you can see the puts and takes of our operating margin on slide 31 .", "we drove a 6.2 percentage point benefit from improved price mix , supply chain - realized productivity , cost synergies associated with the pinnacle foods acquisition and lower pandemic - related expenses .", "netted within the 6.2 % are the additional investments we made to service orders and maximize product availability .", "these investments reflect the dynamic environment and actions we 've taken to respond to it .", "this includes decisions to utilize more third - party transportation and warehousing vendors for some of our frozen products , incurring incremental cost to move product around our distribution network to better align with customer order patterns and delaying a plant consolidation productivity program to maximize current production .", "the 6.2 % also includes transitory supply chain costs such as higher inventory write - offs and increased overtime to support operations .", "the 6.2 percentage point benefit was more than offset by an inflation headwind of 11 percentage points .", "the second quarter gross inflation rate of 16.4 % of cost of goods sold was approximately 100 basis points or $ 20 million higher than expected , driven by higher - than - anticipated increases in proteins and transportation , which are both difficult to hedge .", "the combination of the favorable margin levers , our choiceful supply chain investments and inflation headwinds resulted in adjusted gross margin declining by 483 basis points .", "our operating margin was further impacted by 20 basis points due to our increased a&p investment during the quarter , as i mentioned earlier .", "you can see how these elevated costs impacted each of our reporting segments on slide 32 .", "while each segment was impacted , our refrigerated & frozen segment was impacted the most with adjusted operating margin down 707 basis points primarily due to outsized materials inflation and the additional investment incurred to service orders and get food delivered to consumers .", "we are confident that we will improve overall operating margins in the second half as we execute our additional pricing actions to offset the higher inflation rates .", "as you can see on slide 33 , our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $ 0.64 was heavily impacted by the input cost inflation across our portfolio .", "even though the benefits of our first quarter pricing flowed through the p&l this quarter , the incremental inflation we incurred in the second quarter created an additional headwind .", "in response , we announced additional pricing to customers in early q3 during december .", "although we have yet another lag before this pricing benefits the p&l , we expect to realize benefits from these pricing actions in late q3 with most of the impact in q4 .", "also , our ardent mills joint venture had another good quarter and delivered earnings per share benefit versus the prior year .", "we realized lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases in prior quarters .", "i want to unpack how q2 adjusted earnings per share landed versus our expectations .", "our second quarter adjusted earnings per share came in lower than we originally had anticipated due to two main factors .", "first , as previously mentioned , inflation came in higher by approximately 100 basis points of cost of goods sold or approximately $ 0.02 to $ 0.03 of eps .", "while we have announced additional pricing actions for the second half to offset the incremental inflation , the timing of these benefits is naturally lagging behind the higher inflation .", "second , the cost we elected to incur to service orders , coupled with the additional transitory supply chain costs i described earlier , led to another $ 0.02 to $ 0.03 impact on our adjusted eps .", "we are forecasting these service and transitory cost dynamics to improve as the second half progresses .", "looking at slide 35 , we ended the quarter with a net debt -
