related and staff - related flight cancellations in january , resulting in a $ 50 million negative impact to operating revenues .", "we expect the omicron - related negative revenue impact to january and february combined to be roughly $ 330 million .", "we expect first quarter managed business revenues to be down 45 to 55 % versus 2019 , and improve sequentially from january through march .", "when you put all these moving parts together , that gets us to our first quarter operating revenue guidance of down 10 to 15 % versus first quarter 2019 .", "the result of this exercise , combined with the flight cancellations we have experienced so far this month , is a three - point reduction in first quarter 2022 capacity from down 6 % to down 9 % compared with the first quarter 2019 .", "and for full year 2022 , as tammy mentioned , it 's a four - point reduction from roughly flat to down 4 % compared with the full year 2019 .", "as of march 2022 , we are roughly 75 % restored based on trips , and we continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our route network by the end of 2023 .", "and our on - time performance for that period was 87 % , and that was better than our five - year average .", "so , we ran a similar play over the christmas holiday , and our daily trips there increased to roughly 3,600 a day .", "and because we had those people to pitch in to pick up extra shifts during that week of christmas , we had a completion factor of 99.2 % , and we had less than 1 % of our flights canceled in the face of that covid surge .", "all told , we ended up the fourth quarter with an on - time performance of 72.6 % , mainly due to some of the challenges we faced in october .", "and we had roughly 5,000 employees become sick in the first three weeks of january .", "and that week , we canceled roughly 3,800 flights .", "about 1,900 of those were for weather , and about 1,600 of those were for staffing .", "and then our on -
