than - anticipated incentive compensation .", "within our domestic segment , our sg&a dollars increased $ 139 million .", "the largest drivers were : one , advertising , which included campaigns for both holiday and to drive awareness for our new membership offering .", "three , increased store and call center labor that helped drive the record customer satisfaction scores corie shared .", "and four , best buy health , which includes the impact associated with our acquisition .", "before i discuss the fiscal ' 23 financial outlook , let me spend some time on our new totaltech membership program .", "totaltech is a near - term investment to drive long - term value .", "the thesis is that over time , we will capture incremental product sales from our members that will lead to higher operating income , but as we discussed in prior earnings calls , it does come with near - term profitability impacts .", "first , at $ 199 , the stand - alone membership is profitable .", "it just is n't as profitable as legacy service memberships due to the breadth of benefits and the cost to fulfill them .", "second , there 's a loss of revenue and profit from existing revenue streams that are now included as benefits in the program .", "for example , previously stand - alone services like extended warranties and products installations are now included within our totaltech membership .", "we still offer these services on a stand - alone basis or to nonmembers , but you can imagine there 's an aspect of cannibalization as members are no longer paying incrementally for these items .", "so what does all this mean ?", "we expect that the gross profit rate of our services category will reset to a new level going forward that is lower than it was prior to launching totaltech .", "the way to drive more operating income despite these lower services gross profit rate is to add far more members than we thought was possible under our previous membership offerings .", "the key to increased profit will be through increased volume through a combination of more recurring membership revenue and incremental product purchases of our members .", "the number of memberships grew very nicely in q4 , and our plans for fiscal ' 23 assume continued growth .", "but it will take some time to reach the scale necessary to offset the lower gross profit rate i just described .", "therefore , totaltech remains a pressure in fiscal ' 23 but we expect it to be a meaningful driver of both higher sales and operating income dollars in fiscal ' 25 targets .", "now , let 's talk about our overall fiscal ' 23 outlook .", "our guide is anchored around a comparable sales decline in the range of 1 % to 4 % and a 5.4 % non-gaap operating income rate .", "our non-gaap diluted earnings per share outlook is $ 8.85 to $ 9.15 .", "before we discuss the broader assumptions driving our guide , i want to touch on our expected tax rate .", "our non-gaap effective tax rate is planned at a more normalized level of 24.5 % in fiscal ' 23 compared to 19 % rate in fiscal ' 22 .", "as you may recall , our q2 results this past year included a $ 0.47 diluted earnings per share benefit from the resolution of certain discrete matters .", "now , i would like to share a few important assumptions underpinning our guidance .", "first , we anticipate the traditional ce industry to decline in the low to mid-single digits next year as we lap the high levels of growth in stimulus actions from this past year .", "in addition , we anticipate the number of store closures to be in the range of 20 to 30 , which is consistent with the trend over the past five years .", "as i mentioned , our fiscal ' 23 guidance assumes non-gaap operating income rate of approximately 5.4 % compared to 6 % in fiscal ' 22 .", "to be clear , the biggest driver of the lower operating income rate in fiscal ' 23 is our investment in totaltech .", "as i just described , this near - term pressure will drive long - term value for our shareholders .", "there are , of course , other factors that we expect to impact our results that for the most part offset each other in fiscal ' 23 .", "we do expect higher levels of promotional activity to pressure our gross profit rate , which is partially offset by the favorable impact of expected growth and our monetization of our advertising business or best buy ads .", "we expect our full year sg&a expense to be lower than fiscal ' 22 levels .", "the largest year - over - year variance is lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our plans after paying out at higher levels in fiscal ' 22 due to the overachieving of our performance targets .", "we expect a lower incentive comp to be partially offset by a few areas .", "the first area is higher technology cost primarily due to annualizing spend in fiscal ' 22 .", "the second area is higher depreciation and store remodel expense , as damien will discuss later .", "and lastly , we expect to see higher sg&a dollars in support of our best buy ads business .", "finally , as you may have noticed , we are not providing quarterly guidance , but i would like to provide some insight on the assumed phasing for fiscal ' 23 .", "due to the strong first half comps last year , we expect our full year comparable sales decline to be weighted more heavily in the first half of the year .", "in addition , we expect to see significantly more year - over - year operating income rate pressure in the first half of the year compared to the back half .", "to summarize , the two largest variables for fiscal ' 23 financial results are the short - term industry declines as we lap high growth in government stimulus and the investment in our new membership program that will drive long - term value .", "as we look to fiscal ' 25 , we expect the ce industry will return to the high levels we saw in fiscal ' 22 and that totaltech will drive meaningful growth .", "i will now turn the meeting back over to corie to begin our strategic update .", "as i noted closing out my q4 summary , we remain well positioned as we head into fiscal ' 23 .", "i 'd like to expand on this a bit as we highlight our strategic positioning .", "first , technology is a necessity , and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home .", "second , we have built an ecosystem of customer -

term financial targets back in 2019 .", "as i mentioned earlier , in the past two years , we have delivered more than $ 8 billion of revenue growth and improved our operating income rate by 110 basis points to 6 % .", "we are in a strong position to drive the business forward and deliver growth .", "we do not for one minute believe we hit our peak revenue and margin this past year .", "as matt outlined , we do expect fiscal ' 23 to look different as the industry cycles the last two years of unusually strong demand and we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future .", "but in fiscal ' 25 , we expect to deliver revenue growth and expand our operating income rate beyond what we reported in fiscal ' 22 .", "as we have always said , in order to deliver these financial results , it is paramount that we stay focused on our goal to remain a best place to work , and we continue to deepen relationships with our customers .", "as you can see , our new fiscal ' 25 targets are materially higher than what we thought just back in 2019 .", "we now expect to generate approximately $ 1 billion more in operating income than our original targets .", "given our margin rate , this is considerable growth in operating income dollars .", "so what 's changed since 2019 ?", "well , the ce industry is larger than we expected .", "our online mix has nearly doubled .", "we have found ways to make our operating model more flexible and efficient while also investing in wages and benefits .", "we are accelerating our category expansion , and we have launched an entirely new membership program .", "on the flip side , the financial contribution from best buy health is clearer but also a bit longer term than we had originally modeled .", "this is based on primarily two things .", "first , demand in the active aging business and product constraints were impacted by the pandemic .", "additionally , based on our internal learnings and insights from consumer behavior changes over the past two years , we tuned our strategy to focus on the growing virtual care opportunity , which deborah will discuss in more detail later .", "as we think about our strategy going forward , it is important to look at how dramatically our business has evolved over the past several years .", "here , we use fiscal ' 15 to give a longer - term view to what a different business we have become .", "most of these changes were already in motion before the pandemic and then accelerated significantly in the past two years .", "let me expand on a few points here .", "i already mentioned our fiscal ' 22 online business was 34 % of our domestic sales .", "that is more than $ 16 billion in sales compared to just $ 3.5 billion in fiscal ' 15 .", "when you look at how we use our stores for fulfillment , the increase in the sheer number of products customers are picking up in our stores is impressive .", "this is even more meaningful when you consider the fact that our delivery speed is industry leading , and we cut delivery speed essentially in half over the past several years .", "clearly , customers value our stores and the convenience and choice they provide .", "as damien is going to discuss , we are increasingly interacting with customers via digital channels like chats and video and in their homes .", "and finally , membership is incredibly important , both now and into our future .", "and our my best buy program now has more than 100 million total members .", "so with all of that as background , i 'd like to tap back to our first key takeaway .", "technology is a necessity , and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home .", "so let 's start with some industry context .", "the traditional ce industry is large and growing .", "there 's no perfect external source that tracks our business , so here , we 're showing a historical view based on selected government pce category data .", "our outlook is based on multiple industry forecasts and internal data .", "as you can see on this chart , the industry was growing for several years and then accelerated during the last two years .", "as matt mentioned , we expect it to step back this year as the industry absorbs the very high growth of the past two years .", "by fiscal ' 25 , we believe it can be back to fiscal ' 22 levels , which is materially higher than it was pre pandemic .", "in addition , we 're expanding our addressable market by entering new categories in areas like health and electric bikes that are being disrupted by technology in a good way , as well as areas where we can really complete solutions for customers like indoor and outdoor living .", "jason will provide a bit more detail on these in a few minutes .", "as a reminder , this is also a stable industry .", "contrary to some sentiment , technology is no more volatile or cyclical than other large durable goods categories over time , and the last two years have significantly underscored the importance of technology in day -
