quarter economic performance was primarily driven by a general spread tightening in mbs as the federal reserve continued its balance sheet expansion , having purchased almost 1.5 trillion mbs during q4 so far .", "as mary noted , we did decrease risk somewhat during the quarter , reflected by lower economic debt to equity of 6.8 times .", "in addition , after having increased our position size in tba 2s to $ 7 billion , a significant spread tightening and resulting valuations in the quarter led us to reduce that exposure .", "on net , we took our overall notional tba exposure down by $ 1 billion to end the quarter at $ 5.2 billion .", "the result has been that roll specialness in the 2 % coupon has decreased significantly between mid-december and the end of january .", "additionally , we opportunistically added almost $ 200 million market value of interest -
