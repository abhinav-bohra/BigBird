leading access equipment remains very strong , but near - term results are being meaningfully impacted by supply chain and logistics challenges as well as higher input costs .", "access equipment , which faced an extreme decline in demand in 2020 as a result of the covid - 19 pandemic , has since experienced the most rapid rebound of any of our businesses .", "the rapid return of demand in 2021 exacerbated the supply chain challenges we have been facing , and we believe it will remain choppy well into 2022 .", "our access team continues to work hard to source components to build and shift products to customers around the globe .", "despite these challenges , we delivered strong revenue growth of 37 % in the fourth quarter , leading to 22 % revenue growth for the full year .", "we have taken multiple pricing actions over the past several months based on rising input costs , which we expect will largely address price / cost challenges by the end of the second quarter of 2022 .", "and of course , we will continue to be diligent in our pricing approach should input costs increase further .", "orders came in at $ 1.9 billion in the fourth quarter , representing a quarterly record for the segment , leading to a record backlog of $ 2.8 billion at september 30 .", "the rental equipment market is strong , and the access leadership team has taken measured steps to preserve the health of the industry by addressing unfair competition through our trade case .", "we believe that we are in the early stages of a multiyear growth cycle for access equipment as the rental companies work to lower the overall age of their fleets , which were at historically high levels entering 2021 .", "i want to emphasize that our growth outlook is underpinned by strong market fundamentals , and our continued launch of innovative product offerings such as the davinci all -

year contract that calls for between 50,000 and 165,000 vehicles , with a mix of both zero-emission battery electric vehicles and fuel - efficient ice vehicles and allows the usps to electrify its fleet .", "the fire & emergency segment delivered another strong quarter with an operating income margin of 14 % despite the challenging supply chain environment and extreme cost inflation .", "even more impressive is the fact that our team at f&e delivered an all - time record for operating income margin for the full year at 14.2 % .", "of course , we expect to overcome these hurdles in time , and we are planning an expansion of our appleton manufacturing sites that will support long -

discharge concrete mixers on third - party chassis either purchased by us and supplied to customers with a body and a complete package or furnished by our customers .", "this represents a meaningful risk as chassis availability has worsened over the past couple of months , and we expect it will remain challenged for much of 2022 .", "demand for rcvs and mixtures has been strong , and we have a solid outlook for both markets .", "residential construction as well as other construction indicators are positive , and elevated customer fleet ages are creating additional demand for replacement .", "our outlook is further supported by solid orders in the quarter for both rcvs and mixers as the u.s. and canada moved beyond the pandemic .", "these orders led to an all - time high backlog of just under $ 570 million , providing good visibility into 2022 .", "as john highlighted , we faced significant supply chain and logistics disruptions in the fourth quarter , well beyond our experience in the third quarter .", "we also experienced meaningful material cost inflation .", "recall that we account for inventory on a last - in first - out basis , so the additional cost escalation we saw in purchases in the fourth quarter negatively impacted price / cost dynamics , particularly at access equipment .", "we previously expected a consolidated year - over - year price / cost headwind of $ 35 million in the quarter .", "the actual price / cost impact increased to approximately $ 60 million .", "supply chain disruptions , unfavorable price / cost dynamics and labor constraints all contributed to fourth quarter financial results significantly lower than the expectations discussed on our third quarter call .", "consolidated sales for the fourth quarter were $ 2.06 billion or $ 279 million higher than the prior year , representing a 16 % increase .", "the consolidated sales increase was driven by a 37 % increase at access equipment , a 5 % increase at defense and a 10 % increase at fire & emergency , partially offset by a 6 % decrease at commercial .", "access equipment sales increased by $ 230 million over the prior year quarter due to improved market demand led by north america .", "as the impact of the pandemic has waned , the sales increase was lower than our prior expectations by approximately $ 130 million , largely due to the previously mentioned supply chain disruptions .", "defense sales increased in the quarter due to higher jltv sales as well as the benefit of pratt miller sales , which we acquired in the second quarter , partially offset by lower fmtv and international sales .", "fire & emergency sales increased in the quarter on higher arff deliveries and commercial sales were down on lower package sales .", "consolidated adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $ 104.2 million or 5.1 % of sales compared to $ 124.1 million or 7 % of sales in the prior year quarter .", "access equipment adjusted operating income decreased as a result of unfavorable price / cost dynamics , the return of spending subject to temporary cost reductions in the prior year and unfavorable product liability largely offset by an increase in sales and improved manufacturing absorption .", "defense adjusted operating income decreased as a result of unfavorable product mix , increased material costs and unfavorable production variances partially offset by higher sales volume .", "fire & emergency adjusted operating income decreased in the current year quarter as a result of higher material costs , unfavorable manufacturing efficiencies and the return of spending subject to temporary cost reductions in the prior year , offset in part by higher sales and improved pricing .", "the commercial segment adjusted operating income decreased as a result of unfavorable material costs and the return of spending subject to temporary cost reductions in the prior year , offset in part by improved manufacturing absorption and improved pricing .", "adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $ 1.05 compared to adjusted earnings per share of $ 1.30 in the prior year .", "during the quarter , we repurchased approximately 821,000 shares of common stock for a total cost of $ 95 million .", "we expect that the challenges we faced in the fourth quarter of 2021 will continue into the stub period .", "demand remains robust across the company as indicated by our strong order rates in the fourth quarter and record year - end backlogs in several segments .", "however , the current supply chain and logistics disruptions are making it difficult to forecast sales volume .", "while our backlog supported a 10 % to 15 % sales increase in the stub period versus the first quarter of 2021 , we expect parts availability will likely constrain our ability to deliver higher sales .", "as a result of this uncertainty , we are unable to provide quantitative expectations for the stub period at this time .", "we do expect that stub period earnings per share will be significantly lower than the first quarter of 2021 and may approach breakeven levels on a consolidated basis .", "we expect that unfavorable price / cost dynamics will be a $ 75 million to $ 85 million headwind versus the first quarter of 2021 .", "steel and other component costs have continued to increase .", "we have taken multiple pricing actions in our non-defense businesses over the past several months , and in many cases , prices are now greater than 10 % above early 2021 levels .", "we believe these price increases will enable us to achieve price / cost equilibrium but will still need to -- but we still need to work through large backlogs , so will take until the end of the second quarter of 2022 for these pricing actions to largely catch up with cost escalation .", "if we experience further escalation , we expect to take further pricing action .", "we also expect higher spending levels in the stub period versus the first quarter of 2021 .", "last year , covid - 19 infection rates spiked early in our first quarter and our spending levels remained low .", "since then , our spending levels have begun to normalize in areas such as travel , advertising and medical .", "we also expect that parts availability constraints will continue to drive labor inefficiencies .", "while the current environment is challenging , we are taking appropriate actions and believe that supply chain constraints will subside over time and the longer - term outlook for our businesses remains very strong .", "we 'll provide further updates on 2022 during our january earnings call .", "we just completed a challenging quarter and expect those challenges to remain for the next few quarters .", "however , we believe we 're taking the right actions as we manage through this period , position ourselves for success as supply chains improve .", "we also won significant programs in 2021 and are committed to driving long -
