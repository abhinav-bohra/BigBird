called $ 100 billion hospital fund should n't just be for hospitals , it should be for all providers .", "that was really the pathway that we 've had to the success that we have subsequently achieved .", "and the subsequent success has been a multiple rounds of money out of that cares act for skilled nursing facilities , now totaling over $ 12 billion .", "and we believe that there is more to come .", "those payments that have been made out over time have solved a lot of the cash flow issues that providers normally would have experienced , and we continue to receive those funds .", "next week , for example , on monday , will be the first payment of $ 2 billion in additional payments that are being paid out to providers who are particularly successful in keeping covid out of their buildings .", "when you add up all of these things that have occurred for skilled nursing facilities , whether it's the fmap medicaid money , the sequester , the cares act funding , the three - day stay waiver , you add it all up , and we believe that there 's been over $ 20 billion in relief to the skilled nursing sector .", "well , it means that those that thought that the sector was going to disappear back in march and april were wrong .", "and in fact , the cash position of most providers is as good as it would have been prior to the pandemic .", "i think that for the overwhelming number of providers , when you add all of the things that have occurred , they 're in a pretty good cash position heading into 2021 and feel , i think , pretty comfortable that if we can get a vaccine in early 2021 and census can rebound that they 're going to be ok .", "now there are still a number of providers , it 's a minority , but it is a sometimes a visible group who are fumbling .", "and the basic profile of those is that they fall into two categories and often , unfortunately for them , hit both .", "the first are companies that were struggling financially coming into the pandemic , and this appears to be particularly the case of folks that were highly leveraged .", "if they were struggling coming into the pandemic , it has probably exacerbated their problem over the last eight months .", "and secondly , facilities that happened to be in the northeast , which was particularly hit hard by covid early on at a time when there was virtually no ppe , virtually no testing , the mortality rates were very high .", "they have experienced a loss greater than the national average of 10 % or so .", "and so you will hear about some folks that are out there , and some of them are highly visible that are continuing to struggle .", "but i do n't think it 's representative of the vast majority of the sector .", "and my belief is that if we can get a vaccine by the end of the year , get folks vaccinated in january and february and census can rebound , the overwhelming part of the sector is going to make it through this .", "let 's secondly now talk about assisted living .", "the news is not as good .", "and what i mean by that is we have n't been able to achieve the kind of lobbying success for assisted living that we have been for skilled nursing .", "i do think that has some important breakthroughs recently and that there will be more successes down the road .", "i think a lot of people wonder , why in the heck is assisted living not received the funding that skilled nursing has ?", "and it 's not because hhs does n't like assisted living or just philosophically does n't think that private pay should be reimbursed .", "it 's not because they believe that assisted living folks do n't have needs and do n't have the same kind of problems that people that live the nursing homes have .", "it 's really none of those things at all .", "what it comes down to is that the federal government does n't regulate assisted living .", "it does n't know very much about assisted living .", "hhs provides no federal funds to assisted living and certainly does n't regulate that .", "when hhs was given the assignment to pass out what ended up being $ 175 billion in funds , it started working with the groups and the providers that it was used to working with , which did not include assisted living .", "so as we were pounding the door to say , \" hey , assisted living needs help as well , \" they were really saying , \" well , let 's get through to these medicare providers first , and then we 'll hear what you have to say , \" and they did that .", "they made some initial medicare payments , and then they let us make our case , and we were successful .", "we were able to eventually convince the policymakers that assisted living needed help as well .", "but then we ran into a very unique problem .", "because they do n't regulate assisted living and because they do n't pay , they make money , they told us , \" hey , we do n't even know who the assisted living providers are .", "we do n't have a list of companies to send funds to \" .", "and so at that point , all of the long -

term care .", "i believe , first of all , it will have an impact on the stimulus bill .", "the last -- what was going to be the last stimulus bill , obviously , did not pass before the election .", "and folks threw up their hands this week and said , \" let 's come back after the election \" .", "the conventional view in d.c. , and i agree with it , is that there is a 100 % chance that there will be another stimulus go .", "so the outcome of the election is irrelevant .", "there will be a bill .", "there will be a bill either way .", "what it is relevant to is the size of the bill .", "if republicans retain one part of the apparatus , whether it's the presidency or the senate , the stimulus bill is very likely to be of the size that was being discussed when the discussions fell apart this week , somewhere around $ 1.8 trillion to $ 2.2 trillion .", "and of that , significant additional funds will be added to the cares act funding that will then be available for both skilled nursing and assisted living .", "on the other hand , if the democrats win everything , it 's possible that there wo n't be a stimulus bill in the lame duck .", "they may want to wait until they take over .", "but whenever there is a stimulus bill , if the democrats take over , it will be larger than the $ 1.8 trillion to $ 2.2 trillion .", "it will be more like the $ 3 trillion bill that they passed back in august , and that may just be the beginning .", "they are clearly wanting to spend significant amounts of money to stabilize the economy in their view to fight covid .", "so it 's not really a question of whether there will be a stimulus bill .", "it 's just a question of how large will the bill be , and there will be important things in the bill that will help both skilled nursing and assisted living .", "so first thing to look forward to is some pretty good additional relief in the form of stimulus .", "second area is the whole discussion of vaccines .", "you 're probably following the science on vaccines .", "the drug companies seem to be making really , really good progress .", "as much as we failed on the public policy side to contain covid , the scientists have done a spectacular job on therapeutics and it looks like on the vaccine front .", "the good news is that we 've been able to convince the policymakers that not only should assisted living and skilled nursing be a priority for the vaccine , they 've actually created a turnkey program for us to distribute the vaccine .", "and you probably read about the agreement with walgreens and cvs to provide vaccinations for all assisted living buildings and all skilled nursing buildings across the country .", "if , in fact , we have a vaccine that 's approved by the end of the year , i think there is a possibility that all of our residents and all of our staff will be vaccinated in january and in february .", "and it will create this wonderful time that i 'm certainly looking forward to where we will be able to say to people the safest place in the country for an older person right now is in one of the long - term care facilities that are out there .", "the third thing that i would talk a little bit about is testing .", "testing is continuing to get better , and it 's getting cheaper .", "and we 're being prioritized for it .", "so when you kind of look at where are we headed over the next few months , i think over the next few months , there will be robust testing , a clear understanding in our -- in the long -

term care .", "the good news on census is that although it initially declined about 10 % on the skilled nursing side , it has n't collapsed any further .", "now the bad news is this has n't gotten any better either .", "the conventional thought among the operators that i talk with every single day is that once we get a vaccine and people feel more comfortable coming into buildings , we 'll be able to rebuild the census .", "if that 's true , we will be ok .", "and that is because the federal funding will be sufficient enough to get us to a vaccine .", "if once we get to a vaccine , we can start rebuilding census 0.5 % or 1 % a month , the numbers work out .", "on the other hand , if we get to a vaccine and census does n't recover , we got a real problem .", "and so i think everybody is aware that it's all about census , and our belief and our hope that it will gradually improve once we get past the vaccination .", "and finally , i 'd just remind the folks that are on the call of something that you 're clearly aware of or you would n't be interested in this space at all , and that is that the demographics are finally on our side .", "we went through this demographic trough in the 2010s , where the number of people between 80 and 85 really was n't increasing in the u.s. well , we 're past that now .", "we got past that in 2017 , and the pandemic has n't ended that .", "there will continue to be dramatic growth of the population group that needs our services .", "at the same time , the pandemic will lead to a discouragement of new investment .", "there will be less new capacity out there .", "and you combine those two together , and i think optimistic case , medium and long term , can be made for the space .", "i 'm not here to tell you , you should absolutely continue to invest in the space .", "but i am saying that i am continuing to invest in the space .", "i continue to believe in the space .", "and as horrific as this looked back in march , we 're in a much better spot right now .", "so with that , i 'll end my comments , and look forward to any questions that people have ."], "summary_gold": "q3 ffo per share $ 0.58 .", "summary_pred": "mary took a part -
