casualty segment is influenced in this result and its underlying loss ratio was down about 3 points from the same period last year .", "an improving mix and modest reductions in loss booking ratios similar to what we discussed on our fourth quarter call have driven the improvement .", "from an overall covid perspective , total reserves are largely unchanged from year end .", "our quarterly expense ratio increased 0.5 point to 41 [ phonetic ] .", "in addition , general corporate expense was up $ 1.6 million .", "these increases are driven by amounts accrued for performance related

the most markets , but we continue to achieve rate increases at or above long - term loss costs across the majority of our portfolio .", "our underwriting diet is well balanced in our palate remains

products , commercial auto liability and marine .", "now onto some segment specific comments .", "in casualty , we report an outstanding 83 combined ratio and grew gross premiums 19 % , 4 % adjusted
