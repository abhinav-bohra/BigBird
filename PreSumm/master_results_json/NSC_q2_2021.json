setting quarter , as dramatic improvement in both revenue and volume up 34 % and 25 % respectively outpaced an 11 % growth in expense and while the year - over - year improvement is aided by easier comps from last year 's economic shut down , our performance in the quarter also improved sequentially in a number of ways as shown on slide 4 .", "our results includes second quarter records for net income and earnings per share and all -
