over - year basis , journeys and schuh drove positive overall comps of 15 % and 23 % , respectively , while j&m comps were positive 77 % .", "we were very pleased with gross margins , which were up 210 basis points to last year and flat at 49.2 % versus two years ago .", "strong full - price selling and price increases offset the channel mix impact of increased e-commerce and wholesale and increased logistics costs .", "increased logistics costs put approximately 70 basis points of pressure on q3 gross margin were the greatest drag in our branded businesses .", "journeys gross margin was up 140 basis points to fiscal year ' 20 , driven by more full - price selling and higher footwear asps .", "while schuh 's gross margin was down 180 basis points to fiscal year ' 20 due to a higher e-com mix and higher shipping expenses .", "j&m 's gross margin was up 230 basis points to fiscal year ' 20 , benefiting from strong full - price selling , which also drove the release of slow - moving inventory reserves .", "for j&m , additional logistics costs put 240 basis points of pressure on j&m 's q3 margins .", "finally , licensed brands gross margin was down 150 basis points to fiscal year ' 20 , as we experienced 740 basis points of pressure on q3 margins from additional logistics costs , which more than offset margin improvements in the business .", "adjusted sg&a expense was 41.6 % , a 260 basis point improvement compared to fiscal ' 20 as we leverage from higher revenue and ongoing actions to manage expenses .", "in addition , we experienced leverage in selling salaries and depreciation , partially offset by deleverage in marketing expenses .", "as part of the sg&a discussion , i would like to provide a brief update on our $ 25 million to $ 30 million cost savings initiative .", "i 'm pleased to report we have identified the full amount of the target for this fiscal year .", "a significant portion of the savings is from rent reductions with the remainder in several areas , including travel , conventions , inter - store freight , compensation , and other overheads .", "the full effect of these savings will be realized by the end of fiscal year ' 23 .", "these savings are part of the ongoing multiyear effort of reshaping our cost structure by improving store channel profitability .", "regarding rent reductions , year to date through q3 , we have negotiated 129 renewals and achieved a 19 % reduction in rent expense in north america on a straight - line basis .", "this was on top of a 22 % reduction or 123 renewals last year .", "these renewals are for an even shorter term , averaging approximately two years compared to the three - year average we have seen in recent years .", "with 40 % of our fleet coming up for renewal in the next couple of years , this remains a key priority .", "in summary , third quarter adjusted operating income was $ 45.2 million , a 7.5 % operating margin compared to $ 26.7 million or 5 % for fiscal year ' 20 .", "this quarter 's profitability provides strong evidence of the operating margin expansion opportunity achievable with our footwear -

price selling we could achieve .", "similar to q3 , we expect channel mix as well as increased logistics costs to pressure gross margins .", "increased logistics costs are expected to pressure gross margins by 130 basis points and will offset to some extent these improvements in full - price selling .", "we expect q4 adjusted sg&a as a percentage of sales to deleverage in the range of 180 to 200 basis points compared to fiscal year ' 20 .", "this is driven primarily by increased advertising and marketing costs , particularly in brand advertising and digital marketing related to cost per click and higher performance - based compensation associated with the expected improvement in annual results , partially offset by leverage in occupancy cost .", "as a reminder , fiscal year ' 20 q4 performance - based compensation was relatively low , and this year 's level reflects the improved performance that we have experienced on a year - over - year basis .", "one more factor worth mentioning on the q4 sg&a rate is we are not expecting the same amount of onetime government relief or rent abatements we experienced in q3 this year or last year in q4 .", "our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases for the remainder of the fiscal year , which results in q4 weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 14.3 million .", "furthermore , for q4 , we expect the tax rate to be approximately 28 % .", "in summary , this all results in an expected q4 operating margin below fy ' 20 levels in large part driven by cost pressures unique to the fourth quarter this year .", "we have the right team and the right strategy to continue to drive shareholder value ."], "summary_gold": "q3 non -gaap earnings per share $ 2.36 from continuing operations .<q>q3 sales rose 25 percent to $ 601 million .<q>sees fy adjusted earnings per share $ 6.40 to $ 6.90 from continuing operations .<q>qtrly same store sales increased 25 % over last year .<q>sees fy 22 sales to be up 9 % to 11 % , compared to fiscal 2020 .", "summary_pred": "as we announced last month , and you just heard , i 'm very pleased we 've removed interim from tom 's title .<q>tom brings almost 30 years of cfo experience and deep roots in brands and retail , most recently at deckers brands .<q>he has been a tremendous asset to the organization since joining us a year ago , helping guide the business through a period of significant recovery and growth .<q>and tom george , chief financial officer , will review q3 results in more detail and provide guidance for q4 .<q>we 're excited he 's part of our leadership team and will continue to benefit from his knowledge and expertise as we grow genesco going forward .<q>building off an extremely strong first half of the year , we delivered another record earnings per share that well exceeded our expectations , fueled by a very successful back -
