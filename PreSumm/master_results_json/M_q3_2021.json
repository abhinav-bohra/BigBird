throughs and full price aurs compared to 2019 .", "we continue to roll out additional initiatives including a new promotional effectiveness tool , given our teams access to advanced analytics to better understand the profitability of prior promotional events .", "the improvement in merchandise margin was offset by a rise in delivery expense due to increased digital penetration .", "delivery expense was 4.2 % of net sales , 170 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2019 .", "with regards to inventory productivity , inventory levels were down 15.4 % compared to the third quarter of 2019 , a product of ongoing market dynamics and our own polaris initiatives .", "our sales to stock ratio remains healthy and the improved use of data science continues to enhance our inventory management practices from order placements , all the way to customer sales .", "inventory churn for the trailing 12 months improved by nearly 18 % , while for the trailing six month , inventory churn improved by approximately 22 % .", "additionally , given the macro challenges facing the retail industry , we 're staying ahead by making further shift in our inventory management practices and implementing a number of initiatives .", "as we noted on our last call , we do not anticipate improvements to many of the macro supply chain constraints until mid to late 2022 .", "moving on , we again exercised strong expense management discipline , our net value creation metric .", "sg&a expenses of $ 2 billion improved by about 10 % or $ 229 million from the third quarter of 2019 levels .", "as a percent of net sales , sg&a expenses were 36.3 % , a significant improvement of 630 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019 as we continue to benefit from permanent cost savings and reduced cost due to elevated job openings .", "the impact of the labor shortages are transitory and we expect them to moderate going into the next quarter as well as into the next year .", "improved bad debt levels driven by strong customer credit health continued to contribute to the growth of credit card revenues to $ 213 million , up $ 30 million from the third quarter 2019 and ahead of what we expected .", "credit card revenues were also ahead as a percent of net sales increasing by 40 basis points to 3.9 % and trending ahead of our prior annual guidance .", "as it relates to our credit card program , we are close to finalizing our decision on a partner and expect to announce the decision in the upcoming weeks .", "as a digitally led retailer , we must have a partner with strong digital capabilities today and a strong innovation pipeline with the prospect to further expand that pipeline in the future .", "our loyalty and personalization initiatives serve as key growth levers in our ability to obtain and retain more customers to drive omnichannel sales growth .", "that said , over the next few years , we expect credit card revenue levels will be slightly lower as a percent of sales in the 3 % or so that we have historically experienced .", "given our strong performance across these areas as well as the $ 50 million of asset sale gains recognized during the third quarter , we generated positive adjusted ebitda of $ 765 million .", "notably , adjusted ebitda margin of 14.1 % exceeded the margin in the third quarter of 2019 by 780 basis points on the strength of expense management discipline and gross margin expansion .", "after accounting for interest and taxes , collectively , these results helped to generate quarterly adjusted net income of $ 386 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $ 1.23 versus $ 21 million and $ 0.07 respectively in 2019 .", "our final value creator is capital allocation and our meaningful free cash flow generation of $ 574 million year -
