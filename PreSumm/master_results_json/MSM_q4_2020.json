critical partner to our customers on their plant floors .", "and it also reflects the fact that accelerating market share capture and improving profitability and doing so with urgency is mission critical for our organization and our stakeholders .", "a lot more is coming on this shortly , but i 'll first turn to the quarter , and we 've provided some highlights on slide 3 .", "our fiscal fourth - quarter financial results continue to reflect solid execution in a tough environment .", "versus the prior year period , overall sales were down 11.3 % or 12.7 % on an average daily sales basis .", "gross margin was down 40 basis points and operating margin was 9.8 % as compared to 10.7 % in the prior year .", "excluding one - time adjustments , our operating margin was 11.2 % , down just 30 basis points from 11.5 % in the prior year due to implementing effective cost controls .", "this all resulted in solid earnings for the quarter .", "as we noted in our august sales release , sales of our nonsafety and nonjanitorial product lines have continued to improve sequentially through the quarter .", "sales of safety and janitorial products also continued growing , with year - over - year growth of roughly 20 % each month on average and for the quarter .", "looking at our performance by customer type .", "national accounts declined slightly more than 20 % , while our core customers declined mid-teens and ccsg was down in the low double - digits .", "government sales and that 's both state and federal , were up significantly due to the surge in large safety and janitorial orders , partially offsetting the declines in the other customer types .", "all of this shows that sales levels have continued to lift and have seen a slight increase in the rate of improvement over the past couple of months .", "most manufacturing end markets , while showing sequential improvements in the quarter , are still soft .", "many national accounts are running one shift as opposed to the two or three shifts they were running pre-pandemic .", "our job shop and machine shop customers continue carrying smaller - than - normal backlogs .", "these customers remain cautious about spending and they 're burning off inventory as much as possible , given continued uncertainty .", "the persistence of covid - 19 and its potential for future surge is certainly playing a role in all of this .", "and this caution is reflected in recent sentiment indices , such as the mbi , which remains negative on a rolling 12 - month average .", "that said , the readings have improved over the past couple of months and actually reached neutral territory in september .", "should this improvement continue , it would bode well for our business and should translate into continued sequential lift in our revenues .", "in terms of end markets , the softness in industrial demand was broad -

digit positive growth for ip and during calendar 2021 .", "adjusting for our fiscal calendar , and assuming that these forecasts are accurate , it would mean that we would expect to be growing in the mid single -

end transactional engine .", "the fifth lever is diversified customer end markets .", "while the core of the business is selling into durable metal - cutting manufacturers , we 're also focused on building scale in other areas that are countercyclical and that still leverage many of our strengths .", "government is a good example of this .", "it 's no secret that we had some execution issues there a couple of years back .", "we 've worked hard to rebuild our team and our business , and we 're seeing the payoff in the form of accelerated growth rates , which of course , have been aided by covid relief .", "we plan to continue building on this momentum .", "towards that end , we 'll be adding hunter roles that are specific just to government .", "i 'll now turn to our second goal , as summarized on slide 11 , to deliver roic , return on invested capital , in the high teens within the next three years .", "this would imply profit growth of at least the high single digits and it would also imply incremental margins in the high teens .", "again , all of this assumes that ip grows in the ranges that i mentioned earlier on .", "we launched an operational cost and productivity initiative to deliver on this goal back in fiscal 2020 .", "as you 've heard me mention , we expect this initiative to deliver about 200 basis points in cost down on an operating expense - to - sales ratio basis over the next three years .", "i 'm going to now turn things over to kristen , who will give you more details on the actions that will define our productivity runway .", "as erik mentioned , a significant part of the mission critical program is to reduce operating expenses as a percent of sales .", "the cost takeout is going to come from an assortment of programs aligned to three separate tracks .", "so the first is sales and service , the second is supply chain , and the third is general and administrative costs .", "erik covered some of the sales and service initiatives , so i 'll elaborate a little bit more on supply chain and the g&a tracks .", "let me first say that the productivity comes from a number of projects and we are tracking each of them closely , with several already announced or even executed .", "for example , under supply chain , we recently announced that we will be closing one of our smaller distribution centers located in dallas and moving the service to the remainder of our distribution network .", "we are also stepping up our use of automation and robotics at several of our customer fulfillment centers for packaging .", "this was started last year in harrisburg and is now being expanded to elkhart .", "these moves will improve our productivity and allow associates to perform greater value - added services .", "we have also renegotiated our freight contracts and will realize significant savings over the next three years .", "when it comes to g&a , in our fiscal fourth quarter , we completed a process redesign of our talent acquisition function , which resulted in outsourcing that function .", "this is allowing us to find talent at a faster pace and reduced cost .", "another example is the voluntary retirement program we offered in our fourth quarter .", "the take - up on the program was very good , as is evidenced by the significant headcount drop in our fiscal fourth quarter .", "while we will likely reinvest some of these cost savings over time into the five growth initiatives that erik mentioned earlier , the program will still produce meaningful overall cost reduction .", "we 've also revised our travel policy such that a significant portion of the covid - related temporary travel cost savings will become permanent .", "and finally , we 're renegotiating indirect spend contracts , where we 'll see an opportunity for further savings .", "stepping back from these examples , just kind of thinking about the overall operating expense dollars .", "in fiscal ' 20 , we reported operating expenses of $ 993 million .", "in fiscal ' 21 , the add - back of costs associated with the temporary cost reduction measures roughly offsets the reduction in variable costs from slightly lower sales .", "as erik mentioned , mission critical includes growth investment , and that will be in the range of about $ 15 million in our first year of the growth program which is 2021 .", "this will be more than offset by total structural mission critical savings in 2021 in the range of $ 25 million .", "and by the way , this is in addition to approximately $ 20 million of savings that we 've already achieved in 2020 .", "putting all of this together means that we would expect operating expenses to be slightly down if sales are flat to slightly down in fiscal ' 21 .", "now let 's dig into 2021 a little bit more to supplement what erik mentioned earlier on the growth line .", "on gross margin , we expect the full year to be flat to down 50 basis points year over year .", "an operating margin framework is shown on slide 13 for gaap and 14 for adjusted figures .", "operating margins will naturally vary based on the sales level .", "if sales are down slightly on an adjusted basis , we would expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.2 % , plus or minus 20 basis points .", "if sales are flat , we would expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.4 % , plus or minus 20 basis points .", "and finally , if sales are slightly up , we would expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.7 % , plus or minus 20 basis points .", "over the next three years , we are implementing a change equation that we believe will accelerate market share capture and improve profitability .", "on the growth side of that equation , we 're targeting growth rates of at least 400 basis points above market over the cycle by investing in the five growth levers i described earlier .", "our investments will be funded by costs being taken out of the business and we 're looking to grow profits faster than sales .", "this will enable us to improve returns on invested capital into the high teens .", "all of this is aligned with our ongoing work to reposition msc from a spot - buy supplier to a mission - critical partner on the plant floor of our industrial customers .", "the results will not come overnight , particularly , given that we 're still dealing with the uncertainty being driven by covid -
