in the third quarter was $ 287 million , which was at the higher end of our guidance range and included a true - up of about $ 14 million for q2 shipments reported that were above the original estimates , and that item is not uncommon .", "on a year - over - year basis , third quarter revenue was about $ 40 million above last year 's q3 as we benefited from higher market tams , along with greater adoption of our dolby technologies .", "so q3 revenue was comprised of $ 272 million in licensing and $ 15 million in products and services .", "broadcast represented about 46 % of total licensing in the third quarter .", "broadcast revenues increased by about 40 % year - over - year , and that was driven by higher market volume , higher recoveries and higher adoption of our dolby

market volume , along with increased adoption of dolby vision and dolby atmos , offset partially by lower recoveries .", "and sequentially , pc was down by about 51 % , due mostly to timing of revenue , and that lines up with some of the comments i made last quarter about its increase that quarter because of timing .", "other markets represented about 13 % of total licensing in the third quarter .", "they were up about 42 % year - over - year , and that was driven by higher revenue from dolby cinema , via admin fees and gaming .", "and on a sequential basis , other markets increased by about 4 % due mostly to dolby cinema and to gaming .", "so if i go beyond licensing , our products and services revenue was about $ 15.2 million in q3 compared to $ 16 million in q2 and $ 11.8 million in last year of q3 .", "total gross margin in the third quarter was 89 % on a gaap basis and 89.7 % on a non-gaap basis .", "products and services gross margin on a gaap basis was minus $ 3.9 million in

36 million of discrete tax benefits , which does affect the year - over - year comparisons .", "so our net income on a non-gaap basis in the third quarter was $ 74.8 million or $ 0.71 per diluted share compared to $ 87.5 million or $ 0.86 per diluted share in q3 of last year .", "during the third quarter , we generated $ 172 million in cash from operations compared to $ 134 million generated

having landed in the range , we are updating the second half revenue range to $ 570 million to $ 600 million , in other words , bumping up the lower end by $ 10 million , which means we are
