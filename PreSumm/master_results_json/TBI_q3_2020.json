end of the pay scale when combined with state unemployment benefits , can provide more take - home pay than a work assignment .", "in the recruitment process outsourcing business , gross margin also comes under pressure , but this has more to do with volume than price as rpo cost of sales is mostly comprised of recruiting personnel costs .", "while we are able to reduce recruiting costs by reducing headcount , there is a semi- fixed component that creates negative operating leverage in the cost of sales for the rpo business as revenue declines , similar to the dynamic with the rest of our enterprise personnel costs that are reported in sg&a expense .", "as the economy recovers , pricing power has historically swung back to the industrial staffing industry as demand for talent surges due to economic growth as well as a preference for more contingent labor due to the hesitation of businesses to hire permanent staff associated with uncertainty about the sustainability of the recovery .", "likewise , additional revenue volume has assisted the recovery of rpo gross margin .", "we have an experienced team that has operated through these economic cycles and we have tested processes in place to help ensure we seize the opportunity to improve our gross margin in the future .", "turning to sg&a expense , we turned in another quarter of very strong results .", "expense was down $ 40 million or 31 % compared to q3 2019 .", "we also continue to challenge prior assumptions about the costs needed to run the business and invest in technology .", "we are optimistic that these actions will result in a more efficient service delivery model .", "the opportunity for additional cost savings is greatest in our peopleready business .", "we see opportunity to further reduce the costs of our branch network while maintaining the strength of our geographic footprint through a greater use of technology , centralizing work activities , and repurposing job roles .", "we 've made good progress in 2020 by centralizing certain recruiting activities and repurposing certain job functions .", "a necessary precursor to further reducing the costs of the branch network is a broader repurposing of jobs to increase centralization which can be accomplished through the normal course of employee attrition .", "client - facing job functions must also be repurposed to ensure we continue to meet the service expectations of our clients .", "we will be testing these plans throughout 2021 before we make large - scale changes which will also help us provide more clarity on the savings opportunity .", "turning to our tax rate , our effective tax rate was 30 % in q3 , which is higher than what we had experienced in prior years as a result of this quarter 's performance reducing the net operating loss for the year .", "this results in a reduction to our cares act carry - back benefit expectation resulting in some catch up expense this quarter .", "additional information on the components of our effective tax rate is available in our 10 - q filed today .", "turning to our segments , peopleready , our largest segment , saw a 29 % decline in revenue and segment profit was down 39 % .", "we saw nice intra-quarter revenue improvement with september down 27 % compared to 32 % in july with further improvement to a decline of 19 % in october .", "the improvement was broad -

to - date for october , peoplemanagement was up 1 % .", "about half of the segment profit growth is attributable to cost management actions and half from unique costs in q3 last year creating a favorable comparison this year .", "turning to peoplescout , we saw a 48 % decline in revenue and segment profit was down 97 % .", "intra-quarter revenue did show improvement with september down 40 % compared to 52 % in july .", "as patrick noted , peoplescout results were adversely impacted by exposure to travel and leisure clients , which made up roughly 25 % of the prior year mix and revenue for this vertical was down 74 % year - over - year .", "now let 's turn to the balance sheet and cash flows .", "our balance sheet continues to shine , providing financial flexibility and stability .", "our credit facility provides ample liquidity and our debt position is at its lowest level since 2012 .", "we also repurchased 9 % of our common stock at favorable prices earlier this year to boost shareholder return .", "year -
