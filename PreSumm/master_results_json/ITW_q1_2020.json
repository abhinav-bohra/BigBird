over - year basis .", "obviously , there 's a fair amount of uncertainty around how may and june actually play out but that is our current view .", "as you would expect , given that most of our automotive oem customers in north america and western europe have been essentially shut down since mid-march , and are only beginning to restart production in early to mid-may .", "our automotive oem business will be the hardest hit with revenues potentially down 60 % to 70 % year - over - year .", "and abrupt decline of this magnitude in the quarter is pretty unprecedented .", "as difficult as it may look , if it plays out this way , we expect that itw will still make operating profit in the $ 200 million to $ 400 million range , generate free cash flow of more than $ 500 million and end the q2 with cash on hand of about $ 1.5 billion .", "knowing that we have the financial strength to withstand whatever comes our way over the next few months , our number one priority becomes positioning to play offense in the recovery .", "and this is an area where our strong margin profile really helps us .", "whether the pace of recovery is fast or slow , v shaped or u shaped , over the next few quarters , it does n't really impact us that much .", "under very fast paced recovery , we end up down 15 % for the full year , and margins are 19 % to 21 % .", "they 're much slower recovery , revenues are down 25 % .", "yet , our margins are still a very strong 17 % to 19 % .", "this is against a backdrop , where most of the companies that our divisions compete with came into the pandemic , with margins at half of ours or less .", "as a result , a number of them may have to retrench in a major way in order to get through the epidemic , potentially creating some significant share gain opportunities for us in the recovery .", "with our margin cushion , we are concerned with how quickly demand is going to recover in q3 or q4 .", "we can be fairly certain that it will be incrementally better than q2 .", "but beyond that , it really does n't affect us a whole lot , which allows us to think long - term and positioned for maximum participation in the recovery , making sure that we are in a strong position to fully support our customers , as their businesses begin to re accelerate , and that we are in an equally strong position to take share from competitors , who can't , is the central imperative of our pandemic response planning for every one of our divisions .", "we will , of course , need to manage our businesses smartly across our portfolio and make some meaningful capacity and cost structure adjustments in businesses , where we expect prolonged recovery periods , or maybe even permanent demand impacts from the pandemic .", "but as we always do , we will leave those decisions in the hands of our divisional leaders as they are in the best position to assess the pace and slope of the cut of the recovery in each of their respective businesses .", "the financial benefits of our enterprise strategy , combined with the work done to optimize our capital efficiency , capital structure and capital allocation over the years , has put itw in a very strong position going into this crisis .", "at quarter end , we have more than $ 1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand .", "at the end of q1 and it 's still the case .", "as of today , we have essentially no short - term debt .", "and we have not issued any commercial paper .", "simply put , because we do n't need to cash .", "we have a $ 2.5 billion undrawn credit facility available to us , if needed in the future bring our total liquidity to about $ 4 billion as we sit here today .", "our net leverage is only 1.7 times and our next maturity is pretty small , $ 350 million and not until september 2021 .", "high quality of earnings and strong free cash flow are hallmarks of itw .", "as you know , we consistently generate significantly more cash than we need for internal purposes .", "and our annual conversion rate from net income is consistently above 100 % .", "we expect that to continue to be the case , as we manage our way through the pandemic .", "as evidenced by tier 1 credit ratings that are the highest in our peer group , we continue to have excellent access to credit markets in the event that we needed .", "during this time of market volatility , it 's also worth mentioning that our pension plans , have remained in great shape .", "over the years , we have consistently funded and de risked our plans .", "and as we sit here today , our largest u.s. plan is funded at 104 % .", "so how do we think about and adjust our capital allocation approach during the pandemic ?", "first , with regard to the dividend .", "we recognize the importance of itw 's dividend to our long term shareholders .", "we have a long history , with more than 56 years of growing the dividend .", "and we are part of a small group of so - called dividend aristocrats , and one of about 18 companies that has increased its dividend for more than 50 years .", "and we view the dividend as a critical component of itw 's total shareholder return model .", "since 2012 , we have increased the annualized dividend from $ 1.52 per share to currently $ 4.28 per share , a cumulative annual growth rate of 16 % .", "simply put , we remain strongly committed to our dividend and as we sit here today , we do not see a scenario where we would have to reduce the dividend .", "in terms of strategic optionality , we are clearly in a position of strength , with ample balance sheet capacity .", "and we 're certainly open to the possibility that opportunities might emerge as a result of the pandemic .", "it could be in the form of more reasonable valuation opportunities for assets that we were already interested in , as well as some unique opportunities with quality companies that may not have the financial strength to weather the pandemic .", "given our financial strength and ample capacity , we will be in a strong position to react to any high quality strategic opportunities that may emerge .", "we will continue to fully fund all internal investment and capex projects that meet our criteria , like we always have , but the number will likely come down in terms of aggregate spend in the near term , simply due to the fact that we do n't need any capacity expansion projects for the next several quarters .", "finally , i think , it comes as no surprise to anyone that we have suspended share repurchases until end markets stabilize and the recovery path becomes clearer .", "and as a priority four , which is all about leveraging our strengths to make sure that every one of our businesses are strongly positioned to fully participate in the recovery .", "in short , we are going to be there to serve every bit of our customers ' needs as their businesses begin to reaccelerate and be well prepared to capture any share gain opportunities that may come our way .", "food equipment had a good quarter with organic growth up 2 % year - over - year despite a tough comp of 5 % organic growth last year .", "the service business was solid up 4 % in the quarter .", "equipment growth of 1 % reflects double - digit growth in retail and modest decline in institutional and restaurants against tough year - over - year comps for both of those .", "operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 27.5 % with enterprise initiatives , the main contributor .", "test and measurement in electronics had a very strong quarter with test and measurement up 6 % with 13 % growth in our instron business .", "the segment also experienced a meaningful pickup in demand from semiconductor customers .", "electronics was up 2 % .", "margin was the highlight as the team expanded operating margins 330 basis points to a record , 28.1 % the highest in the company this quarter with strong contributions from enterprise initiatives and volume leverage .", "also in the quarter , we divested in electronics business with 2019 revenues of approximately $ 60 million .", "in the face of an unprecedented demand contraction in q2 , as michael commented earlier , we will still generate operating income in the hundreds of million dollars and generate over $ 500 million in free cash flow .", "we will manage discretionary expenses prudently , but we do n't need to start cutting muscle immediately .", "and we certainly want to avoid doing so , before we have some level of indication as to the shape and slope of the recovery in each of our businesses .", "with this principle in mind , to this point , we are providing full compensation and benefits support to all itw colleagues around the world .", "and we 're going to do our best to sustain that level of support for all of our people through at least the end of q2 .", "we are doing it because we are in a position to support our people at a time of great personal and family stress and uncertainty .", "and we think that it 's the right thing to do .", "but we 're also doing it to protect the significant investment we have made in training and developing great itw people and great itw leaders over the past seven years .", "as michael mentioned , it is likely that we will need to make some staffing adjustments to align with prolonged or permanently lower demand in some of our businesses as a result of the pandemic .", "so we are committed to being there for all of our people during the worst of this , and we will take the time to make whatever longer - term adjustments need to be made thoughtfully .", "the second principle is that we 're going to lean into the upside by remaining invested in structure to capture incremental demand .", "given the profitability of our core businesses in the strength of our financial position , what 's the bigger risk for itw , carrying more cost and it turns out we need for a few months or cutting too much and not being able to fully serve the needs of our customers and take share from our competitors as the recovery accelerates .", "obviously , we believe short sheet and the upside potential of the recovery would be the far bigger mistake for itw .", "and we 're going to plan and execute our recovery strategies accordingly .", "the third principle is that we 're going to leverage the strength of itw to protect investment in areas of strategic importance to the execution of our long - term strategy .", "we 're early in our planning around all these areas .", "but as one example , prior to the pandemic , we invested two plus years in our strategic sales excellence initiative that included significant investments in new sales and sales leadership talent .", "we have the financial capacity to protect these types of long - term strategic investments .", "and doing so is worth a lot more over the long - term to the company , there are a few extra detrimental margin points in the short - term .", "that being said , decremental margins should likely be in our normal 35 % to 40 % range in q4 .", "between now and then , we 're going to focus on making sure itw is in a strong position to fully participate in the recovery .", "turning to slide 14 , this is just a reminder that our long -
