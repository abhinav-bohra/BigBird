enhancing recommendations from the nc first commission , which is tasked with evaluating north carolina 's growing transportation investment needs and ensuring that critical financial resources are available .", "despite some near - term dot headwinds , the passage of a reauthorized comprehensive federal infrastructure package will provide multi-year upside .", "while it 's unlikely a successor bill will be agreed upon and signed into law prior to the fixing america 's surface transportation act 's expiration on september 30 , we feel confident new legislation will be enacted and provide the first sizable increase in federal transportation funding in more than 15 years .", "when this occurs , it will be a big win for our industry and for martin marietta .", "while nonresidential construction activity on existing projects has continued , some commercial and institutional projects in the design or planning stages are being delayed or canceled .", "the dodge momentum index , or dmi , a monthly measure of the first report for nonresidential building projects in planning , which has historically led construction spending for nonresidential building by a full year , is down 20 % from its most recent peak in july 2018 .", "however , to contextualize the june reading , the great recession 's peak to trough dmi decline was 62 % .", "importantly , since the great recession , martin marietta has purposefully shifted our nonresidential exposure to be more heavy industrial -

supply , including texas , colorado , north carolina and florida , which are all in our top 10 states .", "these trends , along with historically low mortgage rates , bode well for future expansion in single - family housing activity , which is two to three times more aggregates - intensive than multi-family housing , given the typical ancillary nonresidential and infrastructure construction activity .", "also , longer term , we expect martin marietta to benefit across all three of our primary end -users from accelerated deurbanization trends , as stay -
