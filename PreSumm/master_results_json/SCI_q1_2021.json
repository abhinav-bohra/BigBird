per - share growth was driven by two factors : significant funeral volume increases , which we anticipated based upon december volume increases of 31 % , and a substantial increase in cemetery property sales , particularly preneed cemetery property sales , which exceeded our expectations and significantly enhanced our earnings per share results for the first quarter of 2021 .", "at a high level , both the funeral and cemetery segments in the quarter had margin improvement of over 1,000 basis points , driven by double -
