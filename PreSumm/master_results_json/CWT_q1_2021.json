.", "so as we mentioned -- as i mentioned a moment ago , the net loss decreased by $ 17.3 million and that was primarily the result of the adoption of the california general rate case late last year .", "the first was obviously , the rate increases associated with that , that added $ 4 million of revenue .", "we 're adding $ 7.6 million of revenue associated with that .", "so we 're expecting to see lower afudc equity here in the quarter , it was down about $ 1 million .", "the market value of certain of our retirement plan assets was in -- so the market value increased $ 0.3 million as
