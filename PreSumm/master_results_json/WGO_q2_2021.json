craft ; second , winnebago industries ' ongoing commitment to operate with excellence and deliver exceptional quality , innovation and service in everything we do ; and lastly , a win - win partnership mentality with our valued dealer network to create and sustain strong consumer demand for our leading portfolio of outdoor products .", "while we have undoubtedly been active via acquisitions in the last four - plus years , fiscal - year 2021 quarter 2 represents a truly organic year - over - year comparison in total performance .", "the second quarter of fiscal - year 2020 was the first full quarter in which newmar 's luxury motorhome line was included in our world - class portfolio .", "one year later , we continue to nurture the tremendous appeal of newmar 's growing product lineup and its relentless focus on craftsmanship , quality , and customer care .", "our collective enterprise results in the second quarter of fiscal - year 2021 validate a strong , complete , full - line rv strategy is now in place here at our company , and premium organic portfolio of rv brands are positioned to compete vigorously in the years ahead .", "now , there is a distinct strategic cause -

year 2021 second - quarter performance was sustained strong consumer demand for our products , both as wholesale appetite from our dealers , but especially at retail with end consumers .", "we are not seeing any significant decline in retail momentum and outdoor product demand as we turn into the spring 2021 selling season .", "ssi results are often a lagging incomplete barometer of the retail health in the industry .", "and our company 's retail numbers in the first two to three weeks of march have actually shown sustained strength and even an uptick in certain categories .", "the rv and marine industry have succeeded in comping effectively over a somewhat normal pre-pandemic period in early calendar 2020 .", "in the next three months of 2021 , march through may , which is our quarter 3 , we 'll see strong retail and wholesale comparisons versus a period of intense marketplace disruption a year ago .", "throughout the pandemic , we have proven our resilience and ability to execute during difficult macroeconomic and large -

to - adjusted ebitda continued to decline and is now 1.0 times , which is toward the lower end of our targeted range of 0.9 to 1.5 times , driven by both strong ebitda generation and lower net debt due to the increasing cash balance of now $ 333 million .", "total liquidity , including our untapped abl , is now in excess of $ 500 million .", "cash flow from operations was a healthy $ 66.9 million for the first half of fiscal 2021 .", "working capital remained slightly elevated due to the inconsistent supply chain delivery but we continue to expect further improvements in this area in the coming quarters .", "our effective tax rate increased to 23.4 % for the first six months ended february 27 , 2021 , from 20.1 % for the same period last year primarily due to consistent year - over - year credits over higher current - year pre-tax income and favorable r&d discrete items in fiscal 2020 .", "for the full year , we currently expect our tax rate to approximate 23.5 % to 24 % , including all discrete -- or i 'm sorry , excluding all discrete items from year - to - date results , and those that may occur in the remainder of the year .", "our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with those communicated in the past , investing in our businesses to drive organic growth , executing strategic expansion to our portfolio through m&a , maintaining a strong liquidity position , managing our leverage ratio within our targeted range , and returning cash to shareholders .", "during the second quarter , we paid a dividend of $ 0.12 per share on january 27 , 2021 , and our board of directors just approved a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.12 per share payable on april 27 , 2021 .", "that concludes my review of our quarterly financials .", "before we open the call to questions , i want to touch efficiently on three topics : one , our estimates for rv industry retail and wholesale performance in fiscal - year 2021 ; two , our thoughts on the probable length of the rv field inventory replenishment cycle and steps we are taking to expand capacity ; and three , recent progress at winnebago industries on important corporate responsibility priorities .", "in our fiscal 2021 , which is september of 2020 through august of 2021 , we believe rv industry retail will grow in the mid- to upper single digits , while industry wholesale shipments in that same period will grow approximately 40 % to 45 % .", "quarter 3 , march through may for our company , industry retail should be especially strong given the comparisons versus 2020 .", "but quarter 4 for our organization , june through august , industry retail will see a more challenging comparison environment due to record -

year 2022 to have most of our businesses in a more normal retail to wholesale replenishment status .", "to support this drive to replenish field inventory , we are actively pursuing and executing several capacity expansion projects within our company , which will position our organization well for future market share gain opportunities .", "some investments are organic and do not require the addition or expansion of square footage or overhead , while other projects will necessitate a physical increase in infrastructure .", "each rv and marine business unit here in winnebago industries has active capacity expansion efforts under way .", "we will not share details for competitive reasons .", "physical assembly line extensions , standing up new lines in existing buildings , adding vertical manufacturing space and capacity , constructing new assembly buildings , shifting product lines and mix within our existing lines and facility , along with online productivity and lean initiatives that reduce waste and improve output rates , each of these are active today across our portfolio .", "multiple eight figures of capital is being invested currently and will likely continue well into fiscal -
