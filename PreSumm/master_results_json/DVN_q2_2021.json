quarter results demonstrate the impressive momentum our business has quickly established .", "even today , as we celebrate devon 's 50th anniversary as a company this year , we 're only getting started and our talented team is eager , energized and extremely motivated to win .", "as investors seek exposure to commodity - oriented names , it is important to recognize that devon is a premier energy company and a must - own name in this space .", "we have the right mix of assets , proven management , financial strength and a shareholder -

in - class in the e&p space , but we also possess the top rank yield in the entire s&p 500 index by a wide margin .", "in fact , at today 's pricing , our yield is more than seven times higher than the average company that is represented in the s&p 500 index .", "furthermore , our dividend is comfortably funded within free cash flow and is accompanied by a strong balance sheet that is projected to have a leverage ratio of less than one turn by year - end .", "investors need to take notice , devon offers a truly unique investment opportunity for the near 0 interest rate world that we live in today .", "now , looking beyond devon to the broader e&p space , i 'm also encouraged this earnings season by the announcement from pioneer on their variable dividend implementation as well as a growing number of other peers who have elected to prioritize higher dividend payouts .", "these disciplined actions will further enhance the investment thesis for our industry , paving the way for higher fund flows as investors rediscover the attractive value proposition of the e&p space .", "now , moving to slide 10 .", "while the remainder of 2021 is going to be outstanding for devon , simply put , the investment thesis only gets stronger as i look ahead to next year .", "we should have one of the most advantaged cash flow growth outlooks in the industry as we capture the full benefit of merger -

risk development , we delivered capital spending results that were 9 % below plan , well productivity in the delaware drove oil volumes above guidance and field level synergies improved operating costs .", "while the operating results year - to - date have been great , the remainder of the year looks equally strong , a true test of asset quality , execution and corporate cost structure proves out in sustainably low reinvestment rates , steady production and significant free cash flow .", "this is exactly what we 're delivering at devon .", "we plan to continue to operate 16 rigs for the balance of the year and deliver approximately 150 new wells to production in the second half of 2021 .", "during the quarter , our capital program consisted of 13 operated rigs and four dedicated frac crews , resulting in 88 new wells that commenced first production .", "this level of capital activity was concentrated around the border of new mexico and texas and accounted for roughly 80 % of our total companywide capital investment in the quarter .", "as a result of this investment , delaware basin 's high - margin oil production continue to rapidly advance , growing 22 % on a year - over - year basis .", "while we had great results across our acreage position , a top contributor to the strong volume were several large pads within our stateline and cotton draw areas that accounted for more than 30 new wells in the quarter .", "this activity was weighted toward development work in the upper wolfcamp , but we also had success co-developing multiple targets in the bone spring within our stateline area .", "the initial 30 -

hand side , our d&c costs have improved to $ 543 per lateral foot in the quarter , a decline of more than 40 % from just a few years ago .", "to deliver on this positive rate of change , the team achieved record -

over - year basis .", "and my final comment on this slide -- on the chart to the far right , the cumulative impact of devon 's strong operational performance resulted in significant margin expansion compared to both last quarter and on a year - over - year basis .", "importantly , our delaware basin operations are geared for this trend to continue over the remainder of the year and beyond .", "while the delaware basin is clearly the growth engine of our company , we have several high - quality assets in the oil fairway of the u.s. that generate substantial amounts of free cash flow .", "these assets may not capture many headlines but they underpin the success of our sustainable free cash flow - generating strategy .", "in the delaware basin , cash flow nearly doubled in the quarter on the strength of natural gas and ngls .", "our dow joint venture activity is progressing quite well and we 're bringing on the first pad of new wells this quarter .", "the williston continues to provide phenomenal returns and at today 's pricing , this asset is on track to generate nearly $ 700 million of free cash flow for the year .", "in the eagle ford , we have reestablished momentum with 21 wells brought online year -

to - ebitda leverage target of one turn or less by year - end .", "our low leverage is also complemented by a liquidity position of $ 4.5 billion and a debt profile with no near - term maturities .", "this balance sheet strength is absolutely a competitive advantage for devon that lowers our cost of capital and optimizes our financial flexibility through the commodity cycle .", "looking ahead to the second half of the year , with the increasing amounts of free cash flow our business is projected to generate , we 'll continue to systematically return value to our shareholders through both higher dividend payouts and by further deleveraging our investment -
