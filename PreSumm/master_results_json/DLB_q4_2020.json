up of about $ 25 million in the quarter related to q3 shipments , which was about $ 15 million higher than the true - up that we had last quarter , and with most of that improvement coming from tvs and set - top boxes , and pcs .", "total company revenue in q4 increased sequentially by $ 24 million compared to q3 , as we benefited from higher unit volumes in tvs , set - top boxes , dmas and pcs , along with the higher true - up that i just discussed .", "now looking at q4 on a year - over - year basis , total company revenue is down by $ 28 million from last year 's q4 and we can attribute that mainly to covid - 19 , especially in products and services , which were down by about $ 20 million or nearly 60 % below last year .", "the composition of q4 revenue was $ 257 million in licensing and $ 14 million in products and services .", "broadcast represented about 47 % of total licensing in the fourth quarter .", "broadcast revenues increased by about 2 % year - over - year , helped by the higher true - up related to the q3 shipments and also driven by higher adoption in tvs and set - top boxes .", "on a sequential basis , broadcast was up by about 35 % due to higher volume in tvs and set - top boxes along with higher recoveries and the higher true - up .", "mobile represented approximately 15 % of total licensing in q4 .", "mobile was down by about 13 % over last year due to lower recoveries , but partially offset by higher adoption of dolby technologies .", "for the sequential comparison , i should point out that last quarter q3 , mobile was about 33 % licensing , which was higher than normal , and that was due to timing of revenue under customer contracts , so we came into q4 expecting mobile revenue to decline this quarter and return to a more normalized percentage of revenue , which is what it did .", "so accordingly mobile revenue was down sequentially by about 50 % , and that was primarily due to timing of revenue under customer contracts .", "consumer electronics represented about 13 % of total licensing in the fourth quarter .", "on a year - over - year basis , ce licensing was down by about 8 % , mainly due to lower recoveries .", "on a sequential basis , ce was about 68 % higher than q3 .", "and as a reminder , q3 was lower than usual and only 9 % of licensing because of timing under contract .", "pc represented about 12 % of total licensing in q4 .", "pc was higher than last year by about 26 % , helped by the higher true - up and also because of the increased adoption of dolby technologies .", "and sequentially , pc was up by about 32 % that 's for similar reasons .", "other markets represented about 13 % of total licensing in the fourth quarter and they were down by about 19 % year - over - year due to significantly lower dolby cinema box office share and that 's because of the covid restrictions and lack of big titles , and also because of lower revenues from gaming due to console life cycles and / or recoveries in automotive .", "on a sequential basis , other markets was up by about 32 % , driven by higher revenue from gaming and from via admin fees and that 's the patent pool that we administered .", "beyond licensing , our products and services revenue was $ 14.3 million in q4 , compared to $ 11.8 million in q3 and $ 34 million in last year 's q4 .", "total gross margin in the fourth quarter was 84.3 % on a gaap basis and 85.1 % on a non-gaap basis .", "products and services gross margin on a gaap basis was minus $ 15.5 million in the fourth quarter and a large portion of that consisted of charges for excess and obsolete inventory associated with conferencing hardware and that relates back to what i just said a minute ago , about our plans in that space .", "going forward into q1 , we anticipate that products and services margin will still be negative , but more along the lines of around minus $ 3 million or minus $ 4 million .", "products and services gross margin on a non-gaap basis was minus $ 14.1 million in the fourth quarter , and my comments here are similar to what i just said for gaap gross margins .", "operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a gaap basis were slightly above the high - end of the range that we had guided , coming in at a $ 198.7 million , compared to $ 182.9 million in q3 .", "operating expenses in the fourth quarter on a non-gaap basis were $ 176.5 million , which is within our range and that was compared to $ 159.2 million in the third quarter , and basically the same comments that i made in gaap apply here as well .", "operating income in the fourth quarter was $ 30.1 million on a gaap basis or 11.1 % of revenue , compared to $ 51.2 million or 17.1 % of revenue in q4 of last year .", "operating income in the fourth quarter on a non-gaap basis was $ 54.3 million or 20 % of revenue , compared to $ 77.6 million or 26 % of revenue in q4 of last year .", "income tax in q4 was 21.8 % on both the gaap and non-gaap basis .", "net income on a gaap basis in the fourth quarter was $ 26.8 million or $ 0.26 per diluted share , compared to $ 43.9 million or $ 0.43 per diluted share in last year 's q4 .", "net income on a non-gaap basis in the fourth quarter was $ 45.8 million or $ 0.45 per diluted share , compared to $ 67.6 million or $ 0.66 per diluted share in q4 of last year .", "during the fourth quarter , we generated about $ 113 million in cash from operations , which compares to about $ 130 million generated in last year 's fourth quarter .", "we ended the fourth quarter with nearly $ 1.2 billion in cash and investments .", "during q4 , we bought back about 640,000 shares of our common stock and ended the quarter with about $ 187 million of stock repurchase authorization still available to us .", "we also announced today a cash dividend of $ 0.22 per share .", "the dividend will be payable on december 4 , 2020 to shareholders of record on november 24 , 2020 .", "total revenue in fy ' 20 was $ 1,162 million that compares to $ 1,241 million in the prior year with a year -
