able to soften the blow to hotel associates with nearly $ 8 million in severance paid out this year .", "hotel adjusted ebitda in the quarter was a $ 17.4 million loss , a marked improvement from the $ 30.4 million loss in the second quarter .", "corporate adjusted ebitda was a $ 24.4 million loss as compared to a $ 37 million loss in the second quarter .", "third quarter adjusted ffo per share was a loss of $ 0.22 as compared to a loss of $ 0.20 in the second quarter .", "two items worth noting with these results : one , they exclude $ 7.4 million in onetime severance costs ; and two , this one is important , adjusted ffo per share was negatively impacted by a non-cash income tax valuation allowance recognized in the quarter of $ 12.4 million or $ 0.06 per share .", "in other words , our third quarter affo would have been a loss of only $ 0.16 per share without that tax adjustment .", "moreover , in the quarter , we successfully reopened five more hotels and had nearly 90 % of our

revenues showed steady progress , rising from slightly over $ 11 million in june to over $ 14 million in july , to over $ 16 million in august , and finally , reaching almost $ 20 million in september .", "encouragingly , revenue in october looks to be coming in even a little bit better at over $ 22 million .", "for example , the rooms department margin rose from 45 % in the second quarter to 64 % in the third quarter , driven in large part by a 25 % sequential reduction in the cost per occupied room .", "in june , we had 10 hotels generating positive gross operating profit , or gop , and this figure rose to 18 hotels by the end of september .", "over that same period , gop margin moved from a negative 35 % to a positive 9 % margin as a testament to our ability to drive revenue while constraining costs .", "on an ebitda basis , six hotels in june were operating profitably , and that figure rose to 10 hotels by september .", "what you cannot see , however , is an additional 10 hotels were , on average , approximately $ 100,000 from breakeven ebitda in september .", "if we exclude the two big box hotels , the chicago marriott and the westin boston , from the 27 hotels we had

showing good strength and up 5 % .", "in fact , business transient rooms were 23 % of total rooms sold in the third quarter , up from only 19 % in the second quarter .", "the first data point is that

operating loss at the corporate noi level was $ 10 million per month in the quarter , as compared to our earlier estimate of $ 11.5 million , a $ 1.5 million per month improvement , owing , among

million per month .", "including capex , our total company burn rate was $ 17.7 million during the quarter and implies a cash runway through late 2022 .", "we updated our analysis of breakeven profitability and estimate that on whole , the portfolio will achieve breakeven profitability at 25 % occupancy on a gross operating profit basis and 40 % on a net operating income basis .", "this is about 500 basis points lower occupancy than our original -- or i should say , our earlier estimates of breakeven occupancy .", "the average daily rate assumed in this analysis is approximately 20 % to 25 % decline from 2019 levels .", "we ended the third quarter with $ 111 million of cash and over $ 300 million of undrawn capacity on our revolver .", "we executed a $ 119 million , 8.25 % series a
