leading advisory smd productivity .", "but we believe that we certainly have meaningful growth opportunities in both revenues and market share gains in the future .", "we have many opportunities to seize , but let me highlight three : first , we are highly focused on filling sector and geographic white space , both in north america and in europe in our advisory business ; and on continuing our client coverage initiatives focused on financial sponsors and large multinational corporations .", "second , we are deepening and broadening our product capabilities , particularly in ecm and debt advisory , including the addition of spac expertise and convertibles capability so that we have more fee opportunities with each of our clients and can increase our share of fees paid by our clients .", "and third , we are investing heavily in advisory capabilities that serve the fastest growing segments of the economy , including the four techs : fintech , biotech , cleantech , and traditional tech , particularly software .", "hiring a - plus talent and developing strong talent from within is critical to continuing to grow , and we have made notable progress on our hiring objectives this year .", "two new advisory smds joined us earlier this year , kristy grippi as our new head of ecm and juan pedro cozar as our head of iberia , and they already are having significant and positive impact on our business .", "three additional advisory smds , brad wolff covering biotech , brad david covering financial sponsors , and adi jayaraman covering fintech have joined us , and we expect them to begin to have an impact soon .", "three additional advisory smds have left their firms and will join evercore later this year covering the power and renewable space and basic materials .", "these smd additions in 2021 put us at the top end of our historical range of four to eight advisory smd recruits per year , and we continue to have meaningful and ongoing conversations with other potential recruits in areas of strategic significance .", "add to that the two advisory smds who were promoted earlier this year , and we have 10 new smds in advisory that are ramping up in areas of strategic importance to us .", "in addition to hiring at the most senior levels , we are adding talent at all levels of seniority to continue to enhance our coverage , to meet the needs of our clients , and to support the elevated pace of activity that john described .", "if we can continue to hire strong talent at all levels and offer more capabilities to serve clients , we will be able to enhance our already - strong and industry - leading advisory smd productivity levels and continue to grow the firm .", "and , of course , there is additional inherent growth potential from the 30 - plus senior managing directors , including the 10 from this year , that have joined or have been promoted over the past three years and are still ramping up to full productivity .", "and finally , we continue to add world - class senior research analyst like mark mahaney , the i.i. - ranked internet analyst who joined us earlier this year .", "now let me discuss our capital return approach .", "our goal has always been to return to our shareholders all of our earnings not invested in the business in the form of dividends and share repurchases .", "we achieved this goal in aggregate over a multi- year period through 2019 .", "and during the period 2015 to 2020 , we reduced our adjusted weighted share count by 9 % , or a little over 2 % a year .", "2020 , of course , was an anomalous year .", "we took several actions in 2020 to build a fortress balance sheet for our business .", "first , in the early days of the pandemic , when there was heightened uncertainty about the length and depth of the economic slowdown , we became more conservative in our capital return policy , temporarily suspending discretionary buybacks and keeping our dividend flat for two quarters .", "this resulted in increased cash holdings , particularly as our business recovered toward the end of the year .", "second , we decided to become more conservative in our long - term capital management approach .", "in addition to what we historically held cash for , minimum working capital requirements , including capital to support our underwriting activities , accrued cash bonuses and a portion of upcoming and a historical deferred compensation , we decided to prefund all of our awarded deferred cash compensation obligations , thus building a truly fortress balance sheet for our business .", "this catch - up was a one - time event .", "finally , we meaningfully increased the capital levels of our u.s. broker - dealer in the third quarter of 2020 to support our significantly expanded underwriting business , which as you may recall , had two very large transactions in the second quarter and is operating at a considerably higher level with a broader array of products than it has prior to 2020 .", "ultimately , because of our surprise in the fourth quarter , we ended 2020 with an excess cash position even when considering the funding of all of these capital requirements for the underwriting business and fully funding our awarded deferred compensation obligations .", "we also ended the first quarter of 2021 with an excess cash position .", "and while we have been working down our excess cash position , we still have more cash than we need to meet our fortress balance sheet requirements .", "so far this year we have returned $ 631.5 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases .", "we intend from this point forward to continue our pre-2020 practice of returning to shareholders all of our earnings not invested in the business , and also to work down opportunistically over time our excess cash position .", "this will in turn shrink our adjusted diluted weighted average share count over time as we did from 2015 until now , although going forward at a more accelerated pace than the 2 - plus percentage shrinkage over the last five years .", "it also will drive meaningful earnings per share growth .", "of the first 12 years that i have been doing evercore earnings calls , in 11 of those 12 years , we have had record revenues and earnings per share .", "sitting where we are today , with year - to - date revenues roughly $ 100 million below last year 's full - year record and nine month earnings per share about $ 0.80 above last year 's full - year record , let me guide all of you by saying that 2021 will be another record year in revenues and earnings for evercore .", "by the way , i got permission from our general counsel to say that .", "and it 's really a pleasure to be here doing my first earnings call with you and john as evercore 's cfo .", "for the third quarter of 2021 , net revenues , net income , and earnings per share on a gaap basis were $ 824 million , $ 160 million , and $ 3.74 , respectively .", "year - to - date , net revenues , net income , and earnings per share on a gaap basis were $ 2.17 billion , $ 444 million , and $ 10.19 , respectively .", "my comments from here will focus on non-gaap measures , which we believe are useful when evaluating our results .", "third quarter adjusted net revenues of $ 832 million grew 104 % year - over - year .", "year - to - date adjusted net revenues of $ 2.19 billion increased 62 % compared to the prior year period .", "this represents our best third quarter ever , our second - best quarter ever overall , and the first time adjusted net revenue surpassed $ 2 billion in the first nine months of the year .", "third quarter advisory fees of $ 709 million grew 161 % year - over - year .", "year - to - date advisory fees of $ 1.78 billion increased 84 % versus the prior year period .", "our advisory fees include , approximately , $ 93 million of revenue from transactions that closed in early october .", "as a reminder , in accordance with relevant accounting principles , we recognize revenue for deals that close early in the following quarter and certain closing conditions were satisfied at quarter - end .", "to compare , we recognized $ 59 million in the second quarter of 2021 and $ 20 million in the third quarter of 2020 .", "third quarter underwriting fees of $ 54 million reflected a decline of 18 % year - over - year .", "this compares favorably to the overall market for u.s. equity and equity - linked issuance which declined nearly 25 % year - over - year as spac activity slowed dramatically .", "we have been selective in spac underwriting activity , which helps protect our revenues from experiencing volatility associated with this market .", "year - to - date underwriting fees of $ 182 million are essentially flat versus the prior - year period , which as a reminder , included two sizable transactions in the second quarter of 2020 that totaled nearly $ 45 million in revenues .", "third quarter commissions and related revenue of $ 47 million increased 6 % year - over - year even as market volumes and volatility declined .", "check collections , which are driven by research votes , were strong .", "convertible securities , which we began trading in january , continued to contribute positively .", "year - to - date commissions and related revenue of $ 151 million declined 2 % versus the prior year period as market volatility declined significantly .", "third quarter asset management and administration fees of $ 20 million increased 21 % year over year on higher aum .", "year - to - date asset management and administration fees of $ 57 million increased 21 % versus the prior year period .", "our adjusted compensation ratio for the third quarter is 58.5 % , which brings our year - to - date comp ratio to 58.8 % .", "this reflects our current best estimate on compensation for the full year .", "as john indicated , our backlog is strong , but as always , our revenue in a given period depends on the timing of deal closings and that is even more so this year than in others .", "additionally , as has been widely reported , market pressures on compensation levels for junior and mid-level bankers remains high and hiring has been strong .", "as we always do , we will continue to evaluate the key drivers of our compensation as the year progresses and make adjustments in the fourth quarter if appropriate .", "third quarter non-compensation costs of $ 83 million increased 17 % year over year driven by higher professional fees due to higher activity levels and strong recruiting efforts , higher t&e due to both increased travel and entertainment , and higher occupancy expense due to more space as we grow as well as expenses relating to our return to the office .", "on a sequential basis , non-compensation expenses increased 14 % driven by higher professional fees which reflected the aforementioned recruiting costs , higher other operating expenses , and higher t&e .", "within other operating expenses , the increase was a result of higher bad debt expense .", "as many other firms have likely experienced , t&e has not rebounded as quickly as we anticipated earlier in the year .", "we expect non-comp expenses , including t&e , to continue to increase as we evolve toward more normal operations and t&e will naturally also tick up as we add smds and teams over time .", "in 2019 , of our t&e expense , 83 % was related to travel .", "year - to - date travel is running at about 20 % of 2019 levels , and we expect that to settle at 70 % to 80 % of pre-pandemic levels .", "we expect other t&e expenses to return to those experienced before the pandemics .", "third quarter adjusted operating income and adjusted net income of $ 262 million and $ 188 million increased 237 % and 258 % , respectively .", "year - to - date adjusted operating income and adjusted net income of $ 674 million and $ 505 million increased 156 % and 177 % , respectively , versus the prior year period .", "we delivered a third quarter adjusted operating margin of 31.5 % , while third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $ 3.96 increased 257 % year over year .", "our year - to - date adjusted margin is 30.7 % .", "adjusted earnings per share of $ 10.41 increased 170 % versus the prior year period .", "turning to our balance sheet , as of september 30th , we held $ 479 million in cash and equivalents and $ 1.3 billion in investment securities .", "as ralph mentioned earlier , even with our strong return of capital , our balance sheet grows throughout the year as we accrue for annual bonus compensation that is paid in the first quarter .", "our balance sheet also reflects the minimum levels of cash for operating our business , including capital to support our underwriting activities , commitments related to deferred cash compensation previously awarded , and cash needs for anticipated deferred compensation to be awarded in the first quarter , plus earnings that we recorded in the third quarter that have not yet been returned .", "year -
