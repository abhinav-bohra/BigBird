term guest deposits .", "and that 's deposits on bookings beyond 12 months , are 3 times historical levels , driven in part by our proactive efforts to open more inventory for sale in outer years .", "we continue to focus our efforts on our lower cost channels like direct marketing to our sizable past guest database of over 40 million guests , and earned media , as we build on our multiple new ship launches and restart news flow .", "in the report , we build on the achievement of our 2020 goal by sharing more details on our 2030 goals and our 2050 aspiration .", "we are committed to decarbonization , and we aspire to be carbon neutral by 2050 .", "as we have previously shared , despite 25 % capacity growth since that time , our absolute carbon emissions peaked in 2011 and will remain below those levels .", "i 'm very humbled by the dedication i 've seen in these past 18 months .", "our strategic decision to accelerate the exit of 19 ships left us with a more efficient and effective fleet , and has lowered our capacity growth to roughly 2.5 % compounded annually from 2019 through 2025 , and that 's down from 4.5 % pre-covid .", "and we will achieve a structural benefit to unit costs in 2023 as we introduce these new , larger and more efficient ships , coupled with the 19 ships leaving the fleet , which were among our least efficient , with the aggressive actions we 've already taken , optimizing our portfolio and reducing capacity .", "we ended the quarter with 35 % of our fleet capacity in service .", "our plans call for another 27 ships to restart guest cruise operations during the fourth quarter and the month of december .", "so on new year 's day , we anticipate celebrating with 55 ships or nearly 65 % of our fleet capacity back in service .", "for the third quarter , occupancy was 54 % across the ships in service .", "occupancy did improve month -
