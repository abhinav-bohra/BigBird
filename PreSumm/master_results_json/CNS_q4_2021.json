duration strategy and 4.0 years in our core preferred strategy .", "after high yield , preferreds offer the second - highest yields in fixed income and offer meaningful tax advantages for the taxable investor due to the high percentage of qualified dividend income that they produce .", "in terms of our private real estate initiative , we have commenced our investment process and have closed on several property acquisitions for both our income strategy and our opportunistic or capital appreciation strategy .", "this year , we will look to add a real estate investment strategist as part of our expansion of multi-strategy capabilities to help our teams and clients allocate between listed and private real estate and execute thematic and strategic research .", "we look forward to sharing our progress on this initiative in the future .", "in closing , we are very positive about the allocation trends we are seeing for our asset classes .", "in the institutional channel , we see a greater need to allocate to real assets .", "by example , in the private market , dry powder and private equity funds is at $ 390 billion for real estate and $ 300 billion for infrastructure .", "investors are becoming more comfortable with listed allocations to complement private , despite greater measured volatility .", "some investors want real assets with liquidity , particularly in the endowment and foundation and healthcare segments where some plans liquidity has been challenged .", "in our early stage pipeline , we have some sovereign wealth opportunities where the plan sponsors are making initial allocations to listed real estate and infrastructure .", "we would expect those initial small allocations to grow meaningfully to make it worthwhile for those plan sponsors to research the asset classes and oversee additional managers .", "in the wealth channel , we are seeing earlier - stage adoption of private real asset allocations .", "as we 've seen in other markets , this will help drive listed allocations over time .", "we believe the inflation environment will help provide additional support for these trends .", "finally , manager consolidation and conversions from passive to active are trends also in our favor as our performance continues to be excellent .", "2021 was a record - breaking year in myriad ways for cohen & steers .", "it marked our 35th anniversary and 17 years as a public company .", "for the quarter and year , we achieved a record number of records , driven by improving fundamentals , a rebounding economy , accompanied by the return of meaningful inflation .", "and for the first time in over a decade , the prospect of sustained fed tightening .", "as matt discussed , assets under management increased to a record $ 106 billion at year -
