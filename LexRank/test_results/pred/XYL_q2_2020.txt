Water Infrastructure orders grew 7%, and total backlog grew 24% in the quarter.
As we continue to feel the near-term impacts from COVID-19 across the emerging markets, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects for the water sector.
Now, I'd like to hand over to Mark to provide some detail in the second quarter, and then we'll come back to our outlook and the trends we see emerging through this period.
There is perhaps no service more essential than drinking water and wastewater.
The applied water segment's orders declined 17% in the quarter, while revenue declined 13% as site restrictions continue to impact customers across industrial, commercial and residential end markets.
As we noted last quarter, we expect utilities to continue to remain resilient as they focus on maintaining their critical infrastructure for wastewater collection and treatment.
However, there is significant divergence between wastewater and clean water.
As Mark mentioned, our wastewater business was down only modestly.
