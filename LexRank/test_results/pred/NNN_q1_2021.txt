Previously, we projected these cash basis tenants would pay at their historical payment rate of about 50% of rent.
Most notable collections from our cash basis tenants, which represent approximately $50 million or 7% of our annual base rent, improved to approximately 80% for the first quarter.
As Jay mentioned, we reported today rent collections of approximately 97% for the first quarter, 98% for April rent collection.
