Turning to our full-year 2020 guidance, as a result of the above average weather, we are increasing our 2020 consolidated earnings range from $4.75 to $4.95 per share to $4.95 to $5.15 per share.
As Jeff mentioned, I will cover our third quarter results and the impact from weather.
We also experienced 2.3% customer growth and 1.3% weather normalized sales growth in the third quarter 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.
The weather benefit has more than offset the additional costs and the reduction in sales due to COVID-19.
