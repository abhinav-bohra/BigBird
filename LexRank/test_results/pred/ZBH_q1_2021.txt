We've actually already had our first procedure using that application last week with very good results and this is just the latest addition to our ROSA robotics program, our platform here and it's also another launch inside of our ZB edge suite of integrated digital and robotic technologies.
But we absolutely believe that the vast majority of those patients who put off in elective procedure will come back into the funnel and that's going to provide a significant tailwind well into 2022 and I, for one, cannot wait for that tailwind and I can tell you that ZB is ready for them.
Those high-priority markets and submarkets where ZB has a path to leadership, and we believe are right to win in markets like sports medicine, ASC and in the external closure market for us and each of these deals gives us a gap filling and, we believe, differentiated product portfolio to drive growth, and that's important to growth, but also drive additional confidence in our ASC business category and of course, inside of this active portfolio management phase, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental business that we discussed back in Q4.
I'm very proud of the ZB team for how they stood up and delivered against a backdrop of a whole lot of things that were absolutely out of their control and I know I talk a lot about the importance of our talent, our mission, our culture here at ZB and I can tell that each were absolutely critical for us in 2020 and continue to be in 2021 and well beyond and with that in mind, we've made some additional changes to our leadership team here very recently.
Again, with multiple robotics launches, continuing success with Persona Revision, Persona iQ, new iterations of mymobility and just really the broader ZB edge ecosystem to drive mix benefit, for sure, but also competitive conversions.
