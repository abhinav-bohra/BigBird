These acquisitions combined with our strong first quarter results and solid orders momentum led us to substantially increase our full year sales and earnings guidance.
To summarize, AMETEK delivered an excellent first quarter with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion, a high quality of earnings and meaningful capital deployment.
With our strong results in the first quarter, including solid orders growth and a record backlog along with contributions from our recent acquisitions, we have increased our full-year sales and earnings guidance.
As Dave highlighted, AMETEK began the year with outstanding results highlighted by strong sales and orders growth and a high quality of earnings.
In addition to these acquisitions, AMETEK also acquired two smaller and yet highly strategic businesses, and [Phonetic] Crank Software and EGS Automation.
Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $1.58 billion on the acquisition of Abaco Systems and NSI-MI, resulting in $1.85 billion in total capital deployed on strategic acquisitions thus far this year.
This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.07 per diluted share, up 5% versus the first quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $0.97 to $1.02.
