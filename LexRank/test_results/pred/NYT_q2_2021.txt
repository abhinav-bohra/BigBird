As compared with 2019, print subscription revenues declined 5.5%, as single-copy and international bulk sale copy declined, while revenue from domestic home delivery subscriptions was flat.
Digital-only subscription revenue grew as a result of the large number of new subscriptions we have added in the past year, continued strength and retention of the $1 per week promotional subscriptions who graduated to higher prices, and finally, the positive impact from our digital subscription price increase, which began late in the first quarter of 2020.
We continue to expect to demonstrate pricing power throughout 2021 as the impact from subscriptions graduating from discounted promotions and the price increase on tenured digital subscription continues to provide a tailwind to digital news ARPU throughout the year.
While subscription unit growth was modest in the quarter, substantial growth in both subscription and advertising revenues, which were a result of fundamental strength in the underlying business, delivered strong financial results, especially when compared with the muted results from the second quarter of 2020.
Print subscription revenues increased more than 1% as home delivery revenues benefited from the first quarter price increase, which more than offset declines in subscription volume.
We now have more than eight million paid subscriptions across our digital and print products, a testament to the success of our strategy, the strength of the market for paid digital journalism and our unique opportunity to meet that demand.
