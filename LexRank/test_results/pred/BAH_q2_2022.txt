We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase by about 50% from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025.
We expect to continue building on our progress through the second half of the fiscal year.
However, we still expect to make those same investments in the second half of the fiscal year, which will pressure back half adjusted EBITDA margins.
In the first half of the fiscal year, we added approximately 1,500 employees.
This gives us great confidence in our plan for the full fiscal year.
