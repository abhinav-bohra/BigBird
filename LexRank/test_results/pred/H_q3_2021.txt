ALG now as part of Hyatt, immediately doubles the number of resorts in our portfolio, increases our European footprint by more than 60% and positions us as the world's largest operator of hotels in the fast-growing luxury all-inclusive resort segment.
We also expect the ALG brands to drive accretive rooms well into the future similar to what we've achieved with our Two Roads Hospitality acquisition in 2018, which has been a significant driver of growth for Hyatt this year, including conversions and expansion of our pipeline.
