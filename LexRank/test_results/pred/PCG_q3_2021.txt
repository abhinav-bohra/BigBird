Guided by former CAL FIRE and local fire authority personnel who now work for PG&E, we implemented additional wildfire mitigation in our high fire threat areas.
This year, we also implemented enhanced power line safety settings to address wildfire risk we faced from extreme drought conditions.
Our 2021 PSPS protocols are the right solution on high wind days, and our enhanced powerline safety settings are necessary and effective and reductions ignitions and the resulting damage, given our current drought conditions.
At PG&E, effective implementation of our wildfire mitigation plan is enabled by our lean operating systems, which we're deploying across the entire Company.
