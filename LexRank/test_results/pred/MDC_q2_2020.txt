As previously mentioned, our gross margin from home sales improved by 70 basis points year-over-year to 20.2%.
Backlog conversion for the third quarter may be slightly lower than the third quarter of 2019 as a result of the significant increase in June orders compared to the prior year, which we are unlikely to deliver in the third quarter.
The average selling price of homes in backlog increased 3% due to price increases implemented over the past 12 months, decreased incentives and a shift in mix to California.
The combination of our diverse selection of affordable homes, combined with our increasingly distinct build-to-order business model, has proven to resonate with homebuyers.
Gross margins increased on both build-to-order and speculative home deliveries, driven by price increases implemented across the majority of our communities over the past 12 months.
The combination of low interest rates, constrained existing home supply and a heightened interest in single-family home ownership has resulted in a very favorable environment for our industry.
We demonstrated solid operating leverage for the quarter as our SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues decreased 90 basis points year-over-year to 10.4%.
Homes delivered increased 25% year-over-year to 1,900, driven by an increase in the number of homes we had in backlog to start the quarter.
