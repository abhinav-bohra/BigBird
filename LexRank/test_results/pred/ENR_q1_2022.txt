Given the continued strength of demand in our categories and our efforts to offset the majority of these headwinds through pricing and cost reduction initiatives, we are maintaining our fiscal 2022 outlook for roughly flat net sales, adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3 to $3.30, and adjusted EBITDA of $560 million to $590 million.
First, our categories remain healthy with both battery and auto care showing robust demand versus pre-pandemic levels.
In battery and lights, strong demand and solid execution resulted in a modest decline in organic sales, while auto care continued its strong performance with organic growth of 1.3%.
This quarter also marks the conclusion of the integration of our battery and auto acquisitions.
Both battery and lights and auto care benefited from continued strong demand, pricing actions and distribution gains.
