In our international segment, second-quarter revenues increased 147% to $164 million or 137% on a constant-currency basis, primarily driven by the net impact from the acquisition of Bisnode and strong growth in both finance and risk and sales and marketing solutions.
Second-quarter international adjusted EBITDA of $43 million increased $23 million or 113% versus second quarter of 2020, primarily due to the net impact of the Bisnode acquisition, as well as revenue growth across our international businesses, partially offset by higher data costs.
Finance and risk revenues were $104 million, an increase of 92% or an increase of 85% on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to the Bisnode acquisition.
Sales and marketing revenues were $60 million, an increase of 383% or an increase of 366% on a constant-currency basis, primarily attributable to the Bisnode acquisition.
Excluding the impact of Bisnode, revenue grew 22% due to higher revenues from API offerings across our U.K. and Greater China markets and increased revenues from our Worldwide Network partners product royalties.
