We have to show you that we can deliver, but robotics is coming, RDN is coming, closed-loop SCS is coming and our diabetes turnaround is coming and Evolut FX and mitral and EV ICD, and the pending acquisition of Intersect ENT, these are all coming.

Medtronic is advancing a pipeline of meaningful innovation that we believe will not only enhance our competitiveness, but will accelerate our total Company growth going forward.
And as a result sales this fiscal year are likely to come in below our $50 million to $100 million target.
At recent rates, we're expecting a currency headwind on third quarter revenue of $80 million to $120 million.
We've recognized many of our customers are dealing with staffing shortages on top of increased COVID patients, and we believe that had an increasing effect on procedure volume.
