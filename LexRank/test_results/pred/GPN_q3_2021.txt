This quarter was no exception with our global merchant acquiring businesses delivering 900 basis points of outperformance relative to the credit trends reported by the card networks last week.
And we went live with Google as a merchant in multiple markets in Asia Pacific exactly as we said we would.
We now have 25 active prospects in our issuer pipeline with AWS, up from 20 last quarter and four at the end of 2020.
Examples of our exposure include through network initiatives, traditional issuers, private label or charge card and program management, virtual card issuance, non-traditional issuers, including fintech, start-ups and neobanks, unique collaborations with AWS and Google, large existing scale players looking to expand BNPL globally into new markets and with added functionality.
