The top two graphics summarize peer reinvestment rate normalized to a $50 and $60 WTI price environment.
The proof point for this sustainability is our five-year benchmark maintenance scenario that can deliver around $5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $50 per barrel WTI price environment or closer to $7 billion of free cash flow at the current forward curve, along with a corporate free cash flow breakeven of less than $35 per barrel throughout the period.
As you can see, our reinvestment rate, which is a reasonable proxy for both operating and capital efficiency in a maintenance or flat production scenario is among the lowest in our peer group.
Similarly, our 2021 capex per barrel of production on either an oil or oil equivalent basis is among the lowest in our space.
