Hospice referred admissions typically account for 50% of VITAS' total admissions and a significant portion of these referrals have very short length of stays.
This reduced occupancy in senior housing has had a corresponding reduction in VITAS nursing home admissions.
VITAS nursing home admissions decreased 22.6% in the third quarter of 2020 and declined 19.3% in the fourth quarter when compared to the equivalent prior year quarter.
Nursing home patients represented 14.7% of the VITAS fourth quarter 2020 patient census, which is our 310 basis point reduction when compared to the prior-year quarter.
The most complex issue facing VITAS over the past nine months has been the disruptive impact the pandemic has had on traditional hospice referral sources, which in turn has impacted our patient census patterns.
VITAS' average daily census in 2021 is estimated to decline approximately 5% and full-year adjusted EBITDA margin prior to Medicare Cap is estimated to be 19.4%.
This decline in nursing home admissions is a direct result of continued disruption in the senior housing occupancy.
