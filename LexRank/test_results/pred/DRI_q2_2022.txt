We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels, same restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31% and 35 to 40 new restaurants.
Capital spending of approximately $425 million, total inflation of approximately 5.5% with commodities inflation between 7% and 8%, total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5% which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%.
As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden was 18.8%, 230 basis points better than pre-COVID levels.
Total sales for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, 37% higher than last year, driven by 34.4% same restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants.
Our other segment grew sales by 7% versus pre-COVID and segment profit margin by 250 basis points.
Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing second quarter performance is a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020.
This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID similar to our previous outlook of 200 to 250 basis points with flow-through from pricing and higher sales helping offset elevated inflation.
