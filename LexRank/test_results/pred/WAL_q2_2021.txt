A majority of growth this quarter was driven by an increase in residential real estate loans of $2 billion, which now comprise 17% of total loans as we look to deploy excess liquidity and integrated new flow arrangements from the recent Galton and AmeriHome transactions.
Finally tangible book value per share decreased $0.16 over the prior quarter to $0.3286 but increased 18% year-over-year again driven by the AmeriHome acquisition of intangible assets that were largely offset by Q2 earnings and the issuance of common stock from our ATM of 700,000 shares for $70 million.
