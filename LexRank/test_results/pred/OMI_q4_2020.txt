This slight increase in revenue was due to growth in our home healthcare business, coupled with higher levels of PPE sold through Medical Distribution, partially offset by the negative impact of COVID-19 on elective procedures versus the prior year.
Our strong execution in serving our customers, along with very high demand for PPE, growth in home healthcare and productivity gains across the company, led to very strong bottom line results.
These investments and operational improvements enabled us to strengthen our position as one of the world's largest vertically integrated manufacturer of healthcare PPE.
