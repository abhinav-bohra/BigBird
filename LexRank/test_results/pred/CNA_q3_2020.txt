As part of our reserve review this year, we made adjustments to both the discount rate and mortality assumptions, resulting in a reserve strengthening of $46 million on a pre-tax basis.
The underlying loss ratio was 60%, and the expense ratio was 30.5%.
We also had an improved underlying loss ratio and a lower expense ratio for the quarter.
The underlying loss ratio was 60.1%, and the expense ratio was 34.9%.
The lower P&C expense ratio of 31.8% largely reflected our growing premium base, which contributed approximately 0.7 points of the improvement in our underlying combined ratio.
