Operating profit in this segment grew 18.2% year-over-year to $84.7 million, reflecting efficient labor management, reduced bad debt expense and ongoing client demand for higher margin virus protection services.
Free cash flow from continuing operations was $79.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021, down from $121.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.
The increase in our adjusted earnings forecast is due to our strong financial performance over the first nine months of fiscal 2021, as well as our favorable outlook for the fourth quarter of the year.
The improvement in operating margin is attributable to a favorable shift in business mix as we emphasize higher margin airport facility contracts and from stronger client demand for virus protection services compared to the prior year period.
As Scott mentioned, our increased guidance for full year fiscal 2021 adjusted income from continuing operations is now a range of $3.45 to $3.55 per diluted share, compared to $3.30 to $3.50 per diluted share previously.
Revenue in our largest segment, Business & Industry, grew 6.7% year-over-year to $807.7 million, benefiting from increased office occupancy in the quarter as well as continued elevated demand for virus protection services.
