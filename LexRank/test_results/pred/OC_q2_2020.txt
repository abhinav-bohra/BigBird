Insulation EBIT decreased by $10 million.
Based on all these factors, Roofing EBIT margins in the third quarter could be slightly better than our second quarter margins, normalized for the 150 basis point benefit from the tariff recovery that Prith mentioned in his remarks.
We are also realizing benefits from the longer-term structural changes we made prior to the pandemic in our Insulation and Composites businesses.
Despite these difficult global market conditions, the Composites business still delivered positive EBIT margins and strong cash flow performance in the quarter due to continued focus on operating performance and initiatives around costs and productivity that we have discussed previously.
And Composites EBIT decreased by $61 million.
