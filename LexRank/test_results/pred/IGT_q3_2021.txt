The performance of each of our business segments has been impressive with Global Lottery achieving record results on strong player demand, global gaming delivering sequentially higher results each quarter since 2019 and Digital & Betting drives significant growth in a nicely profitable business.
As a reminder, the first half of 2021 benefited from some discrete items in our Lottery business between gaming hall closures in Italy, elevated multi-stage app productivity and LMA performance in the U.S.
Operating income increased more than 140% year-on-year on high profit flow-through of global Lottery same-store sales growth, including a positive mix impact from Italy lottery sales and strong operating leverage across business segments, primarily associated with savings from the OPtiMa program.
We recently won several new contracts, including a 10-year facilities management contract with the Connecticut Lottery, where IGT is displacing an incumbent.
IGT's Mobile Lottery Solutions want Lottery Product of the Year at the 2021 International Gaming Awards.
