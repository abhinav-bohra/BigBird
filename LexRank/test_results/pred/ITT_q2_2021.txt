Similar to the rest of ITT, orders growth was incredibly strong, driven by our connector business, with continued North American distribution strength and growth in aerospace OE and aftermarket.
On July 1, ITT divested 100% of its equity of a subsidiary that holds legacy asbestos liabilities and related insurance assets to Delticus, a portfolio company of Warburg Pincus.
These will be driven by the strength in Friction, and short-cycle orders growth in both IP and CCT.
As a result of the transaction, ITT removed all asbestos obligations, related insurance assets, and associated deferred tax assets from our consolidated balance sheet as of the second quarter.
