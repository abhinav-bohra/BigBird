As evidenced, we completed several contract extensions, primarily in our medical, transportation and aerospace and defense end-use markets.
These sequential results reflect similar weakened demand conditions in our largest end-use market of aerospace and defense as the supply chain continues to deal with near-term reductions in OEM build rates.
As Tony covered in his review of the end-use markets, the year-over-year decline is attributable to the ongoing demand headwinds in our key end-use markets of aerospace and defense and medical as a result of the global pandemic.
We have been successful in mitigating a portion of the near-term impact of the aerospace downturn by capitalizing on growing demand for our solutions in transportation and industrial and consumer end-use markets, namely our semicon business.
