AAM delivered strong operating performance in the second quarter of 2021 navigating industry production volatility stemming from the continuity of supply challenges.
Today's announcement clearly underscores AAMâ€™s technology in electric vehicle propulsion and our commitment to excellence within this space.
Reflecting the impact of this activity, AAM generated adjusted free cash flow of $136.1 million in the second quarter of 2021.
This was a compelling high value purchase which should immediately benefit AAM as also part of our long-term lightweighting component strategy.
Operational excellence is a core value for AAM and will certainly benefit us and provide us the competitive advantage going forward.
