In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12% as renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business achieved a record 10.9%, driven by record renewal rate change, while retention remained strong.
Higher net favorable prior year reserve development, underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower cat losses, all contributed to the favorable year-over-year increase.
The principal driver of the higher level of core income for the quarter was very strong underlying underwriting income, resulting from record net earned premium of $7.5 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 88.7%.
Net written premiums in the quarter grew by 3%, driven by strong renewal rate change broadly across the book and continued strong retention in all three segments.
In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%, driven by strong renewal premium change in our Agency Homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners.
We're pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.6%, which improved by 2.8 points from the prior year quarter.
