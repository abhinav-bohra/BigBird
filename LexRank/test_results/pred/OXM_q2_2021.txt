During the second quarter, our combine to direct-to-consumer, full price store and e-commerce comp grew by an impressive 22% compared to 2019 with 15% growth in our biggest brand, Tommy Bahama and a remarkable 31% growth in Lilly Pulitzer.
For the year, we expect our total e-commerce business to be roughly a third of consolidated sales, compared to 23% in fiscal 2019.
Our e-commerce business has been enhanced by our ship from store capability, which allows us to leverage inventories located in stores, to serve the e-commerce demand, as well as demand from other stores.
While e-commerce is our fastest growing channel, physical stores remain an incredibly important part of our direct-to-consumer business.
Growth in our direct-to-consumer channel was led by our highly profitable e-commerce business, which grew by 49% over the second quarter of 2019.
In our Southern Tide business, excellent growth in e-commerce, plus the addition of our new retail stores, drove 17% sales growth, which, combined with expanded gross margins, resulted in a 21% operating margin.
