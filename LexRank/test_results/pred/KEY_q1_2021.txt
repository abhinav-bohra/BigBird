In addition to adding high-quality loans to our balance sheet, consumer mortgage fees were up 135% from the year-ago period.
Consumer loans benefited from the continued growth from Laurel Road and as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business with $3 billion of consumer mortgage loans this quarter.
PPP loans had an impact of $7 billion in the first quarter of 2021 average balances.
Consumer loans were up 1% from the prior quarter, again related to continued production from consumer mortgage and Laurel Road.
Average loans are expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of PPP and stronger commercial growth in the second half of the year.
Commercial loans reflected Key's participation in PPP, partially offset by decreased utilization.
