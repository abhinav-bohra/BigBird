At the beginning of the third quarter, we owned or controlled more than a three-year supply of land based on our trailing 12-month closings.
With our reunderwriting process complete and demand improvements evident, we have resumed our regular land acquisition and development activity and expect to return to more normalized spending levels in our fiscal fourth quarter and into fiscal 2021.
I will then come back to provide an update on our land spending and balance sheet, followed by a wrap up by Allan.
This process resulted in modest land acquisition and development spending during the quarter totaling just under $56 million.
This position allowed us to pause land spending, assess the demand environment and reunderwrite land deals that were in process.
