This strong backlog level supports our guidance for the rest of fiscal 2021.
We've had a healthy level of that type of revenue in fiscal 2020, and we'll actually have a greater revenue level in fiscal 2021 compared to 2020.
For a comparison, we are projecting that fiscal 2021 revenue compared to fiscal 2020 revenue for the Defense work will be up about 50%.
Any other time this would have been an order placed, put into our backlog and be a contributor to current year revenue.
A key component there is our work for the Defense because of the long live nature of that backlog that gives us a strong level of predictable revenue.
70% to 75% of that backlog is planned to convert over the next 12 months.
