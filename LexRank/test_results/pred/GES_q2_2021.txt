Our stores were closed for approximately 30% of the days in the quarter, and when they were open, traffic was roughly half of our customer flow in the prior year.
Overall sales productivity for our retail stores since reopening for the quarter was down 21% in the US and Canada, down 31% in Europe and down 26% in Asia.
Revenues were negatively impacted by store closures in all regions at the beginning of the quarter and lower productivity to prior year at stores once open.
We are happy to report that most of our stores worldwide are now reopened.
Regarding rent, we are still in negotiations with our landlords to appropriately adjust our rental expenses in line with the store closures and declines in traffic.
As we look into the second half of the year, we expect a slow recovery of our retail business, driven by similar metrics to those that we have seen since we have reopened our stores, but with a gradual improvement in customer traffic.
Margins were better than planned as we managed inventories well and benefited from positive rent relief in Europe.
While we reduced marketing spend dramatically during the second quarter, we see an opportunity to increase our investment in the second half of the year to continue to strengthen our brand position and drive traffic.
Our e-commerce business in North America and Europe was up [Phonetic] 9% for the quarter.
While many people feel more comfortable shopping online than in stores, those that do venture out are much more intentional to make a purchase when they visit.
