Last year, Northwest Natural scored second in the West for large utilities in the J.D. Power Gas Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study and were named a Customer Champion by Escalent after placing second in the nation among electric and gas utilities in their most recent study.
Our water utilities operating in the Pacific Northwest served customers through the February event without disruption.
Utility margin in the Gas Distribution segment increased $13.6 million as a result of the new rates and customer growth, which were partly offset by the $1.8 million greater loss from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism as we purchased higher gas -- priced gas during the February cold weather event than was forecasted for the year.
