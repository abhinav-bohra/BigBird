We're also very pleased with our Americas Wholesale business, which grew 19% in sales and 54% in operating profit versus LLY.
The entire decline to LLY was due to a timing shift of European wholesale shipments into Q3 and permanent store closures, which are accretive to operating profit.
Overall, the 8% revenue decline to LLY was driven by the impact of permanent store closures worth roughly 5% of revenue and the shift in wholesale shipments in Europe.
This was slightly short of our expectations, as a result of timing in our European wholesale business worth about 4% to LLY, where delays in product receipts moved some shipments a few weeks into the third quarter.
