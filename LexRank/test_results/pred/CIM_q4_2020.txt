Securitization enables us to finance our mortgage loans for longer term by transferring them from our loan warehouse into mortgage trust as we sell senior notes in each deal.
In total, Chimera sponsored $4.2 billion and 11 separate securitized deals for the calendar year 2020, and we retained $655 million in subordinate notes.
This year, we will continue to seek ways to improve upon or lower our liability cost for securitized debt as well as the back-end financing of our retained securities from Chimera securitizations.
Chimera retained $48 million of subordinate notes.
