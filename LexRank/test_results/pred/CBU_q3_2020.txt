Ending loans were down $69.4 million or 0.9% from the end of the linked second quarter, due to a decline in business activities in the company's markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Similarly, total revenues were up $7.7 million or 5.3% on a linked quarter basis, due to a $1 million or 1.1% increase in net interest income, a $4.8 million or 33.4% increase in banking noninterest revenues and a $2 million or 5.1% increase in revenues from our financial services businesses.
This compares to 0.42% of total loans outstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and 0.36% at the end of the linked second quarter of 2020.
Similarly, average interest earning assets for the third quarter of 2020 of $11.96 billion were up $852.5 million or 7.7% from the linked second quarter of 2020, and up $2.15 billion or 21.9% from one year prior.
The decrease in the provision for credit losses during the third quarter as compared to the prior two quarters was due to improving economic conditions, modest levels of delinquent nonperforming loans, a decrease in loans outstanding, low levels of net charge-offs and a large decrease in the number and amount of the company's loan balances subject to borrow forbearance.
