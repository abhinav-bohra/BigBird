The business strategy put in place in Soma around inventory, products, marketing, and digital is working, and we have every confidence applying the same strategy as Chico's and White House Black Market will continue the apparel sales momentum.
Total company on-hand inventories for the first quarter compared to 2019 were down 21%, with Soma up 13% and the apparel brands down 35.3%, illustrating these strategic investments in Soma's growth and our turnaround strategy in apparel.
We have successfully opened 30 Soma shop-in-shops inside Chico's stores.
Looking at the first quarter compared to 2019, comparable sales decline 22%, with Soma up 39%, and the apparel brands down 33%.
Total first-quarter sales grew 38% over last year, spurred by Soma's extraordinary sales growth of 65%, as well as fantastic customer response to Chico's and White House Black Market, which drove 31% growth in our apparel brand.
