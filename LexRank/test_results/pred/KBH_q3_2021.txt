For 2022, we are forecasting housing revenues of over $7 billion, supported by our anticipated 2021 year-end backlog, community count growth and an ongoing strong demand environment throughout next year.
In the third quarter, our overall average selling price of homes delivered rose to approximately $427,000 from approximately $385,000, reflecting the strength of the housing market.
Considering our quarter-end backlog, the status of our homes under construction and expected construction cycle times, we anticipate our fourth quarter housing revenues will be in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion.
Our forecasted 2021 full year results represent significant improvements across virtually all our key metrics with notable increases in our scale, absorption pace, housing gross margin and operating margin.
Assuming no inventory related charges, we believe our fourth quarter housing gross profit margins will be in the range of 21.6% to 22%, reflecting the impact of peak lumber prices when our forecasted fourth quarter whole deliveries were started.
Our performance in the third quarter reflected significant year-over-year increases across the majority of our key metrics as we produced solid results in housing market, experiencing great demand, while also facing industrywide challenges in getting homes completed and delivered.
We anticipate a return on equity this year of about 20% and further expansion in 2022, supported by double-digit growth in revenues and community count, with higher margins, as well as our recent share repurchase.
In the third quarter, we produced measurable year-over-year improvements in nearly all our key metrics, including a 49% increase in housing revenues that drove a 93% expansion in our earnings per diluted share.
