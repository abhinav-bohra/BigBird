Last quarter, we announced a phased integrated capacity expansion plan that included converting our mill in Houlton, Maine from LSL and OSB to SmartSide, the restart of our Peace Valley OSB mill in Fort St. John, British Columbia, and plans to convert our OSB mill in Sagola, Michigan Society.
Last quarter, I spoke about the challenges presented by shortages of MDI, the resident use and manufacture of SmartSide and OSB.
LP's ability to substitute alternate resins for OSB production and therefore, to be able to strategically allocate all available MDI to the Siding was a unanticipated benefit of having these segments under the LP umbrella.
SmartSide uses MDI exclusively, but OSB can use alternate rests.
Slide six shows summarized results for the quarter, which, much like the fourth quarter, are clean and straightforward with ongoing SmartSide growth and higher OSB prices as the most significant drivers.
And while challenges remain, very strong housing in RNR markets resulting in intense demand for SmartSide and OSB, keeping our near-term outlook exceptionally positive.
Continued SmartSide growth and OSB price appreciation resulted in $93 million and $333 million, respectively, of incremental revenue for the quarter, compared to which everything else is really just a rounding error.
