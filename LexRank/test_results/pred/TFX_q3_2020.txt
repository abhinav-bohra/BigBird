In total, we estimate that COVID-19 negatively impacted our adjusted gross profit by approximately $59 million in the quarter.
The decline in revenue was due to COVID-19, which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately $81 million across several global product categories.
If we were to normalize for the negative COVID impact, we estimate that our underlying business grew by approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our quarter two revenue performance.
However, we estimate that we would have had positive constant currency revenue growth in the high single digits, if not for the impact of COVID-19.
