We continued to make progress on our core priorities for the business: leasing, operating and marketing our outlet centers.
We continue to deliver strong pop-up leasing activity, which serves several important functions: introducing new brands to the outlet channel that may convert to long-term permanent tenants, creating retail vibrancy in an otherwise dark store; providing variety to the center and more choice for our shoppers, delivering immediate NOI contributions; and, in certain cases, allowing us to maintain occupancy on a temporary basis as we defer long-term leases for market improvement.
Developing new business with local and regional brands is one of our leasing priorities.
