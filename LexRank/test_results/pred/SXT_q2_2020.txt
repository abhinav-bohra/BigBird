Because of the impact of the -- because of the impact of Personal Care, we would expect the Color Group to be flat in revenue and profit for the year.
Unfortunately, the growth in Food & Beverage Colors revenue was offset by a more than 20% decline in our Personal Care business revenue.
Similar to the Flavor Group, Colors continues to focus on retaining existing business and improving the Group's overall sales win rate.
In summary, I expect mid-single digit revenue growth and mid to high single-digit operating profit growth for the Flavor Group for the remainder of the year.
In terms of operating profit, the Color Group achieved mid-single-digit profit growth in Food & Beverage Colors for the quarter and has generated double-digit operating profit growth for the year.
Excluding divestiture-related costs and the results of operations to be divested, consolidated adjusted revenue was $294.9 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $302.8 million in the second quarter of 2019.
The Group delivered outstanding profit growth in the quarter and I anticipate the Group to return to revenue growth once restrictions in certain areas begin to ease.
