We finished last year with strong momentum in growing customer relationships, achieving outstanding yearly subscriber growth across Mobility, fiber, and HBO Max.
Growth in mobility was more than offset by a decline at WarnerMedia from the increased HBO Max investment, the new DIRECTV advertising channel arrangements, and lower contribution from basic networks.
We added more than one million fiber subscribers for the fourth consecutive year, and full year broadband revenues were up 6.5% as we returned our Consumer Wireline business to revenue growth.
Driven by our strength in fiber, total Consumer Wireline revenues were up for the third consecutive quarter.
Consumer Wireline revenues and EBITDA are expected to grow on improving fiber subscriber trends.
As our pre-release earlier this month already indicated, we continue to deliver growth in postpaid phones, fiber, and HBO Max.
And it will be enhanced by our accelerated fiber expansion in 5G spectrum deployment, a great reputation for advanced and reliable networking and our expertise to bring it all together for the customer.
In wired broadband, we have the fastest-growing fiber network and expect to capitalize on the expansion of our fiber footprint and accelerate subscriber growth.
As we expand our fiber reach, we'll be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity and stabilize our Business Wireline unit by growing connectivity with small to midsized businesses.
We added 271,000 fiber customers even in a traditionally slow fourth quarter.
And our fiber network continues to get even better with our new multi-gig speeds for AT&T fiber.
