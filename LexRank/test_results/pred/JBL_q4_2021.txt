In FY '22, in spite of supply chain headwinds, we expect incredibly strong growth in automotive and continued solid growth in healthcare and packaging, industrial, semi cap, 5G wireless, and cloud.
We look to deliver a core operating margin of 4.5% on revenues of $31.5 billion, a 30 basis point expansion when compared to fiscal '21.
Jabil is well-positioned to help customers in the semi cap space with end-to-end solutions spanning the front end with design and complex fabrication equipment along with the back end with validation and test solutions.
So from mobility to retail automation to complex heavy industrial equipment, Jabil helps customers navigate large complex material supply chains while effectively managing change, mitigating risks, and delivering quickly and efficiently.
Fiscal '21 came in well ahead of plan, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.2%.
An example of the type of actions we're taking is the addition of our internal DE&I council, which was established in 2020, a nine-person council which guides us and advocates for the broader Jabil.
Our strategic collaboration, which we have highlighted in previous years, has enhanced our credibility within the industry and has further enabled Jabil to benefit from this outsourcing trend.
