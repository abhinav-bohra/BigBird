After the completion of this refinancing transaction, Carriage will have a maximum financial flexibility to pursue a range of value creation and capital allocation opportunities, including partnering and acquiring the best remaining funeral home and cemetery businesses in the country, who will look to Carriage as the succession planning solution of choice within our industry; invest in strategic growth projects throughout our portfolio; opportunistically repurchase our shares, all while remaining at a more modest leverage profile as the vast majority of these will be funded by our growing and recurring free cash flow.
Now what we couldn't have known one year ago, when we invited Dewayne to do his testimonial, is that Mike Doherty, the third-generation member of Fairfax Memorial Park and Funeral Home in Fairfax, Virginia, was on that call and listening carefully to what Dewayne had to say about Carriage being a family succession solution, which Fairfax was looking for at the time.
As I review our results, it is important to recognize the full impact of the operating and financial and value creation leverage dynamics that allowed Carriage to leverage organic revenue growth into higher growth rates in total Field EBITDA, adjusted consolidated EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
