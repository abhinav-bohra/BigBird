As a result, we expect to finish the fiscal year with a consolidated full year non-GAAP operating margin at or near double digits, more consistent with our performance in the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter.
GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54 for the fiscal 2022 first quarter versus $0.10 in the prior quarter.
Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the fiscal '22 first quarter was 25.9% versus 19.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.
We expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2022 year to be between 25.5% and 26.5%.
Starting with our wholesale segment, delivered sales for the quarter grew 76% to $393 million compared with the prior year period, compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 first quarter, sales were 23% higher for a compounded annual growth rate of 11%.
The increase in our effective tax rate for this year's first quarter versus last year's first quarter was primarily due to additional tax benefits from stock compensation in fiscal 2021 which did not occur in fiscal 2022.
