Commercial Aerospace represented approximately 48% of the total first-quarter sales.
Space and Defense represented 36% of first-quarter sales and totaled $111.7 million, basically unchanged from the same period in 2020.
We continue to expect destocking to wind down during the second quarter of 2021, consistent with what we have communicated during our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call.
The sales decrease year-over-year reflects production rate decreases by our Commercial Aerospace customers in response to the pandemic, combined with the continued Commercial Aerospace supply chain destocking.
We expect the aerospace supply chain destocking to largely come to an end during the second quarter 2021.
Commercial Aerospace sales of a $147.6 million, decreased 59.7% compared to the third quarter of 2020 as destocking continues to impact our sales.
