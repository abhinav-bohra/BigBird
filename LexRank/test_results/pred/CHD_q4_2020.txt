Number one, we only buy brands that are number 1 or number 2 in their categories.
We've got a long runway on U.S. power brands going global, a number of acquisitions with very low household penetration versus their lead markets, and enormous opportunity in emerging markets where we've just started opening new offices to help us reach these consumers and a number of strategic investments in resources and capabilities like e-commerce and pricing to help make sure our great international team is working as efficiently and effectively as possible to drive profitable growth long into the future.
It wasn't only consumers buying these categories, they bought our brands in unprecedented numbers.
And then, marketing change was up 140 basis points in the quarter as we invested behind our brands to enter 2021 with momentum.
Number one, self-care at home for our hair care and removal hair businesses like Nair and Flawless, cat ownership for Cat Litter, higher consciousness of germs and cleanliness benefiting ARM & HAMMER, OxiClean, XTRA but also Kaboom, and four, awareness trend with a regular daily intake of supplements, Vitafusion, L'il Critters and Viviscal will benefit, and Waterpik for gum health.
If we look a level deeper in key drivers, in our subsidiaries, we continue to make great headway in turning our U.S. domestic power brands into international power brands.
We focus on power brands, we have 13 power brands in our company that are displayed here on this chart.
Last but not least, you know how acquisitive we are, and I'm happy to share that we've delivered double-digit growth on Waterpik and Flawless in 2020 and they remain far underrepresented in international household penetration than in the U.S. lead market.
