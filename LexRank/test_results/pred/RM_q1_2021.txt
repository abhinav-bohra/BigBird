Despite pressure from a combination of tax refunds and two stimulus payments in the quarter, our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $18 million, or 2%, over the prior-year period, and was down only $28 million, or 2.5%, quarter over quarter.
On a sequential basis, our G&A expense rose 1 million, in line with our expectations due to lower deferred loan origination costs and fewer seasonal loan originations in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter.
