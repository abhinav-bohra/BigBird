Similar to our multifamily resident industry minutes, our office tenants are relatively weighted to the stronger economic sectors than the U.S. overall, which has helped us experience limited bad debt thus far.
We did not increase rents on 12-plus month renewals and for the second quarter, which impacted our NOI growth as we normally would be achieving significant rent increases during the strong second quarter leasing season, especially since we had such strong lease rate growth in March.
Our capital expenditure reductions include nonessential building improvements, tenant improvements and leasing costs, perspective of leasing as well as lower multifamily renovation capex.
Excluding the impact of bad debt, we expect the impact of COVID-19 on our multifamily NOI to translate to a reduction of approximately $0.03 per share relative to our initial core FFO guidance for 2020.
Retail now comprises just 6% of NOI and while retail tenants have struggled the most, we collected 72% of retail rents in the second quarter.
Same-store NOI decreased in our residual retail centers, which we report as other, by 24.6% on a GAAP basis and 22.1% on a cash basis, driven primarily by higher credit losses, which included amounts to do from tenants impacted by COVID-19, been likely not collectible.
Our multifamily same-store NOI increased by 0.7% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 0.8% year-over-year on a cash basis.
Office lease expirations represent approximately 4% of our office revenues and less than 2% of our overall revenue.
