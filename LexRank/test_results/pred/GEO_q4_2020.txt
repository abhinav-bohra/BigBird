Our GEO care segment has also been impacted by lower occupancy levels across our reentry centers, day reporting programs, and youth services facilities due to COVID-19.
Consistent with the efforts undertaken by our GEO secure services facilities, we have been focused on implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies, all of our residential facilities and GEO reentry and GEO youth services issued guidance consistent with the guidance issued by the CDC.
Over the course of the pandemic, we experienced a decline in overall occupancy levels at several of our federal facilities.
Due to the decline in the overall federal population, we have previously announced that the Federal Bureau of Prisons had decided not to renew three of our BOP contracts that are scheduled to expire during the first quarter of 2021.
Today, we reported fourth-quarter revenues of approximately $578 million and net income attributable to GEO of $0.09 per diluted share.
Contractor-operated facilities have historically been used by the Bureau of Prisons to house almost entirely non-U.S. citizen criminal aliens serving sentences for federal crimes committed in the United States.
More recently, we're pleased to have been awarded a new contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons for a 118-bed Residential Reentry Center in Tampa -- and -- in the Tampa, Florida area which we expect to activate during the second half of 2021.
We continuously evaluate these steps and we'll make adjustments as appropriate and necessary based on updated guidance by the CDC and other best practices.
As we have previously disclosed, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has decided that it will not renew our contracts for the D. Ray James, Georgia; Rivers, North Carolina; and Moshannon Valley, Pennsylvania facilities due to the decline in the federal prison populations more recently as a result of the COVID pandemic.
We continuously evaluate these steps and we'll make adjustments based on updated guidance by the CDC and other best practices.
