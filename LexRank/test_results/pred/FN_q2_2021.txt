Within optical communications, telecom revenue was $273.2 million, up 5% from last quarter.
In optical communications, we had anticipated that continued telecom strength would offset continuing softness from datacom products that are deployed inside the data center.
We are optimistic that this momentum in the automotive space will continue into the third quarter revenue.
Looking at our non-optical communications business, automotive has grown to become the largest category with record revenue of $47 million in the second quarter, up 34% sequentially and more than 100% from a year ago.
This faster ramp will also contribute to our anticipated growth in optical communications revenue in the third quarter.
In summary, we are pleased to deliver a record second quarter result and are optimistic that the third quarter will produce another record performance.
In fact, we saw modest growth in optical communications revenue in the second quarter.
