Supply chain disruptions and labor constraints impacting North America plants that supply APAC also limited our ability to meet orders across the region with the largest impact experienced in China and Japan.
For the third quarter of 2021, Tennant reported net sales of $272 million, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year, which included a favorable foreign currency effect of 1.2% and a divestiture impact of negative 2% related to the sale of our Coatings business in the first quarter of 2021.
Our continued execution of our enterprise strategy has enabled us to better navigate to continued macro challenges facing the overall economy.
The challenges we're facing with global supply chain and labor shortages are not unique to Tennant and are likely to remain for the foreseeable future.
