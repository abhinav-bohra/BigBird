Our fourth quarter consolidated results were positively impacted by significantly stronger spot tanker rates at Teekay Tankers, the start-up of various growth projects and higher charter rates secured on certain LNG carriers at Teekay LNG, improved results from our directly owned FPSO units and lower G&A expenses across the group.
Additionally, Teekay LNG continues to execute on its balanced capital allocation strategy, which includes prioritizing balance sheet delevering for now and second consecutive year of over 30% increase in quarterly cash distributions with a 32% increase commencing in May 2020.
