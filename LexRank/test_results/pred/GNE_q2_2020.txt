The increase was powered by higher per meter electricity consumption resulting from the general acquisition of higher consumption meters, warmer weather than the year-ago quarter and increased residential electricity consumption from residential customers as part of the transition to work from home during COVID-19.
This quarter we benefited from the strong consumption levels at Genie Retail Energy, and our consolidated gross margin rebounded to 25.6% from 14.7% in the year-ago quarter.
To wrap up, we met the various challenges of the COVID-19 environment, posted a strong second quarter, significantly improving on the financial results of the same period a year-ago, strong consumption per electricity meter and reduction in customer acquisition spend keyed substantial year-over-year improvement in our bottom line results.
