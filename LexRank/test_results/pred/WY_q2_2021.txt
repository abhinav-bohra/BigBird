Although our sawlog and fiber log pricing should be comparable to the second quarter, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly lower due to a higher percentage mix of fiber logs.
As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.
In Japan and China, demand for our logs remained strong, and our sales realizations increased significantly.
For lumber, our quarter-to-date realizations are approximately $425 lower, and current realizations are approximately $535 lower than the second quarter average.
We anticipate slightly lower domestic log sales realizations in the third quarter, absent significant fire-related disruption.
