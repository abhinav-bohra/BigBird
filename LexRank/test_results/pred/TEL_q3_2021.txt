Our auto business grew 90% organically and we are benefiting from the market recovery and are demonstrating continued content outperformance due to our leading global position.
In our industrial segment, orders grew 8% sequentially and with growth in industrial equipment, energy and medical and flat orders in AD&M which indicates the stabilization that I mentioned earlier.
Transportation orders remained elevated due to the market recovery, as well as the auto industry supply dynamics.
You'll see this in our transportation segment with electric vehicle adoption accelerating in our communications segment around cloud investment and in our industrial segment with capital spending accelerating globally around factory automation as well as digitization.
Starting with transportation, our sales were up approximately 70% organically year-over-year with growth in each of our businesses.
And you see this with our adjusted operating margin in the segment of 23.5%, which is up 760 basis points versus the prior year.
