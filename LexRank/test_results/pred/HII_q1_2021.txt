The team at Ingalls is also working closely with the Navy to put LPD 32 and 33, along with LHA nine under contract.
This was primarily due to growth at Newport News and Ingalls that was largely offset by a decline of Technical Solutions due to divestitures associated with the portfolio-shaping actions we have taken.
Ingalls operating income of $91 million and margin of 14% in the quarter were up from the first quarter of 2020, mainly due to higher risk retirement on LHA, which was related to the 25% completion milestone that Chris mentioned earlier.
The improvement was driven by higher risk retirement at Ingalls and improved performance to Technical Solutions.
