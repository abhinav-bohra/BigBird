Turning to our beauty and home segment, core sales decreased 3% and the segment's adjusted EBITDA margin was 10% in the quarter and was negatively impacted by increased resin and other raw material costs, which are passed through where possible, albeit through a process that has typically been on a 60 to 90-day lag.
In pharma the increased demand for our injectable components including supplying some of the COVID-19 vaccine distributions, and increased demand for our active material science solution, including those for COVID-19 test kits, offset declines in the prescription drug and consumer healthcare markets.
Turning to slide six.
Core sale for the beverage market increased 2%, primarily due to the pass-through of higher resin prices.
In closing, on slide eight, I'd like to mention that the broad range of end markets that we serve makes Aptar a very resilient company through economic cycles, and the most recent period was no exception.
