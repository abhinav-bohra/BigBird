Since April, both VITAS and Roto-Rooter have reengineered their operating procedures to safely care for our patients and customers during the pandemic.
I anticipate continued strong operational and financial results for both VITAS and Roto-Rooter, as we operate during the pandemic.
This translated into Roto-Rooter on a unit-for-unit basis having third quarter 2020 commercial revenue declining 11.6% and residential revenue increasing 24.6%.
Roto-Rooter unit-for-unit commercial revenue declining 38.6% in April, improving to a 31.8% decline in May and a decline of 19.7% in June.
