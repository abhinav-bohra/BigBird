Turning to our Snacks Power brands, which continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 2% this fiscal year and 15% on a two-year basis driven by double-digit consumption growth in the majority of our brands.
As previously mentioned, we expect to continue to progress on our cost savings program and expect to deliver an incremental $45 million in fiscal 2022, keeping us on track to deliver $850 million by the end of the fiscal year.
However A&C was comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.
Additionally, we expect net interest expense of $190 million to $195 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%, which is largely in line with fiscal 2021.
US Soup two-year dollar sales growth of 16% in the fourth quarter exceeded the growth in total shelf stable meals and was just slightly behind total edible growth in that same time period.
Importantly, when considering these items, the upper end of our fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per share range is in line with fiscal 2021 performance.
The estimated impact to EBIT from the additional week in fiscal 2020 was $22 million.
However for the comparable period in fiscal 2019, organic net sales increased 10%.
Adjusted EBIT decreased 13% compared to prior year, to $267 million driven by lower sales volume, including the impact of the additional week in the prior year quarter and a lower adjusted gross margin, partially offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and lower adjusted administrative expenses.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased $0.08 or 13% versus prior year to $0.55 per share, partially driven by the estimated $0.04 contribution from the additional week in fiscal 2020.
