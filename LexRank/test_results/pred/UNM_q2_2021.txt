The group life and AD&D business within Unum U.S. returned to profitability in the second quarter after recording losses in the previous two quarters as COVID-related mortality in the U.S. declined materially from the peak levels experienced late last year through the early months of 2021.
Within the Unum US segment, the group disability line reported operating income of $59.9 million in the second quarter compared to $64.1 million in the first quarter.
Looking at the growth on a year-over-year basis and in local currency to neutralize the benefit we saw from the higher exchange rate, Unum UK generated growth of 3% with strong persistency and the ongoing successful placement of significant rate increases on our in-force block.
The benefit ratio improved to 51.7% in the second quarter from 55.4% in the first quarter as experience in the life insurance block improved with the overall decline in COVID-related mortality.
