Our private capital advisory business made a meaningful contribution as well, albeit considerably less so than in the prior year.
In that regard, note that, our employees own about half of the economics of the firm through stock and restricted stock.
Our quarterly revenue was up 32% and earnings per share was up 158% from the same period last year.
We are hopeful that it will be at least as successful as the restructuring advisory team expansion, that was our primary strategic focus over the last couple of years.
