As both Steve and Sanjiv mentioned, Linde has a strong productivity culture, which enables consistent profit growth, irrespective of the economic climate.
We also stepped up our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gases emissions footprint, and Sanjiv will share that road map with you.
To achieve this goal, we must materially reduce our Scope one emissions, which are driven by hydrogen production.
We also have Scope one emissions, which are significantly lower than our Scope two emissions, but are significant nonetheless.
In 2020, we generated a total of 37 million metric tons of emissions to make products that helped our customers avoid more than twice our emissions or 85 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
Overall, I'm pleased to see how the entire Linde team has come together and is leveraging our combined strengths to secure high quality growth opportunities through our leading high density industrial gas network combined with the world class engineering capabilities.
