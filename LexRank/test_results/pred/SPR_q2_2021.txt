Domestic air travel in the United States as well as many other regions of the world are starting to recover, which is encouraging, especially for narrow-body aircraft production rates.
We continue to see improvement in domestic air traffic, which has translated to improved production rates for our narrow-body aircraft versus 2020.
With 85% of Spirit's backlog associated with narrow-body aircraft, we believe we are well positioned to benefit from this domestic air traffic demand and narrow-body recovery.
As we have discussed before, we are trailing Boeing in terms of 737 production rate to burn off the inventory of storage shipsets in Wichita and Tulsa.
Operating margin for the quarter was negative 7% compared to negative 77% in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to increased 737 production volumes and the resulting decrease in excess capacity costs as well as less net forward losses in the absence of a loss on disposal charges.
