During the first quarter, we exported a quarterly record of 133 cargoes of LNG from our two facilities, with production incentivized by strong global LNG margins during the quarter, and we had the benefit of Corpus Christi Train three commissioning volumes.
We have established ourselves as a premier LNG operator, demonstrating LNG buyers worldwide the reliability and certainty associated with a long-term supply agreement with Cheniere.
