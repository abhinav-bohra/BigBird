Underlying underwriting income of $632 million pre-tax was 6% higher than in the prior-year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.
The improved year-over-year result was driven by higher underlying underwriting income, prior-year reserve development and higher net investment income, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.
The underlying combined ratio was 93.3%, an improvement of 3.5 points over the prior-year quarter, which experienced a very high level of loss activities.
Segment income was $174 million, up about 50% compared to the prior-year quarter, driven by the impact of higher net earned premium, a significantly improved underlying underwriting margin and favorable prior-year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 83.4% improved by 5.5 points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting lower pandemic-related loss activity, earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and a lower expense ratio.
Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance.
The underlying combined ratio was 97%, up approximately 15 points from the prior-year quarter which reflected unusually low loss activity due to the pandemic.
Underlying underwriting income increased 6% to $632 million pre-tax, reflecting a higher level of earned premium in all three segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%.
