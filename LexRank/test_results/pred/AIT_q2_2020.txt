While, we remain highly focused on managing costs in the second half of our fiscal 2020 given the current environment.
Results reflect continued weak manufacturing activity and related MRO needs across our service center network as well as softer demand within our international operations in Canada, and Mexico.
As previously highlighted, sustained weak demand across a number of key end markets remains the primary drag on sales.
As highlighted on Slide 6 and 7, sales in our Service Center segment declined 2.3% year-over-year or 3.5%, excluding a 1.2% incremental impact from acquisitions.
As highlighted in recent quarters, our leading technical position and service capabilities across motion control, fluid power, flow control and now automation puts us in a unique position to capture greater share organically as our customers outsource their technical MRO and production infrastructure needs.
Within our Fluid Power and Flow Control segment, sales increased 2.7% over the prior year quarter with acquisitions adding 7.6% growth.
On an organic basis, segment sales declined 4.9% reflecting weaker flow control sales and slower activity across our industrial OEM customer base, as well as the remaining year-over-year drag from the large project referenced in prior quarters.
By segment, our guidance assumes mid-to low-single digit organic declines year-over-year in our service center segment during the second half and low-single digit organic declines in our Fluid Power and Flow Control segment.
