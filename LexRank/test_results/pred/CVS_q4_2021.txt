Our success is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs, including medical and pharmacy, and products and services that utilize CVS Health capabilities, such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs.
We are progressing on optimizing our retail portfolio and pivoting our stores into three formats: primary care clinics, enhanced health hubs, and traditional CVS pharmacy locations.
For the full year 2021, CVS Health administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million vaccines.
The increase in adjusted operating income was driven by a few key components: the administration of COVID-19 vaccines, underlying strength in pharmacy and front store sales, and a $106 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement, which were partially offset by the combined impacts of ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure, and business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements.
Our digital capabilities for health interactions such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services, and sales of health and wellness products have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses.
