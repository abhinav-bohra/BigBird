This means completing our wave two expansions and progressing wave three expansions to grow lithium conversion capacity and volumes.
This slide shows the expected lithium production volume ramp from the new conversion facilities we expect to complete this year.
Now turning to Slide 16, I'll provide some additional color on lithium volume growth.
This was driven by higher sales from lithium and bromine, partially offset by the loss of revenue from our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in June 2021.
Now turning to Slide 7 and more on the lithium market outlook.
