The average revenue per order decreased to $2,500 due to a shift in the mix of direct title orders to lower premium refinance transactions.
The provision for title policy losses and other claims was $81 million or 5% of the title premiums and escrow fees, an increase from a 4% loss provision rate in the prior year.
Revenues in our Title Insurance segment were up 26% in the fourth quarter and we effectively managed our expenses, achieving a 53% success ratio, which contributed to a pre-tax margin of 18.9%.
Investment income within Title Insurance and Services segment was $52 million, down 26% primarily due to the impact of the decline in short-term interest rates on the investment portfolio and cash balances, partially offset by higher interest income from the company's warehouse lending business.
