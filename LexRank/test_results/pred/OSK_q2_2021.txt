The growth over the prior year was driven by a 29% increase in Fire & Emergency sales and a 6.5% increase in Access Equipment sales, offset in part by a modest sales decrease in the Defense segment.
We are estimating that access equipment adjusted operating margin will be 10.5% to 11.25%, included in our expectations is an approximately $30 million net headwind from elevated steel prices that we expect will primarily impact the fourth quarter.
Looking at the third quarter, we expect consolidated sales to be up approximately 40% over the prior year, with access equipment and defense up most significantly.
