On a longer-term basis, we either own or control land, primarily in coastal infill markets that can support roughly $1 billion of annual starts over the next four years if the supply/demand picture remains robust, which we believe it will.
We started $349 million of new development totaling two million square feet that consisted of six speculative projects and two build-to-suits in the quarter.
This third quarter activity has further shifted the geographic position of our portfolio on an NOI basis to approximately 40% in the coastal Tier one market.
