If we go to Slide 11, I'll make a few comments on our segment performance.
Organic growth in that segment was 15% versus prior year.
Total sales was a second quarter record as well as total segment operating margin.
Both our adjusted net income and our adjusted earnings per share has improved by 29% versus prior year.
When you look at the segment operating margins, it's a Q2 record on an adjusted basis.
