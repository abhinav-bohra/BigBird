The analysis included clinical data on 4,000 patients obtained at the mass general and concluded that in the TAVR era overall survival of patients with severe AS has doubled.
For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, for TAVR $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million, for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million, and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million.
This quarter, more than 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN valves, an indication that more patients are benefiting from our life changing technologies than ever before.
We remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity as patients and clinicians increasingly understand the significant benefits of TAVR therapy, supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence.
TAVR procedure and Edwards' growth in Europe, also rebounded significantly on a year-over-year basis.
We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards' growth in the second quarter.
We are encouraged that U.S. TAVR procedures grew as vaccinations increase and patients decided to seek treatment during the quarter.
Now, turning to several recent TAVR clinical trial highlights, last week at the TVT Conference, data on the Vancouver's TAVR Economic Study were presented which further demonstrated the favorable economic value of our SAPIEN 3 platform, a comparison of 1100 patients was conducted to assess the economic impact of next day discharge.
Total sales grew 49% year-over-year, as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing treatment in the second quarter.
