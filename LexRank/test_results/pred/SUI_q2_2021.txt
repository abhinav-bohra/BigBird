Sun delivered a strong second quarter across the board, outperforming our prior expectations in RV, marinas and manufactured housing.
The change is being driven by continued outperformance of transient RV, marinas, the sustained strength in our manufactured housing portfolio and our robust acquisition activity, particularly as we begin to realize the meaningful marina industry consolidation opportunity.
Same community manufactured housing NOI increased by 5.4% from 2020 and same community RV NOI increased by 85.1%.
