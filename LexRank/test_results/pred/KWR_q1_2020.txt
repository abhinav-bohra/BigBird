We followed a similar review format for this deck as the one we used for our last couple of calls post Combination, where our comparison periods show actual and non-GAAP results as well as pro forma sales and pro forma adjusted EBITDA as if we've been combined with Houghton throughout the periods presented.
On a pro forma basis, as if Houghton was also in Q1 of 2019, net sales were down 3%, which reflects negative impacts from lower volumes and foreign exchange, partially offset by additional sales from Norman Hay.
And if we look forward to 2021 and 2022, I continue to be optimistic in our future, and I do expect us to achieve significant increases in our adjusted EBITDA, as we complete our integration cost synergies, continue to take share in the marketplace, and benefit from a projected gradual rebound in demand in our end markets over this period of time.
Sequentially, non-GAAP earnings per share is up from $1.34 in Q4 of 2019, which included Houghton and Norman Hay and the additional shares.
So, while our actual sales are up significantly to $378.6 million in Q1, this is due to the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.38 is down from $1.41 in Q1 last year, due primarily to the additional shares issued in the Combination, partially offset by the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay.
If Houghton was included in the prior year, we estimate that our prior year gross margin would have been approximately 1% lower.
The main non-GAAP adjustments are combination and restructuring charges totaling about $10 million and a $38 million non-cash impairment charge in Q1 to reflect the writedown of our Houghton trademark indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair value.
For 2020, our new estimate is $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus our previous estimate of $35 million.
I am very proud of what the Quaker Houghton team has done to continuing servicing our customers as well as continuing with our integration, which has not missed a beat.
Concerning gross margins, you may recall from our comments in the past that the combined gross margins of Quaker Houghton were expected to be about 1% lower than stand-alone Quaker.
