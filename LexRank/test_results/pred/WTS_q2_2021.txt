Americas adjusted operating profit increased 54% and adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points to 17.7%, driven by volume, price, cost actions and productivity, which is partially offset by incremental investments, inflation and the return of expenses related to business normalization.
We expect adjusted operating margins in the Americas should be up versus 2020, driven by the drop-through benefits of additional volume, including the freeze impact.
