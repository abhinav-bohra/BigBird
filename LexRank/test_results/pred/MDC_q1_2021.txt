Also, as previously noted, our net new home orders for the first quarter could have been even higher were it not for our efforts to balance orders and pricing to best manage our backlog.
We ended the quarter with 7,686 homes in backlog, a 65% increase over the first quarter of 2020.
Let's look at our net new home order information for the quarter on Slide 9.
The average selling price of homes in backlog increased 9% due to price increases implemented over the past 12 months, decreased incentives and a shift in mix to California.
Gross margin from home sales improved by 200 basis points year-over-year to 21.9%.
Gross margin from home sales also benefited from a 40-basis-point improvement in our capitalized interest in cost of sales as a percentage of the home sale revenues, which is a great example of how our business continues to benefit from increasing scale.
