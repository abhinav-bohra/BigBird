Let's now turn to Snacks where our power brands continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 14% on a two-year basis despite being down 5% year-over-year.
Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales grew 3%.
Our sales results benefited from the continued momentum of our Snacks power brands and our U.S. retail products in our Meals & Beverage division as well as the early signs of recovery from our foodservice business.
Turning to Slide 12, as Mark just shared, our third quarter results were impacted by last year's demand surge related to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the gross margin impact due to pronounced inflation, our transition out of the COVID-19 environment, and some executional pressure as we continued to advance our transformation agenda primarily in our Snacks division.
On a two-year basis, total Snacks consumption grew 10% against organic net sales growth of 3% with the gap driven by the decline in our partner brands and continued pressure in the convenience channels.
Operating earnings for Snacks decreased 29% for the quarter driven by a lower gross margin and sales volume declines partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses and lower administrative expenses.
Year-to-date adjusted EBIT of $1.14 billion was comparable to prior year as a lower adjusted gross margin and increased adjusted administrative expenses were offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, higher adjusted other income and sales volume gains.
Overall, the Meals & Beverages division delivered a strong in-market quarter against difficult comparisons with share gains in key categories especially among younger consumers, TPD [Phonetic] gains and improved service levels continuing to support our confidence that it will emerge from the pandemic in a stronger position.
During the quarter, organic net sales declined 12% and adjusted EBIT decreased 27% driven by lower sales volume and a lower adjusted gross margin partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses.
Pacific Foods continued to be a powerful growth engine within our soup portfolio with in-market consumption growth of nearly 30% on a two-year basis and continued share gains versus prior year, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of share improvement.
