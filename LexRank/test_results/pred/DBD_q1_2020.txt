From an industry perspective, we expect our banking business, which generated approximately 74% of the company's revenue during 2019, will show greater resiliency in our retail business, due to the higher mix of services and software revenues.
Non-GAAP gross profit of $90 million in the quarter and a gross margin of 28.9% reflects the resiliency of this segment as we benefit from our DN Now services modernization and software excellence initiatives, as well as our intentional actions to reduce low-margin business.
