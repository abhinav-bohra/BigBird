Like Journeys, Schuh's strength is its ability to deliver the fashion brands desired by its youth consumer and Schuh drove a nice growth across its diversified mix of both casual and fashion athletic footwear.
Journeys' and Schuh's gross margins were up 330 and 250 basis points, respectively, to fiscal year '20, driven by more full-price selling and higher footwear ASPs.
Journeys grew 2%, while Schuh grew 12% on a constant currency basis, and we more than tripled our licensed brands business.
Journeys' performance underscores the competitive advantages the business has built and how it has leveraged those advantages to further separate itself as the destination for branded fashion footwear for teens.
We expect to fully launch our new Schuh loyalty program following a successful test in fiscal '22, grow our Johnston & Murphy program, which launched last year, and advance the work on a loyalty program for Journeys.
