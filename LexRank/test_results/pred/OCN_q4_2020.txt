You know, MAV expects to leverage up to $250 million in capital that will be contributed by Oaktree and Ocwen, respectively, based on our relative shares to purchase MSRs and this will be leveraged up roughly one for one with secured MSR financing.
In terms of benefits, MAV supports our servicing and subservicing growth objectives on a capital-efficient basis and will help generate increased cost efficiency through increased origination and servicing scale.
Now in addition, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate M&A transactions to expand our originations and servicing capabilities which might provide enhanced returns versus MSR investments.
We believe our broad portfolio of services, including subservicing, specialty servicing, MSR purchase through multiple delivery methods, provides a compelling value proposition.
