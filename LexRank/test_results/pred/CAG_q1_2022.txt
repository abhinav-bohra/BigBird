As you can see on Slide 14, we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 11% for fiscal 2022, compared to the approximately 9% we anticipated at the time of our fourth-quarter call.
As you can see on Slide 26, our Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 was heavily impacted by inflation, as well as by a slightly higher tax rate.
Note that the 16.6% inflation shown on the slide represents gross market inflation for Q1 and does not include hedging or sourcing benefits.
First, we began implementing actions on some of our domestic retail products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the inflation we began to experience last fiscal year.
Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating profit both decreased year over year but were flat on a two-year basis, demonstrating our ability to offset the double-digit inflation experienced in the business during the quarter.
