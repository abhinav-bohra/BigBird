We expect strong long-term consumer demand, especially for Saucony, Merrell, Sweaty Betty, our work brands and Sperry, which will launch a line of products in the active sport category next spring.
Based on the performance of Merrell, Saucony, Sweaty Betty, Wolverine and our other work brands, our performance business developed growth of nearly 30% over 2019 during the third quarter.
This strategic focus led to our recent acquisition of Sweaty Betty, a trend right women's active wear brand that adds a very meaningful DTC business to our portfolio with over 80% of revenue generated through DTC channels.
Merrell, Saucony and Sperry all well exceeded gross margin expectations in the quarter, a testament to their strong position in the marketplace and robust pipeline of relevant trend-right product.
Including Sweaty Betty, DTC e-commerce revenue more than doubled in Q3 relative to 2019 and our DTC stores are up over 35% versus that year.
In the third quarter, we acquired sweaty Betty, a powerhouse brand that operates in the global addressable active wear market of over $200 billion.
Additionally, Merrell was featured on The Today Show during Q3, showcasing the Moab Speed, which aligns well to the brand's Step Further campaign, encouraging increased commitment to the outdoors.
