Price mix benefited substantially in the year-to-date period from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments.
Exports were up over 18% versus the comparable period, led by Beef, where sales improved by more than $350 million on a year-to-date basis.
Year-to-date operating income was $633 million, up 23% versus the prior year period.
Operating income was $27 million in the third quarter and $137 million on a fiscal year-to-date basis, both stronger than comparable periods a year ago.
However, on a year-to-date basis, our operating margin of 9.6% was up 170 basis points versus last year, driven by favorable pricing and lower commercial spend.
Average sales price was also up about 17%, largely due to strong results in our Beef segment, the mix benefit from retail volume and the partial recovery of raw material inflation in net sales price.
Chicken and Prepared Foods also improved their respective segment earnings, while Pork earnings were down versus the comparable period a year ago.
Given the continued strength in our Beef segment and ongoing inflationary pressures that are partially being recovered through price, we are raising our sales guidance for the full-year.
Sales improved 25% in third quarter and 8% year-to-date, reflecting improved volumes, which were up 10% for the quarter and flat year-to-date.
Year-to-date, operating income for the total Company improved by 49%.
We are pleased to have additional capacity coming online at Eagle Mountain in Utah and Columbia, South Carolina, both facilities are expected to grow our pre-packaged Beef and Pork products.
We've also seen some strength in industrial, particularly in Beef and Pork.
