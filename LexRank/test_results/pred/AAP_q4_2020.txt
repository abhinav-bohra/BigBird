We're excited to announce that we plan to expand our store base and geographic footprint this year and expect to open 50 to 100 new stores.
Adjusted operating income margin rate of 8.7% to 8.9%, which includes margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points.
Our team members are a differentiator for Advance.
In Q4, we delivered comparable store sales growth of 4.7% and margin expansion of 17 basis points.
Moving on to an update of our four pillars of margin expansion, I'll begin with sales and profit per store.
Our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $8.51, which is a new record for Advance and includes a headwind of $0.66 related to COVID costs.
First, protect the health, safety and well being of our team members and customers.
Our store and distribution center team members continuously stepped up throughout the year, and they are the true heroes for us.
