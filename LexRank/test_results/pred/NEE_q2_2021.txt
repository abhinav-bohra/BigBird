As a result of these financings and the strong cash flow generation of its existing portfolio, NextEra Energy Partners ended the quarter with more than $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes funds raised in the second quarter financing activities and existing partnership debt capacity to support its ongoing growth initiatives, including the acquisition of the approximately 590 net megawatts of renewables from Energy Resources as well as previously announced acquisition of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects, both of which are expected to close later this year.
Gulf Power will continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates.
As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio with an agreement to acquire assets in a diverse portfolio of long-term contracted wind and solar projects from Energy Resources.
Further building on that strength, today, we are announcing that NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from NextEra Energy Resources.
