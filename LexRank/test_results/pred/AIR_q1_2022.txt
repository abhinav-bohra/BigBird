With respect to Afghanistan, as we discussed on last quarter's call, we had in-country activity on 2 programs, our WASS program supporting the State Department and our C130 program supporting four Afghan Airforce aircraft.
It was another strong quarter, as we generated $18 million from operating activities from continuing operations.
Compared to the prior year period, sales were up 14% from $401 million to 405 -- $455 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up 206% from $0.17 per share to $0.52 per share.
