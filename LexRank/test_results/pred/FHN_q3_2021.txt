Moving to slide 9, net interest income was down $5 million linked quarter given the expected decrease tied to lower merger accretion and PPP portfolio balances, core net interest income was up 1% as the benefit of lower deposit cost, day count, commercial loan growth, and higher investment portfolio income was partially offset by continued declines in consumer loan balances and overall loan spread compression, given the continued reductions in LIBOR and the competitive landscape.
As Bryan mentioned, tangible book value per share came in at $10.88, up 1% as GAAP net income was largely offset by a $0.23 impact tied to the return of capital and a $0.07 decline tied to the mark-to-market on the security portfolio in OCI.
Additionally, we continued making solid traction on revenue synergies and have thus far identified roughly $35 million of annualized revenue synergies that are tied to commercial loans and additional synergies tied to debt capital markets, mortgage, and private client wealth.
This reflected anticipated declines in other non-interest income and fixed income and mortgage that were partially offset by growth in brokerage trust and insurance tied to higher annuity sales, as well as higher service charges and fees as an increase in transaction volume and higher leasing income tied to terminations helped to mitigate the impact of a recent change in our NSF pricing structure.
Our CET1 ratio of 10.1%, down from 10.3% in the second quarter tied to the accelerated share repurchases in the quarter, loan growth, and higher unfunded commitments.
We generated PPNR of $284 million as underlying improvement in core net interest income and traditional banking fees was masked by the impact of expected declines in net merger-related and PPP non net interest income along with lower fixed income and mortgage banking fees.
