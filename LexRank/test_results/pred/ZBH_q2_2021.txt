Still, we continue to be encouraged by the team's execution and ongoing strong momentum for Persona and ROSA Knee.
And I believe this fundamental shift is coming for ZB and for our core markets with technology advancements, potentially changing the care paradigm for patients in the future, and that's really what our focus is.
And most importantly, it also gives ZB the chance to really change the lives of patients around the world.
While the region has been largely stable in recent quarters, it was impacted late in the second quarter by channel inventory contraction in our knee and hip categories within China, and advance of the rollout of volume-based procurement or VBP.
We are focused on evolving ZB from what I would define as a metal and plastic provider of implants into a leading med tech innovator.
And then if I just look at ROSA overall, we did see another strong quarter in Q2 of market demand and traction with ROSA total knee as well with placement momentum broadly continuing across the world, not just in the U.S. but internationally as well.
