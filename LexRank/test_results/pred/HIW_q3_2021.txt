We delivered the $285 million Asurion project on budget and ahead of schedule; we acquired a $683 million portfolio of office properties with attractive long-term returns; since announcing the acquisition, we have sold $163 million of noncore properties at attractive valuations; we raised our quarterly dividend over 4%; we increased the midpoint of our FFO outlook $0.165 per share since the beginning of the year; and we did all this while maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDAre ratio of 5.6 times.
