In closing, we are pleased with the results of our fiscal third quarter, and we have a strong financial outlook.
I want to point out that we are not providing fiscal 2023 guidance at this time.
For the first nine months of the fiscal year, we generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion.
As we look forward to fiscal 2023, I'm most excited about the progress on the four company priorities.
