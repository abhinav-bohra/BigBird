FMC diamides Rynaxypyr and Cyazypyr make up well over 80% of the entire diamides class, which includes a few other smaller active ingredients.
New formulations, new registrations, label extensions and improved market access will drive growth not only for the diamides but for all FMC active ingredients.
Asia makes up nearly 40% of our diamides business today with North America a little over 1/4 of the sales and EMEA and Latin America between 15% and 20% each.
Moving to slide 17 and the diamide patent state.
Since we launched FMC as a pure-play agricultural science company, diamides have been a core part of our business.
FMC diamides have grown well above the market in all regions since we acquired them in 2017.
Rynaxypyr is covered by 21 patent families with a total of 639 granted and pending patents.
