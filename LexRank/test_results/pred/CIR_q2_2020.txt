Our Aftermarket business is largely driven by Industrial and defense.
Looking at today's portfolio, approximately 46% of our revenue is General Industrial, 27% is Aerospace & Defense with defense approximately twice the size of commercial, and 27% as aftermarket sales and support.
Overall, we expect Q3 orders to decrease sequentially driven by the timing of Defense Program orders, and COVID related headwinds in the Commercial business.
