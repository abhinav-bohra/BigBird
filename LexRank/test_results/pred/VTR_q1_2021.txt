Sequential SHOP revenue is expected to grow modestly as a result of occupancy gains.
And our SHOP occupancy gains were at or above those reported by other market participants to date.
Our Canadian SHOP portfolio, which has maintained occupancy of over 91%, tempered the full SHOP occupancy growth because Canadian clinical conditions and regulatory measures are currently lagging those in the U.S.
As a result, same-store SHOP NOI declined sequentially by 8% in the second quarter versus the first.
Since then, led by our U.S. SHOP community, which posted 280 basis points of growth, we grew SHOP spot occupancy 190 basis points through April 30th to nearly 78%.
