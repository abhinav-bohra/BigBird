The continued success of our mask and device portfolio along with a solid pipeline of new products and new digital health solutions covering sleep apnea, COPD, and out of hospital software gives us confidence in continued growth as we move through the year.
We have massive opportunities ahead in sleep apnea, in COPD as well as in outside the hospital software to help patients live better quality lives, to help patients and healthcare systems save money and to help achieve better management of chronic disease.
In addition, our Brightree and MatrixCare software systems are helping to manage 19 [Phonetic] million more people outside the hospital.
Over the longer-term and on a deeper level, this partnership will also allow ResMed to participate in a broad chronic disease management platform covering sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health and beyond.
