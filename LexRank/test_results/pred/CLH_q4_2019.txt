Turning to our segment results, beginning with environmental services on Slide 4.
Our adjusted earnings per share was $0.42.
Looking at our guidance from a quarterly perspective, we expect growth in Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be in line with the full year with steady growth in the business, pricing gains and operational efficiencies.
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew by 10% on a 3% increase in revenue, and we generated record adjusted free cash flow of $208.5 million.
For 2020, using the midpoint of our guidance range, we would expect SG&A to be up in absolute dollars from the prior year and slightly up on a percentage basis, given the onetime benefits we experienced last year.
