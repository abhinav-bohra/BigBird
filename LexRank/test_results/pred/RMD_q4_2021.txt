Looking forward to fiscal-year '22, we expect several factors will drive demand, including the general recovery of the global sleep market from COVID-19 impacts, the launch of our next-generation AirSense 11 platform and share gains during our competitors' recall.
We expect to see steady improvement in patient flow for sleep apnea and respiratory care therapy as we move throughout our fiscal-year 2022.
Revenue growth reflected increased demand for our sleep devices and masks, which was, in turn, driven by both sleep patient flow recovering from the COVID-19-impacted reduced levels in the prior-year quarter and by increased demand in response to the recent product recall by one of our competitors.
As I mentioned before, during the June quarter, one of our competitors announced a product recall on certain sleep and respiratory devices, which, in turn, has resulted in significantly increased demand for our devices.
