Segment operating margin increased 242 basis points when compared with last year.
Given our strong first quarter, we now think a reasonable outlook for the total company organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 6% led by forecasted growth of about 10% in Digital Imaging excluding FLIR.
Now turning to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales declined 3.3% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 28.5% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products.
