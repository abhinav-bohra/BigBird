Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we called one of our previously issued SFR securitizations, which has $75 million of outstanding loans, the majority of these loans have either been refinanced or resecuritized, and the call allowed us to recycle our capital at a significantly improved cost of funds.
On that note, at December 31st, we had approximately $375 million of capital allocated to our operating businesses, including $215 million for residential mortgage banking and $160 million for BPL mortgage banking.
