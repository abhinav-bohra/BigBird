Our consumer group achieved record net sales of $491.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2022, an increase of 2.9% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2021.
As a result, our performance coatings group and construction products group are operating not only at record sales and EBIT but at record margins in the third quarter.
Our consolidated adjusted EBIT growth was driven by three of our four segments: construction products, performance coatings, and specialty products, which leveraged selling price adjustments and operational improvements to the bottom line.
And raw material inflation, in particular, has had the most significant impact on EBIT.
