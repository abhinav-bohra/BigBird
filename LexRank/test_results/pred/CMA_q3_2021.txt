Excluding PPP loans, we expect loan growth in several businesses, including general Middle Market and large corporate.
Putting PPP and dealer side, the average loans and the remainder of our portfolio grew about $600 million or nearly 1.5% over the second quarter, including a 3% increase in general middle market.
Our results included solid loan growth in a number of business lines, which was overshadowed by the headwinds from PPP loan forgiveness and reduced auto dealer loans due to supply constraints.
