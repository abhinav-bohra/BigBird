Our team's performance to start the fiscal year has shown continued excellent execution, even on top of very impressive same-store sales a year ago.
With the largest selling season ahead, we expect to build on a strong start to our fiscal year and deliver exceptional customer experiences.
Among these are improving margins on new and used boat sales, impressive service and storage performance of SkipperBud's, which has a long track record of performance in these categories, growth in our higher margin finance and insurance businesses, and growth in our brokerage business including our global Superyacht Services Organizations of Northrop & Johnson and Fraser Yachts.
This exceptional growth was driven by even greater comparable new unit growth that exceeded 35%%.
Turning to guidance, the December quarter exceeded expectations and the industry trends remained strong.
