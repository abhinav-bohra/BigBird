In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was 539 million, up 9% compared to fiscal '20, driven by continued strength in e-commerce, up 144% versus fiscal '20 combined with strong results from Journeys and licensed brands compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Overall digital sales increased to 25% of our retail business compared to 11% in fiscal '20, led by Journeys' penetration improvement, Schuh's ability to capture lost store sales online, and J&M's double-digit improvement compared to fiscal '20.
This is mainly due to growth at Journeys, Schuh stores coming back online, and continued strength from the Levi's business.
Journeys, Schuh, and licensed brands all achieved higher operating income compared to fiscal '20.
Revenue more than doubled to record Q1 levels, and operating profit improved considerably versus pre-pandemic levels as Levi's footwear was well received in accounts ranging from department stores to Journeys and Journeys Kidz to family footwear.
