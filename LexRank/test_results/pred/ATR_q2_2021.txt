As certain economies begin to reopen, we expect the recovery in our beauty, beverage and prescription pharma business to gradually progress.
In our Food + Beverage segment, top line growth was strong across each market segment with about 60% of the growth coming from price adjustments related to the passing through of higher resin costs.
Similar to the first quarter, growth of our Pharma segment was driven by strong demand for elastomeric components for injectable drugs and exit Material Solutions, which offset declines in sales to the prescription and consumer healthcare markets, which continue to be impacted by customers drawing down inventory levels in key categories.
Looking at sales growth by market on a core basis.
Turning to our Food + Beverage segment, which had another solid performance, core sales increased 23%.
Core sales to the beverage market increased 26% as we realized some recovery over a very low prior year second quarter.
Starting with Slide six.
