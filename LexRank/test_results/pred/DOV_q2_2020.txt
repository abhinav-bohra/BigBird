The US, our largest market declined 10% organically, with four segments posting organic declines, partially offset by growth in retail fueling.
First, as presented in the box on the bottom, June bookings saw a significant improvement from the May trough, with all five segments posting double-digit month-over-month sequential growth.
Bookings were relatively resilient for this segment and we have improved in June, resulting in a robust backlog that we are prepared to execute against.
So decremental margins are challenging and require heavy lifting on cost containment, where marking & coding business did a good job, achieving a flat margin year-over-year and we have taken proactive actions to manage the cost base in the digital printing business.
Recovery in volumes along with cost actions we've undertaken should result in positive margin and profit trend through the remainder of the year resulting in the segment posting a second half comparable profit increase.
We still carry a strong backlog across all segments and that increases our confidence for the second half.
