The strong growth momentum that we experienced in the third quarter continued into the fourth quarter as revenue grew 5.9% year over year to $3.7 billion, with organic growth of 5.3%.
At the enterprise level, we delivered organic growth of 5%, GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, operating margin of 22.7%, and free cash flow of $695 million or 114% of net income.
Third, selective high-quality acquisitions, such as MTS, that enhance ITW's long-term profitable growth potential, have significant margin improvement potential from the application of our proprietary 80-20 front-to-back methodology and can generate acceptable risk-adjusted returns on our shareholders' capital.
As you can see by segment on the next page, every segment is positioned to deliver solid organic growth in 2022 with organic growth of 6% to 9% at the enterprise level.
