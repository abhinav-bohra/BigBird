Looking at the WWE media segment, adjusted OIBDA was $107 million, growing 4% as increased revenue and profit from WWE's licensing agreement with Peacock, as well as increased revenue from the escalation of domestic core content rights fees more than offset the absence of a large scale international event.
As Vince, Nick and Stephanie highlighted, transitioning WWE Network to Peacock, while launching WrestleMania with a live audience of 50,000 fans in attendance is a major accomplishment.
We had an early case study in WWE delivering audiences for our partners' streaming services a little over two weeks ago, when our premiere event, WrestleMania, was distributed for the first time exclusively on Peacock in the United States.
