In our pineapple product line, net sales were $114 million compared with $126 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to lower selling prices and sales volume in North America and Europe.
Volume decreased 21%, unit pricing was 3% higher and unit cost was 9% higher than the prior-year period.
Our investments in 2020 will be in key projects that were in the pipeline, including delivery of the four new container vessels, the consolidation of Mann Packing and our Fresno operation in our new Gonzales, California facility, and as Mohammad mentioned, the consolidation of our two distribution centers in Phoenix, Arizona.
