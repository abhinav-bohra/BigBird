Total community bank loans grew by 5% year-over-year with business banking loans leading the way at 9%.
Another key point on this slide is the fact that sponsor and specialty and leveraged loans within our C&I business in general performed at the same level or better than our other portfolios in the commercial bank, a point I have made several times over earnings call -- calls when asked about the nature of our leveraged loans.
Loan growth was strong as total loans grew 11%, and commercial loans grew almost 16% from a year ago or by more than $1.8 billion.
