On slide 12, you'll see Pioneer's high-quality asset base, which yields a peer-leading oil percent that drives our high-margin barrels, positioning Pioneer as the only E&P among our peers to realize a corporate breakeven below $30 a barrel WTI.
This highly competitive yield is underpinned by the greater than $18 billion of cumulative cash returned to shareholders outlined on the previous slide and speaks to the power and underlying quality of Pioneer's assets.
This peer-leading oil mix, combined with our unparalleled breakeven oil price in the high 20s, not only underpins our operational and financial strength, it enables Pioneer's low reinvestment rate and drive significant and durable free cash flow and return of capital to shareholders well into the future.
We've successfully tested our simul frac and have incorporated a second simul frac fleet into our program, which benefits mainly Pioneer, partially in DoublePoint acreage, given our -- leveraging our significant water system that we have across the Midland Basin.
