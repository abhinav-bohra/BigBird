With our Bakken properties of a contract for that $154 million, which most of you are aware of, and closing expected in the coming weeks, we did preannounce that we would accelerate completion activity on the $9.4 net Haynesville wells this year to bring those volumes forward into our current strong pricing environment for natural gas.
We had a very strong quarter, which was driven by that 25% production increase, combined with substantial improved oil and gas prices.
This increase was mostly due to higher production taxes coming from the higher oil and gas sales we had for the quarter.
Both laterals were drilled to the Haynesville formation, and both these wells are currently being completed.
Based on our current operating plan for this year, we expect to spend between $590 million to $630 million, which will include drilling 52.5 net operated Haynesville wells and then turning 54.4 net operated wells to sales.
