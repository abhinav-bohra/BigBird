This included a negative provision to the allowance for credit losses of $16.8 million, which with net charge-offs of $1.2 million reduced the allowance to $180.4 million, representing 1.5% of total loans and leases or 1.56% net of PPP balances.
Adjusting for PPP loan forgiveness, net interest income was slightly higher than the first quarter as the impact from lower interest rates was offset by the deployment of liquidity.
Partially offsetting the MSR valuation impairment or higher service charges and other transaction fees, the increase from the second quarter of 2020 was mainly due to an increase of $5.4 million from fees on deposit accounts and other service charges due to the reopening of the economy.
