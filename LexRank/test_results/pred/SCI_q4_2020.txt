Both funeral and cemetery segments had margin improvement of over 600 basis points, driven by double-digit top line percentage growth applied against a more efficient cost structure.

Preneed funeral sales production for the quarter was down 1.6% versus the prior year, which is just a significant improvement of our results posted in earlier quarters this year.
