The selection of the preferred path from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP is a significant milestone in our transition from coal-fired generation toward cleaner and reliable forms of generation, all of which are expected to save NIPSCO customers' approximately $4 billion over the long term.
NIPSCO's electric TDSIC plan is pending before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission or IURC.
As I mentioned a moment ago, the preferred plan from NIPSCO's 2021 IRP, advances our plans to retire remaining coal-fired generation between 2026 and 2028 as we shift to lower cost, clean and reliable generation.
The preferred path from the 2021 IRP refines the timeline to retire coal-fired generation at the Michigan City Generating Station to between 2026 and 2028.
Also congratulations to our customer experience team for the successful launch of the Columbia Gas and NIPSCO mobile apps.
