In line with the improved narrow-body outlook, as we described in our 10-K, Spirit is planning to produce about 160 737 MAX aircraft in 2021.
While the wide-body programs will remain a headwind for the next few years, domestic air travel in many regions of the world is trending in the right direction, which is an encouraging sign especially for narrow-body aircraft.
We believe Spirit is well positioned to benefit from this trend of recovering domestic air travel in the largest aviation markets, given that 85% of our backlog is narrow-body aircraft.
Additionally, Boeing has secured several new orders from airlines, including large orders from Southwest, Alaska Air and Ryanair, who will take delivery of their first newly certified 737 MAX 8200 aircraft in the near future.
Increased 737 MAX production and higher defense revenues, helped contribute to the gross profit improvement.
In the first quarter, Fuselage segment revenues were $437 million, down approximately $115 million compared to 2020, primarily due to lower production volumes on the wide-body programs, partially offset by an increase in 737 MAX defense and the recently acquired Bombardier business jet program revenues.
