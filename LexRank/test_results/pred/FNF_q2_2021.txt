We are excited about our second quarter performance as our title business continues to produce record results, and F&G set records for its retail annuity sales, while expanding into new institutional channels, further validating our decision to acquire the company just over one year ago.
We'll begin with a brief strategic overview from Randy, Mike will review the title business, Chris will review F&G, and Tony will finish with a review of the financial highlights.
Including net recognized losses of $30 million, our title segment generated $3 billion in total revenue for the second quarter compared with $2.1 billion in the second quarter of 2020.
We continue to provide for title claims at 4.5% of total title premiums.
