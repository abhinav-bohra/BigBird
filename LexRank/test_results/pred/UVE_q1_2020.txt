As we have done every quarter since Hurricane Irma made landfall, I would like to start with some additional color on past cat events, then talk briefly about 1Q weather and lastly, provide an update on our June one reinsurance placement efforts.
As we disclosed during our year-end earnings call, with capacity already locked in via the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund and multiyear deals, we stood at over 75% of our desired core first event reinsurance tower complete.
Our in-house claims and legal staff continue to deliver day in and day out for our company and for our reinsurance partners as we approach the finish line on these cat events.
