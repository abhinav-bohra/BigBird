We talked at our recent Investor Conference about our early TAVR trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic patients.
In TAVR, despite headwinds, more than 100,000 patients benefited from treatment with SAPIEN valves worldwide.
Growth at smaller TAVR centers, which are providing local access to aortic stenosis patients was more than offset by declines in larger accounts, where referrals have been disrupted by the resurgence of COVID.
For the full year 2021, we continue to expect R&D as a percentage of sales to be in the 17% to 18% range, similar to pre-COVID levels, as we invest in developing new technologies and generating evidence to expand indications for TAVR and TMTT including enrolling seven clinical trials.
Outside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, we estimated total TAVR procedures grew in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis and Edwards growth was comparable.
Structural heart patients were severely impacted beginning in March, experiencing significant difficulties entering the system, which also had a profound impact on second quarter procedures and even though healthcare systems adapted to the challenge, the resurgence of COVID that began late in the year continues to impact structural heart patients, who need care.
Edwards' underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single digit range.
