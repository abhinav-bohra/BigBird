Within Safety-Kleen, we expect a steady uptick in demand for our core branch services, while with -- meanwhile within SK Oil, we will continue to ramp up base and blended production.
Safety-Kleen revenue was down 30% due to a slowdown in both the branch and the SK Oil businesses, due to customer shutdowns.
We now expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $470 million to $500 million.
We will continue to active manage our CFO rates to reflect the value of the waste oil and the collection services that we're providing.
This is based on the assumption of a slight slowdown in our Environmental Services profitability from Q2 levels while the Safety-Kleen segment improved sequentially.
Looking at our segment results beginning on Slide 4, Environmental Services revenues declined 12% from a year ago due to the COVID related slowdown across multiple lines of business, partly offset by incineration and decontamination work.
