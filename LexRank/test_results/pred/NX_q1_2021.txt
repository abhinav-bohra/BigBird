Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 million in this segment which represents margin expansion of approximately 330 basis points compared to prior year.
On an adjusted basis, EBITDA for the quarter increased by 55.4% to $24.3 million, compared to $15.7 million during the same period of last year.
The increase was primarily the result of increased demand for our products across all product lines and operating segments.
Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million, resulted in margin expansion of approximately 660 basis points year over year.
As such, on a consolidated basis, we are confident in our ability to deliver low double-digit revenue growth this year while maintaining adjusted EBITDA margins in the low 12% range, despite the increasing inflationary pressures.
In addition, again, on a consolidated basis, it could prove challenging to realize margin expansion in the second half due to inflationary pressures, increased stock-based comp expense and a normalization of medical expenses.
Based on our strong first-quarter results and ongoing conversations with our customers, we are raising our expectations for the year and now expect approximately 12% sales growth in our North American fenestration segment, approximately 5% sales growth in our North American cabinet components segment and approximately 22% sales growth in our European fenestration segment.
