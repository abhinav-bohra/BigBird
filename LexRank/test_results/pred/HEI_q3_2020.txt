These decreases were partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense at Flight Support, which I previously mentioned was $7.5 million due to potential collection difficulties from certain commercial aviation customers that filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal '20 as a result of the financial impact of the outbreak as well as the increase from fiscal '19 and '20 acquisitions.
Consolidated net income per diluted share increased 4% to $1.83 in the first nine months of fiscal '20 and that was up from $1.76 in the first nine months of fiscal '19, and that increase principally reflects an incremental discrete tax benefit from stock option exercises, which were recognized in the first quarter of fiscal '20, less net income attributable to non-controlling interest and lower interest expense, partially offset by the previously mentioned lower operating income of Flight Support.
