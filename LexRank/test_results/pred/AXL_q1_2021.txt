And as for electrification, we are excited to announce today that AAM and REE Automotive have agreed to jointly develop an exciting new electric propulsion system for e-mobility.
AAM's partnership with REE intends to incorporate our lightweight highly efficient next-generation electric drive units which feature fully integrated high speed motors and inverters into REE's highly modular technology that enables a fully flat EV chassis for multiple commercial vehicle applications.
AAM has been able to capture an increase in sales with no net increase in SG&A expense.
For AAM, we will continue to work with our customers and our extended supply base to protect continuity of supply.
On a separate but related matter, we are also pleased to announce today that AAM will receive a grant from the US Department of Energy in support of the development of our three-in-one electric drive unit.
