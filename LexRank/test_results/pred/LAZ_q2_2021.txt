Assuming current macroeconomic conditions, as we said last quarter, we expect that our Financial Advisory revenue in the second half of 2021 will be higher than the first half.
In Asset Management, we entered the second half of the year with a record level of assets under management.
Overall, our advisory business is experiencing unprecedented activity levels.
Our Global Private Capital Advisory franchise also had a strong quarter serving financial sponsors with new fundraising and innovative secondary market solutions.
