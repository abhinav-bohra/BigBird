Adjusted gross profit margin increased to 36% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with 35% a year ago.
The adjusted operating income margin was flat despite the lower sales volume.
As anticipated the challenging business environment led to sales declines in the Food and Beverage, vehicle, and industrial end markets.
Additionally, demand in the automotive end market continues to be soft, therefore, as a result of the anticipated full-year decline in both RV and automotive customer sales, we continue to expect vehicle end-market sales to be down double-digits for the full year 2020.
As a result, we now expect the sales increase in the mid-single digits for the year in this market compared with our previous outlook about low single-digit increase.
