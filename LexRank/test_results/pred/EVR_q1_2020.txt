Advisory business, M&A is our largest revenue contributor and we expect that business to be negatively affected for some period of time.
In aggregate, our total revenues of $436 million from our investment banking businesses, advisory, underwriting and commissions, increased 10% versus the first quarter of last year.
Due to the strength of our advisory revenues compared to the declines experienced by our larger competitors, we expect to increase again our market share of advisory fees among all publicly reporting firms on a trailing 12-month basis, the 8.6% from 7.9% for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2019, and from 8.3% at the end of 2019.
As we enter a slower market for M&A activity and a more restructuring, debt advisory and liability management focused environment, our business is pivoting to meet the changing needs of our clients.
Advisory fees of $359 million, our largest revenue source, increased 10% compared to the first quarter of 2019, and held up very well compared to our larger competitors, almost all of whom experienced double-digit declines between 10% and 20% in their advisory revenues.
Our Private Capital Advisory business performed well during the quarter and completed assignments already in progress.
These businesses are smaller than our M&A advisory business and it will take time before the increase in revenue related to restructuring and debt and equity capital markets advisory activities are recognized.
Restructuring and debt advisory is building rapidly while M&A transactions are currently being delayed, postponed or put on hold, as buyers and sellers assess the duration and severity of the downturn.
Many of our private capital advisory assignments are currently on hold as investors are sidelined and are resetting their expectations.
On the other hand, the current environment has created opportunities for us as we have rapidly redirected our advisory efforts to adjust to the evolving needs of our clients.
