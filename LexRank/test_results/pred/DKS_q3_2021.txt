Through this collaboration, DICK'S and Nike will create unmatched value for our athletes through exclusive products, experiences, content and other specialized offers.
In our stores, we continue to make DICK's a great place to work, as we know that our people are our competitive differentiator and a great teammate experience drives a great athlete experience.
In addition to innovating within our core business, we also launched Public Lands, a new omnichannel specialty concept to better serve outdoor athletes.
Importantly, we also continue to drive a significant improvement in the profitability of our eCommerce channel by leveraging fixed costs, sustained athlete adoption of in-store pickup and curbside, as well as fewer and more targeted promotions.
And earlier this year, we launched two DICK'S House of Sport stores, highly experiential destinations that are redefining sports retail.
Compared to 2019, gross profit as a percent of net sales improved 886 basis points, driven by merchandise margin rate expansion of 578 basis points due to fewer promotions, as well as leverage on fixed occupancy costs of 370 basis points, which again was partially offset by higher freight costs.
During a time when consumers are making lasting lifestyle changes with an increased focus on health and fitness and greater participation in outdoor activities, we believe that DICK's Sporting Goods has become synonymous with sport in the United States.
Prior to DICK's, Navdeep spent 11 years at Advance Auto Parts in various leadership roles, most recently serving as Senior Vice President of Finance.
