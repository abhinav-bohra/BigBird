The unfavorable change was primarily due to the loss and loss adjustment expense at National in Q4 2019 compared to a loss and loss adjustment expense benefit in Q4 2018, which were both related primarily to National's insured Puerto Rico exposures.
The results for the quarter were driven by several factors: increased loss and loss adjustment expense at National related to its remaining Puerto Rico exposures, reflecting both views of the credits and the effect of higher discount rates on the present value of estimated future recoveries; increased loss and loss adjustment expense at MBIA Corp.
The decrease year-over-year was primarily due to the voluntary call at par in August of $150 million of MBIA Inc.'s 6.4% notes due in 2022.
As a result of the restructuring and the extinguishment of our COFINA exposure, along with claims payments that we have made on our other insured Puerto Rico exposure, our total insured debt service on Puerto Rico bonds has declined from $7.9 billion at year-end 2018 to $3.3 billion at the end of 2019.
National's leverage ratio of gross par to statutory capital declined to 21 to one, down from 23 to one at year-end 2018.
Our COFINA exposure accounted for approximately one half of our total insured Puerto Rico debt service.
