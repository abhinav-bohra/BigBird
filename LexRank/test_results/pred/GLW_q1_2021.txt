Corning experienced the most favorable first-quarter glass pricing environment in more than a decade.
We're living in a world that Corning anticipated exactly a decade ago in our video, A Day Made of Glass.
Noting both Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, the magazine named Corning, The Most Innovative Company in Consumer Electronics for 2021.
Corning is the industry leader and the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, which allows us to innovate on important dimensions not available to competitors.
We combine our unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms to develop category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives.
Stepping back, we are the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors.
And third, display glass manufacturing requires periodic investments in existing capacity to maintain operations.
And we announced a moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices for the second quarter.
