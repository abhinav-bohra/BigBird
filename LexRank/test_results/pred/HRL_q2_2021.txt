And as we saw across many of our refrigerated foodservice businesses, demand for avocado products in the channel started to return during the quarter.
In addition to foodservice growth, our retail and deli businesses also remained healthy with demand elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 32% due to higher foodservice sales, higher retail fresh pork profitability and decreased operational expenses due to abating COVID-19 cost pressures.
Branded exports also grew with growth coming from the SKIPPY and SPAM brands, higher foodservice sales and improved margins on the fresh pork items.
We anticipate strength in pork markets due to continued export demand and a foodservice recovery domestically.
Foodservice volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, driven by growth from SKIPPY, pizza toppings, and bacon items.
We anticipate markets to stabilize near the current levels, but volatility due to lower cold storage levels and strong demand in the foodservice channel could cause inflationary pressure.
