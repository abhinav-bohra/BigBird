Our water quality solution sales were also impacted by supply chain challenges on a more modest basis, yet still delivered results in line with our expectations.
SEA expenses increased $6.2 million year-over-year with the inclusion of the water quality acquisitions as well as more normalized pandemic impacted expenses such as travel.
