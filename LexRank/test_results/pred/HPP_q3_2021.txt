In the 3rd quarter, we had a robust same property NOI growth as our office and studio tenants continue to pay rent and repay deferred rent.
Our rent collections remained strong at 99% for our portfolio overall and 100% for office and studio tenants.
On the studio side, we plan to begin construction for our 241,000 square foot, Sunset Glenoaks Studios Development in Sun Valley before year-end, with delivery anticipated in the third quarter of 2023.
We unveiled plans for Sunset Glenoaks, which will be the first purpose-built studio in Los Angeles area in more than 20 years growing our studio footprint in that market to a 1.5 million square feet in two stages.
We purchase a major site north of London to build Sunset Waltham Cross which will be a large scale purpose-built facility with 15 to 25 new stages and we expanded our services platform with the purchase of the transportation and logistics companies, Star Waggons and Zio Studio Services, enhancing our existing clients experience, while capturing significant additional production-related revenue.
