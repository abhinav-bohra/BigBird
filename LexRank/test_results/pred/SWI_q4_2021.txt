For the full year, we delivered $719 million of GAAP revenues, representing flat year-over-year performance relative to 2020; and adjusted EBITDA of $303 million, representing a 42% EBITDA margin while growing subscription revenue 19% year over year on a GAAP basis.
Once again, we expect license and subscription revenue growth to be partially offset by a decline in maintenance revenue, which we expect to be down approximately 4% to 5% year over year.
As we talked about at our Analyst Day, our maintenance revenue has been impacted by a combination of year-over-year declines in license sales for the past nine quarters and a reduction in our renewal rates in 2021.
We anticipate both our license and subscription revenues to grow in 2022, reflecting a recovery in sales to new and existing customers and further expanding our recurring revenue base.
On-premises subscription sales resulted in an approximately 8 percentage point headwind to our license revenue for the quarter.
