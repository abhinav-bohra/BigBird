For the fourth quarter, overall with Alumar refinery production returning close to normal operating levels and if current Aluminum and Alumina index pricing levels persist, we expect another record-setting quarter.
Importantly, we also have ASIs Chain of Custody Certification, which allows us to sell ASI certified Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminum.
In the Aluminum segment, again excluding the San Ciprian impact Index pricing and currency impacts and assuming today's spot alumina prices persist, while we expect substantial benefit in the Alumina segment, Alumina costs in the Aluminum segment are estimated to increase by $100 million.
In the first two months of the quarter, ex-China Alumina prices remained more muted than in Aluminum, high freight costs made shipments to China unattractive and the market outside China had sufficient supply.
Now with Aluminum prices remaining at post global financial crisis highs and Alumina prices recovering nicely, earnings should be even better in the fourth quarter.
Revenues were up $744 million or 31% from the same period last year on higher aluminum and alumina prices.
Also, we'll talk more today about the strength in aluminum pricing and an improved pricing trend in Alumina.
The $110 million increase in adjusted EBITDA excluding special items was driven by higher metal prices as well as favorable currencies, slightly higher Alumina prices and better product pricing in Alumina and Aluminum.
To work toward this ambition, we are focused on increasing the share of our operations powered by renewable energy and commercializing some of the breakthrough innovations we've discussed previously, such as the ELYSIS technology which eliminates all direct greenhouse gases from the traditional aluminum smelting process and adapting Mechanical Vapor recompression to Alumina refining to further reduce our already low-carbon intensity.
And more generally, across our alumina refineries, it is important to note that Alcoa has the world's lowest carbon intensity in its global refining system.
Aside from Index pricing, currency and the San Ciprian impacts that I mentioned, the Alumina segment adjusted EBITDA is expected to be flat sequentially, higher shipments, cost improvements and the partial recovery from the Alumar unloader outage are expected to offset higher raw materials and energy costs.
In addition, we experienced a few other impacts in the quarter, higher raw material costs, mostly caustic in the Alumina segment and carbon products in smelting, higher energy costs in Europe and to a lesser extent in Brazil were unfavorable by $71 million.
The Alumar restart that will be powered by renewable energy, the joint development project for high purity alumina and our net-zero ambition.
