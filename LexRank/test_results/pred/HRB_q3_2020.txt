For H&R Block, as Jeff shared, we expect growth in DIY clients in line with the category, and an improvement in client trajectory in Assisted as we hold market share in that category.
Consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we expect these client growth and net average charge expectations along with Wave to result in revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%.
To summarize, we're on track to deliver our financial outlook for the year by digitally enabling our business, driving improved client trajectory in Assisted, innovating in Virtual, enhancing our award winning DIY product and expanding in small business.
Starting with the tax industry, we continue to expect overall return growth of around 1%, with Assisted volume flat to slightly up and DIY growing around 3%.
