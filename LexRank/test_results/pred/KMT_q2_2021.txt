As Chris mentioned, our expectation continues to be that simplification/modernization benefits for the total year will be approximately $80 million, driven by actions already taken or announced, bringing the total expected cumulative savings to $180 million by the end of fiscal year 2021.
Adjusted operating margin of 5.3% was up 50 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially.
Sequentially, despite rolling back many temporary cost control actions in the quarter, which should amounted to close to $10 million, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 170 basis points due to the improving market conditions and continued simplification/modernization savings.
