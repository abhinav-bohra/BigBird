Segment profit increased 2% for the quarter, driven by strong results in the International segment, Foodservice growth and the addition of Planters.
We expect a strong finish to the year as pricing actions continue to take effect, the foodservice industry continues to recover and from the addition of Planters.
Additionally, the prices of pork remained elevated caused by the recovery in the foodservice and the strong worldwide demand.
This guidance reflects the addition of the Planters business and includes the associated one-time transaction costs and accounting adjustments in addition to the impact from inflationary pressures on our business.
Excluding a partial quarter of the Planters business, organic sales increased 14% and volume declined 2%.
The guidance issued for the remainder of the year includes the impact of Planters and the expectations of continued inflationary pressure and volatile market conditions.
This all-time record performance was led by an acceleration in our Foodservice business, sustained demand for our retail and deli products, continued growth from our international business and pricing actions taken across the portfolio.
Whether it is cooking a meal at home, snacking at work, eating at a local restaurant, hosting a gathering with family and friends or ordering food online, a Hormel Foods branded product will likely be an option.
