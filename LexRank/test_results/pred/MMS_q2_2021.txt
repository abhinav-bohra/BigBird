Second quarter fiscal 2021 revenue in the U.S. Services segment increased to $448.2 million, driven by an estimated $175 million of COVID response work.
We expect significant improvement to the financial contribution from these contracts in fiscal 2022.
We project COVID response revenue will now range between $800 million and $850 million for the full fiscal year.
