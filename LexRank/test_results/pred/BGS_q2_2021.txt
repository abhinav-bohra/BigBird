Recent studies show that even in spring 2021, approximately 65% of consumers were baking at home at least once per week, lifting the prospects of our growing list of baking brands that includes B&G Foods stalwarts such as Brer Rabbit and Grandma's Molasses as well as more recent additions such as Clabber Girl and Crisco.
Many other brands and businesses that we have acquired, including spices, baking and meals, still have incredible opportunities in front of them.
As I mentioned earlier, interest expense, depreciation and amortization are continuing to trend higher than last year as a result of the Crisco acquisition.
Depreciation and amortization are also up year-over-year, driven primarily by Crisco.
Within the portfolio, our spices & seasonings baking and meals brands are up 20% versus Q2 2019.
