Our water and electric supply costs were $33.3 million for the quarter, an increase of $1 million from last year.
Regarding the pending general rate case covering rates for the years 2022 through 2024 at our water utility subsidiary Golden State Water Company, we're pleased to report that we have reached a settlement in principle with the public advocates office of the California Public Utilities Commission or CPUC for short, and nearly all of the items in the case.
As we discussed in our prior calls Golden State Water filed a general rate case application for all its water regions and the general office in July 2020.
Golden State Water and the public advocates office of the CPUC have reached the settlement agreement in principle on the majority of the items in this general rate case application.
