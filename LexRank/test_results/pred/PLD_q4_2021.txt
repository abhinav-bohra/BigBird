In fact, approximately 75% of the increase to our core FFO for 2022, excluding promotes, is derived from organic growth, principally same-store NOI and strategic capital fee-related earnings.
We are forecasting rent growth in our markets to be 11% in the U.S. and 10% globally.
This current rent spread represents embedded organic NOI of more than $1.2 billion or $1.55 per share that we will capture without any further market rent growth.
In addition, we see growing earnings from our Essentials business, which allows us to expand our services and solutions beyond rent.
