As Eric mentioned, assisted living operators are now included as eligible providers beginning with Phase 2 of the Provider Relief Fund, which equates to approximately 2% of 2019 revenue, which most of our operators have or expect to receive.
As a result, today, we're announcing additional rent deferrals for Bickford, which together with other previously announced rent deferrals, will impact cash NOI growth by up to approximately $5.5 million over the next two quarters or approximately 3.5% of our trailing six-month cash NOI before deferrals.
Bickford, our largest assisted living operator representing 15% of annualized cash revenue, experienced an 80 basis point sequential decline in third quarter average occupancy, which compared to 270 basis point decline in the prior quarter comparison.
However, between our operators' exceptional capabilities, additional federal support and our other cash sources that we can make available to our operators under our leases such as deposits and escrows, we do continue to be confident that any additional occupancy loss or coverage decline will not necessarily translate into additional dollar-for-dollar rent deferrals.
