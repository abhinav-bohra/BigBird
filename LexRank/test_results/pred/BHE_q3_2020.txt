Now turning to the medical sector.
Our non-GAAP earnings per share improved sequentially based on our improved operational performance, lower net interest expense and lower tax rate.
For Q3, our non-GAAP gross margin was 8.7%, a 170 basis point sequential increase.
The resulting non-GAAP operating margin target range will be between 3.4% to 3.8%.
Moving to the A&D sector outlook.
Overall, for the fourth quarter, we expect increased revenues from stronger demand and new programs in defense, industrials and telco to offset anticipated declines in medical as we pivot manufacturing from COVID-19-related therapeutic equipment to diagnostic, trauma and elective surgical devices.
We expect that our gross margins will be 9% to 9.1% for Q4, and SG&A will range between $29 million to $30 million.
