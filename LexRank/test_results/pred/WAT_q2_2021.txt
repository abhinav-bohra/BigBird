As outlined on Slide 5, in the second quarter, our revenue grew 31% as reported and 27% on a constant currency basis, reflecting continued strength in our pharma and industrial end markets with strong demand for both our instrument systems and recurring revenue products across our major geographies.
These dynamics support updated full year 2021 guidance of 13% to 15% constant currency sales growth.
By end market, our largest market category, pharma, grew 31% in constant currency; industrial grew 28%; and academia and government grew 7%.
Moving down the P&L, operating expenses increased by approximately 39% on a constant currency basis and 42% on a reported basis.
Looking at the third quarter of 2021, we expect constant currency sales growth to be 7% to 9%.
Moving now to our sales performance by geography on a constant currency basis.
First, by operating segment, our Waters Division grew 27%, while TA grew by 32% on a constant currency basis.
Continued strength in sales to pharma customers was broad-based across customer segments, geographies and applications.
