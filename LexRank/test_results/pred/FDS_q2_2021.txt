Based on the first half results, we are encouraged by the client response to our enhanced product suite reflected in both growth in new clients as well as increased expansion with existing clients.
We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year, reaching over 6,000 clients for the first time in our history.
This growth reflects the addition of more wealth and corporate clients as well as data providers and asset owners, an ongoing trend as we continue to diversify our client base.
I'm proud of the ways in which we are showing up for one another and for our clients every day.
