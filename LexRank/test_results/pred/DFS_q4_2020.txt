In summary, we had a solid fourth quarter with strong credit performance across the portfolio, net interest margin expansion driven by lower funding costs, flat reserves; and excluding one-time items, operating expenses were down year-over-year.
Turning to loan growth on Slide 5.
Moving to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 10.
Most of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition as we aligned marketing spend and tightened credit criteria in response to this changing economic environment.
As expected, the tightening of our underwriting criteria combined with elevated payment rates impacted our loan growth and our total loans decreased 6% year-over-year.
Total loans were down 6% from the prior year driven by a 7% decrease in card receivables.
Excluding one-time items, expenses were down 4% from the prior year.
However, we took substantial market share in private student lending and gain share in card lending.
