We opened 44 new tenants and 276,000 square feet, resulting in total annual rent of $11.3 million.
Our second quarter was more about getting centers opened and getting our tenants open safely and less about leasing.
As our centers continue to open and as our retailers opened and were able to trade with some consistency, the leasing climate began to improve.
