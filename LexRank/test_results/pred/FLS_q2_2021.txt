Based on the combination of our strong first half bookings, driven mostly by shorter-cycle aftermarket and MRO activities and visibility into improving end markets, Flowserve was pleased to increase our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the full year to $1.45 to $1.65.
Delivering these level of bookings or higher would position Flowserve well to deliver a strong 2022 financial performance.
We are confident in our ability to continue to grow the Flowserve enterprise and ultimately restore our bookings to pre-pandemic levels in the coming quarters.
At this level, Q2 was a momentum-building quarter for Flowserve, as our bookings inflected upward and we now have clear line of sight to earnings growth.
To make the transition, a number of Flowserve pumps required upgrades to support the new application conditions and improve the operator's production and energy efficiency.
RedRaven is clearly adding value to Flowserve and to our customers.
