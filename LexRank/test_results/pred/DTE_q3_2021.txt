The $1 billion increase in our DTE Electric five-year plan is driven by distribution infrastructure investments, preparing our grid for electrification, and hardening initiatives, an increased cleaner energy investment due to our voluntary renewable program, which is still exceeding our high expectations.
At DTE Electric, we announced our plan to accelerate decarbonization by ceasing coal use at the Belle River Power Plant by 2028, reducing carbon emissions by 50% two years earlier than originally planned.
In 2022, at DTE Electric Group growth will be driven by distribution and cleaner generation investments.
At DTE Gas, we are on track to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
