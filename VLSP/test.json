Many of these systems have direct physical applications. And\nalso, since we can solve them exactly, the integrable systems are often\nconsidered as toy models and provide us with indispensable intuition for\ninvestigation of more complicated theories.\n\nA class of integrable systems can be solved by means of the Bethe\nAnsatz. Bethe Ansatz was invented for the solution of the Heisenberg\nmagnet in a seminal work [ 1 ] in 1931. The solvability by means of the\nBethe Ansatz essentially relies on the two-dimensionality of the\nconsidered system. Therefore the Bethe Ansatz works in the\ntwo-dimensional statistical models and @xmath dimensional quantum field\ntheories. A two-dimensional integrable structure was also identified in\na way explained below in the four-dimensional gauge theory: @xmath\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM). This theory became therefore the first\nexample of a non-trivial four dimensional quantum field theory where\nsome results were found exactly at arbitrary value of the coupling\nconstant.\n\n@xmath SYM is also famous due to its conjectured equivalence [ 2 , 3 , 4\n] to type IIB string theory on AdS @xmath S @xmath . This duality is the\nfirst explicit and the most studied example of the gauge-string duality\nknown as the AdS\/CFT correspondence. This duality is usually studied in\nits weaker form, which states the equivalence between the \u2019t Hooft\nplanar limit of the gauge theory and the free string theory.\n\nThe AdS\/CFT correspondence between gauge and string theories is the\nduality of weak\/strong coupling type. It allows giving an adequate\ndescription of the strongly coupled gauge theory. On the other hand, the\nweak\/strong coupling nature of the duality conjecture makes difficult to\nprove it. Except for the quantities protected by the symmetry and some\nspecial limiting regimes, comparison of gauge and string theory\npredictions requires essentially nonperturbative calculations. This is\nwhere the integrability turns out to be extremely useful.\n\nOn the gauge side of the correspondence the integrability was initially\ndiscovered in the 1-loop calculation of anomalous dimensions of single\ntrace local operators [ 5 ] . Later it was conjectured to hold at all\nloops [ 6 ] . According to the integrability conjecture, the single\ntrace local operators correspond to the states of an integrable spin\nchain in which the dilatation operator plays the role of a Hamiltonian.\nAt one-loop level this is a spin chain with the nearest neighbors\u2019\ninteractions. It can be diagonalized for example by algebraic Bethe\nAnsatz. The all-loop structure of the spin chain is much more\ncomplicated. In particular, the all-loop Hamiltonian is not known.\nLuckily, one of the beauties of the integrability is that it gives us a\nway to find the spectrum of the system even without knowledge of the\nexact form of the Hamiltonian. This solution can be obtained by\napplication of the method which was initially developed in [ 7 ] for the\ntwo dimensional relativistic integrable theories. We will now briefly\nrecall this method.\n\nLet us consider a two dimensional integrable relativistic quantum field\ntheory which has massive particles as asymptotic states. Due to the\nexistence of higher conserved charges, the number of particles is\npreserved under scattering and the scattering factorizes into @xmath\nprocesses. Therefore the dynamics of the system is determined by the\ntwo-particle @xmath -matrix. This @xmath -matrix is determined up to an\noverall scalar factor by the requirement of invariance under the\nsymmetry group and by the Yang-Baxter equation (self consistency of\ntwo-particle factorization). The overall scalar factor is uniquely fixed\nby the unitarity and crossing conditions and the assumption about the\nparticle content of the theory.\n\nLet our field theory be defined on a cylinder of circumference @xmath .\nThe notion of asymptotic states and scattering can be defined only for\n@xmath , where @xmath is the mass of the particles. If this condition is\nsatisfied, the system of @xmath particles is completely described by the\nset of their momenta and additional quantum numbers. Once the quantum\nnumbers are chosen, the momenta of the particles can be found from the\nperiodicity conditions which lead to the Bethe equations. In the\nsimplest case when particles do not bear additional quantum numbers the\nBethe equations are written as:\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (1)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nThe energy of the system can be found from the dispersion relation:\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (2)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nTherefore the knowledge of the scattering matrix solves the spectral\nproblem of the theory.\n\nFor simplicity we ignored the fact that the masses of the particles can\nbe in principle different.\n\nIt turns out that the AdS\/CFT integrable spin chain can be also\ndescribed in terms of the factorized scattering. This idea was initially\nproposed by Staudacher in [ 8 ] . In [ 9 ] Beisert showed that the\nscattering matrix can be fixed up to an overall scalar factor, known\nalso as the dressing factor, already from the symmetry of the system.\nThe Yang-Baxter equation is then satisfied automatically. The dispersion\nrelation for the excitations is given by the expression\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (3)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nwhere @xmath is the \u2019t Hooft coupling constant. This dispersion relation\nwas initially derived in [ 10 ] .\n\nIn [ 9 ] the Bethe Ansatz equations were derived from the knowledge of\n@xmath -matrix using the nested Bethe Ansatz procedure. The equations\ncoincided with the ones conjectured in [ 11 ] . Note that the equations\nare defined up to the dressing factor which cannot be fixed from the\nsymmetry.\n\nAlthough the logic of derivation is similar to the one in the field\ntheory, in AdS\/CFT we are dealing with the spin chain. This is seen in\nparticular in the dispersion relation which contains the sine function.\nAs in field theory, the resulting Bethe Ansatz is valid only in the\nlimit of large volume and is usually called the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.\n\nIn spin chains the notion of the cross channel is not defined. Therefore\nthe formulation of the crossing equations is not obvious and this\nprevents us from imposing constraints on the dressing factor. It seems\nthat knowledge that the spin chain describes the spectral problem of\n@xmath SYM is insufficient to fix the dressing factor of the scattering\nmatrix. However, we can try using the fact that due to the duality\nconjecture the AdS\/CFT spin chain should solve also in some sense the\nstring theory. We therefore turn to the discussion of the string side of\nthe correspondence.\n\nAccording to the duality conjecture, the conformal dimensions of local\noperators are equivalent to the energies of string states. The free\nstring theory is described by the supersymmetric sigma model \u00b9 \u00b9 1 with\nproperly taken into account Virasoro constraints and remaining gauge\nfreedom which come from the dynamical nature of the worldsheet metric in\nstring theory. [ 12 ] which is classically integrable [ 13 ] \u00b2 \u00b2 2 The\nintegrable structures were discovered in the same time in gauge and\nstring theories. Developments of the integrability ideas on both sides\nof the correspondence mutually used insights from each other . Assuming\nits quantum integrability, we again can describe the system in terms of\nthe factorized scattering matrix and construct the corresponding Bethe\nAnsatz from it. The AdS\/CFT correspondence then implies that we will\nobtain the same Bethe Ansatz equations as for the solution of spin\nchain. In [ 14 ] Hofman and Maldacena proposed to identify special\none-particle excitations of the spin chain with special string\nconfigurations known since then as giant magnons. The proposed\nidentification conformed also the dispersion relation ( 3 ). The\nphysical equivalence of scattering matrices for the sigma model and for\nthe spin chain was shown in [ 15 ] . Therefore we get an interesting\nphenomenon: a discrete spin chain solves a continuous field theory.\n\nDue to this phenomenon we can expect the existence of the crossing\nequations for the scattering matrix of spin chain excitations. This is\nnot granted, since relativistic invariance of the system is broken by\nthe gauge fixing. In [ 16 ] Janik assumed that the crossing equations\nare however present. He derived these equations by purely algebraic\nmeans. We will explain his reasoning in details in subsection 6.3.1 of\nthis thesis.\n\nThe existence of a non-trivial dressing factor was established before\nthe crossing equations were formulated. The dressing factor was found at\nthe leading [ 17 ] and subleading [ 18 ] orders of strong coupling\nexpansion by comparison of the algebraic curve solutions [ 19 ] for the\nsigma model and the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. At first three orders of\nweak coupling expansion perturbative calculations of the gauge theory\nshowed that the dressing factor equals @xmath . If the duality\nconjecture is true the dressing factor should interpolate between its\nvalues at weak and strong coupling.\n\nBeisert, Hernandez, and Lopez [ 20 ] checked that the results [ 17 , 18\n] at strong coupling satisfy the crossing equations and proposed a class\nof asymptotic solutions to the crossing equations to all orders of\nperturbation theory. Based on this proposal and using a nontrivial\nressumation trick, Beisert, Eden, and Staudacher [ 21 ] conjectured a\nconvergent weak coupling expansion for the dressing factor and found the\nnonperturbative expression that reproduced that expansion. Their\nproposal is known now as the BES\/BHL dressing factor. Based on this\nconjecture they formulated the integral equation known as the BES\nequation. This equation was the Eden-Staudacher equation [ 22 ] modified\nbecause of the non-triviality of the dressing factor. The solution of\nthe BES equation allows one to find the cusp anomalous dimension - the\nquantity that acquired attention both at gauge and string side of the\ncorrespondence. The BES\/BHL proposal passed a non-trivial check. The\ncusp anomalous dimension calculated in [ 21 ] up to fourth order in the\nweak coupling expansion from the BES equation coincided with the\nfour-loop perturbative calculations in @xmath SYM [ 23 ] .\n\nThe @xmath -matrix fixed by the symmetry and equipped with the BES\/BHL\ndressing factor defines the AdS\/CFT integrable system. The anomalous\ndimensions at arbitrary values of the coupling constant can be computed\nusing the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. Since integrability was not\nrigorously proven, the validity of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz had to be\nchecked.\n\n##### Personal contribution\n\nThe verification of the AdS\/CFT Bethe Ansatz at strong coupling was the\nsubject which initiated my PhD research. This verification resulted in\nthe papers [ KSV1 , KSV2 , V1 ] . In the papers [ KSV1 , KSV2 ] we\nanalyzed the strong coupling expansion of the BES equation, the paper [\nV1 ] was devoted to the strong coupling solution of the generalization\nof the BES equation proposed in [ 24 , 25 ] . These problems proved to\nbe rather difficult. The solution of these equations was a subject of\ninterest of several theoretical groups [ 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 ] , [ 30 , 31\n] , [ 32 , 33 ] , [ 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ] . In our works we realized that\nit was particularly useful to rewrite the integral equation in the form\nof a specific Riemann-Hilbert problem. Such representation allowed\nfurther significant simplifications of the equations and finally allowed\nto solve them perturbatively.\n\nThe developed techniques turned out to be useful for the solution of\nsimilar integral equations that appeared in different integrable models.\nIn [ V2 ] we applied this techniques to find the free energy of the\n@xmath sigma model in the presence of magnetic field at first 26 orders\nof the perturbative expansion. The solution at leading and subleading\norders allowed deriving analytically the exact value of mass gap, which\nwas guessed previously from numerics in [ 38 , 39 ] . Higher orders of\nthe perturbative expansion allowed testing the properties of Borel\nsummability of the model.\n\nMy fifth paper [ V3 ] gave another evidence for the correctness of the\nAdS\/CFT asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The paper was devoted to the solution\nof the crossing equation for the dressing factor. Despite many checks of\nthe BES\/BHL proposal this dressing factor was never obtained directly\nfrom the solution of the crossing equation. In [ V3 ] we presented such\nkind of derivation. Moreover, we showed that the solution of the\ncrossing equations is unique if to impose quite natural requirements on\nthe analytical structure of the scattering matrix and to demand the\nproper structure of singularities that correspond to the physical bound\nstates in the theory.\n\nThis thesis contains most of the results of the mentioned works [ KSV1 ,\nKSV2 , V1 , V2 , V3 ] . The references to these works are listed at the\nend of the introductory chapter. However, as we will now explain, the\ndiscussed topics in the thesis are not enclosed with explanation of [\nKSV1 , KSV2 , V1 , V2 , V3 ] .\n\n##### About functional equations\n\nWhile we considered particular problems in the context of the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence, it became clear that formulation following from the\nBethe Ansatz integral equations in the functional form reveals\nresemblance between the AdS\/CFT integrable system and rational\nintegrable systems. Therefore we put a lot of attention in this thesis\nto reviewing of the simplest rational integrable models, such as XXX\nspin chain and Gross-Neveu and principal chiral field sigma models.\nInstead of using more usual language of integral equations or Fourier\ntransform we perform the review in terms of the functional equations.\nThen we are able to present the AdS\/CFT case as a generalization of\nrational integrable systems. Basically AdS\/CFT spin chain requires for\nits formulation only one additional integral kernel @xmath with simple\nanalytical properties.\n\nIn the first part of this thesis we also devote attention to such topics\nas Hirota relations and thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA). Also these\nsubjects are not directly used by us in the AdS\/CFT case, there are\nnumber of reasons to include them in the current work. First of all, TBA\nhas a remarkable algebraic structure based on two deformed Cartan\nmatrices. This algebraic structure is seen also on the level of (linear)\nfunctional equations. Second, the structure of the supersymmetric Bethe\nAnsatz is much better seen if Hirota relations are used for its\nderivation [ 40 ] . Third, the discussion of TBA in the rational case\ncan be thought as a preparation for the subject of TBA in the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence which has been recently studied in the literature [ 41 ,\n42 , 43 ] , [ 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ] .\n\nThe name \u201dfunctional equations\u201d is mostly used in this thesis to denote\nthe functional equations that were used for the asymptotic solution of\nintegral Bethe Ansatz equations. These functional equations are linear.\nThis thesis deals also with two nonlinear functional equations. The\nfirst type is the Hirota equations. Since Hirota equations coincide with\nthe TBA equations, the algebraic structure of Hirota equations can be\nalso seen from the algebraic structure of linear functional equations.\nThe second type is the crossing equations.\n\n##### Original results presented in this thesis\n\nThis thesis contains few minor original results that were not published\nbefore.\n\nIn chapter 7 we present the solution of the @xmath Heisenberg magnet in\nthe logarithmic regime and at large values of @xmath . This solution is\nbased on the techniques developed in [ KSV2 , V1 , V2 ] . The solution\ngives a check of the two-loop strong coupling expansion of the\ngeneralized scaling function performed in [ 48 ] , [ V1 ] .\n\nIn Sec. 3.5 we show for the case of the @xmath Gross-Neveu model and\nequally polarized excitations that the transfer matrices of the spin\nchain discretization become in the thermodynamic limit the @xmath\n-functions which appear in the TBA system.\n\nIn Sec. 4.5 we show that the integral equations for the densities of\nstring configurations in the @xmath case fit the fat hook structure \u00b3 \u00b3\n3 We were informed that this result was also obtained by V.Kazakov,\nA.Kozak, and P.Vieira, however it has not been published. . This is\ngeneralization of the known results for the @xmath and the @xmath cases.\n\nIn Sec. 8.3 we give an alternative to [ 34 ] derivation of the @xmath\nsigma model from the BES\/FRS equation. This an important check of the\nAdS\/CFT integrable system originally proposed in [ 49 ] and explicitly\nrealized in [ 34 ] .\n\nIn appendix C we solve the mirror crossing equations in a similar way as\nthe physical crossing equations were solved in [ V3 ] . This allows\nderiving the mirror integrable theory based only on the symmetries of\nthe system, without performing analytical continuation from the physical\ntheory.\n\n##### Structure of the thesis\n\nThe text of the thesis is divided into three parts. The parts were\ndesigned in a way that the reader familiar with basic aspects of\nintegrability could read each part separately. Therefore some concepts\nare repeated throughout the text.\n\n###### Part 1. Integrable systems with rational R-matrix.\n\nThe main goal of this part is to give a pedagogical introduction to the\nsubject of integrability.\n\nIn the first chapter we introduce the Bethe Ansatz for the integrable\nXXX spin chain. The XXX spin chain can be easily formulated and the\nBethe Ansatz solution is the exact one. This Bethe Ansatz is also\nimportant since it describes the AdS\/CFT integrable system at one-loop\napproximation on the gauge side.\n\nIn the second chapter we discuss the Bethe Ansatz solution of IQFT on\nthe example of the principal chiral field (PCF) and the Gross-Neveu (GN)\nmodels. We exploit the constructions developed in the first chapter\nsince the @xmath -matrix in such models up to a scalar factor coincides\nwith the @xmath -matrix of the XXX spin chain.\n\nThe third chapter aims to show that the PCF and GN models can be viewed\nas a certain thermodynamic limit of the XXX spin chain. The derivation\nis based on the string hypothesis. We show also that the functional\nstructure of the Y-system is basically dictated by the functional\nstructure of the equations for the resolvents of string configurations.\n\nThe fourth chapter is devoted to the supersymmetric generalization of\nthe ideas developed in the previous chapters.\n\n###### Part 2. Integrable system of AdS\/CFT.\n\nThis part is devoted for reviewing of the integrability in AdS\/CFT.\n\nIn the fifth chapter we make a general overview of the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence, explain how the integrable system appeared in the\nspectral problem and discuss the main examples of the local\noperators\/string states which were investigated in the literature.\n\nIn the sixth chapter we explain the main steps for the construction of\nthe asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The second part of this chapter is devoted\nto the solution of the crossing equations which is based on the author\u2019s\nwork [ V3 ] .\n\n###### Part 3. Integral Bethe Ansatz equations.\n\nThis part is based on the original works [ KSV1 , KSV2 , V1 , V2 ] . It\nis devoted to the perturbative solution of a certain class of integral\nBethe Ansatz equations. The method of the solution is basically the same\nfor all three cases that are considered (one chapter for one case). This\npart is provided with its own introduction.\n\n### List of author\u2019s works.\n\n-    [KSV1] I.\u00a0Kostov, D.\u00a0Serban and D.\u00a0Volin, \u201cStrong coupling limit of\n    Bethe Ansatz equations,\u201d Nucl.\u00a0Phys.\u00a0 B 789 , 413 (2008)\n    [arXiv:hep-th\/0703031].\n-    [KSV2] I.\u00a0Kostov, D.\u00a0Serban and D.\u00a0Volin, \u201cFunctional BES\n    equation,\u201d JHEP 0808 , 101 (2008) [arXiv:0801.2542 [hep-th]].\n-    [V1] D.\u00a0Volin, \u201cThe 2-loop generalized scaling function from the\n    BES\/FRS equation,\u201d [arXiv:0812.4407 [hep-th]].\n-    [V2] D.\u00a0Volin, \u201cFrom the mass gap in O(N) to the\n    non-Borel-summability in O(3) and O(4) sigma-models,\u201d\n    [arXiv:0904.2744 [hep-th]].\n-    [V3] D.\u00a0Volin, \u201cMinimal solution of the AdS\/CFT crossing equation,\u201d\n    J.\u00a0Phys.\u00a0A 42 , 372001 (2009) [arXiv:0904.4929 [hep-th]].\n\n## Part I Integrable systems with rational R-matrix\n\n### Chapter 1 @xmath XXX spin chains\n\n#### 1.1 Coordinate Bethe Ansatz\n\nThe Bethe Ansatz is one of the most important tools for the solution of\nthe quantum integrable models. It is applicable to all the integrable\nmodels considered in this thesis. In the first part of the thesis we\nwould try to give a pedagogical review of the Bethe Ansatz and related\ntopics with the perspective to the modern applications. For other\npedagogical texts see [ 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 ] .\n\nThe Bethe Ansatz was initially proposed in [ 1 ] for the solution of the\n@xmath XXX spin chain which served as an approximation for the\ndescription of the one-dimensional metal. We will study a slightly more\ngeneral @xmath case. The @xmath XXX spin chain is defined as follows. To\neach node of the chain we associate the integer number with possible\nvalues from @xmath to @xmath . In other words, each node carries a state\nin the fundamental representation of @xmath . The Hamiltonian is given\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the operator that permutes the @xmath states at sites\n@xmath and @xmath .\n\nThe problem of the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian can be solved by\nthe coordinate Bethe Ansatz. To show how it works, we should choose a\npseudovacuum of the system. A possible choice is @xmath (the number zero\nis assigned to all the nodes). This is indeed a state with the lowest\nenergy, although this energy level is highly degenerated due to the\n@xmath symmetry of the system. For the opposite sign of the Hamiltonian\n(antiferromagnetic spin chain) this state is no longer the vacuum but\njust a suitable state for the construction of the coordinate Bethe\nAnsatz.\n\nWe consider subsequently the one-, two-, three- e.t.c particle\nexcitations. By @xmath -particle excitation we mean a state in which the\nvalues of exactly @xmath nodes are different from @xmath .\n\nFrom the one-particle excitations we can compose a plane wave excitation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis plane wave is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian with the\neigenvalue\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor the investigation of the two-particle excitations let us first\nconsider the following state:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.4)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nThe Hamiltonian does not act diagonally on it. However, its action can\nbe represented in the following form:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (1.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIt is straightforward to check that the terms @xmath cancel out if we\nconsider the following linear combination\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwith\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe matrix @xmath is called the scattering matrix. Note that indices\n@xmath and @xmath take values from @xmath to @xmath . This is because\nthe pseudovacuum is not invariant under the @xmath symmetry but only\nunder the @xmath subgroup, therefore the excitations over the\npseudovacuum transform under @xmath .\n\nIt is useful to introduce the rapidity variable @xmath via the relation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn terms of the rapidity variables the @xmath matrix has a simpler form:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere the operator @xmath permutes the @xmath states of the particles. It\nis different from @xmath in ( 1.1 ) where @xmath states were permuted.\n\nFor a sufficiently long spin chain we can give a physical interpretation\nfor ( 1.6 ) as the scattering process. Let us take @xmath . The function\n@xmath is interpreted as the initial state: the particle with momenta\n@xmath is on the left side from the particle @xmath . The function\n@xmath represents the out state. Scattering of the particles leads to\nthe exchange of their flavors and to the appearance of the relative\nphase. The scattering is encoded in the @xmath matrix. The permutation\noperator @xmath in ( 1.9 ) exchanges the flavors of the particles \u00b9 \u00b9 1\nWe chose the notation in which the flavor is attached to the momenta of\nthe particle. The other notation is also possible in which the flavor is\nattached to the relative position of the particle. In the latter\nnotation the @xmath matrix differs by multiplication on the permutation\noperator. .\n\nThe two particle wave function ( 1.6 ) can be written in a condensed\nnotation as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt turns out that for the three-particle case the following linear\ncombination\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian with the eigenvalue @xmath . It\ncan be interpreted as the combination of all possible configurations\nobtained from the pairwise scattering of initial configuration given by\n@xmath . The property that we encounter only the @xmath scattering\nprocess is an essential property of the integrability.\n\nThe last term in @xmath can be written also as @xmath . This is because\nthe process @xmath can be obtained in two different ways. The\nindependence of the order of individual scattering processes is encoded\nin the Yang-Baxter equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is straightforward to check that this equation is satisfied by the\n@xmath matrix ( 1.9 ). The scattering matrix also satisfies the\nunitarity condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us consider now the states with larger number of particles. The\nsolution of the diagonalization problem is obtained in a similar way.\nThis solution is known as the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. The @xmath\n-particle wave function is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all permutations. The symbol @xmath means\nthe following. We choose a realization of @xmath in terms of a product\nof the elementary permutations: @xmath . The transpositions of only the\nneighboring particles are allowed. Then @xmath . The construction of the\nwave function is unambiguous since the @xmath matrix satisfies the\nYang-Baxter equation ( 1.12 ) and the unitarity condition ( 1.13 ).\n\nThe Ansatz ( 1.14 ) gives the solution of the diagonalization problem\nfor the case of the spin chain on infinite line. For the case of the\nperiodic spin chain of length @xmath there are constraints on the\npossible values of momenta. To write down these constraints we first\nneed to introduce an appropriate basis in the space of functions ( 1.14\n).\n\nThe scattering matrix is invariant under action of the @xmath group.\nTherefore, instead @xmath where @xmath is the projector to a chosen\nrepresentation @xmath of the @xmath group. As we will show in the next\nsection, it is possible to decompose the whole representation space\n@xmath in a sum of irreps\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsuch that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe ordering in the product is taken in such a way that @xmath is to the\nright from @xmath if @xmath mod @xmath .\n\nFor @xmath the decomposition ( 1.15 ) is a trivial property since the\nscattering matrix commutes with the symmetry generators. The nontrivial\nstatement for @xmath is in simultaneous validity of ( 1.16 ) for\ndifferent values of @xmath .\n\nWe chose a basis in such a way that each basis wave function lies inside\nsome irrep @xmath . The periodicity condition, which can be written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nimplies the following equations on @xmath , @xmath , for a chosen irrep\n@xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nOnce momenta satisfy ( 1.18 ), @xmath is the eigenfunction of the\nHamiltonian on the periodic chain of length @xmath with the energy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that if the set of momenta @xmath is a solution of ( 1.18 ) for a\ngiven representation @xmath , there is no guaranty that the same set of\nmomenta would be a solution for a different representation. In fact, the\ngeneral situation is that a set of momenta is a solution of ( 1.18 ) for\nonly one representation @xmath .\n\nThe equations ( 1.18 ) are best written in terms of the nested transfer\nmatrix \u00b2 \u00b2 2 We use the adjective \u201dnested\u201d to distinguish ( 1.20 ) with\nwhat is usually called the transfer matrix and which we introduce later.\nwhich is defined as follows. We introduce an auxiliary particle @xmath ,\nwith rapidity @xmath , in the fundamental representation of the @xmath\ngroup. The nested transfer matrix is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the trace is token over the representation space of the auxiliary\nparticle. Since @xmath , the periodicity conditions ( 1.18 ) can be\nwritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor the case @xmath the @xmath matrix is just a scalar function and the\nequations ( 1.21 ) reduce to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich are the Bethe Ansatz equations for the @xmath XXX spin chain.\n\nLet us now briefly describe how the solutions of the Bethe equations (\n1.22 ) are mapped to the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian ( 1.1 ) for the\ncase @xmath .\n\nThe solutions with at least two coinciding rapidities lead to a zero\nwave function. This is due to the fact that @xmath . Each solution with\npairwise different rapidities, @xmath , and finite values of @xmath\nleads to an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian \u00b3 \u00b3 3 There are few solutions\nof exceptional type of the Bethe equations, which require the proper\nregularization to fit this picture. The example is the solution @xmath\nfor @xmath and @xmath . . This eigenstate is a highest weight vector in\nthe irreducible multiplet of @xmath . To obtain the other states of this\nmultiplet we have to add subsequently the particles with infinite\nrapidities (zero momenta) to the solution. Adding the particle with\ninfinite rapidity is equivalent to the action of the lowering generator\nof the @xmath algebra on the wave function. The Bethe Ansatz solution is\ncomplete [ 56 ] . This means that all the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian\ncan be obtained by the procedure that we described.\n\n#### 1.2 Nested\/Algebraic Bethe Ansatz\n\nFor @xmath we have to diagonalize the nested transfer matrix (perform\nthe decomposition ( 1.15 )) in order to solve the periodicity conditions\n( 1.21 ). This is the subject of the nested Bethe Ansatz. We consider\nfirst the case of the @xmath spin chain.\n\nIn this case the excitations over the pseudovacuum can have only two\nlabels, @xmath and @xmath .\n\nIt is instructive to use the graphical representation (see Fig. 1.1 )\nfor the algebraic constructions that we will use. In the graphical\nrepresentation each particle is represented by an arrow. For each arrow\nwe assign the rapidity and the color. If the direction is not shown\nexplicitly we take by default that the particle propagates 1)from left\nto right and 2)from bottom to top. @xmath matrix is given as an\nintersection of two lines (scattering of the particles).\n\nThe graphical representation of the nested monodromy matrix @xmath and\nthe nested transfer matrix @xmath defined by ( 1.20 ) are shown in\nFig.\u00a0( 1.2 ).\n\nThe nested monodromy matrix @xmath scatters the auxiliary particle\nthrough all the physical particles. Since in the considered case (\n@xmath ) particles can be in one of two states ( @xmath or @xmath ), we\ncan write the nested monodromy matrix as a two by two matrix with\nelements acting on the physical space only:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nObviously, @xmath .\n\nThe nested transfer matrices with different values of @xmath commute\nwith one another:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIndeed, from the Yang-Baxter equation the following equation follows:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n              @xmath               \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.25)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nIt can be also rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTaking the trace over the representation spaces of both auxiliary\nparticles in ( 1.26 ) we prove the commutativity of the nested transfer\nmatrices.\n\nDue to the commutativity of the nested transfer matrices the\nsimultaneous diagonalization of @xmath is possible. Since @xmath is\ninvariant under the symmetry algebra, the condition ( 1.16 ) can be also\nsatisfied and the Bethe Ansatz equations ( 1.21 ) can be constructed.\n\nTo solve the problem of diagonalization of @xmath we first introduce a\nnested pseudovacuum. It consists of the particles with rapidities @xmath\n, all of them are of the color @xmath . We will denote this new\npseudovacuum as @xmath .\n\nThe nested transfer matrix acts diagonally on @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we introduced the Baxter polynomial\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nExcitations over the nested pseudovacuum are generated by @xmath\noperators:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese states are given by the diagram in Fig. 1.3 .\n\nGenerically, the action of the nested transfer matrix on the state\n@xmath is not diagonal. However this is the case if the rapidities\n@xmath satisfy the relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe eigenvalue of the transfer matrix is then given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere we do not prove that the condition ( 1.30 ) is necessary and\nsufficient to diagonalize action of @xmath . See for example [ 51 ] .\nHowever note that the relation ( 1.30 ) can be read from the eigenvalue\nof the transfer matrix in the following way. From the form of the @xmath\nmatrix we see that the nested transfer matrix cannot have poles at\n@xmath . The application of this demand to ( 1.31 ) gives us ( 1.30 ).\n\nIf we shift the variables @xmath by @xmath , the equation ( 1.30 )\nacquires the form of the nested Bethe Ansatz equation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe periodicity condition ( 1.21 ) leads to the following Bethe\nequation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFrom solution of ( 1.33 ) and ( 1.32 ) we can construct the eigenstate\nfor the @xmath XXX spin chain using ( 1.29 ) and ( 1.14 ) and find its\nenergy using ( 1.19 ).\n\n###### Algebraic Bethe Ansatz for the @xmath XXX spin chain\n\nWe can make another interpretation for the relations ( 1.30 ). If to put\nall the @xmath equal to @xmath , then ( 1.30 ) transforms to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is nothing but the Bethe Ansatz ( 1.22 ) for the Heisenberg @xmath\nXXX spin chain with @xmath replaced by @xmath .\n\nOf course, when all @xmath are equal, we cannot interpret them as\nrapidities of excitations in the spin chain - the wave function would be\njust zero for them. Correspondingly, the periodicity condition ( 1.18 )\nlooses its sense. Instead, each particle with rapidity @xmath is\ninterpreted as a node in the spin chain. Diagonalization of @xmath\nautomatically diagonalize the Hamiltonian due to the following equality:\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (1.35)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nThe nested eigenvectors ( 1.29 ) are proportional to the corresponding\nstates ( 1.14 ) of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz.\n\nThis approach of solving the XXX spin chain is called the algebraic\nBethe Ansatz [ 57 , 58 ] . The matrix @xmath in the algebraic Bethe\nAnsatz approach is called the transfer matrix of a spin chain. This\nexplains why in previous section we used the notion of the \u201dnested\u201d\ntransfer matrix: to distinguish between nested and algebraic Bethe\nAnsatz interpretations.\n\nTogether with the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian the algebraic Bethe\nAnsatz gives us the possibility to construct higher conserved charges.\nThe local conserved charges are the coefficients of the expansion of the\ntransfer matrix around a singular point @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere @xmath is the operator of translation by one node of a spin chain.\n\nExpansion around any other nonsingular point gives us other conserved\ncharges that are not local. Of course the distinction between locality\nand no locality can be made only in the limit of infinite length.\n\n###### Nested Bethe Ansatz for @xmath\n\nThe construction that we used to diagonalize @xmath can be generalized\nto the case with arbitrary @xmath [ 59 ] .\n\nFor example for @xmath any excited state can be built by the procedure\nshown in Fig. 1.4 \u2074 \u2074 4 We conjecture that Fig. 1.4 is equivalent to the\nprocedure in [ 59 ] . Although we did not prove this explicitly, we\nchecked on simple examples that the procedure in Fig. 1.4 generates\neigenstates of the transfer matrix once the rapidities satisfy nested\nBethe Ansatz equations. .\n\nAgain, the nested transfer matrix acts diagonally if and only if the\nrapidities @xmath , @xmath and @xmath satisfy relations which are\nexactly the nested Bethe Ansatz equations. The shortcut to write these\nrelations can be read from the fact that the eigenvalue of the transfer\nmatrix on the nested state is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the requirement that the transfer matrix does not have poles except\nfor @xmath .\n\nThe nested Bethe Ansatz equations can be encoded in the following\ndiagram:\n\nEach node of the diagram corresponds to the one type of nested Bethe\nroots. For each node its left neighbor plays the role of the\ninhomogeneous spin chain. The cross corresponds to the initial\nhomogeneous spin chain (each node of which can be interpreted as a\nparticle with rapidity equal to @xmath ).\n\nActually, the diagram 1.5 without cross is nothing but the Dynkin\ndiagram. The cross corresponds to the fact that we consider particles in\nthe fundamental representation of the @xmath group defined by the Dynkin\nlabels @xmath .\n\nEach physically meaningful solution of the Bethe equations should not\ncontain coinciding rapidities. The solutions with only finite Bethe\nroots and the numbers of Bethe roots that satisfy inequalities ( 1.44 )\ngive the highest weight vectors in the irreducible multiplet of the\n@xmath group. The highest weight states and the states obtained from\nthem by action of the symmetry generators span the whole Hilbert space\nof the system [ 60 ] .\n\nIf to put @xmath , we can interpret Fig. 1.4 as the algebraic Bethe\nAnsatz for the @xmath spin chain. In this case the procedure shown in\nFig. 1.4 gives us also the wave function of the corresponding\neigenstate.\n\nIt is also possible to construct the Bethe Ansatz for arbitrary simple\nLie algebra and arbitrary irreducible representation (irrep). For a Lie\nalgebra of rank @xmath defined by the Cartan matrix @xmath and for the\nirrep given by the Dynkin labels @xmath the Bethe Ansatz equations for a\nhomogeneous spin chain of length @xmath are written as [ 61 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 1.3 Counting of Bethe roots and string hypothesis\n\nFor the simplest case of the @xmath magnet the number of the Bethe roots\ncannot be larger than the half of the length of the spin chain. This\nrestriction can be explained by the representation theory. Each solution\nof the Bethe equations with all Bethe roots being finite corresponds to\na highest weight vector. We cannot construct the highest weight vector\nfor the number of excitations larger than the half of the length.\n\nThe same logic may be applied in principle for the @xmath magnet.\nHowever, it would be nice to see how the constraints on the number of\nthe Bethe roots come directly from the Bethe equations. We will first do\nthis derivation for the @xmath case and then generalize to arbitrary\n@xmath .\n\nIt is useful to introduce the Baxter equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAssuming that @xmath is a polynomial, it is easy to see that the set of\nthe Bethe equations in the @xmath case ( 1.22 ) is equivalent to the\ndemand that the function @xmath defined by ( 1.39 ) is an entire\nfunction (and therefore is a polynomial).\n\nThe zeroes of @xmath are the Bethe roots, therefore @xmath is the Baxter\npolynomial ( 1.28 ). The reader can recognize in @xmath the eigenvalue\nof the transfer matrix rescaled by an overall factor ( cf. ( 1.31 )).\n\nLet us take a solution of the Bethe equations which consists only from\nreal roots and find all zeroes of the l.h.s. of ( 1.39 ). Among these\nzeroes there are Bethe roots (zeroes of @xmath ) and zeroes of @xmath .\nThe real zeroes of @xmath we will call holes. The zeroes of @xmath with\nnonzero imaginary part will be called accompanying roots.\n\nAccompanying roots are situated roughly on the distance @xmath above and\nbelow the Bethe roots. This fact can be understood in the large @xmath\nlimit. Indeed, if we consider the region @xmath for the large @xmath ,\ngenerically the second term in the l.h.s. of ( 1.39 ) is suppressed with\nrespect to the first one. To estimate the magnitude of the suppression\none can approximate\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that suppression is strong at large @xmath if @xmath is\nsufficiently close to origin.\n\nThe first term in the l.h.s. of ( 1.39 ) is suppressed for @xmath .\nTherefore in the large @xmath limit we can write approximately\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (1.41)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that the accompanying roots are given in the first approximation\nby zeroes of @xmath and @xmath . Therefore each Baxter root gives 2\naccompanying zeroes in @xmath . Counting the number of zeroes on both\nsides of the Baxter equation, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the number of Bethe roots and @xmath is the number of\nholes.\n\nThe maximally filled state does not contain holes and we obtain the\nknown restriction on the number of the Bethe roots.\n\nThis analysis is simply generalized to the case of @xmath magnet. In\nthis case we have @xmath types of Bethe roots. Let us denote the number\nof roots of each type by @xmath . For the @xmath -th type of the Bethe\nroots we can write the Baxter equation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.43)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow the @xmath play the same role as @xmath in ( 1.39 ) and we obtain\n@xmath .\n\nThe complete set of inequalities can be written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFrom here it follows that a maximally saturated state (antiferromagnetic\nvacuum), which corresponds to the trivial representation, is constructed\nfrom the following number of Bethe roots:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n###### String hypothesis\n\nThe accompanying roots could not be the roots of @xmath since we had\nrestricted ourselves for the case when all the Bethe roots are real. If\nwe allow the Bethe roots to be complex, then an accompanying root can\nbecome the complex root of @xmath . But in this case this complex root\nof @xmath will have its own accompanying root. In turn, we can allow\nthis second-level accompanying root to enter the Baxter polynomial or\nnot. In such a way we construct a so called string.\n\nThe string of length @xmath , or @xmath -string, is the following set of\nthe Bethe roots:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere, depending on @xmath , @xmath is integer or half-integer. The\n@xmath -string is completely defined by the position of its center\n@xmath .\n\nThe string hypothesis states that in the limit @xmath all the Bethe\nroots are organized in strings. It was shown by counterexamples that the\nstring hypothesis is strictly speaking wrong. Although, as we can see\nfrom ( 1.40 ), stringy configurations dominate for @xmath being close to\nthe origin, for @xmath the configuration resembles string only\nqualitatively. In this regime the imaginary distance between roots\nscales as @xmath and the positions of roots belonging to string\nsignificantly deviate from lying on a straight line. There are also more\nsophisticated examples of solutions which do not satisfy string\nhypothesis even qualitatively \u2075 \u2075 5 For numerical and analytical studies\nrelated to the string hypothesis see [ 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 ] and\nreferences therein. .\n\nAlthough the string hypothesis is wrong, the stringy configurations\ndescribe the low energy excitations in some regimes that we will be\ninterested in. Therefore it is reasonable to study Bethe equations as if\nthe string hypothesis was correct.\n\nWhat is a string from the point of view of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz?\nLet us consider a string of length two which is composed from two\nrapidities @xmath . The wave function for such string is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.47)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nSince @xmath , this wave function describes the propagation of the bound\nstate with momenta @xmath . Therefore strings correspond to the bound\nstates.\n\n###### Interaction of strings\n\nEach nested level of the @xmath Bethe Ansatz has its own string\nsolutions. Let us assume that the string hypothesis is valid and write\ndown Bethe equations explicitly for the center of strings.\n\nThe Bethe equations are constructed from the following building block:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe indices @xmath label the nested level of the Bethe roots (the case\n@xmath is considered below), @xmath enumerate Bethe roots at each level.\n\nLet us introduce the shift operator\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.49)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the following notation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this notation the function @xmath will be written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.51)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo write the Bethe equation for the center of a given string we have to\nmultiply the Bethe equations for each root which constitutes the string.\nFor the string of length @xmath and with the center at @xmath we will\nget the get a factor of the type\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.52)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFrom ( 1.48 ) we conclude that the interaction of the strings of length\n@xmath and @xmath with centers at @xmath and @xmath are written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.53)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe have to understand the denominator of @xmath as such power series\nthat @xmath represents a finite linear combination of shift operators.\nMore precisely:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.54)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe expression ( 1.53 ) describes the interaction of strings from\ndifferent nested levels ( @xmath ). In the case when strings belong to\nthe same nested level, the interaction will look like\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow we are ready to write down the set of Bethe equations for the\ncenters of strings. We introduce the following notations.\n\nFirst, the centers of strings are marked by @xmath , where @xmath labels\nthe nested level (node of the Dynkin diagram), @xmath labels the length\nof the string and @xmath enumerates different strings with the same\n@xmath .\n\nThen we will also need the \u201d @xmath -deformed\u201d Cartan matrix of the\nDynkin diagram:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the adjacency matrix of the Dynkin diagram. For @xmath\nseries which we consider @xmath . For example, for @xmath the deformed\nCartan matrix is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.57)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing these notations, the Bethe equations for centers of strings that\nfollow from ( 1.38 ) can be written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 1.4 Fusion procedure and Hirota equations\n\nThe Bethe Ansatz equations can be also derived by the procedure\ndifferent from the one presented above. This procedure includes\nderivation of the functional (Hirota) equations ( 1.80 ) and then\nsolution of them via the chain of Backlund transforms ( 1.85 ). This\nprocedure is interesting in particular because the functional equations\n( 1.80 ) reflect the symmetry algebra of the system. The analytic\npeculiarities of the system appear then by imposing proper boundary\nconditions when solving ( 1.80 ). In principle, it is possible to choose\ndifferent boundary conditions and therefore obtain different integrable\nsystems based on the same symmetry group.\n\nIn this section we will explain the meaning of the functional equations\n( 1.80 ). In the next section we will show how to solve them. We will\nconsider only the rational case which leads to the Bethe equations of\nthe XXX spin chain.\n\nFirst, let us make a simplification. The @xmath matrix ( 1.9 ) can be\nrepresented as the ratio of the @xmath -matrix\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.59)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the scalar factor @xmath . The @xmath -matrix satisfies the\nYang-Baxter equation. However, the unitarity condition is replaced by\n@xmath .\n\nIn the following we will assign to the scattering of the particles the\n@xmath -matrix ( 1.59 ) instead of the @xmath matrix ( 1.9 ). This is a\nreasonable since the common scalar factors, like @xmath , do not play\nthe role in the problem of the diagonalization of the transfer matrix.\nDue to this we will also define the transfer matrix through the @xmath\n-matrices:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nStarting from now, we will also understand the transfer matrix in the\nsense of its definition for the algebraic Bethe Ansatz procedure.\n\nUntil now we studied only scattering of the particles in the fundamental\nrepresentation. It turns out useful to introduce the particles in\ndifferent representations. We can introduce them by a so called fusion\nprocedure. Let us first understand how the fusion procedure works for\nthe construction of the particles in the symmetric and the antisymmetric\nrepresentations.\n\nWe define the particle in the symmetric\/antisymmetric representation as\na composite of two fundamental particles with\nsymmetrization\/antisymmetrization of the color:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.61)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the projectors @xmath are defined as:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.62)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis definition of the composite particle makes sense only if the\nprojection to the symmetric or antisymmetric representation survives\nunder scattering with other particles:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.63)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis requirement is satisfied if to choose the relative rapidities of\nthe constituent fundamental particles as shown in ( 1.61 ). Indeed, let\nus use the fact that the operator @xmath has the following property:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.64)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen the property ( 1.63 ), for example for the particle in the\nsymmetric representation, is a simple consequence of\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (1.65)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere we used the Yang-Baxter equation and the property that @xmath .\n\nLet us take the particle in the symmetric representation with the color\n@xmath \u2076 \u2076 6 curly brackets means symmetrization and scatter it with the\nparticle in the fundamental representation which carries the color\n@xmath . Direct calculation shows that the scattering process is the\nfollowing:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.66)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe will drop the overall scalar factor @xmath . Then the @xmath -matrix\nof this process is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.67)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath now means a generalized permutation: @xmath .\n\nThe particle in any representation given by the Young table with @xmath\nboxes can be constructed as a composite particle of @xmath fundamental\nparticles with a corresponding symmetrization of color indices. The\nrelative rapidities of the fundamental particles are chosen such that\nthe symmetrization commutes with the scattering process. The scattering\nof composite particles satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation since the\nscattering of the fundamental particles does. The @xmath -matrix can be\ncalculated in the way analogous to the presented above calculation of\n@xmath . For the explicit formulas and more detailed discussion see [ 66\n] .\n\nIn the following we will be interested only in the rectangular\nrepresentations - the representations @xmath given by the rectangular\nYoung tables with @xmath rows and @xmath columns \u2077 \u2077 7 @xmath for\nantisymmetrization, @xmath for symmetrization . For the scattering of\nthe rectangular representation with the fundamental one the R-matrix has\na simple form \u2078 \u2078 8 The @xmath -matrix for the scattering of two\narbitrary representations is in general complicated. It is given as a\npolynomial over the generalized permutation operator with coefficients\nthat depend on @xmath . :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.68)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a generalized permutation operator.\n\nThe generalized permutation operator @xmath acting on the tensor product\nof two arbitrary representations @xmath is defined as follows. The color\nof the particle in the representation @xmath is given by @xmath , where\n@xmath is a number of boxes in the Young table and @xmath is a\nprojector. The operator @xmath is a sum over all possible pairwise\npermutations of the indices @xmath of @xmath with the indices @xmath of\n@xmath . For example, the generalized permutation operator acts on the\ntensor product of symmetric and antisymmetric representations in the\nfollowing way:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.69)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow we are ready to introduce the transfer matrix in a given\nrepresentation. The @xmath -matrix in the representation @xmath is\ndefined as follows:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.70)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere the auxiliary particle is in the representation @xmath . All the\nphysical particles \u2079 \u2079 9 In fact these \u201dphysical particles\u201d are the\nnodes of a spin chain. Each node carries an inhomogeneity @xmath . are\nin the fundamental representation. For the rectangular representations\nwe will additionally use the notation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.71)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing the equation ( 1.2 ), which is valid for two arbitrary\nrepresentations, we can prove that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.72)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore we can diagonalize simultaneously all the transfer matrices.\n\nThe transfer matrices in different rectangular representations are not\nindependent but satisfy the so called fusion or Hirota equations. In the\nsimplest case of the fusion of two transfer matrices in the fundamental\nrepresentation the Hirota equation reads\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.73)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe proof of this relation is most easily done graphically:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.74)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nTo obtain the transfer matrix in the antisymmetric representation in\nderivation ( 1.74 ) we should use the representation ( 1.64 ) for the\nprojector @xmath , Yang-Baxter equation, and cyclicity of the trace.\n\nIf we would scatter the fundamental representation with the trivial one,\nthere would be no interchange of color. Therefore it is natural to\ndefine the corresponding @xmath -matrix as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.75)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen the Baxter polynomial @xmath can be considered as a transfer matrix\nin the trivial representation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.76)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nMoreover, using fusion procedure and ( 1.75 ) we conclude that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.77)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand thus\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.78)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore equation ( 1.73 ) can be rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.79)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis equation is generalizable for arbitrary rectangular\nrepresentations:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.80)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquation ( 1.80 ) is known as the Hirota equation.\n\nThe transfer matrices are defined on the lattice bounded by the\nrectangle @xmath which any meaningful Young diagram should fit. To make\nthe Hirota equations valid for any integer values of @xmath and @xmath\nwe define @xmath on the lines @xmath and @xmath by the relations ( 1.78\n). Outside the rectangle and these two lines @xmath . Therefore, the\nfusion relations ( 1.80 ) are nontrivial on the shape shown in Fig. 1.7\n.\n\nThe Hirota equation simplifies on the boundary of the rectangle. Let us\ntake for example the lower boundary ( @xmath ). The fusion relation on\nit is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.81)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is solved as a product of left and right moving waves. On the other\nhand @xmath . Therefore we have only the left-moving wave.\n\nThe same situation occurs on the left boundary. On the upper boundary we\nalso have the transfer matrix in the trivial representation. However now\nthe corresponding @xmath -matrix is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.82)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe generalized permutation is not zero, as it was on the upper and the\nleft boundaries, but is equal to @xmath . For example: @xmath due to the\nfact that @xmath is proportional to the completely antisymmetric tensor.\n\nDue to ( 1.82 ) we have @xmath . Combining three boundaries together we\nsee that there is only the left-moving wave on the boundary generated at\nthe origin by @xmath .\n\n#### 1.5 Nested Bethe Ansatz via Backlund transform\n\nThe Hirota equation ( 1.80 ) is a discrete integrable system in the\nsense that it can be obtained as a compatibility condition of the system\nof the linear equations [ 40 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (1.83)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthat can be also represented graphically as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.84)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAn interesting fact is that if we consider ( 1.5 ) as the equations on\n@xmath then the consistency condition gives us fusion relations ( 1.80 )\non @xmath ! Therefore @xmath can be thought as the transfer matrix of\nsome integrable system. The transfer matrix @xmath is called the\nBacklund transform of @xmath .\n\nThere are two possible and different solutions to ( 1.5 ) which generate\nrespectively the first-type (BT1) and the second-type (BT2) Backlund\ntransformations. BT2 is relevant for the study of supersymmetric groups\nand is discussed in chapter 4 . Here we discuss BT1.\n\nFor BT1 the strip on which the functions @xmath are nonzero is given by\nthe constraints @xmath , that is the number of rows is diminished by 1.\nThus @xmath can be viewed as the transfer matrices for an @xmath\nintegrable system. From ( 1.5 ) one can see that the boundary of the\nstrip of @xmath carries left-moving wave induced by the left-moving wave\nof @xmath . To obtain a rational integrable system we have to choose the\nvalue of @xmath to be a polynomial.\n\nThe idea of solving the Hirota equations is to perform a sufficient\nnumber of Backlund transforms so that we are eventually left with a\nstrip with only one row. To make the notation systematic we define by\n@xmath the transfer matrices associated with the @xmath group. The\nboundary condition is given by @xmath . For the rational integrable\nsystem @xmath is a polynomial. The zeroes of @xmath are denoted by\n@xmath . Subsequent application of Backlund transformations generates\nthe sequence\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.85)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe linear equation ( 1.84 ) evaluated for the gray rectangle in Fig.\n1.8 has a particular interest for us. This equation gives a relation\nbetween @xmath , @xmath and the Baxter polynomials @xmath , @xmath .\nIndeed, this equation reads as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.86)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the notation @xmath is used.\n\nSince @xmath , the recursive relation ( 1.86 ), known also as a Baxter\nequation, gives us the possibility to express @xmath in terms of Baxter\npolynomials only:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.87)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is enough to solve the Hirota system since all the @xmath can be\nfound from the knowledge of @xmath and @xmath .\n\nIn ( 1.87 ) we recognize up to an overall factor the expression ( 1.37\n). The Bethe equations can be read from ( 1.87 ) as the condition that\n@xmath is a polynomial by construction and therefore does not have\npoles.\n\nThe Hirota equations were obtained as a relation between transfer\nmatrices. They give a set of Bethe equations via the sequence of\nBacklund transformations. The essential point in this derivation of the\nBethe equations is that the boundary conditions for the transfer\nmatrices and the transfer matrices themselves are required to be\npolynomials. It is also possible to impose different requirements on the\nanalytical structure of the transfer matrices. Then @xmath will be\nconsidered as a transfer matrices based on an @xmath -matrix different\nfrom ( 1.59 ). In this way we can obtain for example trigonometric and\nelliptic integrable systems. The transfer-matrices of the Hirota system\nthat was proposed for the AdS\/CFT [ 44 ] contain square root branch\npoints.\n\n### Chapter 2 Two-dimensional integrable field theories\n\n#### 2.1 Two-dimensional sigma-models\n\nThe integrable 1+1 dimensional quantum field theories (IQFT) give us\nanother example of the systems that can be solved by the Bethe Ansatz\ntechniques. A remarkable development in this direction started in the\nlate 70\u2019s with the realization of the fact that the scattering matrix in\nthese theories can be found exactly [ 7 ] .\n\nIn this and the next chapter we will consider the following two examples\nof the integrable models: @xmath chiral Gross-Neveu model (GN) and\n@xmath principal chiral field model (PCF). Our choice is dictated by the\nsimplicity of these models. In chapter 9 we also study the @xmath vector\nmodel. The actions for these three models are given by:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath               \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.1)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nAll three theories can be treated on a similar footing. They are\ndetermined by the coupling constant @xmath and the parameter @xmath -\nsize of the matrix of a symmetry group. These theories are\nasymptotically free. Therefore, at large energy scales they can be\nstudied perturbatively.\n\nThe infrared catastrophe makes the perturbative description\ninappropriate at low energies. It is believed that the spectrum of these\ntheories develops a mass gap. The mass scale comes through the mechanism\nof the dimensional transmutation and is given through the beta-function\n@xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe chiral Gross-Neveu model \u00b9 \u00b9 1 It is also known as a two-dimensional\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model or a massless Thirring model. is a model with a\nfour-fermion interaction and continuous chiral symmetry @xmath . It was\ndiscussed in [ 67 ] together with the other fermion field theories with\nquartic interaction. In particular it was shown in the large @xmath\nlimit that the operator @xmath acquires on the quantum level a nonzero\naverage proportional to @xmath . In the large @xmath limit it is\npossible to identify the particle content of the model and calculate the\nmasses of the particles. The theory contains one massless particle which\nis invariant under the @xmath group but transforms under the action of\nthe @xmath chiral symmetry. There are also massive particles which are\nblind to the chiral symmetry and do not interact with the massless\nparticle. There are @xmath different types of massive particles. The\n@xmath -th type transforms under an antisymmetric representation @xmath\nof the @xmath group. Since the massless particle is completely decoupled\nfrom the massive ones, we will not consider it in the following.\n\nThe PCF for finite values of @xmath was solved by Polyakov and Wiegmann\n[ 68 , 69 ] . In [ 70 ] the large @xmath solution of this model using\ndifferent means was given. There are also @xmath different types of\nmassive particles. The @xmath -th type transforms under the @xmath\nrepresentation of the @xmath symmetry group of the system.\n\nThe @xmath vector sigma model was solved at large @xmath [ 71 , 72 ] .\nThis solution shows the presence of the only one particle multiplet in\nthe vector representation of the @xmath group.\n\n#### 2.2 Scattering matrix\n\nAs we see, the sigma models can be exactly solved at large values of\n@xmath . The theories can be also exactly solved at finite values of\n@xmath if to assume theirs integrability and make an assumption about\nthe particle content of the theory \u00b2 \u00b2 2 Using integrability, the masses\nof the particles could be exactly found at finite @xmath [ 73 ] as we\ndiscuss in chapter 9 . . More precisely, we can exactly find the\nscattering matrix [ 7 ] . The arguments go as follows.\n\nFirst, the infinite number of the conserved charges implies conservation\nof the number of particles. The reason for this is that the @xmath -th\nconserved charge @xmath acting on a free particle with momenta @xmath\ngives roughly speaking @xmath . So @xmath is the total momentum of the\nsystem and @xmath is the total energy of the system. Therefore we have\nan infinite set of conservation laws\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nthat can be satisfied only if the number of particles is conserved and\nthe momenta interchange.\n\nSecond, the scattering process factorizes into @xmath processes. The\nargument of why it happens is the following \u00b3 \u00b3 3 For a rigorous\ntreatment see [ 74 ] . The particle is described by a wave packet\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAction of @xmath and @xmath generates the translation in space and time\nrespectively (as it should). Let us consider the action of @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nExpanding the term @xmath around a saddle point value @xmath we see that\nthe action of @xmath shifts the wave packet by the value that depends on\nthe momentum @xmath of the particle. Therefore the action of @xmath on a\nsystem of particles will shift each particle by a different distance.\nSo, using this operator we can always represent any scattering as a\ncombination of @xmath scattered processes. Therefore we should know only\n@xmath scattering matrix to define the system.\n\nThe same reasoning with application of @xmath leads to the Yang-Baxter\nequation ( 1.12 ) which is depicted in Fig. 1.1 .\n\nTo impose further constraints on the structure of the @xmath -matrix we\nwill use the fact that we are dealing with the relativistic quantum\nfield theory \u2074 \u2074 4 The pedagogical discussion of the analytical\nstructure of the scattering matrix can be found for example in [ 75 ] .\n. The two to two scattering process is defined by the @xmath -point\nfunction shown in Fig. 2.1 . For simplicity we consider the scattering\nof particles with equal masses. Since in two dimensions the momenta are\nonly interchanged after scattering, the scattering matrix depends on\nonly the one invariant. For this invariant we can take\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nor the difference of rapidities @xmath which is related to @xmath\nthrough:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.6)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nThe invariant of the @xmath -channel is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe amplitude of the reverse process can be obtained simply by replacing\n@xmath with @xmath . Therefore the unitarity condition reads\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nWe can pass from @xmath process to @xmath process (overline means\nantiparticles and charge conjugation) by simple change of the sign of\n@xmath . This leads to the crossing equations\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe @xmath -matrix as a function of the @xmath variable has square root\nbranch points at @xmath and @xmath which correspond to two-particle and\nparticle-antiparticle thresholds. The on-shell two-particle scattering\nis given by @xmath for @xmath , the on-shell particle-antiparticle\nscattering is given by @xmath for @xmath . The square root cuts are\nresolved after introduction of the rapidity variable @xmath via ( 2.2 ).\n\nThe @xmath -matrix is a meromorphic function of @xmath . The physical\n@xmath -sheet is mapped into the strip @xmath . The poles on the\nimaginary axes of @xmath -plane and inside this strip correspond to the\nphysical particles in the theory. These particles can be thought as\nbound states of the scattered particles. We can understand this\ncorrespondence from tree level diagrams:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing the trick with @xmath one can calculate the scattering which\nincludes these bound particles in the following way:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe invariance under the symmetry of the system, the Yang-Baxter\nequation ( 1.12 ), the unitarity ( 2.8 ) and crossing ( 2.9 )\nconditions, and the assumption on the pole structure inside the physical\nstrip @xmath uniquely fix the two-particle scattering matrix and\ntherefore completely determine the system.\n\nThe Yang-Baxter equation and invariance under the symmetry fixes the\n@xmath -matrix up to an overall scalar factor. The scattering matrix\ndiscussed in the first chapter also satisfies these two conditions.\nTherefore the algebraic structure of the @xmath -matrices in two cases\nis the same and we can apply the Bethe Ansatz techniques developed in\nthe first chapter.\n\nThe unitarity, crossing, and the pole structure are the physical\nconstraints on the @xmath -matrix. The assumption on the pole structure\nis a consequence of an assumption on the particle content of the theory.\nThis assumption is hard to be proven exactly. It is usually confirmed by\nthe exact large @xmath solution. Another possibility to verify this\nassumption is to study the renorm-group behavior and Borel summability\nproperties of the system which we will discuss in chapter 9 .\n\nThe knowledge of the @xmath -matrix allows solving the theory at large\nvolume with the help of the Bethe Ansatz as we will discuss now on the\nexample of the PCF and GN models.\n\n#### 2.3 PCF and Gross-Neveu model\n\nThe particle content of GN model includes in particular particles in the\nfundamental representation. The PCF model contains in particular\nparticles in the fundamental @xmath fundamental representation. We\nchoose the following normalization of the rapidities of these particles\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this normalization the Bethe equations will resemble most the Bethe\nequations ( 1.22 ) of the XXX spin chain.\n\nThe scattering matrix of the fundamental particles was determined to\nhave the following form [ 68 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.13)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.14)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThere is a relation between @xmath and @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.15)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe scalar factors can be also rewritten in terms of the shift\noperators. For this let us use the following definition (see also\ndefinition ( 1.50 )):\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand similar expressions for other gamma functions. Naively, the l.h.s.\nof ( 2.16 ) should be understood as product of poles\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nOf course, this product should be regularized. We will always use\nregularization which leads to the gamma function. For more details see\nappendix A .\n\nUsing the representation ( 2.16 ) for the gamma functions one can write:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.18)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe first equalities for the expressions of @xmath and @xmath are exact\nin view of the definition ( 2.16 ). It is worth to recall that the\nasymptotic behavior of these scalar factors is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.19)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThis asymptotic behavior is not evident from the representation ( 2.3 )\nbut can be found if to use ( 2.16 ).\n\nThe second equalities in ( 2.3 ) have no precise meaning and are given\nfor heuristic reasons. In particular, the second equalities formally\nsuggest that @xmath . This is not true of course, however this\nsuggestion means that @xmath and @xmath differ only by a CDD factor. The\nCDD factor, which is in our case @xmath , is a factor multiplication by\nwhich leaves a scattering matrix obeying the crossing equations. It is\npossible to fix this factor by the requirement of a precise structure of\npoles in the physical strip.\n\n###### Bound states\n\nThe physical strip is given by @xmath . The fundamental particles can\nform bound states if the @xmath -matrix has poles inside this strip.\n\nThe @xmath -matrices ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.3 ) have a pole at @xmath in the\npurely antisymmetric channel. This means that bound states are particles\nin the antisymmetric representations: @xmath for GN and @xmath for PCF.\nThe mass of the obtained particle is easily calculated from the\nconservation law:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis bound state (fused particle) can be represented by two particles\nwith rapidity difference equal to @xmath . Due to the existence of the\nhigher conserved charges any scattering with such bound state is\nequivalent to successive scattering with its constituents. One can build\ntherefore the correspondent @xmath -matrix. The procedure is almost the\nsame as for the fusion procedure discussed in Sec. 1.4 . The only\ndifference is that the fused @xmath -matrix should satisfy physical\nrequirements of unitarity and crossing and therefore has a different\nfrom the fused @xmath -matrix overall scalar factor.\n\nIt is instructive to compare the bound state with the strings in the XXX\nspin chain. The string configurations in the XXX spin chain can be also\nconsidered as bound states, which however reflect the analytical\nstructure of the @xmath -matrix ( 1.59 ). Since for the XXX spin chain\n@xmath , Im @xmath has opposite sign with Im @xmath . Therefore strings\ncorrespond to zeroes of @xmath for @xmath . These zeroes appear in the\nsymmetric channel of scattering.\n\nSince strings in the XXX spin chain are bound states in the symmetric\nchannel we can form them at any nested level of the Bethe Ansatz. In the\ncase of the @xmath GN and PCF, the bound states appear in the\nantisymmetric channel. Thus these bound states should correspond to\ncollection of Bethe roots on different levels of the nested Bethe\nAnsatz. This collection of roots will be constructed in the next\nsubsection.\n\nOne can perform scattering of the bound state with a fundamental\nparticle. The scattering matrix of this process again has a pole inside\nthe physical strip. The easy way to see this is to notice that this pole\nshould be due to a pole of the scattering with one of the two\nconstituents of the bound state. The constituents of the bound state\nhave rapidities @xmath . Therefore the pole occurs at @xmath .\n\nContinuing in a similar way we find that the considered sigma models\ncontain particles in the representations @xmath ( @xmath ) for @xmath .\nThe masses of the particles come from the conservation law:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n###### Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz for GN.\n\nOnce the @xmath -matrix of the system is known, one can build the wave\nfunction for each state in the same way as it was done for the XXX spin\nchain. If we consider the theory on a circle, the periodicity of the\nwave function leads to a nested Bethe Ansatz. Its construction is\ncompletely parallel to that of the XXX spin chain. The answer for the\nGross-Neveu model is the following. There are momentum carrying roots\n@xmath and @xmath types of nested roots @xmath , where @xmath denotes\nthe nested level. The Bethe Ansatz equations read\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.23)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the usual Cartan matrix of the Dynkin diagram for the\n@xmath Lie algebra.\n\nSometimes this set of Bethe Ansatz equations is depicted by a kind of\nDynkin diagram shown in Fig. 2.3 .\n\nAn important difference with the XXX spin chain is that the Bethe Ansatz\n( 2.3 ) is asymptotic. It is valid only when the volume @xmath of the\nsystem is large. Otherwise the notion of scattering and free particles\nwould be impossible. The exact expression for the energy of the system\nin the finite volume is different from the answer given by the\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz (ABA) by the correction of order @xmath .\n\nAlthough the Bethe Ansatz above is formally for the particles in the\nfundamental representation, it contains all the other particles as well.\nThey appear as special string-type configurations.\n\nTo recover the configurations which correspond to the bound states we\nfirst note that from the fusion procedure we know that the @xmath\n-particle should contain @xmath rapidities @xmath which form a @xmath\n-string. Let us take a rapidity @xmath which belongs to this string and\nwhich has a positive imaginary part . For @xmath we see that @xmath .\nSince @xmath has no poles in the physical strip, we need to have a\nnested root @xmath . Equivalently, for each rapidity @xmath with\nnegative imaginary part we have @xmath . Therefore the existence of the\n@xmath -string of @xmath -s requires presence of the @xmath -string of\n@xmath -s with the same center.\n\nFollowing a similar logic one can show that @xmath -string of @xmath -s\nand @xmath -string of @xmath -s imply the @xmath -string of @xmath -s.\nThe iteration procedure is performed until we reach the string of the\nlength @xmath . Therefore the bound particles in GN are described by\nstacks shown in Fig. 2.4 .\n\nIf we denote by @xmath the center of the stack that contains @xmath\n@xmath roots ( @xmath -stack) (it is associated with the @xmath bound\nstate) then the Bethe Ansatz equations for the centers of stacks will\nhave the following form:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.24)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.25)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nRemarkably, each bound state interacts with only one level of nested\nBethe roots. And this interaction is the same as the interaction between\ndifferent nested levels (see also Fig. 3.1 ).\n\n###### Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz for PCF.\n\nThe asymptotic Bethe Ansatz for PCF contains two wings of nested levels.\nWe will denote the nested Bethe roots by @xmath and @xmath , where\n@xmath and @xmath stand for right and left wings.\n\nThe Bethe equations are the following:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.26)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe identification of the bound states is similar to the case of GN\nmodel. The only modification is that since @xmath , a @xmath -string of\n@xmath -s induces @xmath -strings on both left and right wings. As a\nresult we have the structure of stacks shown in Fig. 2.6 .\n\nIf we denote by @xmath the center of the stack that contains @xmath\n@xmath roots then the Bethe Ansatz equations will have the following\nform:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n                       @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.27)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.28)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\n### Chapter 3 IQFT as a continuous limit of integrable spin chains\n\nAn important problem to study is what field theories can be obtained in\nthe continuous limit of integrable spin chains. Assuming that\nintegrability and symmetry of the system is preserved in the continuous\nlimit we may expect to recover from the @xmath symmetric spin chains the\n@xmath GN model, just based on the argument of the universality of low\nenergy effective theories.\n\nIn this chapter we study excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum\nof the @xmath XXX spin chain \u00b9 \u00b9 1 This study for the @xmath case was\nfirst time correctly done by Faddeev and Takhtajan [ 76 , 77 , 78 ] .\nThese authors also found the scattering matrix of the excitations using\nthe method of [ 79 ] . The general case was studied in [ 80 ] . . This\nvacuum is interesting since it is invariant under the @xmath group. The\nscattering of the excitations, which are also called spinons, depends on\nthe representation in which the spin chain was defined. For the\nfundamental representation the scattering of low energetic spinons in\nthe infinite volume is described by the same scattering matrix as the\none for the @xmath GN model. In the limit of the infinite spin\nrepresentation the low energy scattering matrix is identical with the\none of the PCF model [ 68 , 81 ] . Interestingly, the PCF model has a\nlarger @xmath symmetry.\n\nA nontrivial scalar factor in the scattering matrix, such as @xmath in (\n2.3 ), is recovered from the algebraic Bethe Ansatz equations as an\neffective interaction of spinons. From the point of view of the Bethe\nAnsatz, spinons are not elementary particles but are holes in a Dirac\nsea of magnons - excitations over ferromagnetic vacuum. Curiously, the\nscattering matrix of spinons obtained in this purely algebraic way is\ncrossing-invariant, although the XXX spin chain does not have such\ndiscrete symmetry.\n\nIn opposite to the GN and PCF models, the spinon spectrum is gapless. To\nobtain massive particles we may consider an inhomogeneous spin chain\nwhich is also known as a light cone spin chain \u00b2 \u00b2 2 Such spin chain was\nproposed in [ 81 ] . The Bethe equations for it were used before in [ 68\n] were the PCF model was solved in terms of a certain fermionic model. .\n\nThe described above scattering picture is applicable when we consider\nsigma models in the infinite volume. In sections 3.4 and 3.5 we discuss\napplicability of the spin chain discretization for the finite volume\ncase. We recall a thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) [ 82 , 83 ] and\nsuggest that the @xmath -functions which appear in the context of TBA\nshould be identified with the transfer matrices of the light cone spin\nchain. We show that this is indeed the case on the simplest example of\nequally polarized spinons of the @xmath GN model.\n\n#### 3.1 Excitations in the antiferromagnetic @xmath XXX spin chain\n\nWe will first consider in details the @xmath case, which will be our\nguiding example for a more complicated cases of @xmath models. The Bethe\nequations for the @xmath XXX spin chain,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwere derived from the scattering theory of the excitations over the\nferromagnetic vacuum. An interesting physics arise if to consider the\nHamiltonian with opposite sign and therefore excitations over the\nantiferromagnetic vacuum. An important property of the antiferromagnetic\nvacuum is that it is a trivial representation of the symmetry group \u00b3 \u00b3\n3 for the spin chain of even length which we will consider in the\nfollowing. For the antiferromagnetic spin chain of the odd length the\nlowest energy state is doubly degenerated. .\n\nWe have at our disposal excitations over the ferromagnetic vacuum\n(magnons). The question is to build an effective theory in which the\nvacuum is a Dirac sea of magnons. For general length of the spin chain\nthis problem was not solved. However, in the thermodynamic limit @xmath\nthe Bethe equations are considerably simplified and the problem can be\nsolved. The usual way to solve it is to introduce the integral equation\nfor the density of Bethe roots, as it is done for example in [ 51 ] . We\nwill use a slightly different description, in which we deal with the\nresolvents and functional equations on them. The advantage is that all\nthe integral kernels which appear are replaced with the rational\nfunctions of the shift operator \u2074 \u2074 4 Fourier transform also leads to\nthese rational functions. The functional approach has an advantage of\nkeeping explicitly the analytical structure of the resolvents and\ntherefore of the density functions. This is especially useful for the\nproblems discussed in the third part of this work. .\n\n###### Holomorphic projection\n\nTo derive the functional equations for the resolvents let us start from\na simple configuration which contains only real Bethe roots. The main\nassumption which goes through all derivations is that in the large\n@xmath limit one or other terms in the l.h.s. of the Baxter equation (\n1.39 )\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\ncan be neglected, depending on whether we are in the upper or in the\nlower half plane of the rapidity variable. As we discussed in section\n1.3 , in this approximation the transfer-matrix is represented as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath stands for the Baxter polynomial of holes\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTherefore the Baxter equation reduces to\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIf we introduce the resolvents\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand take derivative of the logarithm of ( 3.5 ), we will get\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (3.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath .\n\nAt first glance this derivation seems to be not rigorous. However, the\nequations ( 3.1 ) are equivalent to the linear integral equation which\nis derived in the canonical approach (used for example in the lectures [\n51 ] ). Indeed, taking the difference of the functional equations ( 3.1\n) on the real axis we get\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nUsing the fact that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nit is easy to see that ( 3.8 ) is equivalent to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is the integral Bethe Ansatz equation for the XXX spin chain.\n\nTo go back from ( 3.10 ) to ( 3.1 ) we integrate ( 3.10 ) with a Cauchy\nkernel. We call this operation the holomorphic projection. The word\nholomorphic stands for passing from the density which is the function\ndefined only on the real axis to the resolvent which is an analytical\nfunction everywhere in the complex plane except on the support of the\ndensity. The word projection stands for the fact that the expression (\n3.8 ) can be split into two equations ( 3.1 ) defined on the upper and\nthe lower half planes.\n\n###### Bethe equations for holes\n\nThe true excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum are holes. The\nequations ( 3.1 ) can be rewritten as \u2075 \u2075 5 We omit the equation in the\nl.h.p. since it is just conjugated to the one in the u.h.p.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nRemarkably, such an equation can be obtained in the large @xmath limit\nfrom the following Bethe Ansatz:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is defined through\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n@xmath is nothing but the @xmath -matrix of the @xmath GN model for\nscattering of equally polarized particles. The rapidities @xmath\ndescribe holes from the point of view of the ferromagnetic spin chain.\nIn this derivation we did not require that the number of holes should be\ninfinite. So the equation ( 3.11 ) can describe few excitations over the\nantiferromagnetic vacuum as well.\n\nWhat is missing for matching ( 3.12 ) with the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz\nof the GN model is the nested level of the Bethe equations and the\ncorrect expression for @xmath .\n\nWe will recover the correct nested structure if we will take into\naccount also all string configurations in the XXX spin chain. The\nfunctional equation that describes the thermodynamic limit of the\ncomplete set of Bethe equations ( 1.58 ) is the following:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe second term on the l.h.s. comes from the operator @xmath . We can\nsplit this operator in the following way:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEach of two terms in the r.h.s. of ( 3.15 ) is a sum of finite number of\nshift operators. The first term contains only shifts in the positive\nimaginary direction. Only this term survives under the holomorphic\nprojection in the upper half plane.\n\nA remarkable property of the operator @xmath is that it is an element of\nthe inverse deformed Cartan matrix ( 1.56 ) of the @xmath algebra \u2076 \u2076 6\nWe are grateful to Paul Zinn-Justin for pointing out this fact. We would\nlike also to refer to his PhD thesis [ 55 ] where many ideas of this\nchapter are also discussed. . Therefore the equation ( 3.14 ) can be\nalso rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the last formula we used the operator @xmath to put the expression\ninto a more symmetric form. To avoid ambiguities of how the action of\nthis shift operator is defined, we should consider ( 3.16 ) in the\nregion @xmath , not @xmath . Then this equation can be analytically\ncontinued.\n\nTo make the particle-hole transformation \u2077 \u2077 7 Passing to functional\nequations that allow to interpret holes as the roots of a certain Bethe\nAnsatz equation. more explicit we introduce\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe equations ( 3.16 ) for @xmath can be written also as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is easy to see that it leads to the Bethe equation of the @xmath GN\nfor the momentum-carrying particle (but with different @xmath ).\n\nThe equations ( 3.16 ) for @xmath are written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese equations have the same form as ( 3.16 ) except for the replacing\nthe source term @xmath by @xmath . The same equations can be obtained\nfrom the nested level of the Bethe Ansatz for @xmath GN. Interestingly,\nthe centers of the strings of the length two play the role of the real\nroots of the nested Bethe equations.\n\n###### A model with the gap in the spectrum\n\nStill, the obtained equations do not have correct expression for the\nmomentum. In fact, the energy of a hole is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe spectrum of the theory does not contain a gap, therefore we can\nobtain only a massless field theory.\n\nTo cure the situation we follow the approach of Faddeev and Reshetikhin\n[ 81 ] who suggested to consider the XXX spin chain with alternating\ninhomogeneities @xmath such that the Bethe Ansatz is written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe same equations appeared in the solution of PCF by Polyakov and\nWiegmann [ 68 ] before [ 81 ] . However the equations ( 3.21 ) had a\ndifferent meaning; they described a fermionic model with a four-fermion\ninteraction. The reason of equivalence is that the first-quantized\nversion of the fermionic model are the particles interacting through the\n@xmath -potential. Such system is solved by the same Bethe Ansatz\nequations as the ones for the XXX spin chain. In fact, exactly the\nPolyakov-Wiegmann approach was used in [ 80 ] for the solution of the\nPCF model for an arbitrary simple group. Translation of this result to\nthe Faddeev-Reshetikhin picture is straightforward and for the @xmath\ncase is given in the next sections.\n\nLet us introduce the spacing @xmath between the nodes of the spin chain.\nThe energy for the excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum can be\nwritten as:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.22)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThere are low energy excitations for small values of @xmath . In the\nlimit @xmath we obtain for them:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo obtain a finite value for the mass @xmath we have to consider a\nproper limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (3.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this limit we recover exactly the integral equations which follow\nfrom the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz of @xmath GN.\n\nNow we will generalize the obtained results to the case of @xmath group\nand then to the case of PCF.\n\n#### 3.2 Generalization to the case of @xmath Gn.\n\nThe generalization is straightforward. Let us label the resolvent for\nstrings in the position @xmath as @xmath . The label @xmath corresponds\nto the nested level of the Bethe root. The label @xmath labels the\nlength of the string. The general Bethe equations are written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.25)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the resolvent for the source term. It equals to @xmath\nin the homogeneous case and to @xmath in the case of the light-cone spin\nchain.\n\nRemarkably, the equation ( 3.25 ) within the usage of the deformed\nCartan matrix ( 1.56 ) can be rewritten as:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe use two different Cartan matrices. One is of @xmath Dynkin diagram,\nanother one is of @xmath Dynkin diagram. We reflect these distinctions\nin the superscripted indexes of @xmath .\n\nThis form of the functional equation is usually described in terms of\nthe Dynkin-type graph in Fig. 3.1 with @xmath graph in the horizontal\ndirection and with @xmath in the vertical direction.\n\nTo obtain the @xmath GN model we perform a particle-hole transformation\non the roots of type @xmath . For this we introduce the resolvents\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe equations ( 3.26 ) for @xmath describe the nested levels of the\n@xmath GN. As in the @xmath case, the roots @xmath play the role of the\nsource terms.\n\nThe equations ( 3.26 ) for @xmath lead to the following equations:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that interaction between the states is determined by the inverse\nCartan matrix. It is straightforward to check that we get a correct\nexpression for @xmath given in ( 2.25 ).\n\nThe inverse deformed Cartan matrix can be written explicitly as \u2078 \u2078 8\nThe generalization of this expression for the distinguished Dynkin\ndiagram of @xmath algebra was given in [ 84 ] .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we used the notations @xmath for @xmath -numbers. This inverse\nCartan matrix should be understood as a series over positive powers of\n@xmath for the equations written in the u.h.p. and as a series over\nnegative powers for the equations in the l.h.p.\n\nThe momenta @xmath of a @xmath -particle of the GN model should enter\ninto the integral equation for @xmath (density associated with @xmath )\nas @xmath . We can calculate this expression from the explicit form of\nthe inverse Cartan matrix:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nExplicit calculation with the help of inverse Laplace transform gives\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing the parity properties of @xmath we obtain in the limit analogous\nto ( 3.1 )\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (3.32)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhich leads to the following effective mass parameter:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that masses of the particles obtained from a light-cone spin\nchain are the same as it should be in the @xmath GN model (see ( 2.22\n)).\n\n#### 3.3 Generalization to the case of @xmath Pcf.\n\nIf we consider the XXX spin chain in the fundamental representation of\nthe @xmath group, the dynamics of low energy excitations over the\nantiferromagnetic vacuum is described by the GN model. To obtain in\ncontinuous limit the PCF model we have to consider the spin chain in a\ndifferent representation [ 81 ] . The general Bethe Ansatz for arbitrary\nrepresentation of @xmath group is given by ( 1.38 ). The version of the\nBethe Ansatz which includes a string hypothesis is given by the equation\n( 1.58 ). Remarkably, the Bethe Ansatz which corresponds to a\nrectangular representation with Young table given by @xmath rows and\n@xmath columns leads to a simple functional equation on the resolvents:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo obtain a PCF we have to consider the case @xmath and @xmath . The\nantiferromagnetic vacuum corresponds to the maximal filling of strings\nof type @xmath , @xmath .\n\nAs usual, we perform a particle-hole transformation for the nodes @xmath\n:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince the resolvent decreases at infinity one can approximate in the\nlarge @xmath limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing this approximation, we can write for the central nodes \u2079 \u2079 9 the\nnodes that a subject of a particle-hole transformation. :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese are functional Bethe Ansatz equations that can be also derived\nfrom the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz of @xmath PCF. To obtain the massive\ntheory we use the limit ( 3.1 ) which is the same as in the case of the\nGN model.\n\nThe nested Bethe equations come from the nodes that are on the left and\non the right from the central nodes. We see that in the limit @xmath\ntwo, left and right, @xmath symmetries appear.\n\n#### 3.4 Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz\n\nIn the previous sections we saw that the functional Bethe equations for\nthe excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum coincide with the\nequations that can be obtained from the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz for the\nsigma-models. It is therefore natural to ask the question whether\nlight-cone spin chains provide a correct lattice regularization of the\nsigma model. If it is the case we will be able to describe sigma-models\nin a finite volume. A possible way to describe a system in a finite\nvolume known as a thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) [ 82 , 83 ] . Our\ngoal would be to compare the description given by TBA with the\ndescription which is suggested by the spin chain discretization. In this\nsection the TBA approach is reviewed. In the next section we argue that\nthe spin chain leads to the same results and support this suggestion by\nthe simplest example.\n\n###### TBA for calculation of the ground state energy.\n\nLet us consider the theory on the torus with periods @xmath and @xmath .\nThe sigma-model in the finite volume @xmath is recovered in the large\n@xmath limit. The basic idea of the TBA is to write the partition\nfunction in two different ways:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere @xmath ( @xmath ) is the Hamiltonian that generates translation in\nthe @xmath ( @xmath ) direction. Since the theory is relativistically\ninvariant these Hamiltonians are the same. The energy of the ground\nstate of the sigma-model at finite @xmath can be found as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe can calculate partition function since the energy spectrum at large\n@xmath is described by the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. In the large @xmath\nlimit a saddle point approximation is used. Then @xmath is given by a\nfree energy that can be found by the minimization of\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the entropy of the macroscopic state with given energy.\n\nWe use an assumption that in the thermodynamic limit the Bethe roots\norganize themselves into strings. Then the macroscopic state in the\nthermodynamic limit is described by densities of the strings. We already\nknow that the functional equations that describe sigma model can be\nwritten in a much simpler form if we interchange the role of particles\nand holes for the momentum carrying roots. Therefore let us denote by\n@xmath ( @xmath ) the densities of strings (corresponding holes) of type\n@xmath in the case when they are not momentum carrying. The momentum\ncarrying strings will be denoted in inverse way - @xmath will stand for\ndensities of holes and @xmath for densities of particles.\n\nThe densities satisfy the equation \u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u2070 10 In the literature the\nnotation @xmath instead of @xmath is often used. Our choice of notation\nis motivated by the fact that @xmath is given by the inverse Cartan\nmatrix (up to multiplication by @xmath or @xmath ). The kernel @xmath\ndoes not have such clear algebraic interpretation.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a source term. For GN or PCF @xmath and @xmath .\n\nThe free energy @xmath is given by the following equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the first term is @xmath of ( 3.40 ) and the second one is the\nentropy of the system.\n\nMinimization of the free energy leads to the TBA equations:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.43)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe ground state energy given by ( 3.39 ) then can be evaluated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the case of the GN and PCF models one can further simplify the\nexpressions. First, the kernels @xmath can be most generally represented\nas\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere coefficients @xmath are symmetric with respect to interchange of\n@xmath and @xmath . We conclude therefore that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us introduce the functions @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen the TBA equations for @xmath will be written as \u00b9\u00b9 \u00b9\u00b9 11 The sum\nover @xmath is from @xmath to @xmath for GN and from @xmath to @xmath\nfor PCF. We always assign @xmath to the momentum-carrying nodes.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere @xmath denotes the integral kernel whose holomorphic projection is\nthe deformed Cartan matrix @xmath . Let us evaluate this kernel. If the\nfunction @xmath of integration is analytic in the strip @xmath , then\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.49)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the resolvent of @xmath and @xmath means analytical\ncontinuation of @xmath to the point @xmath from the upper half plane. We\nsee that for the functions analytic in the strip @xmath , @xmath\ncoincides with @xmath .\n\nLet us therefore act with @xmath on the equation ( 3.48 ). It is\nstraightforward to check that @xmath is a zero mode of this action.\nTherefore we will get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nor more explicitly\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.51)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe have obtained the functional @xmath -system. The algebraic structure\nof ( 3.50 ) is determined by the equations ( 3.26 ). Therefore the\nstructure of @xmath -system reflects the strings hypothesis and the\ninteraction between strings.\n\n###### TBA in the case of excited states.\n\nThe set of equations ( 3.51 ) requires appropriate boundary conditions\nto have a unique solution. Boundary conditions which follow from ( 3.43\n) lead to the solution which gives the energy of the ground state. The\nresults of [ 85 , 86 ] suggest that changing of the boundary conditions\nallows describing a certain class of excited states. The energy of such\nexcited states is given by generalization of ( 3.44 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.52)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath are solutions of\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.53)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is often believed that all the excited states of the sigma model can\nbe described as certain solutions of the @xmath -system. The energies of\nthese states are given by ( 3.52 ). As was shown in [ 87 ] for a wide\nclass of excited states of the @xmath sigma model, equations ( 3.53 )\nreduce in the large volume limit to the Bethe Ansatz equations.\nTherefore ( 3.53 ) are thought as exact Bethe Ansatz equations for the\nsystems in finite volume.\n\nThe conjecture about applicability of the @xmath -system for the\ndescription of the excited states is supported by the spin chain point\nof view on the problem as we will now discuss.\n\n#### 3.5 Transfer matrices of spin chain as @xmath-functions of TBA.\n\nThe functional @xmath -system ( 3.51 ) can be rewritten as the Hirota\nsystem ( 1.80 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.54)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nif we introduce the @xmath -functions by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nRelation ( 3.55 ) defines the functions @xmath modulo the gauge\ntransformation\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (3.56)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nThe Hirota system ( 3.54 ) is also invariant under ( 3.56 ), therefore\nthere is an equivalence between @xmath -system and Hirota system modulo\ngauge transformations.\n\nA priori @xmath -functions defined by ( 3.55 ) do not have meaning of\ntransfer matrices. However ( 3.54 ) has the same form as the fusion\nrelations for the transfer matrices of the spin chain. Based on this\nobservation we suggest that @xmath functions obtained from ( 3.55 )\ncoincide with transfer matrices of the spin chain discretization of the\nsigma model.\n\nHere we will show this equivalence on the simplest case - @xmath GN\nmodel with the excitations polarized in the same direction. A more\ngeneral case would be the subject of our future work.\n\nSince all particles are equally polarized, the spin chain is described\nby the equations ( 3.21 ). In Fig. 3.3 we show a typical solution of\nthis equation. The red dots represent the zeroes of the Baxter\npolynomial and the blue dots represent the zeroes of @xmath . The\ncomplex zeroes of @xmath are accompanying \u00b9\u00b2 \u00b9\u00b2 12 This term was\nintroduced in Sec. 4.5 . roots and do not have physical meaning. The\nreal zeroes of @xmath are holes. They play the role of physical\nexcitations. Their energy is proportional to @xmath and is also plotted\nin Fig. 3.3 (as a potential with a well).\n\nIn the Faddeev-Reshetikhin limit ( 3.1 ) the holes inside the well in\nFig. 3.3 describe the massive excitations of the GN model. The holes\noutside the well should describe the massless field theory. However in\nthe limit ( 3.1 ) massless excitations do not interact with the massive\nmodes as we will see below.\n\nLet us use ( 3.55 ) to define @xmath functions based on the transfer\nmatrices of the spin chain. These @xmath functions will be denoted as\n@xmath to distinguish them from the @xmath -functions of TBA. From (\n3.55 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.57)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath .\n\nThe function @xmath satisfies the equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince @xmath are the rapidities of spinon excitations which are true\nparticles in the antiferromagnetic case, we should identify ( 3.58 )\nwith ( 3.53 ) and therefore we expect that @xmath . From this\nidentification it also follows that all excited states should satisfy (\n3.58 ) which cannot be shown from the TBA point of view.\n\nThe transfer-matrix @xmath satisfies the Baxter equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.59)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe have already discussed (see Sec. 1.3 ) that @xmath is represented in\nthe form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath in the large @xmath limit. In the large @xmath limit we can\nalso approximate the Baxter equation by:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.61)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us verify if the approximation ( 3.61 ) is valid in the limit ( 3.1\n). We are interested in the dynamics of excitations inside the well,\ntherefore @xmath . As it follows from ( 1.40 ), approximation ( 3.61 )\ncan be trusted \u00b9\u00b3 \u00b9\u00b3 13 We consider the Bethe roots inside the well. For\nthese roots the last term in ( 1.40 ) is small if @xmath is at the\ndistance from the source origin smaller then @xmath . This condition is\nperfectly satisfied since inside the well all the distances are\nmaximally of order @xmath . We see that approximation ( 3.61 ) is\nperfectly satisfied. This also means the validity of the string\nhypothesis.\n\nIn view of ( 3.61 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.62)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the dots stand for the term that can be neglected in the large\n@xmath limit.\n\nThe equation ( 3.61 ) for @xmath is solved explicitly by \u00b9\u2074 \u00b9\u2074 14 We\nrequire @xmath to be analytic outside the real axis.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.63)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nInserting this solution into ( 3.62 ) we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.64)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe factor containing @xmath can be calculated explicitly in the limit (\n3.1 ). If we take logarithm and then derivative of this factor we will\nget:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (3.65)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe overall constant of integration can be found from the fact that at\n@xmath the considered factor in the limit ( 3.1 ) should be equal to\n@xmath .\n\nTherefore in the limit ( 3.1 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.66)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere the product is taken only over the interior holes (inside the well\nin Fig. 3.3 ). The residual factor from the exterior holes is @xmath ,\nwhere @xmath is the number of exterior holes to the right from the well.\nSince the holes are excited by pairs, the value of the multiplier @xmath\ndoes not depend on the type of excitation we consider. In the following\nwe will consider the case when @xmath is divisible by @xmath , therefore\n@xmath .\n\nThe representation ( 3.66 ) for @xmath is correct in the strip @xmath ,\nwhere we can use approximation ( 3.61 ) for both @xmath and @xmath .\nFrom ( 3.57 ) we do not expect singularities on the lines @xmath , at\nleast inside the well. Therefore let us evaluate l.h.s. of ( 3.58 )\nusing ( 3.66 ). From this evaluation we see that ( 3.58 ) gives\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz equations for the @xmath GN model:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.67)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nA given asymptotic behavior of @xmath functions in the large @xmath\nlimit is sufficient to solve the @xmath system in the finite volume. It\nfollows for example from the method developed in [ 87 ] . Since we\nreproduce asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the large volume limit, we\ntherefore can identify @xmath and @xmath .\n\nLet us now see how the transfer matrices are identified. We expect to\nfind the gauge transform which will give the following boundary\nconditions in the large @xmath limit:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.68)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.69)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this gauge @xmath should be of order @xmath and therefore the first\nrow in the strip were Hirota equations are nontrivial is decoupled.\nTherefore ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.69 ) define boundary conditions for the Hirota\nsystem defined on a strip @xmath , see Fig. 3.4 . @xmath is the nested\ntransfer matrix. The condition of absence of poles of @xmath leads to\nthe nested Bethe equations of @xmath sigma model.\n\nThe gauge transformation which leads to ( 3.5 ) and ( 3.69 ) should\nsatisfy the following equations\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n              @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.70)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThere is indeed a solution of such system.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.71)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore we see that the Hirota equations for the discretized spin\nchain have a meaningful thermodynamic limit if a proper gauge is chosen.\n\n### Chapter 4 Supersymmetric spin chains\n\nThe current achievements in the field of supersymmetric integrable\nsystems can be summarized as follows \u00b9 \u00b9 1 We will restrict to the most\nstudied case of @xmath algebras. . Most of the algebraic constructions\nbased on the @xmath algebra have a direct generalization to the\nsupersymmetric case. However, these generalizations do not cover the all\nvariety of properties of supersymmetric systems. Also, the physics of\nthe excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum is much more\ncomplicated and was studied to some extent only for few simple cases.\n\nGeneralizing @xmath case construction, all finite-dimensional\nirreducible representations (irreps) of @xmath algebra were constructed\nby Kac [ 88 , 89 ] as highest weight representations. Equivalently these\nrepresentations can be labeled by Young tableaux [ 90 , 91 , 92 ] . The\ndeterminant Weyl formula for characters and its parameter dependent\ngeneralization - Bazhanov-Reshetikhin formula [ 93 ] has a\nstraightforward generalization [ 94 , 95 , 96 ] . This allows, in a\ncomplete analogy with @xmath case, to construct the nested Bethe Ansatz\nfor a supersymmetric group from Hirota dynamics via a chain of Backlund\ntransforms [ 40 ] . The Bethe Ansatz equations can be also derived using\nanalytical Bethe Ansatz techniques [ 97 ] .\n\nWhat makes the @xmath case more difficult than the @xmath case is that\nLie superalgebras allow also reducible but indecomposable\nrepresentations. A good example is the @xmath algebra representations of\nwhich were studied in [ 98 , 99 ] . Although all irreps of @xmath were\nclassified, the complete classification of indecomposable\nrepresentations for arbitrary supersymmetric simple algebra is not known\n\u00b2 \u00b2 2 This is mainly due to the representations of zigzag type. See [\n100 ] and references therein. .\n\nEven if we consider only irreducible representations, their tensor\nproduct may contain an indecomposable representation. It is possible to\nrestrict to the class of the representations tensor product of which is\ngiven by a direct sum of irreps. Unfortunately, such restriction does\nnot allow construction of a spin chain which contains a singlet state\n(antiferromagnetic vacuum). Therefore, whenever an antiferromagnetic\nvacuum is present in a spin chain, studying of excitations around this\nvacuum encounters the problem of presence of irreducible\nrepresentations; this leads to significant complications in the\nconstruction of a physical theory [ 101 , 102 ] .\n\nHere we aim to discuss the techniques mostly for further applications to\nthe integrable system that appears in the context of the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence. It turns out that, at least for the purposes of this\ntext, it is sufficient to consider the class of irreps that do not\ncontain indecomposable parts in their tensor product. These\nrepresentations can be obtained from tensoring of the fundamental\nrepresentation.\n\nIn this chapter we will first recall basic properties of the\nsupersymmetric algebras and theirs representations on the example of the\n@xmath algebra. Then we will discuss the structure of the\nrepresentations that appear as a result of the fusion procedure for the\n@xmath case. We will see that, as in the nonsupersymmetric case, the\nstring-like solutions are in the one-to-one correspondence with\nrectangular irreps. The corresponding integral equations will be\nnaturally written on a fat hook shape.\n\nThe integral equations can be written also in the case of the Bethe\nAnsatz in the representation of type @xmath . In this case the equations\nare naturally written on a so called T-hook shape. This raises a\nquestion about representation theory behind T-hook. This question has\nnot been solved.\n\nThe fusion relations for a fat hook shape were discussed in [ 94 , 95 ,\n40 ] . In the context of the AdS\/CFT correspondence the T-hook shape was\nfirst proposed in [ 44 ] and then in [ 46 , 47 ] built starting from the\nstring hypothesis of [ 103 , 43 ] . The string hypotheses and TBA\nsystems for various cases were also known in the literature before [ 104\n] .\n\nIn Sec. 4.5 we present a general construction: the string hypothesis and\ncorresponding functional equations for the resolvents \u00b3 \u00b3 3\nEquivalently, we can write integral equations for the density functions.\nfor @xmath algebra and for Bethe equations with one arbitrary source\nterm. The Bethe equations may be based on any Kac-Dynkin diagram.\nAlthough this generalization of [ 103 , 104 , 44 ] is quite obvious, it\nwas not discussed in the literature before.\n\n#### 4.1 @xmath algebra and its representations\n\nThe defining representation of the algebra is given by the following\n@xmath matrices\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (4.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe generators @xmath of @xmath bosonic subalgebra obey canonical\ncommutation relations\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe fermionic generators @xmath and @xmath transform under adjoint\naction of @xmath as a spin @xmath representation. Nonzero commutators\nare given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.3)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nThe Cartan subalgebra of @xmath is spanned by @xmath and @xmath . The\ngenerator @xmath acts as zero on the bosonic generators. On the\nfermionic generators it acts as follows\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFinally, the fermionic commutators \u2074 \u2074 4 For the case of superalgebras\nwe understand any commutator as a graded commutator, that is\nanticommutator when both generators are fermionic and usual commutator\notherwise. are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe weight diagram for the generators is shown in Fig. 4.2 .\n\nA standard method to build an irreducible representation of the @xmath\nalgebra is to introduce the highest weight vector @xmath defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe other states of the representation are obtained by action of\nlowering operators @xmath , and @xmath . Due to the fermionic nature of\n@xmath and @xmath , each of these operators is applied consecutively at\nmost once. For the case when they applied exactly once, we get a typical\nrepresentation, which we will denote as @xmath . Under the action of the\nbosonic @xmath subalgebra this representation decomposes into four\n@xmath irreps: ( @xmath , @xmath ), ( @xmath ), ( @xmath ), ( @xmath ),\nwhere the first argument in the brackets is the spin of the @xmath irrep\nand the second argument is the eigenvalue of the operator @xmath . The\ndimension of @xmath is the following:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe parameter @xmath can acquire arbitrary values except @xmath .\n\nAn atypical representation is the representation for which either @xmath\nor @xmath . Due to the commutation relations ( 4.5 ) the first condition\ncan be realized only for @xmath . The second condition can be realized\nonly for @xmath . Both conditions are satisfied simultaneously only when\n@xmath , i.e. for the trivial representation. We will denote the\natypical representation with @xmath as @xmath and the atypical\nrepresentation with @xmath as @xmath . The reason for such notation is\nclear from the structure of the representation shown in Fig. 4.2 . The\ndimension of atypical representation is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nSince the dimension of atypical representation is smaller than the\ndimension of typical representation with the same spin, atypical\nrepresentation is often called short representation.\n\nFor @xmath we have @xmath . This is nothing but the fundamental\nrepresentation.\n\nThe structure of reducible but indecomposable representations is quite\ninvolved. Here we would like to point out only the simplest type of\nindecomposable representation which can be obtained as continuation of\nthe typical representation @xmath to the point @xmath (or @xmath ). The\nirreducible submodule in such representation is @xmath ( @xmath ). For\nmore information about indecomposable representations we refer to [ 100\n] .\n\nIt is useful to identify irreps with the Young tableaux. There are two\n3-dimensional representations: @xmath and @xmath . We will refer to the\nfirst one as fundamental ( @xmath ) and to the second one as\nantifundamental ( @xmath ). Following [ 91 ] , we label @xmath with a\nbox and @xmath with a dotted box (see Fig. 4.4 ). In general, to obtain\nall irreps one should consider tensor products of @xmath and @xmath . A\ngeneral irrep corresponds to a union of two Young tableaux [ 91 ] shown\nin Fig. 4.4 . It is tempting to answer the question whether it is\nmeaningful to fit this union into the T-hook domain that is introduced\nin section 4.7 .\n\nAn important difference with the @xmath case is that the antifundamental\nrepresentation never appears in the tensor product of the fundamental\nrepresentation. This is also true for a trivial representation, atypical\nrepresentations with negative @xmath and any typical representations\nwith @xmath . A natural way to construct antiferromagnetic vacuum is to\nconsider a spin chain with half of the nodes in the fundamental and half\nof the nodes in the antifundamental representations [ 101 ] . Since\ntensor products of @xmath and @xmath contain also indecomposable\nrepresentations, we will encounter such representations when dealing\nwith the excitations over the antiferromagnetic vacuum.\n\nIn the following we will consider a simpler particular case - the\nrepresentations with @xmath . These representations can be obtained from\nthe tensor product of fundamental representation only. Such tensor\nproduct always decomposes into irreps.\n\nTo fix grading of the representation module, we take the vector space\nwith two bosonic and one fermionic components for the fundamental\nrepresentation. A straightforward combinatorial analysis gives the\nidentification of Young tableaux and irreps shown in Fig. 4.4 . We used\ninverse notation for Young tableaux with the largest line below. Such\nnotation was used in [ 40 ] to describe Hirota dynamics in integrable\nsystems. Horizontal lines in the Young tableaux mean\nsupersymmetrization: symmetrization of bosonic elements with other\nelements and antisymmetrization of fermionic elements. The vertical\nlines in the Young tableaux imply superantisymmetrization:\nantisymmetrization of bosonic elements with other elements and\nsymmetrization of fermionic elements. Note that Young tableaux give\ntypical irreps with only discrete half-integer values of @xmath .\n\n#### 4.2 Fusion procedure in the @xmath case.\n\nThe procedure of construction of irreps of @xmath algebra is a\nstraightforward generalization of such procedure for @xmath case. Again,\nwe have a fundamental representation defined by Dynkin labels @xmath and\nits conjugate. Arbitrary irrep can be obtained only from tensor product\nof both of these representations. Appearance of the reducible\nindecomposable representations in the tensor product is controlled by\nthe value of the continuous parameter @xmath . The parameter @xmath is a\nCartan weight with respect to the generator @xmath , where generator\n@xmath is given by the following matrix in the defining representation:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn the following we consider only the representations that can be\nobtained from the tensor product only of the fundamental representation\n@xmath itself. Such irreps are described by Young tableaux which should\nbe inside a fat hook structure shown in Fig. 4.5 . If the border of a\nYoung table does not touch the internal border \u2075 \u2075 5 By the internal\nborder of fat hook we mean the border which contains the corner point\n@xmath . of the fat hook then such Young table defines atypical\nrepresentation. Otherwise, such Young table defines typical\nrepresentation.\n\nWe can derive the Hirota dynamics on a fat hook using a straightforward\ngeneralization of discussion in Sec. 1.4 [ 40 ] . Namely, we consider an\nintegrable system based on the @xmath -matrix\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the graded permutation.\n\nStarting with this @xmath -matrix one can construct the transfer matrix\nin a fundamental representation and use a fusion procedure to obtain the\ntransfer matrices in other representations. The transfer matrices @xmath\nin the rectangular irrep satisfy the Hirota equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe transfer matrices are non-zero if @xmath or @xmath is inside or on\nthe border of the shape (fat hook) in Fig. 4.5 .\n\nThe representations are nontrivial on the internal border of the fat\nhook. They are different from the representation in the corner @xmath\nonly by the value of the parameter @xmath .\n\n#### 4.3 Bethe Ansatz\n\nThe Bethe Ansatz equations can be derived from the fusion relations (\n4.11 ) via a chain composed from two different types of Backlund\ntransforms. The two different types of Backlund transforms appear in the\nfollowing way. The bilinear equations ( 1.5 ) on @xmath and @xmath\nconsidered for a fat hook configuration allow two solutions. For the\nfirst one @xmath is nonzero on a fat hook @xmath . This is the same\nBacklund transform which was discussed in section 1.5 . It is called the\nBacklund transform of the first type (BT1).\n\nFor the second solution @xmath is nonzero on a fat hook @xmath .\nExchanging the roles of @xmath and @xmath for such Backlund transform we\nobtain the Backlund transform of the second type (BT2) which reduces\n@xmath by one. The functional equations for BT2 are shown in Fig. 4.5 .\n\nThe set of the Bethe Ansatz equations is obtained after successive\napplication of Backlund transforms that reduce the fat hook to a single\nstrip. This can be done by application of different chains of Backlund\ntransforms [ 40 ] . A possible chain is shown in Fig. 4.5 . The shape of\nthe chain corresponds to a particular Kac-Dynkin diagram of the @xmath\nalgebra. Each turning of the path corresponds to the fermionic node.\nEach straight pass corresponds to the bosonic node.\n\nThe Bethe Ansatz equations are determined by the Cartan matrix of a\ngiven Kac-Dynkin diagram and have the formal expression\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe Cartan matrix @xmath for a given Kac-Dynkin diagram up to an overall\nsign is given by the following identification:\n\nThe overall sign is chosen such that the sum of the elements in the\nfirst row of @xmath is positive.\n\nFor example, the Cartan matrix for the Kac-Dynkin diagram in Fig. 4.5 is\nthe following:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe Bethe equations ( 4.12 ) can be also written for an arbitrary\nrepresentation [ 97 ] . It is not clear how to obtain the Bethe\nequations for an arbitrary representation from a fat hook construction.\n\n#### 4.4 Duality transformations.\n\nThe system of the Bethe equations is different depending on what\nunderlying Kac-Dynkin diagram was chosen. But the physical properties of\nthe system should not depend on the choice of the Kac-Dynkin diagram.\nAnd indeed, there exists a so called duality transformation [ 105 , 106\n] , [ 95 ] , [ 107 ] which allows to pass from one system of equations\nto another.\n\nLet us consider a fermionic node. We will denote the Baxter polynomial\nfor this node as @xmath . The fermionic node is coupled to two other\nnodes. We will denote the Baxter polynomials that correspond to these\nnodes as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe Bethe equation for the fermionic node\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\ncan be derived from the Baxter equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFrom the point of view of a fat hook picture the Baxter polynomials\n@xmath are just some @xmath polynomials \u2076 \u2076 6 @xmath is the polynomial\nthat defines a boundary condition for the @xmath fat hook. This is a\ngeneralization of the @xmath polynomial in Sec. 1.5 . The polynomial\n@xmath gives a source term for the Bethe equations. For the homogeneous\nspin chain of length @xmath we have @xmath . with appropriate shifts of\nthe arguments on @xmath . These polynomials are associated to the nodes\nwhich form a square shown in Fig. 4.6 . The Baxter equation ( 4.15 ) is\na @xmath relation on these polynomials.\n\nDuality transformation is a passage from the Bethe equations which\ncontain @xmath as Bethe roots to the Bethe equations which contain\n@xmath (zeroes of @xmath ) as Bethe roots. We see that @xmath and @xmath\nenter ( 4.15 ) in a symmetric way. Therefore @xmath are also fermionic\nroots. They obey the same equation as ( 4.14 ), with @xmath replaced by\n@xmath .\n\nThe roots @xmath enter to the Bethe equations for @xmath as the\nfollowing ratio\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAn analogous ratio appears in the Bethe equations for @xmath .\n\nUsing ( 4.15 ) it is easy to see that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore the Bethe equations for @xmath ( @xmath ) change under duality\ntransformations in accordance with the change of the Kac-Dynkin diagram\nshown in Fig. 4.6 .\n\nLet us also consider Bethe equations which correspond to the\nrepresentation\n@xmath . Such Bethe equations are written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nA special attention should be devoted to the momentum carrying node in\nthese equations if @xmath . If the momentum carrying node is fermionic,\nthe Bethe equations for this node are written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIf we perform a duality transformation for the momentum carrying node\nthen the building block of the Bethe equations for @xmath roots will be\nthe following:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore the @xmath node becomes also momentum carrying. Although the\nduality transformation of the momentum-carrying node is possible, the\nresulting equations bring the Bethe Ansatz equations in a nonstandard\nform. Due to this we should forbid to perform the duality transformation\nof the momentum-carrying node if it is situated inside the Kac-Dynkin\ndiagram. This restriction has interesting consequences. For example, if\neach wing (on the left and on the right from the momentum-carrying node)\nof the Kac-Dynkin diagram contains at least one fermionic node, one\ncannot rewrite the Bethe equations in a form which corresponds to the\ndistinguished diagram (the one with a single fermionic node).\n\nThe momentum-carrying node has another important feature. If we start\nfrom the Bethe equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich correspond to the left diagram in Fig. 4.7 , and perform duality\ntransform both on @xmath and @xmath nodes, then the Bethe equations for\nthe momentum carrying node will become\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIf we put @xmath and @xmath in equation ( 4.21 ) then we will get the\nequation for a compact (SU(2)) XXX spin chain. On the opposite, if we\nput @xmath and @xmath in ( 4.22 ) then we will get the equation for a\nnoncompact (Sl(2)) XXX spin chain.\n\nThe second description reveals noncompactness of the spin chain\ndescribed by ( 4.18 ). Indeed, let us find the constraints on the\npossible number of the Bethe roots. For simplicity we suppose that there\nare only three types of the Bethe roots. Bosonic Bethe roots @xmath\nwhich satisfy ( 4.21 ) (or, equivalently ( 4.22 )) and fermionic Bethe\nroots @xmath which satisfy the Baxter equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFrom the Baxter equation we read that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn Sec. 1.3 we obtained the constraints on the number of bosonic Bethe\nroots. In our case we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nCombining ( 4.24 ) and ( 4.25 ) we see that the number of the Bethe\nroots is unconstrained.\n\n#### 4.5 String hypothesis and integral equations\n\nTo formulate a set of integral equations in the thermodynamic limit we\nwill establish first the string hypothesis for the Bethe Ansatz based on\nthe @xmath algebra.\n\nThe string hypothesis for bosonic roots was discussed in Sec. 1.3 and in\nSec. 2.3 . Bosonic Bethe roots can form string configurations alone.\nAlso they can participate in the formation of stacks as intermediate\nnodes. The mechanism how the bosonic roots enter the stacks was\ndiscussed in Sec. 2.3 in the context of GN and PCF models.\n\nTo formulate a string hypothesis for fermionic roots we will consider\nthe Baxter equation for fermionic roots\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the notation is the same as for ( 4.15 ).\n\nLet us assume for simplicity the following ordering of Bethe roots:\n@xmath . Then in the thermodynamic limit the roots of @xmath type will\ndetermine the dominant term in the l.h.s. of ( 4.26 ). For @xmath the\nfirst term will be dominant.\n\nFermionic Bethe roots do not form string configurations themselves.\nInstead, they participate in the formation of stacks as the first or the\nfinal node. Indeed, if @xmath -roots organize in a string of length\n@xmath then ( 4.26 ) implies the string configuration with the same\ncenter either for @xmath -roots of length @xmath , or for @xmath -roots\nof length @xmath .\n\nAll possible string\/stack configurations that can be built from bosonic\nand fermionic nodes \u2077 \u2077 7 For the rational Bethe Ansatz in any\nfundamental representation. are shown in Fig. 4.8\n\n###### Integral equations on a fat hook\n\nThe procedure of construction of integral equations is analogous to the\none described for the bosonic case. In appendix B we prove the following\nstatement:\n\nThe set of the functional equations derived from the Bethe Ansatz for a\ngiven Kac-Dynkin diagram of @xmath algebra and under the assumption that\nthe string hypothesis is valid is equivalent to the following set of\nequations:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfor @xmath being a coordinate of a point situated strictly inside the\nfat hook, and, for @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is different for different Kac-Dynkin diagrams; the\nexpression for of @xmath is given in ( B.10 ) and ( B.11 ).\n\n@xmath is a \u201dD-deformed\u201d Cartan matrix defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe resolvents @xmath and @xmath are zero on the boundary and outside\nthe fat hook except for @xmath .\n\nThere is a string configuration associated with each @xmath node of a\nfat hook. Depending on the node, either @xmath or @xmath is the\nresolvent of the density function of strings. Then correspondingly\neither @xmath or @xmath is the resolvent of the correspondent density of\nholes.\n\nThe exact identification of @xmath with holes or particles is given by\nthe following procedure. First we draw the Kac-Dynkin diagram on the\nnodes of the fat hook. The momentum-carrying node corresponds to the\nnode {1,1}. We are allowed then to move only to the east or to the\nnorth. The initial direction is to the east(north) if the last movement\nin the chain of the Backlund transforms was to the west(south). For\nexample for the fat hook construction in Fig. 4.5 the initial direction\nis to the north.\n\nOne should turn at each node next to the fermionic one.\n\nEach node of the fat hook occupied by the Kac-Dynkin diagram is\nassociated with the corresponding type of the Bethe roots. The\nstring\/stack configurations with the longest string formed from this\ntype of Bethe roots are situated on the straight line which starts from\nthe considered node. There is the only way to assign straight lines to\nthe nodes of the Kac-Dynkin diagram such that all nodes of the fat hook\nwill be occupied.\n\nThe example of the whole construction is shown in Fig. 4.9 .\n\nThe correspondence between holes\/particles and @xmath is chosen in such\na way that interaction (in the sense of equation ( 4.27 )) inside the\nsame line should be through the holes and the interaction between\ndifferent lines should be through the particles.\n\nAlthough formally the equations ( 4.27 ) are the same for different\nKac-Dynkin diagrams, these equations describe different regimes of a\nspin chain. As well, in general there is no relations between the\nresolvents used in ( 4.27 ) for different Kac-Dynkin diagrams. We will\nillustrate now this issue on the example of @xmath spin chain\n\n#### 4.6 Thermodynamic limit of the Bethe equations in the @xmath case\n\nIn the @xmath case we can consider the thermodynamic limit for\nconfigurations close either to the ferromagnetic or to the\nantiferromagnetic vacuum. In the supersymmetric case there are more\npossibilities.\n\nLet us consider the Bethe equations for @xmath spin chain in a\nfundamental representation. Each site of the spin chain is occupied by\none particle which can be a boson with spin up or down or a fermion.\n\nFrom the representation theory we conclude that the total number of\nfermions can be changed only by @xmath by the action of the symmetry\nalgebra. Indeed, the number of fermions is changed under action of\n@xmath and @xmath generators. The square of these generators is zero.\n\nTherefore the state with large amount of fermions never lies in the same\nsymmetry multiplet with the state with small amount of fermions. Thus we\nhave four possible regimes in the thermodynamic limit. If we choose as\nthe pseudovacuum a state with each site occupied with bosons with spin\ndown then these regimes are described as follows:\n\n1.  Large spin, small amount of fermions.\n\n2.  Small spin, small amount of fermions.\n\n3.  Large spin, large amount of fermions.\n\n4.  Small spin, large amount of fermions.\n\nThese regimes can be shown on the following weight diagram:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt turns out that different types of the thermodynamic limit, except the\nsecond one, are naturally related to different dual configurations of\nthe Bethe equations. We will consider each configuration separately.\n\n######\n\n[]\n\ncase. In this case the Bethe equations are written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.31)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe inequalities for the number of Bethe roots are written as follows\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNaturally, the thermodynamic limit is possible in the case when we\nreplace all inequalities @xmath by stronger demands @xmath . This\ncorresponds to the first type of the thermodynamic limit.\n\nThe bosonic Bethe roots @xmath can form string configurations while the\nfermionic roots are real. Introducing the resolvents @xmath for the\n@xmath -strings and @xmath for fermions we obtain the integral equations\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.33)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nOne can try to perform a particle-hole transformation of @xmath as we\ndid in the @xmath case. In this way we will realize the second type of\nthe limit. The obtained integral equations seem do not correspond to the\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz of any known integrable field theory.\n\n######\n\n[]\n\ncase. This case is obtained from the previous one by performing the\ndualization of the root @xmath . The Bethe equations are written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.34)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe inequalities for number of Bethe roots are written as follows\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe thermodynamic limit corresponds to the case when @xmath , which is a\nthird type of thermodynamic limit.\n\nSince the resolvents @xmath remain the same as in the previous case, all\nthe integral equations which do not include @xmath should remain the\nsame. This is indeed the case. Note that the underlying @xmath -string\nconfigurations in the [] case correspond to stack configurations of two\nfermionic nodes in the [] case.\n\nThe complete set of integral equations is written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.36)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere by @xmath we denoted the resolvent for dual variables and by\n@xmath the resolvent of holes for the dual variables. Note that by\nconstruction @xmath .\n\n######\n\n[]\n\ncase. This case is obtained after duality transformation on the @xmath\n-variable of the [] case. The Bethe equations are written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.37)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThis case is the best suited for description of the low-spin regime with\nmost of the excitations being fermions (case 4). The @xmath -string of\n@xmath -s in the [] case transforms into @xmath string of @xmath -s in\nthe [] case. The bosonic excitations of the [] case are now described by\nthe stack composed of @xmath 2-string and one @xmath Bethe root. We will\ndenote the resolvent of @xmath -string configuration, @xmath , by @xmath\n(it should be the same resolvents as in previous case), the resolvent\nfor free @xmath roots by @xmath , and the resolvent for the stack by\n@xmath . Then the integral equations will be written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.38)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 4.7 T-hook\n\nIn the previous two chapters we discussed an algebraic structure of the\nfunctional equations for the case of the irrep @xmath of the @xmath\nalgebra. This structure has a natural generalization for the case of\nother fundamental representation. Let us consider an integrable system\nwhich is described by the following Kac-Dynkin diagram:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is a diagram of the @xmath algebra \u2078 \u2078 8 If a grading convention is\nnot specified, it could be also a @xmath algebra. However, we can always\ndefine a self-consistent notation to obtain only @xmath case. . Gray\nnodes stay either for bosonic or fermionic nodes. Therefore we do not\nrequire the Kac-Dynkin diagram to be distinguished. Numbers above the\nnodes are the Dynkin labels of the representation.\n\nBy a direct generalization of the results of Sec. 4.5 we deduce that the\ninteractions between string configurations in the thermodynamic limit of\nthe Bethe Ansatz based on ( 4.39 ) are described by ( 4.27 ) which is\nnow defined on a T-hook shape shown in Fig. 4.11 . The nodes @xmath\ncorrespond to string or stack configurations based on the momentum\ncarrying node. The nodes to the right(left) of the central line @xmath\ndenote string or stack configurations constructed from the Bethe roots\nthat correspond to the Dynkin nodes to the right(left) of the momentum\ncarrying node.\n\nBased on the functional equations ( 4.27 ), a @xmath -system defined on\nthe T-hook shape can be derived from the TBA. This is how a T-hook was\ninitially proposed in [ 44 , 46 , 47 ] for @xmath .\n\nIn the case of the @xmath algebra and of the representation @xmath of\nthe @xmath algebra there is a strange coincidence that the fusion\nrelations for the transfer matrices of these system are defined exactly\non the same shape as the @xmath -system following from TBA. Based on\nthis coincidence we even suggested in section 3.5 an equivalence between\n@xmath -functions and transfer matrices of the spin chain\ndiscretization. It is therefore natural to ask a question whether a\nT-hook shape has a transfer matrix interpretation.\n\nUnfortunately such kind of interpretation is not known in the\nliterature. Probably one of the obstacles is that consideration of\nfusing relations that include representation of type @xmath leads to\nindecomposable representations and therefore is complicated. Still, in a\nlack of the transfer matrix description we can ask the question whether\nT-hook @xmath -system can be solved by the Bethe Ansatz equations, in\nthe same fashion as was discussed in sections 1.5 and 4.3 . Such kind of\nanalysis was partially done in [ 108 ] . In this work indeed a solution\nof @xmath -system was given in terms of the boundary @xmath -functions.\nIf to assume that @xmath are polynomials, they can be considered as the\nBaxter polynomials that define positions of the Bethe roots. In [ 108 ]\nhowever only the set of @xmath relations which leads to the Bethe\nequations on the fermionic Bethe roots was given. @xmath relations which\nlead to the bosonic Bethe equations were not given. It would be\ninteresting to find such kind of relations. If it is possible then it\nwould be natural to ask what is the meaning of @xmath -functions from\nthe point of view of the Bethe Ansatz. This should be a nontrivial\nquestion in view of the complicated representation theory of\nsuperalgebras.\n\n## Part II Integrable system of AdS\/CFT\n\n### Chapter 5 Overview\n\nIn this chapter we are going to review the subject of integrability in\nthe AdS\/CFT correspondence. For other reviews on this subject we refer\nto [ 109 , 110 , 111 , 112 ] (correspondence itself), [ 113 , 114 , 115\n] (integrability, with the stress on the gauge side), [ 116 , 117 , 118\n, 119 ] (integrability, with the stress on the string side), [ 120 , 121\n, 122 ] (both aspects). In this text we do not discuss scattering\namplitudes in the context of the AdS\/CFT correspondence. For reviews of\nthis subject we refer to [ 123 , 124 ] .\n\n#### 5.1 Essentials of the AdS\/CFT correspondence.\n\nString theory initially appeared as an attempt to describe strong\ninteractions. However, this attempt was not very successful and with the\ndiscovery of nonabelian gauge theories it receded into the background. A\nnew relation of strings, now to the gauge theory, was proposed by \u2019t\nHooft [ 125 ] . In his work he considered the large @xmath limit of\n@xmath gauge theories:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn this limit the sum of Feynman diagrams can be organized as the @xmath\nexpansion. Interestingly, this expansion is nothing but the expansion\nover the topologies. For example, the partition function of the system\nis expanded as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is a sum of Feynman diagrams which can be drawn on a\nRiemann surface with @xmath handles.\n\nThe topological expansion is reminiscent to the perturbative expansion\nin a string theory. In this analogy we interpret the Feynman diagram\n(more precisely, the dual graph) as the discretization of a string\nworldsheet and @xmath should be then proportional to the string coupling\n@xmath .\n\nThe idea to interpret Feynman diagrams as a discretization of the\ntwo-dimensional surface was fruitfully used to define the\ntwo-dimensional gravity through the matrix models [ 126 , 127 , 128 ,\n129 ] (for a review see [ 130 ] ). In the case of the matrix models the\nsum over the planar graphs @xmath can be calculated explicitly. This sum\nis convergent with a finite radius of convergence @xmath . Close to a\ncritical value @xmath the sum is dominated by the diagrams with large\nnumber of vertices. Therefore the continuous surfaces are recovered in\nthe proper double scaling limit which includes @xmath .\n\nThe identification of the string theory which corresponds to a \u2019t Hooft\nconstruction in the gauge theories is a highly nontrivial problem. For a\nlong time there were no explicit examples except the ones for the\ntwo-dimensional gauge theories [ 131 , 132 , 133 ] . The discovery of\nthe AdS\/CFT correspondence [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] gave us explicit examples of a\ngauge\/string duality in four dimensions. Often it is suggested that this\nduality realizes the \u2019t Hooft idea, however this was not explicitly\nshown.\n\nThe first example of the AdS\/CFT correspondence is the equivalence\nbetween @xmath supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) and the type IIB\nstring theory with AdS @xmath S @xmath manifold as a target space. This\nequivalence was first proposed in [ 2 ] developing the study of string\ntheories in the presence of @xmath -branes.\n\nThe @xmath -branes are @xmath dimensional objects on which strings can\nterminate [ 134 ] ( @xmath stands for Dirichlet boundary conditions).\nThe low-energy modes of the @xmath -branes are described by the\nmaximally supersymmetric gauge theory living on @xmath -brane. A stack\nof @xmath branes leads to the @xmath gauge theory [ 135 ] . For @xmath\nthis is @xmath SYM. This is how SYM theory appears in the context of the\nstring theory.\n\nThe AdS\/CFT conjecture is based on the observation that string theory in\nthe presence of @xmath -branes can be effectively described, at least\nwhen @xmath is large, as a closed string theory in a nontrivial\ngravitational background. We will now explain this description in more\ndetails. Let us consider a type IIB string theory. Its action is the\naction for the supersymmetric sigma model, with a worldsheet metric\nbeing dynamic. The bosonic part of the action can be written as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is a target space metric, @xmath is an antisymmetric tensor\nand @xmath is the dilaton.\n\n@xmath can be considered as an infinite set of coupling constants in the\nquantum field theory which are subjects of renormalization. This is how\nstrings govern the geometry of the target space. The demand that the\n@xmath -function for these coupling constants equals zero leads to the\nsupergravity equations of motion.\n\nThe type IIB string theory contains also the selfdual 4-form @xmath .\nThere exists a solution of supergravity EOM with a flux of a field\nstrength @xmath equal to @xmath , @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.4)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nThis is a background which is suggested to be effectively generated by a\nstack of @xmath @xmath -branes.\n\nDue to the red shift the energies for the observer at infinity are not\nthe same as the energies for the observer at finite @xmath . They are\nrelated as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nOne can consider the following limit introduced by Maldacena [ 2 ] . We\ntake @xmath with @xmath fixed. In this limit the near horizon dynamics\nat distances @xmath decouples from the rest. In terms of the variable\n@xmath the near horizon geometry is approximated by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhich is the AdS @xmath S @xmath geometry. Therefore we obtain the type\nIIB strings propagating in the AdS @xmath S @xmath space-time.\n\nDue to ( 5.5 ), the near horizon excitations are viewed by the observer\nat infinity as low energy excitations. As we already discussed, the low\nenergy excitations are described in a @xmath -brane picture by the gauge\ntheory.\n\nThe comparison of these two different descriptions of the near horizon\nphysics leads to the AdS\/CFT correspondence conjecture. The conjecture\nincludes also the relation between @xmath and @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFrom ( 5.6 ) and ( 5.3 ) we conclude that the string sigma model depends\nnot on @xmath and @xmath separately but on their dimensionless ratio\nwhich is a \u2019t Hooft coupling constant:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe AdS\/CFT correspondence is often trusted only in the \u2019t Hooft limit (\n5.1 ), when the stack of @xmath -branes is a heavy object capable to\ngenerate a nontrivial gravity background. In the \u2019t Hooft limit @xmath ,\nso the first quantization of the string theory is enough. This is the\nlimit which we consider in this text.\n\nThe discussed construction of the duality picture can be generalized.\nThe possible variations of the string target spaces and brane\nconfigurations are discussed in a great detail in the review [ 111 ] .\n\nRecently an AdS @xmath \/CFT @xmath version of the duality was proposed\nby Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis, and Maldacena (ABJM) [ 136 ] . The ABJM\nconjecture relates @xmath @xmath superconformal Chern-Simons theory at\nlevel @xmath with M-theory on AdS @xmath S @xmath . The quotient with\nrespect to @xmath should be understood in the following way: S @xmath\ncan be viewed as the S @xmath Hopf bundle over @xmath . The discrete\ngroup @xmath acts on the S @xmath fiber. For @xmath it breaks the\ncomplete @xmath supersymmetry to @xmath one. In the \u2019t Hooft limit (\n@xmath with @xmath fixed) the dimension reduction from S @xmath to\n@xmath takes place and we obtain the correspondence between the planar\nChern-Simons gauge theory and the first quantized type IIA string theory\non AdS @xmath .\n\nSince in the limit ( 5.1 ) the duality is of weak\/strong coupling type,\nit is especially useful for the description of the gauge theories at\nstrong coupling. It would be very interesting to find a\nnon-supersymmetric version of the duality which could describe QCD. Of\ncourse it is not obvious whether such generalization is possible at all.\nFor a discussion of possible restrictions for this generalization and to\nwhat extent they can be overcome see [ 137 ] .\n\nLet us come back to the \u2019t Hooft attempt to describe the worldsheet\ndiscretization of a string with the help of Feynman diagrams. If to\nfollow the analogy with matrix models, the continuous description of the\nworldsheet appears when the coupling constant approach some critical\nvalue @xmath . The finiteness of @xmath for @xmath SYM \u00b9 \u00b9 1 or other\ngauge theory conjectured by the duality. would signal that the \u2019t Hooft\ndescription is inappropriate for the AdS\/CFT correspondence. In the\npresence of the supersymmetry one could believe that by virtue of some\ncancellations @xmath . However, the finite radius of convergence for\nsmall \u2019t Hooft coupling expansion of various observables in @xmath SYM\nsuggests that @xmath is finite.\n\nA huge progress in the understanding of the AdS\/CFT correspondence\nduring the last decade was possible in particular due to the discovery\nof integrability. It is believed that integrability will allow to find\nthe spectrum of the AdS\/CFT system at arbitrary value of the coupling\nconstant and to give a direct proof of the duality. On the string side\nthe integrability appears in a standard way - as integrability of a\ncoset sigma model. On the gauge side the integrability structures are\nidentified in quite unusual way. We will now discuss the integrability\nstructures from the gauge point of view, then pass to the string side,\nand at the end review the main tests of the AdS\/CFT correspondence and\nthe integrability conjecture.\n\n#### 5.2 Gauge side of the correspondence and underlying integrable\nsystem.\n\nThe gauge side of the AdS\/CFT correspondence is the @xmath super\nYang-Mills (SYM) theory in @xmath dimensions. This is a conformal field\ntheory. The vanishing of the beta function in it was shown in [ 138 ,\n139 , 140 ] . The field content of @xmath SYM is a gauge field, four\nleft and four right Majorana spinors, and 6 real scalars:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      @xmath      \n     @xmath      @xmath      \n     @xmath      @xmath      (5.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- -------\n\nAll fields are in the adjoint representation of the @xmath gauge group.\n\nThe global symmetry algebra of the system is @xmath . The bosonic\nsubalgebra of @xmath is given by the direct sum @xmath . Its first term\nis the conformal symmetry in @xmath dimensions, the second term is the\n@xmath symmetry. The @xmath symmetry trivially acts on @xmath , spinors\ntransform in its spinorial representation ( @xmath acts on the index\n@xmath ), scalars transform in its vector representation ( @xmath acts\non the index @xmath ).\n\nThe lagrangian of the theory is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (5.10)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe coefficients @xmath are the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients which\nprovide the invariance of the lagrangian under action of the @xmath\nsymmetry.\n\nWe are interested in the \u2019t Hooft planar limit ( 5.1 ) of the theory.\nInstead of the \u2019t Hooft coupling constant @xmath the coupling constant\n@xmath is often used. It is defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe objects to study in the planar limit are single trace local\noperators. These operators can be viewed as the words built from the\nletters corresponding to the elementary fields of the theory. A possible\nexample of such operator is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSingle trace operators ( 5.12 ) are organized into multiplets of the\nsymmetry algebra @xmath . Its representations are parameterized by a set\nof numbers\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath are spin labels of the representation of the Lorentz group\n@xmath , @xmath are Dynkin labels of @xmath and @xmath is the conformal\ndimension or, what is the same, the eigenvalue of the dilatation\noperator. We will denote the dilatation operator by @xmath .\n\nThe symmetry algebra is preserved on the quantum level. However, certain\nsymmetry generators depend on the coupling constant due to their\nrenormalization.\n\nThe unitary representations of @xmath were classified in [ 141 , 142 ] .\nThey include three series of the so called BPS representations. These\nrepresentations are analogs of atypical irreps discussed in Sec. 4.1 .\nThe value of @xmath in the BPS multiplets can acquire only half-integer\nor integer values, therefore it does not change on the quantum level.\n\nThere is also one series of irreps for which the value of @xmath can\nchange continuously. For these irreps the dilatation operator acquires\nin general situation a quantum correction:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe quantum correction to the dilatation operator @xmath , unlike the\nclassical part @xmath , acts nondiagonally on the single trace local\noperators:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAccording to the duality conjecture the eigenvector of @xmath\ncorresponds to a certain string state. The corresponding eigenvalue\n(anomalous dimension of the operator) is equal to the energy of this\nstate. Finding the spectrum of @xmath is the subject on which we\nconcentrate in this thesis.\n\nIf we are interested in finding the spectrum of very long operators, the\ndiagonalization of the matrix @xmath seems to be a complicated problem\nsince this matrix is very large. For short operators a direct\ndiagonalization is possible, however @xmath is known explicitly only at\nfirst few orders of small @xmath expansion. The integrability methods\nturned out to be a very powerful tool which allowed to overcome these\nproblems. We will explain how integrability appears in the spectral\nproblem of AdS\/CFT and then discuss it in details. To start, we should\nfirst explain some details on the structure of the single trace\noperators and operator @xmath .\n\nOne can think about a single trace operator as being a state of a spin\nchain. Each occurrence of a given field (but not covariant derivative)\ncorresponds to one site of this chain with the corresponding color\nindex.\n\nAs an example we can consider the operator which consists of the fields\nonly of two types, @xmath and @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe vector space spanned by these operators is invariant under action of\nthe quantum dilatation operator. @xmath and @xmath form a fundamental\nmultiplet of the @xmath subalgebra of @xmath . Therefore the space\nspanned by operators ( 5.16 ) is usually called the @xmath subsector.\nThe mapping to the spin chain is the following: we identify @xmath field\nwith a spin down @xmath state of the node and @xmath field with a spin\nup @xmath state of the node, so the operator ( 5.16 ) is mapped to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAnother important example is the operators built only from the @xmath\nfield and a light-cone covariant derivative @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSuch operators are called twist @xmath spin @xmath operators, where\n@xmath is a number of @xmath -fields and @xmath is a number of covariant\nderivatives.\n\nThis subsector is also invariant under the action of the dilatation\noperator and is called the @xmath subsector. Here @xmath is identified\nwith a node of the spin chain and the number of covariant derivatives\nacting on @xmath gives a number of excitations at that particular node.\nThis subsector is noncompact in the sense that the number of excitations\nat each node can be arbitrary.\n\nAlthough the symmetry generators @xmath are renormalized, their\nconformal dimensions are preserved since the commutation relations are\npreserved. In other words, @xmath commutes with symmetry generators:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore, if one thinks of @xmath as of the Hamiltonian of the\ndescribed above spin chain, @xmath is the symmetry of this spin chain.\n\nNote that @xmath enters as a central extension of @xmath algebra which\nis different from for example such spin chain as Heisenberg ferromagnet.\nInstead, this property resembles to the case of relativistic theories in\nthe sense that in both cases the Hamiltonian is a part of a symmetry\nalgebra.\n\nThe Hamiltonian @xmath can be expanded in the powers of the coupling\nconstant as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the @xmath -loop contribution of the perturbative\ntheory. The perturbation theory in the \u2019t Hooft planar limit is such\nthat @xmath includes only the interactions between @xmath nearest\nneighbors. For example, for the @xmath subsector @xmath and @xmath are\ngiven by [ 6 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a permutation operator.\n\nThe integrability in @xmath SYM was first observed by Minahan and\nZarembo in [ 5 ] for the @xmath subsector of the spin chain at one loop\n\u00b2 \u00b2 2 Prior to this work, integrability had been already discovered in\none loop QCD. It first appeared in a study of the Regge asymptotics of\nscattering amplitudes [ 143 , 144 ] . The one-loop dilatation operator\nin the @xmath subsector of QCD was identified with the Hamiltonian of\nintegrable spin chain in [ 145 ] . The @xmath subsector then was further\nstudied in [ 146 , 147 , 148 , 149 ] . This subsector is built only from\nthe scalar operators @xmath and is invariant under action of @xmath .\nMinahan and Zarembo explicitly calculated @xmath in this sector and\nfound that it was the Hamiltonian of the integrable @xmath spin chain\nwith rational @xmath -matrix.\n\nIn [ 150 ] the one-loop integrability for the whole symmetry algebra was\nchecked. The underlying integrable spin chain is based on the rational\n@xmath @xmath -matrix. Therefore it can be solved by standard means\ndescribed in details in the first part of this text. In particular, we\nhave to choose a pseudovacuum to write down the Bethe Ansatz equations.\nThe standard choice for the pseudovacuum is the BPS state\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe pseudovacuum is not invariant under the whole @xmath symmetry, but\nonly under @xmath . The Bethe Ansatz equations for the excitations over\nthis pseudovacuum are encoded into the Kac-Dynkin diagram \u00b3 \u00b3 3 A\nparticular choice of a Kac-Dynkin diagram is dictated by further\ngeneralization of integrability to higher loops. shown in Fig. 5.1 .\n\nThe first evidence that integrability might hold below one loop was\nobtained by Beisert, Kristjansen, and Staudacher in [ 6 ] , where the\ntwo loop dilatation operator ( @xmath ) was calculated and a degeneracy\nof the spectrum characteristic for integrable system was found. In this\nwork they conjectured also that integrability holds at all loops. In [\n151 ] Beisert showed that the dilatation operator, at least in @xmath\nsubsector, can be fixed up to three loops by supersymmetry, an input\nfrom perturbative field theory, and additional requirement - the proper\nBMN scaling [ 152 , 153 , 10 ] . This gave a check of integrability up\nto three loops. The three loop Hamiltonian was shown to be related to\nthe Inozemtsev model [ 154 ] and derivable from the Hubbard spin chain [\n155 ] .\n\nSuch properties as the BMN scaling of the spectrum and the relation of\nthe Hamiltonian to Inozemtsev and Hubbard models, do not hold starting\nfrom four loops. Starting from this order, the checks of integrability\nare more sophisticated. So far there is no proof of the all-loop\nintegrability conjecture, however there are nontrivial checks at four [\n21 , 23 , 156 ] , [ 157 , 158 ] and even at five loops [ 159 , 160 , 161\n] \u2074 \u2074 4 The four loop tests [ 157 , 158 ] and five loop tests consider\nshort operators which are sensible to wrapping corrections. These are\nthe verifications of the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz which is next level\nafter construction of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz that we discuss in\nthis chapter. . Of course, an important argument for the all-loop\nintegrability is that at strong coupling we should reproduce the string\nsigma model, which is integrable at least classically (we discuss the\nintegrability on the string side of the correspondence in the next\nsection).\n\nThe identification of integrability structures at higher loops is a\nnontrivial procedure. As we have already mentioned, the range of\ninteraction increases by one with each order of the perturbation theory.\nSoon the structure of the Hamiltonian becomes very involved. The exact\nHamiltonian of the system is not known \u2075 \u2075 5 For the @xmath subsector a\nconstruction that allows one to generate the series of @xmath in @xmath\nwas proposed [ 162 , 163 ] . Still, this construction does not give the\nHamiltonian in a close form. Also it does not include wrapping\ninteractions. . Also we do not know the complete @xmath -matrix of the\nsystem.\n\nFor the finite length spin chain at a certain order of the perturbation\ntheory the range of interaction spreads to the whole spin chain. At this\norder new types of Feynman diagrams appear that contribute to the\nHamiltonian. They lead to the so called wrapping interactions. In [ 164\n] it was shown that the Bethe Ansatz approach, at least in the known\nform, does not correctly describe the system with wrapping interactions.\nTherefore, to apply Bethe Ansatz one should generically restrict to the\ncase of the infinitely long spin chain. More precisely, for the spin\nchain of the length @xmath , the Bethe Ansatz can be trusted up to the\norder @xmath in the expansion ( 5.20 ). Due to this reason the Bethe\nAnsatz is called asymptotic.\n\nThis is reminiscent to the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the integrable\nsigma-models. The latter is built based on the factorized @xmath -matrix\nwhich describes the scattering of particles. The notion of a scattering\nis possible only in the case when @xmath , where @xmath is the mass of\nthe particle and @xmath is the size of the system. For @xmath or smaller\nthe asymptotic Bethe Ansatz should be corrected.\n\nThe scattering matrix in integrable sigma-models is constructed by the\nbootstrap approach discussed in Sec. 2.2 . This approach turned out to\nbe very useful to describe the spectrum of @xmath . The importance of\nthe factorized @xmath matrix in the AdS\/CFT case was recognized by\nStaudacher in [ 8 ] . As was shown by Beisert [ 165 ] , the @xmath\n-matrix which describes the scattering over the BPS vacuum ( 5.22 ) can\nbe fixed up to an overall scalar factor from the symmetry requirements.\nThe overall scalar factor is restricted by the crossing equations [ 16 ]\n\u2076 \u2076 6 The existence of the crossing equations is expected from the fact\nthat the integrable system should describe also the string sigma model\n(see Sec. 6.3 ). . The solution of the crossing equations is also known\n[ 20 , 21 ] . This solution is uniquely fixed by the reasonable physical\nrequirements [ V3 ] .\n\nThe knowledge of the @xmath -matrix allows to build the all-loop Bethe\nAnsatz equations [ 9 , 166 ] initially proposed by Beisert and\nStaudacher [ 11 ] . The @xmath -matrix is not a rational one, except for\n@xmath where we recover the one-loop integrable system. The overall\nscalar factor, the logarithm of which is also known as the dressing\nphase, enters to the central node equations.\n\nThe construction of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz will be discussed in\ndetails in chapter 6 . To give a brief idea of how it looks like we\nwrite down an explicit form of the Bethe Ansatz for the @xmath\nsubsector:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere @xmath is the Zhukovsky map defined by ( 6.34 ) and @xmath is the\ndressing factor. For @xmath we have @xmath and @xmath . Therefore we\nrecover the Bethe Ansatz equations for the XXX Heisenberg ferromagnet (\n3.1 ). The Bethe Ansatz equations in the absence of the dressing factor\nwere first proposed by Beisert, Dippel and Staudacher [ 167 ] and are\nknown as the BDS Bethe Ansatz. The necessity of the nontrivial dressing\nfactor became clear from the perturbative calculations on the string\ntheory side [ 17 ] .\n\nThe logic of construction and the structure of all-loop Bethe equations\nare much closer to the integrable field theories then to the integrable\nspin chains. Therefore, we depict the Dynkin diagram for the all-loop\nBethe Ansatz as shown in Fig. 5.2 \u2077 \u2077 7 ( 5.23 ) corresponds to the\nblack node of the diagram in Fig. 5.2 with nested Bethe roots being\nturned off. , in analogy with Fig. 2.5 for PCF. This analogy should not\nbe very surprising since at strong coupling the Bethe Ansatz should\nreproduce the spectrum of the string theory, which is a two-dimensional\nfield theory.\n\n#### 5.3 String side of the correspondence\n\nThe first-quantized string is described by a\nGreen-Schwarz-Metsaev-Tseytlin action [ 12 ] , whose bosonic part has a\nnonlinear sigma model form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe metric @xmath is the metric of AdS @xmath S @xmath ( 5.6 ). The\ntarget space is not AdS @xmath S @xmath but its universal covering. As\nwe already mentioned, the theory depends on the unique parameter - \u2019t\nHooft coupling constant given by @xmath , where @xmath is the radius of\n@xmath and @xmath spaces.\n\nThis theory can be formulated as a coset sigma model. Similarly to\nbosonic sigma models on a coset manifold [ 168 ] , it can be shown to be\nclassically integrable [ 13 ] . Namely, it is possible to construct the\nflat current @xmath in terms of which the equations of motion are\nwritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the simplest cases @xmath . For the string sigma model its definition\nis slightly more complicated.\n\nOne can introduce the Lax connection @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is flat as it can be easily checked from ( 5.25 ) and the flatness\nof @xmath .\n\nUsing the Lax connection, one can build the monodromy @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the contour @xmath is a closed contour on the string worldsheet\nshown in figure on the right.\n\nDue to the flatness of @xmath the function @xmath does not change if the\ncontour @xmath is continuously deformed, including translation in the\n@xmath direction. Therefore @xmath does not depend on time @xmath .\nSince @xmath depends on the additional parameter @xmath it generates an\ninfinite set of integrals of motion. As usual for integrable systems,\nthe local integrals of motion appear if to expand @xmath near its\nsingular points which are @xmath (compare to the formula ( 1.35 ) and\nthe discussion after it).\n\nFor the AdS\/CFT sigma model this construction was first realized in [ 13\n] . However, the existence of infinite set of integrals of motion is not\nsufficient for proving classical integrability. One has to show that\nthese integrals of motion are in convolution. This was done first for\nthe @xmath subsector in [ 169 ] , then for the bosonic string in [ 170 ,\n171 ] , and finally for the whole string in [ 172 ] .\n\nEach string state is characterized, not uniquely in general, by the\nvalues of the Cartan generators of @xmath algebra acting on it. These\nare three angular momenta @xmath for the rotation of string in @xmath ,\ntwo angular momenta @xmath for the rotation of string in @xmath and the\nenergy @xmath which corresponds to the translations in time direction.\nThese parameters are related to the parameters ( 5.13 ) which define the\nrepresentation in the following way:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nInitial interest for particular solutions to the string equations of\nmotion and their quasiclassical quantization was motivated by the\ndiscovery of the so called BMN scaling [ 152 ] . The conjecture of the\nBMN scaling states that in the limit @xmath , @xmath the energy is\neffectively expanded in terms of the BMN coupling @xmath . This scaling\ngave a window for a direct comparison of strong and weak coupling\nresults since smallness of @xmath can be achieved both in perturbative\ngauge and string theories since @xmath is large. For some of the\nreferences concerning study of string configurations in this scaling and\nits generalizations see [ 173 , 174 , 175 , 176 , 177 , 178 , 179 ] . We\nwill discuss some particular cases in the next section.\n\nThese initial investigations played an important role for the\ndevelopment of integrability techniques. Later it became evident that\nthe BMN scaling is violated at higher orders. But soon the development\nof the integrability gave precise predictions for certain anomalous\ndimensions at strong coupling without relying on the BMN regime.\n\nSolutions of string equations of motion can be described by a general\napproach known as a finite gap method. Its application for AdS\/CFT was\ndeveloped in a series of papers [ 180 , 181 , 182 , 183 , 184 ]\ninitiated by [ 19 ] . Based on the finite gap method, it was possible to\nperform a general test for the validity of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz\non the string side at 1-loop approximation [ 185 ] .\n\nThere are also few two-loop calculations in string theory [ 186 , 187 ,\n188 ] . The two-loop check of the integrability seems to be more\nprofound than the one loop one. The one-loop results could be obtained\nby the quasiclassical quantization. Instead, a two-loop calculation\nrequires computing of Feynman diagrams. We discuss comparison of the\nBethe Ansatz prediction and the string two-loop predictions in\nsubsection 5.4.3 and chapter 8 . So far, at two loops there is an\nagreement for the value of the cusp anomalous dimension [ 186 ] .\nHowever, for more involved examples: generalized scaling function [ 187\n] and Konishi operator [ 188 ] there are disagreements. The reason for\nthese disagreements is still not understood.\n\nBefore going to the explicit examples let us mention that there is an\nimportant difference between the sigma-model and the string theory. In\nthe latter the world-sheet metric is a dynamical quantity. Although we\ncan always choose a reference frame in which the worldsheet metric is\nflat, the dynamical nature of the metric leads to Virasoro constraints.\nBy fixing the Virasoro constraints we typically introduce the mass scale\ninto the system, as it happens for example in a light-cone gauge.\nTherefore, finally we consider not the initial conformal sigma model (\n5.24 ) but a field theory with massive excitations. The @xmath -function\nfor the coupling constant remains zero of course.\n\n#### 5.4 Verifications of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz\n\nAll the examples considered below are based on the string states which\nhave at most two nonzero angular momenta. The formulation of the\nperturbative string theory is known only when one of the angular momenta\nis large. This requirement is also needed to be able to use the\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz.\n\n##### 5.4.1 BMN particles and giant magnons.\n\nIn the seminal paper of Berenstein, Maldacena, and Nastase [ 152 ] the\nstring theory was considered in a type of the Penrose plane wave limit [\n189 ] which described perturbations around fast moving point-like string\nsolution. The limit in [ 152 ] included\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere we will rather use the \u2019t Hooft limit ( 5.1 ) with additional\ndemand that the BMN coupling\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis small. The excitations we are interested in are the same in two\ncases. Therefore we will keep the name of BMN excitations (particles)\nalso for our case. Our reasoning follows closely to [ 173 ] .\n\nTo understand the nature of the BMN excitations it is useful to replace\nstring by a particle on @xmath . The lagrangian for such a particle is\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nOne has the conserved angular momentum\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFixing its value one can find the effective lagrangian for the\ncoordinate @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe got a particle which moves in the effective potential with minimum at\n@xmath . For large values of @xmath it is enough to use quadratic\napproximation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich leads to oscillations with frequency @xmath . Note that in this\nexample @xmath plays the role of the coupling constant.\n\nThe picture in the string theory is completely similar. The energy of\nthe particle is the analog of the string worldsheet energy. The coupling\nconstant in the string case is @xmath . The fast rotating string with\nmomenta @xmath leads to a massive relativistic field theory with @xmath\n. The worldsheet energy is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe spectrum is discrete since we consider closed strings.\n\nThe written expression ( 5.35 ) for @xmath looks like if we have only\none type of excitations. In fact, there are 16 of them - 8 bosonic and 8\nfermionic. However, all their masses are equal as was shown by Metsaev\nin [ 190 ] using symmetry.\n\nTo find the target space energy @xmath we should use the on-shell\ncondition which states that @xmath , where @xmath is a number of\nworldsheet derivatives in the vertex operator corresponding to the\nconsidered state. If we consider states with finite values of @xmath ,\nthe on-shell condition and ( 5.35 ) lead to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow we understand the meaning of the BMN coupling @xmath . This is a\nsquare of the inverse mass of the BMN particle. If we assume that\nspectrum of the theory is described by BMN particles, it is natural to\nexpect that the energy of the state is expanded in terms of @xmath . In\nreality the BMN scaling is not an exact property. The reason is that the\nharmonic oscillator approximation works only for the oscillations with\nsmall mode numbers @xmath .\n\nIt will be convenient to introduce the worldsheet momentum\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich will be a natural variable if we rescale the worldsheet volume\nsuch that it is equal to @xmath .\n\nThe momentum @xmath is continuous in the large @xmath limit. The\nharmonic oscillator approximation works for @xmath . For @xmath one may\nexpect a different from ( 5.36 ) dispersion relation. In fact, the exact\nenergy which is associated to each particle is equal to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis expression was initially derived in [ 10 ] .\n\nThe excitations whose momentum scales at large @xmath as @xmath are\ncalled giant magnons.\n\nTo understand better the giant magnons let us consider the bosonic\nstring sigma model on @xmath and choose the temporal gauge @xmath . In\nthis gauge the theory reduces to the @xmath sigma model. The equations\nof motion for the @xmath sigma model via Pohlmeyer reduction [ 191 ]\nreduce to the equations of motion for the sine-Gordon model. It is\nwell-known that the sine-Gordon model has kink solutions. Giant magnons\nare equivalent to these kink solutions. For more details we refer to the\noriginal paper of Hofman and Maldacena [ 14 ] and to the review of Dorey\n[ 122 ] .\n\nThere is also an intermediate regime between the one of BMN particles\nand giant magnons - near plane wave regime [ 192 ] . The momentum of\nexcitations in this regime scales as @xmath . From the dispersion\nrelation ( 5.38 ) it follows that @xmath . Interestingly, this scaling\nis characteristic not only for the near plane wave excitations but for\nthe operators with finite value of @xmath [ 3 , 4 ] .\n\nLet us now identify the considered excitations from the point of view of\nthe gauge theory.\n\nOn the gauge theory side the string moving at the speed of light\ncorresponds to the BPS vacuum ( 5.22 ). The transversal fluctuations\naround this vacuum correspond to insertion of waves of some other\noperator @xmath different from @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe dispersion relation ( 5.38 ) is the consequence of invariance under\nsupersymmetry algebra [ 9 ] as we will explain in the next chapter.\n\nIn the case of the @xmath sector @xmath . At weak coupling the\nexpression for the energy ( 5.38 ) can be approximated by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this expression we recognize, up to an overall factor @xmath , the\ndispersion relation for the XXX ferromagnet.\n\nLet us summarize. At finite coupling there is one type of excitation -\nspin wave in the integrable spin chain. At strong coupling three\npossible scalings of this excitation are possible \u2078 \u2078 8 numerical\nanalysis shows that for multipartite solutions a more general scaling of\nthe type @xmath is possible. However there is no macroscopically\nsignificant amount of such particles. : giant magnon ( @xmath ), near\nplane wave ( @xmath ), and BMN particle ( @xmath ).\n\n##### 5.4.2 Folded and spinning strings.\n\nA further possible generalization of the single particle excitations\ndiscussed above is to consider a string with two large angular momenta.\nIf two of them, say @xmath and @xmath , are on the sphere, we obtain the\nfolded string rotating in @xmath . In @xmath this is a point-like string\nsituated at the center of @xmath . If one momentum @xmath is on @xmath\nand another @xmath is on @xmath , we get the folded string rotating in\n@xmath . In @xmath this is a point-like string spinning around equator.\n\nOn a gauge side the folded string on @xmath corresponds to the\nmultiparticle state in the @xmath sector, the folded string on @xmath\ncorresponds to the multiparticle state in the @xmath sector. The @xmath\ncase was initially analyzed in [ 193 ] , then both @xmath and @xmath\ncases were treated on the common footing in [ 178 ] .\n\nLet us discuss in more details these solutions in the one-loop\napproximation on the gauge side of the correspondence.\n\nThe Bethe equations are written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the notation is the following. For the @xmath case: @xmath . For\nthe @xmath case: @xmath .\n\nThe energy is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt will be useful to introduce the ratio\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.43)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe structure of the Bethe Ansatz restricts @xmath to be larger than\n@xmath . The positive values of @xmath can be arbitrary, however the\nsolution that we discuss in this subsection requires @xmath to be finite\nin the large @xmath limit.\n\nTaking the logarithm of the Bethe equations we get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor finite values of @xmath , positive or negative, and large values of\n@xmath the Bethe roots scale as @xmath . Therefore we can approximate (\n5.44 ) by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe are interested in the solution with minimal energy and for simplicity\nwe take @xmath to be even. Such a solution is symmetric and is defined\nby taking half of @xmath equal to 1 and other half equal to @xmath [ 193\n, 178 ] .\n\nOne can interpret ( 5.45 ) as the force equilibrium equation in the\nclassical mechanics. If @xmath is negative, then the particles repel\nalong the real axis. This leads to their distribution on the real axis.\nIf @xmath is positive, then the particles attract along the real axis.\nInstead, they repel in the imaginary direction. This leads to the fact\nthat for the @xmath subsector the lowest energy solution is given by two\nsymmetrically situated string-like configurations (see Fig. 5.3 ).\n\nIn the large @xmath limit ( 5.45 ) equation is solved by the techniques\ndeveloped in the context of the @xmath matrix model [ 194 , 195 ] .\nNamely, we rely on the fact that the roots condensate on two cuts in the\ncomplex plane (see Fig. 5.3 ). To see condensation one should rescale\n@xmath .\n\nThen it is useful to introduce the resolvent @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis function is analytic everywhere except on the cuts. In the large\n@xmath limit ( 5.45 ) becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the values of the resolvent from the right\nand from the left of the cut respectively. If we differentiate the last\nequation, then we obtain the equation for @xmath which has the solution\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo fix the solution we used the fact that the resolvent should be\nanalytic outside the cuts and decrease as @xmath at infinity.\n\nThe branch points of the resolvent are @xmath and @xmath . @xmath and\n@xmath are real (and are defined to be positive) in the @xmath case and\ncomplex conjugated (and are defined to have positive real part) in the\n@xmath case. The values of @xmath and @xmath are fixed from the\nadditional condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.49)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich follows from ( 5.47 ).\n\nThe energy found from the solution ( 5.48 ) with @xmath and @xmath fixed\nby ( 5.49 ) is given by [ 178 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the elliptic integral of the first kind and @xmath is\nthe elliptic integral of the second kind:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.51)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nInterestingly, the energy in two different sectors is defined by a\nsingle analytic function ( @xmath ) of the parameter @xmath .\n\nTo obtain the result ( 5.50 ) one considers the large @xmath limit while\nthe coupling constant is small (zero in fact). Of course, string\nperturbative solution is valid only for large values of the coupling\nconstant. Therefore the large @xmath limit on a string theory side\nshould be formulated differently. The first step which is used for the\ncalculations on the string theory side is to consider the limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.52)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis limit can be thought as introduction of the BMN couplings @xmath .\nSome of the charges may be zero. Then the string movement in the\ncorresponding direction is switched off and we do not require the\nscaling @xmath for such charges.\n\nIn the limit ( 5.52 ) the classical solution for the equations of motion\nis known exactly [ 176 , 178 ] . The energy for such classical solution\ncan be represented as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.53)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo be precise, let us consider the @xmath case. The large @xmath limit\nwith fixed @xmath leads to the following expansion of the energy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.54)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe term containing @xmath indeed coincides with ( 5.50 ) [ 178 ] .\n@xmath agrees with two loop prediction from the gauge theory side [ 178\n] . However, @xmath does not match with the three loop prediction from\nthe gauge theory side. This does not mean the violation of the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence but that the BMN scaling is not valid at this order of\nperturbation theory.\n\nLet us take a look once more on the solution ( 5.48 ). @xmath can be\nviewed as a meromorphic differential which defines a Riemann surface.\nTherefore the solution of the Bethe Ansatz in the thermodynamic (large\n@xmath ) limit is characterized by the algebraic curve [ 19 ] .\n\nThe algebraic curve appears also on the string side. Indeed, let us\nconsider the differential @xmath , where @xmath is defined by ( 5.27 ).\nThis is a @xmath supermatrix. Let us take its particular eigenvalue\n@xmath at some point @xmath . In general there are nontrivial cycles\nstarting and ending at @xmath , analytical continuation over which\nbrings @xmath to another eigenvalue of @xmath . Therefore @xmath is the\ndifferential defined in general on the 8-sheeted Riemann surface.\n\nWhat we can do is not to compare the energies given from string theory\nand asymptotic Bethe Ansatz, but to compare the algebraic curves which\nwith additional constraints are in one to one correspondence with given\nsolutions. This is indeed can be done [ 19 ] , [ 180 , 181 , 182 , 183 ,\n184 ] . This approach is known as the finite gap method. It gives a more\nsystematic way to describe possible string solutions. However, it is not\nevident how to apply it beyond the quasiclassical approximation.\n\nOf course, it is not compulsory to look only for the solutions only in\nthe BMN window. We can directly demand that the (all-loop)asymptotic\nBethe Ansatz gives the same results at strong coupling as the\nperturbative results of the string sigma model. Using this demand it was\npossible to fix the dressing factor at the tree [ 17 ] and one loop [\n196 , 197 , 18 , 198 ] levels of the strong coupling expansion.\n\n##### 5.4.3 Operators with logarithmic scaling of energy\n\nLarge @xmath ( @xmath ) scaling with fixed @xmath is not the only\npossible regime for the operators that are described by two nonzero\nangular momenta. Another interesting regime in the @xmath case is when\n@xmath and @xmath scales in way that @xmath .\n\nThe possibility of using this regime to test the AdS\/CFT correspondence\nwas initially recognized by Belitsky, Gorsky, and Korchemsky in [ 199 ]\n. They showed that the spectrum in this regime depends on the value of\nthe parameter \u2079 \u2079 9 In [ 199 ] the inverse parameter @xmath was used. We\nuse the notations of [ 24 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn particular they discussed the case @xmath and showed that the\none-loop correction to the anomalous dimension scales in this case as\n@xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAppearance of the parameter @xmath is not accidental. At sufficiently\nsmall @xmath the distance between the two cuts in the two-cut solution\n(like in Fig. 5.3 on the right) can be approximated by the quantity\nproportional to @xmath . This distance remains finite for finite @xmath\n. Therefore @xmath can be thought as measure of distance between two\ncuts.\n\nWhen the cuts are situated at the finite distance from each other, the\nsolution ( 5.48 ) becomes inappropriate, since due to the required\nrescaling @xmath ( 5.48 ) develops a singularity at the origin.\n\nThe logarithmic scaling regime acquired a lot of attention. In [ 49 , 24\n] it was shown that the logarithmic scaling ( 5.56 ) also takes place in\nthe case of finite @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.57)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe quantity @xmath is called the generalized scaling function.\n\n###### Cusp anomalous dimension\n\nThe situation @xmath is realized in particular in the case when we are\ndealing with finite twist operators ( 5.18 ) with large number @xmath of\ncovariant derivatives. The composite operators with large number of\ncovariant derivatives were investigated for arbitrary four-dimensional\ngauge theory. All of them obey the logarithmic scaling ( 5.56 ) known\nalso as a Sudakov scaling.\n\nFor the case of twist two operators the scaling function @xmath is equal\nto twice the cusp anomalous dimension [ 200 , 201 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe same equality holds for the ground state of arbitrary finite twist\noperator.\n\nThe cusp anomalous dimension was introduced in [ 202 , 203 ] . This\nquantity depends on the gauge theory that we consider and it is\nimportant for calculation of the scattering amplitudes. For @xmath SYM\nthe cusp anomalous dimension allows one to find exactly the four- and\nfive-point gluon amplitudes [ 204 ] . The cusp anomalous dimension was\nfound at weak coupling analytically up to three loops [ 205 , 206 ] and\nnumerically up to four loops, after an impressive effort [ 23 , 207 ] .\n\nOn a string theory side the finite twist operator correspond to the\nfolded string rotating in @xmath [ 173 ] . The logarithmic scaling\nappears due to the approaching of the ends of string to the boundaries\nof @xmath . The factor of two in ( 5.58 ) corresponds to the fact that\nthe folded string has two ends \u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u2070 10 A more general situation of the\nso called spiky strings that have @xmath cusps, was discussed in [ 208 ]\n. For that string configurations the coefficient of proportionality in\n5.58 was found to be @xmath . . A nice physical arguments for the origin\nof logarithmic scaling were given in [ 49 ] . The cusp anomalous\ndimension was found at strong coupling at tree level [ 173 , 174 ] , one\n[ 209 ] and two [ 186 ] loops.\n\nBeisert, Eden, and Staudacher [ 21 ] derived from the asymptotic Bethe\nAnsatz the integral equation, known as the BES equation, solution of\nwhich allows to find the scaling function @xmath at finite values of the\ncoupling constant. Their proposal was based on the work of Eden and\nStaudacher [ 22 ] and was different by introduction of the nontrivial\ndressing factor @xmath . This was the first work where an exact\nnonperturbative proposal for the dressing factor, built on an earlier\nwork [ 20 ] , appeared.\n\nThe calculation of the scaling function @xmath through the BES equation\ngave the first nontrivial test for the AdS\/CFT integrability conjecture\nat four loops of weak coupling expansion [ 21 ] . The strong coupling\nsolution of the BES equation proved to more complicated. In [ 26 , 27 ]\n, [ KSV1 , 28 ] the leading order of the strong coupling expansion was\nfound analytically. In [ 29 ] the first three orders were found\nnumerically. The subleading order was obtained in [ 30 , 31 ] by means\ndifferent from solving the BES equation (see section 8.4 ). In [ 32 ] ,\n[ KSV2 ] a recursive procedure for analytical expansion to any desired\norder was given. The obtained results reproduced the string theory\ncalculations at tree level [ 173 , 174 ] , one [ 209 ] , and two [ 186 ]\nand gave a strong evidence of the correctness of the asymptotic Bethe\nAnsatz. We present the results of [ KSV2 ] in section 8.2 and in\nappendix E.2 .\n\n###### Generalized scaling function\n\nAs we already mentioned, the logarithmic scaling also takes place for\nfinite values of the parameter @xmath [ 49 , 24 ] . A generalization of\nthe BES equation which allows finding the generalized scaling function\n@xmath was given in [ 24 , 25 ] . This generalization is known as the\nBES\/FRS equation. Since we have an additional parameter @xmath , by\nsolving this equation at strong coupling we can test the integrability\non the functional level. The solution of the BES and BES\/FRS equations\nwas a subject of our work. We discussion these equations in chapter 8 .\n\n###### @xmath sigma model\n\nOne important regime proposed by Alday and Maldacena in [ 49 ] needs to\nbe mentioned. This is strong coupling limit in which @xmath is non-zero\nbut is exponentially small with respect to the coupling constant.\n\nTo understand what happens in this case let us discuss the spectrum of\nexcitations in the string sigma model. In the same way as it was for the\ncircular string in S @xmath , the folded string rotating in AdS @xmath\ncreates a centrifugal force. However, this force leads to the nonzero\nmass only for bosonic fluctuations on AdS @xmath and for fermionic\nfluctuations. The bosonic fluctuations on S @xmath are left massless on\nthe classical level. Therefore, if we consider low energetic\nfluctuations of the folded string in AdS, they will be described by the\nfluctuations on S @xmath , i.e. by the O(6) sigma model. The other\nmassive fluctuations serve as a cutoff for such low energy description.\n\nOn the quantum level the O(6) sigma model acquires a new mass scale via\nthe mechanism of the dimensional transmutation. The mass of the\nparticles can be given through the \u2019t Hooft coupling constant which in\nthe quasiclassical approximation coincides with the coupling constant of\nO(6) sigma model:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.59)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe power @xmath and the exponential factor are defined through the beta\nfunction of the sigma model (see chapter 9 ). The constant @xmath is not\nuniversal and depends on how the O(6) sigma model is embedded in the\nwhole string sigma model.\n\nThe strong coupling and the large @xmath regime with @xmath is described\nby the @xmath sigma model in the presence of the chemical potential\nwhich creates a finite density of particles (proportional to @xmath )\nwith rapidities on an interval @xmath . The boundary of the interval\n@xmath is a function @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWhen @xmath becomes of order of @xmath , we reach the cutoff where the\n@xmath sigma model is no more appropriate. At larger energies we have to\ndeal with the full spectrum of the string sigma model.\n\nThe @xmath sigma model is the theory with a non-zero beta function which\nallows in fact to have the parameter of dimensional transmutation ( 5.59\n). From the other side, the parameter ( 5.59 ) is defined in terms of\nthe \u2019t Hooft coupling constant which has a vanishing beta function. This\nseeming contradiction is resolved in the following way. We consider a\nsystem which depends on three parameters: @xmath , and @xmath . In the\nregime when the @xmath sigma model is applicable, it sufficient to have\ntwo parameters: @xmath and @xmath . The reason why we multiplied by\n@xmath is the following: if we normalize the worldsheet volume to some\nconstant, the mass of AdS excitations will scale as @xmath at large\n@xmath . Therefore @xmath serves effectively as a mass scale. If we\nsimultaneously change @xmath and @xmath (keeping @xmath constant) in a\nway that @xmath do not change, then the physics of the @xmath sigma\nmodel will not change. We see that effectively @xmath runs with @xmath ,\nand ( 5.59 ) reflects the nontrivial beta-function of this dependence.\n\nThe BES\/FRS equation in the Alday-Maldacena regime was investigated in [\n34 , 35 , 36 ] . In [ 34 ] Basso and Korchemsky derived the integral\nequation for the @xmath sigma model from the BES\/FRS equation. They also\nderived the proper expression ( 5.59 ) for the mass scale and the\nexplicit value of the coefficient @xmath . In [ 210 ] , [ 35 , 36 ] a\nnumerical evidence for the presence of the mass scale ( 5.59 ) was\ngiven. In subsection 8.3 we will give an alternative derivation of the\nintegral equation for the @xmath sigma model however without the\nderivation of the coefficient @xmath .\n\n#### 5.5 Summary\n\nThe AdS\/CFT correspondence gives an explicit realization of long\nstanding attempts to formulate duality between gauge and string\ntheories. Despite its strong\/weak coupling type, the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence can be directly verified, at least on the level of the\nspectral problem, using the integrability technique. The problem of\ndiagonalization of the dilatation operator is shown to be equivalent to\nthe problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of a certain spin\nchain conjectured to be integrable. This problem is solved using the\nbootstrap approach analogical to the one proposed by Zamolodchikov and\nZamolodchikov. The approach is based on the assumption of the factorized\nscattering which allows to express all the processes in terms of the\ntwo-particle S-matrix. The two-particle S-matrix can be uniquely fixed\nby symmetry, unitarity, crossing, and an assumption about the particle\ncontent \u00b9\u00b9 \u00b9\u00b9 11 As we discuss in the next chapter, a strange feature of\nthe @xmath algebra allows to fix the S-matrix even without using of\nYang-Baxter equation. . The asymptotic Bethe Ansatz which can be derived\nonce the scattering matrix is known gives a possibility to explicitly\nverify the integrability conjecture by comparison of the Bethe Ansatz\nresults with perturbative calculations on both sides of the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence. In this chapter we discussed checks that are based on\nthe consideration of such objects as single-particle excitations\n(magnons), folded and spinning strings, operators with logarithmic\nscaling of energy. The verifications of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz are\ndone today up to four loops on the gauge side and up to two loops on the\nstring side. Based on the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz, which we did not\ndiscuss here, recently even five-loop check of integrability was done.\nThese results provide a strong evidence that the AdS\/CFT system is\nindeed integrable.\n\nThe properties of operators with logarithmic scaling of energy was a\nsubject of our work. We will present the details of our calculations in\nchapters 7 and 8 . Before this, in chapter 6 we discuss in details the\nderivation and main properties of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.\n\n### Chapter 6 Bootstrap approach and asymptotic Bethe Ansatz\n\nIn this chapter we discuss the derivation of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz\nof the AdS\/CFT integrable system. The derivation is based on\ndetermination of the scattering matrix using the symmetry constraints\nand then application of the nested or algebraic Bethe Ansatz procedure.\nTechnically the scattering matrix is found based on the arguments\nsimilar to those of Zamolodchikov and Zamolodchikov [ 7 ] for\nrelativistic systems. However, the AdS\/CFT scattering matrix has a\ndifferent physical interpretation. While the approach of [ 7 ] deals\nwith the excitations over the true vacuum of the theory, in the AdS\/CFT\ncase we consider excitations over the BMN state @xmath which is more\nlikely as a pseudovacuum of the XXX spin chain.\n\nThe BMN state @xmath is invariant under the psu(2 @xmath 2) @xmath\nsubalgebra of the whole psu(2,2 @xmath 4) symmetry of the system [ 113 ]\n. The generator of the central extension of this subalgebra is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn the Bethe Ansatz description an excitation of @xmath is seen as the\nstate composed from a fixed number of magnons (see section 1.1 ). Far\nfrom the collision point a single magnon is given by a plane wave:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n                       @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.2)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nHere @xmath stands for a type of a magnon.\n\nAlthough an excitation over the BMN state should be covariant under the\naction of psu(2 @xmath 2) @xmath , a single magnon does not have this\nproperty. The symmetry algebra closes when acting on the one magnon\nconfiguration only for the case @xmath .\n\nIt was suggested in [ 9 ] that we should extend the symmetry algebra\nwith two additional central charges to get a closed action on ( 6 ).\nThen a symmetry algebra which allows us to study a magnon scattering is\npsu(2 @xmath 2) @xmath . The appearance of two additional central\ncharges was confirmed from the string theory perspective [ 211 ] . From\nthe point of view of the gauge theory such analysis was not done.\nThough, the idea of central extension leads to simple and\nself-consistent explanations for many properties of the AdS\/CFT system.\nThis makes it hard to doubt in the correctness of the suggestion.\n\nWe see that it is logical to start discussion by reviewing the basic\nproperties of the centrally extended @xmath algebra and its\nrepresentations. After that we come back to the discussion of the\nmagnons and their scattering and give the expression for the scattering\nmatrix up to an overall scalar factor. These topics are the subject of\nthe section 6.1 in which we follow closely the ideas of [ 8 , 9 , 165 ]\n\u00b9 \u00b9 1 Mostly a gauge theory point of view on the scattering is discussed\nhere. A complementary approach based on a Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra\nand more natural for the string theory is given in [ 15 ] . . In section\n6.2 we formulate the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz proposed in [ 11 ] and\nderived in [ 9 , 166 , 212 ] . Then in section 6.3 we formulate the\ncrossing equations (based on [ 16 ] , see also [ 15 ] ) on the overall\nscalar factor of the S-matrix, explicitly solve them, and formulate a\nsufficient set of conditions that uniquely fix the solution. The\npresented solution of the crossing equations is based on [ V3 ] . The\nresulting expression for the scalar factor was initially proposed in [\n20 , 22 ] and then checked to solve the crossing equations in [ 213 ] .\nWe finish this chapter with section 6.4 where is given, based on Cauchy\ntype integral operators, a shorthand notation for the Bethe equations\nand following from them in a thermodynamic limit functional equations.\n\n#### 6.1 Scattering matrix from symmetry constraints\n\n##### 6.1.1 @xmath algebra\n\nWe will start from the @xmath algebra with one central charge. This is\njust an @xmath algebra.\n\nTo describe the structure of @xmath algebra it is instructive to\nconsider its four-dimensional representation. The vector space of this\nrepresentation is a direct sum @xmath of two-dimensional spaces: @xmath\nwith even grading and @xmath with odd grading. The @xmath generators can\nbe combined in the following block matrix:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIf to denote the basis of @xmath by @xmath and the basis of @xmath by\n@xmath then the action of the generators is the following:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.4)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nThe explicit action of @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nCommutation relations in the algebra are described as follows. @xmath\nand @xmath form the @xmath bosonic subgroup and act on @xmath by the\nfundamental representation for the correspondent index. The nonzero\ncommutator \u00b2 \u00b2 2 When dealing with superalgebras, by commutator we\nalways understand the graded commutator. between the fermionic\ngenerators is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the central charge @xmath equals @xmath for the four-dimensional\nrepresentation. Abstract definition of @xmath has no restriction on\n@xmath . For arbitrary value of @xmath the minimal dimension of the\nrepresentation is @xmath . The condition @xmath is also called a\nshortening condition since the four-dimensional representation has a\nsmaller dimension than the minimal possible dimension for arbitrary\n@xmath .\n\nAn exceptional feature of the @xmath algebra is that its central\nextension has two central charges in addition to @xmath , therefore a\ncomplete centrally extended @xmath algebra is @xmath . The centrally\nextended algebra possesses @xmath group of external automorphisms. These\nfeatures are due to the fact that there exists an antisymmetric\ninvariant bilinear form @xmath which allows raising and lowering of\nindexes. Due to this the adjoint actions of the bosonic subalgebra\n@xmath on @xmath and on @xmath are equivalent. To fix the notation we\ndefine\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nLet us introduce\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThen the commutation relations of the fermionic generators are given by\n\u00b3 \u00b3 3 This form of the commutator is related to the fact that the\ncentrally extended @xmath can be viewed as a @xmath limit of the\nexceptional Lie superalgebra @xmath . The latter has @xmath bosonic\nsubalgebra. The generators of the bosonic subalgebra are identified with\n@xmath and @xmath . Fermionic subspace is spanned by @xmath . Adjoint\naction of @xmath and @xmath on @xmath -s is given by the fundamental\nrepresentation related respectively to @xmath and @xmath indices. The\ncommutator of @xmath -s is given by\n\n@xmath (6.9)\n\nFor generic @xmath the generators @xmath do not commute with each other.\nBut they do in the limit @xmath . In this limit we recover ( 6.10 ) from\n( 6.9 ).\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n@xmath is a symmetric matrix of central charges. @xmath . In the\nnotations of [ 9 ] @xmath and @xmath .\n\nThe @xmath outer automorphisms rotate the third index of @xmath . The\nmatrix @xmath form a symmetric three-dimensional representation of the\nexternal @xmath group with an invariant @xmath .\n\nThe existence of a four dimensional representation is possible if a\nshortening condition @xmath is satisfied. We will denote such\nrepresentation by @xmath .\n\nFor @xmath the four dimensional representation is not faithful since\n@xmath . The faithful representation with nonzero central charges is\ninfinite dimensional. The faithful infinite dimensional representation\nis important for identification of the scattering matrix. Therefore we\nwill now discuss this representation.\n\nThe basis in the vector space of the faithful representation is chosen\nto be the following: @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath is integer. The\nbosonic generators @xmath and @xmath do not act on @xmath . They act on\n@xmath and @xmath according to ( 6.1.1 ).\n\nThe action of the other generators is the following\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.11)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.12)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is either @xmath or @xmath .\n\nThe closure of the commutation relations requires that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe case ( 6.1.1 ) corresponds to @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . If we\nreduce the representation to four dimensions by identifying @xmath , it\nis easy to see that ( 6.13 ) is equivalent to the shortening condition\n@xmath .\n\n##### 6.1.2 Action of the algebra on 1-particle and two particle states\n\nAccording to the nested Bethe Ansatz construction which was explained in\nthe first chapter, a generic one-particle state is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                       @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.14)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe action of the symmetry algebra on this state is given by ( 6.1.1 )\nif to identify the field @xmath with the markers @xmath in ( 6.1.1 ) and\nthe field @xmath with @xmath or @xmath [ 165 ] . Notice an unusual\nproperty of the symmetry algebra: its action changes the length of the\nspin chain.\n\nIn the basis @xmath the representation ( 6.1.1 ) rearranges into\nfour-dimensional blocks. The action of the generators on @xmath is the\nsame as in ( 6.1.1 ) except for the replacements:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe second replacement plays an important role for the case of two and\nmore particles and in particular leads to a nontrivial coproduct\nstructure. Indeed, a generic two-particle state can be written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                       @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.16)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAs a consequence, the action of the generators that change the number of\n@xmath -s contain an additional factor @xmath . In particular, the\nco-product of @xmath is given by [ 214 , 9 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo put the coproduct in the symmetric form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\none should impose\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are two arbitrary parameters.\n\nWe see that the representation becomes dependent on the momentum @xmath\nof the particle.\n\nEquivalently, the action of @xmath is given by @xmath . From the\nshortening condition we obtain the expression for C:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn view of ( 6.1 ) and ( 5.14 ), the energy of the magnon should be\nidentified with @xmath . Therefore ( 6.21 ) can be seen as the\ndispersion relation.\n\nThe constant @xmath cannot be fixed using the properties of the @xmath\nalgebra. However, the dispersion relation ( 6.21 ) was derived in [ 10 ]\nusing a different approach. Based on [ 10 ] it is possible to identify\n@xmath with the coupling @xmath defined by ( 5.11 ).\n\n###### Parametrization.\n\nUsing rescaling of basis vectors in ( 6.1.1 ) we can always adjust the\nconstants @xmath to fulfill the following two criteria. First, we demand\nthat @xmath . We can even put @xmath , however for the reasons explained\nbelow @xmath should be kept explicitly. Second, we demand @xmath . Using\nthese restrictions, the constants @xmath are uniquely parameterized as:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.22)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe parameter @xmath is fixed by the shortening condition ( 6.13 ) which\nimplies\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe should choose the solution with the property: @xmath when @xmath .\n\nWe see that the representation is uniquely defined by the momentum of\nthe particle @xmath and the coupling constant @xmath .\n\n###### Hopf algebra picture.\n\nIn the Hopf algebra picture, proposed for the AdS\/CFT scattering matrix\nin [ 214 ] , for each particle with momentum @xmath we associate the\nrepresentation @xmath with the coefficients @xmath given by ( 6.22 ).\nThe coefficient @xmath should be equal for all particles and may be put\nto @xmath .\n\nThe coproduct is nontrivial for @xmath and is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.24)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe two-particle wave function is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath -matrix should satisfy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this notation @xmath matrix acts on two @xmath -dimensional\nrepresentations:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n###### Twisted picture\n\nThe Hopf product becomes the standard one if we redefine the value of\n@xmath . Before scattering we will put @xmath and @xmath . After\nscattering it will be opposite @xmath , @xmath . In this picture the\n@xmath -matrix is invariant under the standard coproduct:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nbut the representations of the particles before scattering are different\nfrom the representations of the particles after scattering:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.29)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n##### 6.1.3 Zhukovsky parameterization\n\nLet us introduce two parameters @xmath and @xmath defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe shortening condition ( 6.23 ) is then expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis equation defines an algebraic curve which is a torus. A useful\nparameterization, not uniform however, for the torus is given in terms\nof the parameter @xmath defined by:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us define the Zhukovsky map @xmath by the relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen the parameters @xmath and @xmath are the double-valued functions of\n@xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nA choice of the branches of these functions is constrained by the demand\nthat the @xmath limit should be smooth. If momentum of the particle is\nreal at all values of the coupling constant then smooth @xmath limit\nimplies that @xmath . The region defined by @xmath is usually called the\nphysical region.\n\nThe parameter @xmath is an equivalent of the rapidity in the Heisenberg\nferromagnet and for @xmath coincides with it. Let us show the\ncoincidence on the example of the energy:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the limit @xmath we get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is a correct expression for the energy of the XXX magnon ( 1.19 ).\n\n##### 6.1.4 Scattering matrix\n\nWhen central charges do not obey any shortening condition, a minimal\ndimension of an irrep of @xmath algebra is @xmath . In general position\nthe three central charges of the tensor product of two short irreps do\nnot obey a shortening condition. Therefore the tensor product of two\nfour-dimensional representations of the @xmath algebra is in general\nposition an irreducible representation. Thus the @xmath -matrix can be\nfixed up to a scalar factor from symmetry constraints.\n\nThe matrix elements of scattering matrix obtained in Hopf algebra\nformulation differ from those obtained in twisted picture by a phase.\nThis is due to the different choice of the parameter @xmath and\ntherefore a basis redefinition. Different choices of @xmath distinguish\n@xmath -matrix obtained from the Hopf algebra formulation, @xmath\n-matrix obtained from a Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra [ 15 ] , and\n@xmath -matrix of the Hubbard model [ 166 ] . In the following we deal\nwith the @xmath -matrix which is used for construction of a wave\nfunction 6.25 .\n\nThe structure of the @xmath -matrix is quite involved. It can be found\nin the original work of Beisert [ 165 ] . Here we will give the @xmath\ninvariant formulation of the scattering matrix presented in [ 165 ] .\n\nThe infinite dimension representation ( 6.1.1 ) is decomposed into\nfour-dimensional blocks if we consider the action of the @xmath\nsubalgebra. This subalgebra is constructed from the generators @xmath\nand the central charge @xmath . The commutation relations of @xmath\nalgebra are recovered after the following identification with the\ngenerators of Sec. 4.1 :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath                        (6.38)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe subspace @xmath is invariant under the action of the @xmath\nsubalgebra and forms the typical irrep @xmath with @xmath . The tensor\nproduct of two such irreps of @xmath is decomposed into direct sum of\nthree representations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nof dimension @xmath , 8, and 4 respectively.\n\nThe scattering matrix is given by the sum of the projectors on these\nrepresentations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe scattering matrix has two special points. When @xmath , the\nscattering matrix reduces to the @xmath . When @xmath the scattering\nmatrix reduces to @xmath . These properties of the scattering matrix\nallow performing the fusion procedure as it was in the case of rational\nR-matrices. In particular, the transfer matrices constructed from fused\n@xmath satisfy Hirota equation as a function of @xmath on a fat hook\nshape of @xmath algebra.\n\n#### 6.2 Beisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz\n\nThe asymptotic Bethe Ansatz was proposed by Beisert and Staudacher [ 11\n] before the full factorized @xmath -matrix was found. Later it was\nrigorously derived based on the knowledge of the @xmath -matrix ( 6.40 )\nand using the coordinate nested Bethe Ansatz [ 9 , 212 ] and the\nalgebraic Bethe Ansatz [ 166 ] . It is given by the following set of\nequations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n                       @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.41)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe notations here are the following:\n\n1.  The parameter @xmath , @xmath counts the number of Bethe roots of\n    the @xmath -th type.\n\n    The relation between @xmath , @xmath and the charges @xmath , @xmath\n    defined by ( 5.28 ) is given by the following formulas:\n\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.42)\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n2.  The functions @xmath , @xmath are defined through the Zhukovsky map\n    by\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (6.43)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    supplemented by the condition @xmath . This condition is natural for\n    the central roots @xmath since the energy is expressed through this\n    roots by\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (6.44)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    and it should have a proper @xmath limit. However, the condition\n    @xmath is somehow artificial for the Bethe roots of type @xmath .\n    Indeed, up to the replacement @xmath the first equation coincides\n    with the third one. Therefore it is possible to unite the equations\n    for the roots of type @xmath and @xmath into one if to not impose\n    constraints on the choice of the branch for @xmath . The same is\n    true for the roots of type @xmath and @xmath .\n\n3.  The Bethe equations describe the spectrum of the single trace\n    operators. Since the shift of all nodes by one does not change the\n    single trace operator due to the cyclicity of the trace, the overall\n    momentum of the spin chain should obey a constraint\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (6.45)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n4.  The factor @xmath was introduced in [ 42 ] . It is equal to @xmath\n    when the fermionic excitations obey periodic boundary conditions and\n    to @xmath when the boundary conditions are antiperiodic. For the\n    AdS\/CFT case the boundary conditions are such that\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (6.46)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    We could in principle cancel out the factor @xmath and the terms\n    @xmath in the Bethe Ansatz. However we do not make this cancelation\n    since the Bethe Ansatz equations in the form ( 6.41 ) are valid even\n    if the condition ( 6.45 ) is not satisfied.\n\n5.  The explicit form of the scalar factor @xmath will be given in the\n    next section after the crossing equations that determine @xmath are\n    solved.\n\nTo finish the description of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz a map between\nthe configuration of Bethe roots and single trace operators should be\ngiven. A graphical answer to this question is presented in Fig.1 of [\n215 ] . Here we will focus on the two simplest examples discussed in the\nprevious chapter: @xmath and @xmath sectors of the theory.\n\nThe @xmath sector is spanned by the operators ( 5.16 ). This sector is\ndescribed by the Bethe equations ( 5.23 ) which are recovered from (\n6.41 ) by putting @xmath . Number @xmath of fields @xmath is equal to\n@xmath , number of fields @xmath is equal to @xmath , @xmath .\n\nThe @xmath sector is spanned by the operators of type ( 5.18 ). In this\ncase the length of the spin chain is equal to the number of the fields\n@xmath , @xmath . Number of covariant derivatives acting on one field\n@xmath is interpreted as the number of excitation of the corresponding\nnode. Each covariant derivative corresponds to a complex \u2074 \u2074 4 This\ncomplex is not a string-like configuration. All Bethe roots are real. of\nthree Bethe roots: one bosonic root of type @xmath , one fermionic root\nof type @xmath , and one fermionic root of type @xmath . Therefore the\ntotal number @xmath of excitations is equal to @xmath , the parameters\n@xmath are equal to zero. In view of ( 6.42 ) the AdS charge @xmath is\nequal to @xmath .\n\nInstead of writing three types of Bethe equations for three types of\nBethe roots it is possible to perform a duality transformation on the\nfermionic roots and get only one type of Bethe equations. For @xmath it\nis the same duality transformation that was discussed in section 4.4 .\nIts generalization exists for the case @xmath [ 9 ] . We depicted in\nFig. 6.3 the Dynkin diagrams which correspond to the Bethe equations (\n6.41 ) and dual transformed Bethe equations.\n\nAfter the duality transformation the @xmath sector is described by the\nfollowing set of Bethe equations:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 6.3 Crossing equations\n\n##### 6.3.1 Sketch of derivation\n\nThe scalar factor @xmath which appears in the Beisert-Staudacher\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz cannot be fixed from the continuous symmetries\nof the system. The same situation happens in the bootstrap approach for\nthe relativistic theories (see chapter 2 ). However, in relativistic\ntheories there are also discrete symmetries which lead to the existence\nof antiparticles. From these symmetries additional functional equations\n(crossing equations) on the scattering matrix can be derived. These\nequations together with an assumption on the physical spectrum of the\ntheory and unitarity condition unambiguously fix the scalar factor [ 7 ]\n.\n\nAlthough the light-cone quantized string theory is not relativistically\ninvariant and the presence of discrete symmetries is not evident, it was\nargued by Janik [ 16 ] that one can hope to have a kind of the crossing\nequations on the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ). Janik derived such crossing\nequations assuming that, written in a general algebraic form, they are\nthe same as the ones for the relativistic theories. This general form is\nthe following \u2075 \u2075 5 Strictly speaking, ( 6.48 ) is not the crossing\nequations used in a relativistic theory. Equation ( 6.48 ) is derived\nfrom the crossing equations and the unitarity condition. :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath , @xmath is a symmetry algebra, and @xmath is the\nantihomomorphism of the symmetry algebra.\n\nOn the level of the representation @xmath , the action of the antipode\n@xmath on an arbitrary generator @xmath is realized as:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.49)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a representation (for anitparticles) which is in general\ndifferent from @xmath , @xmath is a charge conjugation (intertwining)\nmatrix and @xmath means supertransposition \u2076 \u2076 6 we need to perform\ntransposition since @xmath is an antihomomorphism. .\n\nFor the case of the @xmath @xmath -matrix ( 6.40 ) the representation\n@xmath is the four dimensional representation of the centrally extended\n@xmath algebra defined by the parameters @xmath .\n\nThe equation ( 6.48 ), realized on the representation @xmath , is a\nmatrix equation on the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ) in which only a single\nscalar factor is not fixed. The demand that this equation holds fixes\nunambiguously @xmath and @xmath . This was done in [ 16 ] under the\ncondition that @xmath .\n\nThe representation @xmath is parameterized by @xmath which are related\nto @xmath of @xmath via the substitution\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis substitution leads to the change of sign for the energy and the\nmomentum. Note that the representation @xmath is not contained in any\ntensor product of @xmath . Therefore the antiparticles are not\nexcitations of the asymptotic spin chain. This is an important\ndifference with compact representations in the nonsupersymmetric case.\nThis difference was discussed in chapter 4 .\n\nThe existence of @xmath and @xmath consistent with ( 6.48 ) is a\nnontrivial fact which supports the conjecture of the existence of the\ncrossing equations for the scattering matrix ( 6.40 ). After\nidentification of @xmath and @xmath the crossing equations lead to the\nfollowing equation on the scalar factor @xmath in ( 6.41 ) [ 16 , 216 ]\n:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.51)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us explain the meaning of the superscript @xmath . We consider the\ndressing factor @xmath as a multivalued function of @xmath . The\nspectral parameter @xmath defines @xmath , and therefore the parameters\n@xmath of the representation, by the relation @xmath (see ( 6.34 )). The\nsuperscript @xmath means that the first particle in the @xmath -matrix\nshould be in the @xmath representation, i.e. we should use the\nreplacement ( 6.50 ). This replacement is realized as the analytical\ncontinuation of @xmath along the contour @xmath in the @xmath -plane \u2077 \u2077\n7 The monodromy over @xmath also leads to ( 6.50 ). But the solution of\ncrossing equation with such monodromy seems to be pathological if one\nrequires analytical properties of the dressing factor natural for the\nphysical theory. The situation is opposite in the mirror theory. If to\nrequire analytical properties of the scattering matrix natural for the\nmirror theory, the crossing equation with the monodromy over @xmath is\nthe right one. Its solution is the \u201dimproved\u201d dressing phase of [ 213 ]\nas we discuss in appendix C . . This contour is depicted in Fig. 6.4 .\nIt encircles the branch points @xmath . The dressing factor @xmath has a\nnontrivial monodromy along the contour @xmath as it is seen from the\nequations ( 6.51 ).\n\nIn principle, it is possible to resolve both branch cuts @xmath and\n@xmath using an elliptic parameterization [ 16 ] . In terms of the\nelliptic variable @xmath used in [ KSV1 ] and related to the one of [ 16\n] by a Gauss-Landen transformation the crossing transformation is given\nby @xmath . However, as we will see below, the dressing phase has not\ntwo but infinitely many cuts. Therefore the elliptic parameterization\nfor the dressing phase is not very useful. We will not use the elliptic\nparameterization in this work.\n\n##### 6.3.2 Solution\n\nOne can show that the solution of the crossing equation can be fixed\nuniquely by the following set of requirements on its analytical\nstructure [ V3 ] :\n\n-   @xmath can be represented in the following form [ 17 , 216 ] :\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (6.52)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    where @xmath is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of\n    variables: @xmath .\n\n    In the following we will use the functions @xmath and @xmath defined\n    by\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (6.53)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n-   @xmath is an analytic single-valued function for the physical domain\n    @xmath . This domain is the analog of the physical strip @xmath in\n    relativistic models. The condition of analyticity can be seen as the\n    minimality condition.\n\n-   @xmath as a function of @xmath does not have branch points except\n    those that are explicitly required by the crossing equation. The\n    required branch points are of the square root type. This is a\n    condition of compatibility of the analytical structure of the\n    dressing phase and analytical structure of the Bethe equations. It\n    can be compared with demand for the S-matrix in relativistic\n    theories to be meromorphic function of the rapidity variable @xmath\n    .\n\n-   @xmath for @xmath . This asymptotics is compatible with the\n    asymptotics of the strong coupling expansion of the dressing phase\n    which is known from string theory calculations.\n\nTo solve the crossing equation let us first understand how the contour\n@xmath looks like in the @xmath plane for the functions @xmath and\n@xmath . This contour is shown if Fig. 6.5 .\n\nSince @xmath may not be single-valued in the domain @xmath , it may\nhappen (and it does) that @xmath as a function of @xmath and @xmath as a\nfunction of @xmath after the continuation @xmath are on different\nRiemann sheets of the @xmath plane. To avoid this problem we\nanalytically continue the crossing equation ( 6.51 ) along the path\n@xmath , shown in Fig. 6.4 and Fig. 6.5 .\n\nThe crossing equation at the point @xmath is written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.54)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath means the analytical continuation of @xmath from the point\n@xmath to the point @xmath via the path @xmath .\n\nThe r.h.s. of ( 6.54 ) was obtained with the help of the property\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAt the point @xmath , in contradistinction to the point @xmath , we are\nallowed to write:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAll four functions @xmath which are used in ( 6.56 ) are on the same\nRiemann sheet of the @xmath plane.\n\nWe can write ( 6.54 ) in terms of the shift operator as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.57)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe shift operator @xmath is not well defined inside the strip @xmath\nsince we can cross the cut of @xmath and go to another sheet. To avoid\nthis ambiguity, we will consider the crossing equation ( 6.57 ) outside\nthis strip, solve it, and then analytically continue the solution.\n\nThe function @xmath as a function of @xmath does not have a branch cut\n@xmath . A solution of ( 6.57 ) with this property is given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nStrictly speaking, this expression should be regularized to have a\nprecise meaning. However, the regulating terms will cancel for the\ncomplete dressing factor @xmath .\n\nThe expression ( 6.3.2 ) can be further simplified if we use the\nfunctions @xmath and the relation @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe multiplier @xmath does not contribute to ( 6.3.2 ). It is needed for\nthe consistency with the antisymmetry of @xmath with respect to\ninterchange @xmath . Indeed, a direct calculation shows that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (6.59)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhose logarithm is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath as it should.\n\nBy taking the logarithm of ( 6.3.2 ) we get a simple Riemann-Hilbert\nproblem which is solved by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith the kernel @xmath defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.61)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe kernel @xmath is constructed to satisfy the following equation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.62)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe subscripts @xmath and @xmath in ( 6.60 ) refer to action of @xmath\non @xmath and @xmath variables respectively.\n\nThis solution was chosen among the other possible solutions by the\nrequirement that @xmath should be analytic for @xmath and @xmath . The\nkernel @xmath appears also in the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. We will\ndiscuss this issue in Sec. 6.4 .\n\nThe expression ( 6.60 ) can be rewritten in the form proposed by Dorey,\nHofman, and Maldacena [ 217 ] if we rewrite the action of the kernel\n@xmath as the integral in the Zhukovsky plane\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.63)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand note that the second term does not contribute to the dressing phase.\n\n##### 6.3.3 Analytical structure of the dressing factor\n\nWe will discuss now the analytical structure of the factor @xmath as a\nfunction of @xmath . The analytical properties of the whole dressing\nfactor @xmath can be then easily derived.\n\nOn the physical sheet @xmath the function @xmath has only one square\nroot cut @xmath . Analytical structure of @xmath for @xmath can be seen\nfrom the formula ( 6.3.2 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.64)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that in this region @xmath has infinitely many cuts @xmath . In\nthe product in the l.h.s. of ( 6.64 ) the branches for @xmath are chosen\nin a way that @xmath .\n\nIf we analytically continue @xmath through one of the cuts @xmath we\nwill arrive at a new Riemann sheet (the third one in Fig. 6.6 ) which\ncontains, at the position @xmath , pole if @xmath or zero if @xmath .\nThis pole\/zero was first observed in [ 217 ] . It was shown there that\nit does not correspond to any bound state but is due to the specific\nproperties of Feynman diagrams in two-dimensional theories.\n\n#### 6.4 The kernel @xmath and a shorthand notation for the Bethe\nequations\n\nThe kernels @xmath that had appeared in the derivation of the dressing\nphase appear also explicitly in the context of the Bethe Ansatz\nequations. Indeed, one can directly check that \u2078 \u2078 8 A standard choice\nof branches is assumed in ( 6.65 ) for the region @xmath , then\nanalytical continuation is performed.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.65)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore we get a shorthand notation for the building blocks of the\nBethe equations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.66)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing the property ( 6.65 ) and the representation for gamma functions\nused in ( 6.3.2 ) one can show that the dressing factor can be\nrepresented in the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.67)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere both the kernel @xmath and @xmath -operator act on @xmath\nvariable.\n\nWe should admit that in ( 6.66 ) and ( 6.67 ) we used the shift operator\nin the sense\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.68)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthat is without performing analytical continuation. In opposite, in such\nformulas as ( 3.16 ) we used the shift operator in the sense of\nanalytical continuation. To avoid ambiguity, the following two rules of\nwriting and interpreting formulas are applied. First, an expression if\npossible should be considered in a region where there is no ambiguity\nbetween two interpretations of the shift operator. For instance in the\ncase ( 3.16 ) the equation should be defined in the region @xmath , then\nit may be analytically continued. Second, if we cannot reach a region\nwithout ambiguities (for example we are required to stay on the real\naxis) then expression @xmath is understood in the sense ( 6.68 ). To\nexplicit the case of analytical continuation we use the notation @xmath\nor @xmath , where @xmath corresponds to the analytic continuation from\nabove the cut and @xmath corresponds to the analytic continuation from\nbelow the cut. As an example see ( 9.20 ) and ( 8.31 ).\n\nTaking into account the remarks about the sense of ( 6.66 ) and ( 6.67\n), we can write down the Bethe Ansatz equations ( 6.41 ) in a shorthand\nway. For this we introduce seven Baxter polynomials\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.69)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe Bethe equations ( 6.41 ) will take the following form:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n                       @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.70)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe given notation is a generalization of ( 1.58 ), however without\nintroducing string configurations. In the limit @xmath we have also\n@xmath and ( 1.58 ) is recovered from ( 6.70 ).\n\nWe see that the Bethe equations ( 6.41 ) can be expressed through the\nBaxter polynomials in the power of an operator which is a rational\ncombination of @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . To compare, analogical\noperator in the case of spin chain contains polynomial combination of\n@xmath and @xmath and in the case of relativistic integrable models -\nrational combination of @xmath and @xmath .\n\n#### 6.5 The kernel @xmath and functional equations.\n\nWhen we pass to the integral equations we should take logarithm and then\nderivative of the Bethe equations. For this purpose it is useful to\nintroduce the kernel @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.71)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe function @xmath also satisfies ( 6.62 ). The relation between the\nkernels @xmath and @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.72)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIndeed, using ( 6.63 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.73)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore for example:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.74)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us see how we can use the shorthand notations to derive a functional\nequation on the resolvent of Bethe roots from ( 6.47 ) in the large\n@xmath limit. By taking the logarithm of ( 6.47 ) we get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.75)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the derivative of @xmath can be read from ( 6.5 ).\n\nNow we use the fact that in the large @xmath limit the approximation\n@xmath is valid. Here\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.76)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis the density of particles and @xmath is the density of holes (in the\n@xmath case holes are zeroes of the transfer matrix, see Sec. 7.2 ). We\ncan introduce the resolvent for the density of holes by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.77)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen, in the large @xmath limit the derivative of ( 6.75 ) is written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (6.78)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis equation can be written in the form @xmath , where the function\n@xmath is analytic in the upper half plane and the function @xmath is\nanalytic in the lower half plane \u2079 \u2079 9 Here we basically give a\nvariation of the procedure of holomorphic projection explained in Sec.\n3.1 . . Therefore @xmath . We therefore obtain an equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.79)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is valid in the upper half plane. Equation in the lower half plane\ncan be obtained from ( 6.79 ) by replacement @xmath .\n\nEquation ( 6.79 ) is almost a BES\/FRS equation [ 21 , 24 ] which we\ndiscuss in chapter 8 . To obtain the BES\/FRS equation we still have to\nperform a proper scaling of the resolvents as discussed in section 7.3 .\n\nIf the resolvent admit some parity properties, ( 6.79 ) can be slightly\nsimplified. Let us decompose the resolvent into the symmetric and\nantisymmetric parts: @xmath . The parity of the resolvent is opposite to\nthe parity of the density.\n\nWe use\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe kernels @xmath first appeared in [ KSV2 ] where they were derived\nusing analytical transformations of the inverse Fourier transform of\n@xmath and @xmath of [ 21 ] .\n\nUsing ( 6.5 ) we can rewrite ( 6.79 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.81)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the case of an even density distribution ( @xmath ) we get the\nBES\/FRS equation, up to a proper rescaling of the resolvents, in the\nform used in [ V1 ] .\n\n## Part III Functional form of integral Bethe Ansatz equations\n\nIn order to compare the prediction of the Bethe Ansatz equations for the\nspectrum of the system with the field theoretical prediction one should\noften consider the thermodynamical limit in which the Bethe Ansatz\nequations reduce to the integral equation on the density of roots.\nTherefore it is important to be able to solve these integral equations.\n\nIn the simplest case the equations can be solved using the Fourier\ntransform. For example such is the equation which describes the density\nof roots of the state that corresponds to the antiferromagnetic vacuum\nof the XXX spin chain:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.82)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe solution of this equation is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.83)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the first part of this thesis we discussed a slightly different\napproach which allows solving such equations. If we introduce the\nresolvent\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.84)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand integrate ( 6.82 ) with a Cauchy kernel @xmath , then we will get\nthe functional equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.85)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand a complex conjugated equation for @xmath . This functional equation\ncan be solved for @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.86)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen the density function will be given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.87)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nComparing position of poles and the residues for ( 6.83 ) and ( 6.87 )\nwe conclude that ( 6.83 ) and ( 6.87 ) are equal.\n\nA more complicated case is when the density of Bethe roots is defined on\na compact support. For example, for the SU(2) XXX spin chain in the case\nwhen the number of Bethe roots @xmath is smaller than @xmath the\nequation ( 6.82 ) is replaced by ( 6.88 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.88)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the branch point @xmath is defined by @xmath . The function @xmath\n(\u201ddensity of holes\u201d) is zero on the interval @xmath and is defined\noutside it in such a way that the equation ( 6.88 ) is valid on the\nwhole real axis.\n\nWe cannot use directly the Fourier transform for solution of the\nequation ( 6.88 ). For finite values of @xmath such equations in general\ndo not have explicit solution. However they can be solved perturbatively\nfor small and large values of @xmath .\n\nWe will consider a more interesting case of large values of @xmath . In\nthis case it is important to consider two different regimes.\n\nFirst, we can rescale our rapidity variable as @xmath and consider the\nlimit @xmath with @xmath fixed. For this scaling we can perturbatively\nexpand the shift operator as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.89)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing this expansion, we can reduce functional equations on the\nresolvents to a recursive tower of solvable Riemann-Hilbert problems.\n\nSecond, we can consider the vicinity of the branch point @xmath . For\nthis we should consider the double scaling limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.90)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this limit the equation ( 6.88 ) reduces to the integral equation on\nthe semiinfinite axis. It can be solved by a Wiener-Hopf method [ 218 ]\n. This approach was used in many applications. We can mention [ 39 , 38\n, 219 ] which are related to the integrability. We will discuss the\nsolution in the double scaling limit ( 6.90 ) in details in Sec. 7.4 .\n\nThe large @xmath and the double scaling limit of ( 6.88 ) lead to the\nequations which allow in general many solutions. Only in the leading\norder the solution can be fixed uniquely by imposing correct analytical\nproperties. We will show that in order to fix the solution in the\nsubleading orders of @xmath expansion we have to consider solutions in\nboth limits and demand their matching in the intermediate regime.\n\nThe search for the subleading orders of solutions of such equations has\na number of different motivations.\n\nIn chapter 7 we discuss the integral equation which appears in a special\nlimit of the @xmath Heisenberg ferromagnet. As we will explain, the\nfirst three orders of the large @xmath expansion has a certain interest\nfor the AdS\/CFT correspondence. The large @xmath expansion of this\nsystem was investigated numerically in [ 220 , V1 ] . Here we give an\nanalytical derivation of this expansion. We also use this derivation to\nexplain all the details of our method.\n\nIn chapter 8 we discuss the so called BES\/FRS equation [ 22 , 21 ] , [\n24 ] which appears in the context of the AdS\/CFT correspondence. The\nfirst three orders of the strong coupling expansion of this equation in\nvarious regimes are required for the comparison with the perturbative\nresults of string theory [ 186 , 187 ] . This chapter is based on the\nworks [ KSV1 , KSV2 , V1 ] .\n\nIn chapter 9 we discuss how to find the mass gap in sigma models. For\ninstance, to fix the mass gap in the @xmath sigma model [ 39 ] we need\nto find the first two (leading and subleading) orders of the large\n@xmath expansion. The higher orders allow studying the Borel summability\nproperties of the model and in this way provide a check for the\ncorrectness of the Bethe Ansatz description of the model. This chapter\nis based on the author\u2019s work [ V2 ] .\n\n### Chapter 7 @xmath Heisenberg magnet\n\n#### 7.1 Quantum mechanics reminder\n\nThe quantum mechanics of one particle is described by the Schr @xmath\ndinger equation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTo consider this equation in the quasiclassical limit it is convenient\nto introduce a new variable @xmath in which the Schr @xmath dinger\nequation reduces to the Ricatti equation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn the quasiclassical approximation which is valid for @xmath the\nsolution is simplified to @xmath . Then the wave function is given by\nthe superposition of two functions\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor @xmath one of the exponents (say the second one) is exponentially\nsuppressed. To glue solutions in two different limits one should perform\nin detail analysis in the vicinity of the turning points @xmath given by\n@xmath . This analysis leads to the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization\ncondition on the energy levels of the particle\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is a constant known as Maslow index. Its value depends on\nthe analytical properties of the potential @xmath near the turning\npoints. In particular, if it is smooth then @xmath , if it is a steep\nfunction then @xmath .\n\nThe Baxter equation ( 7.6 ) can be viewed as a discrete version of the\nSchr @xmath dinger equation. We will see below that analogs of both\nsmooth and steep potential @xmath appear in the quasiclassical solution\nof the Baxter equation.\n\n#### 7.2 Different regimes in the @xmath Heisenberg magnet\n\nThe @xmath Heisenberg magnet (with spin zero) appeared in particular in\nthe context of the integrable structures discovered in QCD [ 143 , 144 ,\n145 , 221 ] . It was intensively studied in [ 222 , 223 ] . In the\ncontext of the AdS\/CFT correspondence the spin 1\/2 @xmath Heisenberg\nmagnet has a particular interest. It describes the one-loop\napproximation of the @xmath subsector of the AdS\/CFT integrable system.\n\nThe Bethe equations for a spin @xmath @xmath magnet are written as\nfollows:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAll the solutions of these equations are real. The Baxter equation is\nwritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe Baxter equation has a natural parameter which is a magnitude of the\ndiscrete shift. In the normalization chosen here this scale equals one.\nWe will call it the Baxter scale.\n\nEach solution has its own internal scales given by the typical distances\nbetween the Bethe roots. It is well known that solutions organize\nthemselves into the cuts. We can distinguish two important scales: the\ndistance between the roots inside the cut ( @xmath ) and the distance\nbetween the cuts themselves ( @xmath ).\n\nIn the thermodynamical limit one typically has a small parameter which\nplays the role of @xmath . The solution is supposed to be expanded in\nperturbative series within this parameter. It is natural to assume that\nfor a sufficiently small @xmath and inside one cut the typical\ndisplacement of the Bethe roots within the change of @xmath does not\nexceed the distance between the Bethe roots. Under this assumption, the\nuniform expansion of the resolvent\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nin the parameter @xmath is possible at the distances from the cut larger\nthan @xmath .\n\nThe smallness of @xmath usually means that the parameter @xmath is\nlarge. If it so, for @xmath we have exponential suppression of the\nsecond term in the l.h.s. of ( 7.6 ). To estimate the magnitude of the\nsuppression one can approximate\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nWe see that the real part of the r.h.s. is positive. Its magnitude\ndepends on the particular limit that we consider, but at any case for\nlarge @xmath and @xmath the exponential suppression of the second term\nin the l.h.s. of ( 7.6 ) is granted. Usually the restriction on @xmath\nis weaker.\n\nUnder the assumption of the exponential suppression, the Baxter\nequations are approximated by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (7.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe equations ( 7.2 ) are equivalent to the linearized equation for the\ncounting function, see the discussion in section 3.1 .\n\nThe relation between the Baxter scale and @xmath can be different\ndepending on the limit we take.\n\nIn the case @xmath , which was studied in [ 224 ] , the typical distance\nbetween roots is much larger than the Baxter scale. Then the\napproximation ( 7.2 ) is valid only at the large distances from the real\naxis. The perturbative @xmath expansion includes performing the Taylor\nseries of the type @xmath . If we perform this expansion in ( 7.2 ) then\nin the leading order we get the equations that can be also obtained by\nthe differentiation of ( 5.47 ). This is not surprising since the limit\n@xmath is the one studied in Sec. 5.4.2 .\n\nIn order to find the corrections to ( 7.2 ) we need to study the\nvicinity of the branch point in the scaling limit which leads to the\nsolution in terms of the Airy function [ 224 ] . This type of limit is\nsimilar to the case of the quantum mechanical particle in a smooth\npotential.\n\nIn this chapter we consider another case which is analogical to the\nparticle in a steep potential. In this case the distance between the\nBethe roots is much smaller than the Baxter scale, the equations ( 7.2 )\nare valid for any value of @xmath .\n\nThis case corresponds to the limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\ninitially discussed in [ 199 ] . We use the notation of [ 24 ] .\n\nThe scaling ( 7.10 ) is possible because in the case of a noncompact\nspin chain the number of excitations @xmath can be greater than the\nlength of the spin chain @xmath .\n\n###### The root distribution near the branch cut\n\nLet us take the logarithm of the Bethe equations ( 7.5 ). We obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.11)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe equation ( ) can be interpreted as the equation for the equilibrium\nof forces in classical mechanics. For distances between the particles\nmuch larger than one, the interaction between the particles can be\napproximated with the Coulomb force @xmath . In this case the density of\nthe particles is approximated by a square root cut in the leading order\nof the large spin limit. This case is realized in the scaling limit\n@xmath .\n\nFor the scaling ( 7.10 ) we have the opposite situation: the distances\nbetween the particles with the smallest absolute values of rapidities\nare much smaller than one. The Coulomb approximation is not applicable.\nTo describe the distribution of roots in this limit it is better to\nrepresent @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIf we introduce the effective force @xmath , then for the positive roots\nequation of the equilibrium will be written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince @xmath is a smooth function, we immediately get that in the\nvicinity of the branch point\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe last estimation comes from the term @xmath which is dominant in\n@xmath for roots close to the origin. The expression ( 7.14 ) is\nconsistent with the assumption of the small distance between the roots.\nIt is valid for @xmath which is the case for any finite @xmath .\nEquidistant distribution of the roots corresponds to a branch point of\nlogarithmic type in the continuous limit.\n\n###### Functional equation in the logarithmic scaling regime (7.10).\n\nLet us introduce the resolvent for holes \u00b9 \u00b9 1 In opposite to the\ncompact case, there are no accompanying roots (in the terminology of\nSec. 1.3 ) in the r.h.s. of 7.6 . Due to this all zeroes of @xmath are\nholes. For the same reason there is no string configurations. :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTaking the derivative of the logarithm of ( 7.2 ) we get\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.16)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nWe will consider the ground state in the limit ( 7.10 ). For the ground\nstate all the holes except two are situated inside the interval @xmath [\n222 ] . The two external holes are situated at the position @xmath . All\nthe Bethe roots are situated between the interval @xmath and external\nholes\n\nLet us expand the equation ( 7.2 ) for @xmath at @xmath . We will get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nDemanding that the resolvent decreases at infinity, we get:\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (7.18)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nWe see that the external holes define the behavior of the resolvent for\nthe values of @xmath in the interval @xmath .\n\nThe energy can be calculated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt was shown in [ 199 ] that in the limit ( 7.4 ) the energy scales\nlogarithmically:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we introduced the normalization of @xmath which is used in the\nAdS\/CFT correspondence.\n\nWe see from ( 7.18 ) and ( 7.19 ) that the Bethe roots with absolute\nvalue larger than @xmath do not contribute to @xmath . Therefore we can\nconsider that the asymptotic behavior of the resolvent at infinity is\ngiven by ( 7.18 ).\n\n#### 7.3 Large @xmath solution\n\nIn view of the asymptotic behavior ( 7.18 ) it is useful to rescale the\nresolvents:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen in the scaling limit ( 7.10 ) we obtain the following functional\nequations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.22)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwith asymptotic behavior given by:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.23)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThese equations are equivalent to the linear integral equation on the\ndensity of holes used in [ 24 , 25 ] .\n\nThe scaling function @xmath can be found as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath means that we analytically continue to the point @xmath\nfrom a point @xmath which has a positive imaginary part.\n\nWe aim to solve ( 7.3 ) perturbatively for the case of large @xmath . As\nwe will see below, the position of the branch point, which we denote as\n@xmath , scales as @xmath . Therefore the typical scale for the solution\nis @xmath and the shift operator can be treated perturbatively:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us consider the equations ( 7.3 ) on the support @xmath of the\ndensity of holes. After multiplying the first one by @xmath and the\nsecond one by @xmath and taking the sum we will get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis equation can be rewritten in the following form:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.27)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nSince @xmath , ( 7.27 ) gives us the possibility to perform the\nperturbative expansion in the recursive manner. Of course, the solution\nof ( 7.27 ) is not unique. We can always add to it a solution of the\nhomogeneous equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe correct solution can be fixed from additional requirements, which we\ngive below.\n\n###### Leading and subleading orders.\n\nLet us assume the following large @xmath expansion of the resolvent:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAfter performing the change of variables @xmath , the term @xmath should\nscale as @xmath times a polynomial of @xmath .\n\nA direct calculation gives the first two orders of the perturbative\nexpansion:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe solution @xmath is obvious. For @xmath one can do a simple check:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath               (7.31)\n                          @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -- -------- --------\n\nThe last expression is nonzero only for @xmath , therefore we can\nreplace @xmath by @xmath .\n\n@xmath has the asymptotics at infinity required in ( 7.3 ). Therefore\nall the other terms in the expansion ( 7.29 ) should decrease at least\nas @xmath at infinity.\n\nThe solution of the homogeneous equation ( 7.28 ) can have singularities\nonly at @xmath . The general solution of the homogeneous equation which\ndecreases as @xmath at infinity is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe index @xmath cannot be equal @xmath , since the first order in which\n@xmath can appear is @xmath . The reason is that the expansion ( 7.29 )\nis an expansion of an integrable function, which implies that @xmath\nshould be integrable.\n\nTo relate the boundary parameter @xmath with @xmath we have to use ( 7.3\n), which for @xmath leads to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe inverse differential operator means integration. The constant of\nintegration should be fixed from the parity properties of @xmath . The\nresult for the leading order of R is:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIndeed, this function is odd if we take the cuts of the square root to\nbe @xmath which is the support of the density of roots.\n\nTo have the correct asymptotics at infinity we have to demand @xmath .\nThis relation should be corrected at the next orders of the large @xmath\nexpansion.\n\n#### 7.4 Solution in the double scaling limit\n\nStarting from @xmath we get a nontrivial contribution from ( 7.32 ) and\nthe solution of ( 7.27 ) becomes ambiguous. To fix this ambiguity, and\nthis is the key point for the perturbative solution of such kind of\nequations, we should consider the initial equations in the double\nscaling limit which is defined as follows. We introduce a new variable\n@xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand expand our equation in the powers of @xmath with @xmath fixed. We\nget the equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (7.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath has a discontinuity at @xmath , while @xmath has a\ndiscontinuity at @xmath . The weak equivalence to zero means that the\n@xmath is proportional to a function @xmath which is analytic at zero.\n\nThis equation can be solved explicitly after performing the inverse\nLaplace transform\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nWe should consider the equations ( 7.4 ) order by order in the @xmath\nexpansion. At each order the function @xmath analytic at zero is just a\npolynomial. Its inverse Laplace transform is therefore a sum of delta\nfunction at @xmath and its derivatives. This sum does not affect the\nconclusions that we will make in this section. We therefore put @xmath .\n\nLet us investigate analytic properties of the function @xmath .\n\nThe resolvent @xmath has only one branch cut on @xmath in @xmath -plane.\nTherefore the Laplace transform should be defined for @xmath . We\nanalytically continue the function @xmath to the region with @xmath by\nchanging the phase of @xmath and simultaneously rotating the contour of\nintegration of the Laplace transform such that @xmath . So, if we will\nchange @xmath in the clockwise direction, the contour of integration\nshould be rotated in the counterclockwise direction.\n\nTo get into the region @xmath the contour of integration passes through\nthe cut of @xmath . To get the analytical continuation of @xmath to the\nother Riemann sheet we use the first equation in ( 7.4 ) to reexpress\n@xmath in terms of @xmath . We see for example that when we pass through\nthe cut @xmath we encounter a branch point at @xmath .\n\nPerforming the Laplace transform of the first equation in ( 7.4 ) we see\nthat the analytical continuation of @xmath by rotation @xmath is given\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince @xmath is analytic for @xmath we deduce that @xmath should have\nzeroes for @xmath .\n\nEquivalently we can find that for @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe conclusion is that @xmath is a function analytic everywhere except\non the axis @xmath where it satisfies the equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe can fix the solution of this equation if we remark that @xmath should\nbe expanded in inverse powers of @xmath at infinity. Indeed, from the\nstructure of the functional equations ( 7.4 ) we conclude that @xmath\nshould be analytic at @xmath . Therefore the total density @xmath should\nbe analytic as well. This implies that the expansion of @xmath at @xmath\nis given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of this expansion is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is the stated behavior of @xmath at infinity.\n\nThe solution of ( 7.39 ) with the required structure of the zeroes and\nbehavior at infinity is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAt each order of @xmath expansion the sum @xmath contains only a finite\nnumber of terms and therefore is well defined. For convenience we put\nthe overall normalization @xmath such that @xmath .\n\nThe dependence of @xmath on @xmath of course cannot be understood from\nthe equation ( 7.39 ). It will become clear when we will show how to\nfind the coefficients @xmath .\n\n#### 7.5 Higher orders in perturbative expansion\n\nThe still unknown coefficients @xmath in ( 7.32 ) and @xmath in ( 7.42 )\nare fixed by demanding that the large @xmath expansion ( 7.29 ) and the\nexpansion ( 7.42 ) in the double scaling limit match in the intermediate\nregime. The expansion ( 7.29 ) in the double scaling regime ( 9.27 )\norganizes at each order of @xmath as a large @xmath expansion, therefore\nit should match with the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion\nof ( 7.42 ).\n\nLet us see how this works for @xmath . The general solution of ( 7.27 )\nat this order is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.43)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nReexpansion of @xmath in the double scaling regime is then given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nCorrespondingly, the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion of\n( 7.42 ) is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe first two terms in ( 7.44 ) are analytic at @xmath . Demanding the\nweak equivalence between ( 7.44 ) and ( 7.45 ) in the sense of ( 7.4 )\nwe find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo obtain the expansion ( 7.48 ) we need also @xmath . The solution at\nthis order is given in appendix D .\n\nTo relate the parameters @xmath and @xmath we find the resolvent @xmath\nfrom ( 7.33 ) and demand that it has the correct asymptotic behavior (\n7.3 ). This leads to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe scaling function @xmath can be found from ( 7.24 ). In terms of\n@xmath this is a rather complicated expression containing @xmath as\nwell. But in terms of the parameter @xmath it significantly simplifies:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis expansion matches with numerical analysis in [ 220 , V1 ] .\n\nThese three orders of large @xmath expansion lie in the BMN-like window\nof the AdS\/CFT. More precisely, as we conclude from [ 209 ] the large\n@xmath expansion of the generalized scaling function @xmath has the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.49)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this expansion the coefficients @xmath do not depend on the coupling\nconstant. The coefficients @xmath define the expansion ( 7.48 ). The\ncoefficients @xmath appear in the large @xmath expansion of the two-loop\ncorrection to the generalized scaling function and were not calculated\nhere.\n\n@xmath and @xmath can be found respectively from tree [ 173 , 174 ] and\none loop [ 209 ] calculations on the string side. In [ V1 ] @xmath was\nfound from the strong coupling solution of the BES\/FRS equation up to\ntwo loops. All findings are in agreement with ( 7.48 ).\n\n### Chapter 8 Generalized scaling function at strong coupling\n\n#### 8.1 BES\/FRS equation and different regimes at strong coupling\n\nIn the previous chapter we discussed the energy of the ground state of\nthe @xmath Heisenberg ferromagnet in various regimes of the\nthermodynamic limit. We saw that the answer depends strongly on the\nrelation of two parameters - the twist @xmath and the number of magnons\n@xmath . For @xmath the energy scales logarithmically with a prefactor\n@xmath , @xmath . One expects [ 24 ] that the logarithmic scaling of the\nanomalous dimension\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nin the limit with fixed @xmath takes place at any finite value of the\ncoupling constant @xmath . In section 5.4.3 we discussed how @xmath can\nbe used for the test of integrability in AdS\/CFT. Now more technical\ndetails would be given.\n\nThe Heisenberg ferromagnet describes the spectrum of the dilatation\noperator only at one loop. The all-loop result may be obtained from the\nconjectured Beisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. In the @xmath\nsector it reduces to the one integral equation known as the BES\/FRS\nequation. Its derivation is completely analogous to the derivation of\nthe one loop equation discussed above. This equation was initially\nderived in [ 24 ] and also in [ 25 ] . In our notations it reads [ V1 ]\n:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.2)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe kernels @xmath are defined by [ KSV2 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is given by ( 6.71 ).\n\nThe asymptotic behavior of the resolvents at infinity is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.5)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nBased on the all-loop integral equation ( 8.1 ), we can relate the\ngeneralized scaling function @xmath and the parameter @xmath in ( 8.1 )\n\u00b9 \u00b9 1 This property was initially remarked in [ 26 ] . . Indeed, the\nanomalous dimension is given by the formula\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.6)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nExpanding the BES\/FRS equation ( 8.1 ) at infinity, we obtain for the\ncoefficients in front of @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nComparing ( 8.6 ) and ( 8.7 ), we conclude that the generalized scaling\nfunction can be found as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nNote that the derivation of this relation includes expansion of the\nkernel @xmath at large @xmath , therefore it is essentially based on the\nhigher order corrections to the one-loop integral equation.\n\nThe resolvents @xmath and @xmath in the BES\/FRS equation have two types\nof branch points. The first type of branch points has \u201dkinematic\u201d origin\n- these are branch points of the inverse Zhukovsky map @xmath which is\nsingular at @xmath . The \u201dkinematic\u201d branch points are located at @xmath\n. The branch points of the second type are located at @xmath , where\n@xmath is the end of the root distribution.\n\nIt is natural to assume that the only nonanalyticities in the\ngeneralized scaling function appear at the values of @xmath and @xmath\nfor which the branch points of different types collide. For real finite\n@xmath and @xmath the collision is impossible. However, if we take into\naccount complex values of these parameters, the collision is possible.\nUsing this observation, we can determine in particular the radius of\nconvergence of the weak coupling expansion of @xmath . Indeed, for\n@xmath we have @xmath . The kinematic branch point touches the origin\nwhen @xmath . Therefore, the radius of convergence equals @xmath . This\nobservation coincides with the numerical prediction in [ 21 ] .\n\nTo investigate analytical properties of the generalized scaling function\nat strong coupling it is useful to introduce the rescaled coordinate\n@xmath . At strong coupling all the kinematic points condense into two\npoints @xmath that are situated on the real axis. Therefore we will\npotentially have different regimes depending where the branch point\n@xmath is situated: inside the interval @xmath , outside it, or at the\nfinite distance from the point @xmath .\n\n###### Finite-twist operators and small perturbations.\n\nThis is a regime in which @xmath is situated inside the interval @xmath\n. In the particular case when @xmath (and therefore @xmath ) the\ngeneralized scaling function reduces to twice the cusp anomalous\ndimension\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTo obtain a nonzero @xmath inside the interval @xmath the parameter\n@xmath should scale as @xmath , so it is exponentially small. As was\nshown in the works of Alday and Maldacena [ 49 ] and Basso and\nKorchemsky [ 34 ] , this regime is effectively described by the dynamics\nof the @xmath sigma model. The quantity @xmath can be viewed as the\nvacuum energy and @xmath is identified with the energy of the @xmath\nsigma model. The physical motivation for this particular description was\ndiscussed in Sec. 5.4.3 . In Sec. 8.3 we give a derivation, alternative\nto the one in [ 34 ] , of the integral equation for the @xmath sigma\nmodel from the BES\/FRS integral equation.\n\n###### The limit with @xmath.\n\nIn the large @xmath limit with @xmath fixed the branch point is situated\noutside the interval @xmath . The position of branch point at @xmath is\ngiven by [ 30 , 48 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n@xmath for any positive @xmath . Therefore if we perform the\nperturbation series as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\neach function @xmath should be analytical function of @xmath . This\nregime was a subject of investigation of [ V1 ] . In Sec. 8.4 we discuss\nthe results of this investigation.\n\n###### Intermediate regime.\n\nFinally, let us consider the regime when the distance between the branch\npoint @xmath and the Zhukovsky branch point @xmath is of order of @xmath\n. This limit should describe the transition between the @xmath sigma\nmodel which is realized in the case @xmath and the string perturbative\nregime @xmath . From the @xmath sigma model we know that @xmath behaves\nas\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nPerforming the small @xmath expansion of the expression of ( 8.10 ) we\nget\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore if we introduce the parameter @xmath and consider the strong\ncoupling limit with @xmath fixed we can expect that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith @xmath interpolating smoothly between the asymptotics ( 8.12 ) and\n( 8.14 ). This observation is further supported by the known analytic\nstructure of the BES\/FRS equation: we do not encounter new singular\npoints while varying @xmath .\n\nThe study of this regime was not done and may be the subject of a future\nresearch.\n\n#### 8.2 Cusp anomalous dimension\n\nThe BES\/FRS equation for @xmath (and therefore @xmath ) reduces to the\nBES equation. This is the very equation in which the all-loop proposal\nfor the BES\/BHL dressing phase initially appeared. The cusp anomalous\ndimension which can be found from the solution of the BES equation is a\nnontrivial quantity and is accessible up to four loops on the gauge side\nand up to two loops on the string side. The perturbative recursive\nsolution of the BES equation at strong coupling was found, after a\nnumber of initial attempts [ 26 ] , [ 29 , 27 ] , [ 28 , KSV1 ] , [ 30 ,\n31 ] , in [ 32 ] , [ KSV2 ] . Here we will show that the method used for\nthe solution is in fact the same as the one used in the previous\nchapter. Our analysis follows closely [ KSV2 ] with a few improvements.\n\nThe BES equation reads\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith the asymptotic conditions on @xmath given by ( 8.1 ). It turns out\nto be useful to introduce the resolvents \u00b2 \u00b2 2 In [ KSV2 ] we used a\nshifted definition:\n\n@xmath\n\n@xmath and @xmath in the upper half of the @xmath -plane by the\nfollowing equations valid for any value of the coupling constant:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.16)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.17)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.18)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThere are combinations @xmath and @xmath of @xmath and @xmath with\nsimple analytical properties. They are defined in the upper half plane\nby\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.19)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.20)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nand further by analytical continuation \u00b3 \u00b3 3 Similar linear combinations\nin the Fourier space were initially proposed in [ 32 ] . .\n\nThe functions @xmath and @xmath have square root type branching at the\npoints @xmath inherited from @xmath and @xmath . If to choose the branch\ncut to be on @xmath for @xmath and on @xmath for @xmath then one can\nshow from the definitions of @xmath and @xmath and the property ( 8.32 )\nof the kernels @xmath that @xmath and @xmath are analytic outside these\ncuts. Analytical continuation through the cuts reveals the branch points\nat @xmath on the next sheet.\n\nThe resolvents @xmath and @xmath are related in the upper half plane as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince @xmath and @xmath have discontinuities on the complementary cuts,\n( 8.21 ) is very similar to the integral equations which follows from\nthe Baxter equations (for example like ( 7.2 )).\n\nThe resolvents @xmath perturbatively at strong coupling, in the regime\n@xmath with @xmath fixed, satisfy the equations [ KSV2 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that the BES equation reduces to a very simple Riemann-Hilbert\nproblem. Its most general solution is given by:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing the formula ( 8.8 ) and the definitions of the resolvents, we\nderive that the scaling function can be expressed in terms of @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSimilarly to the discussion in chapter 7 , to fix the coefficients\n@xmath we should solve ( 8.21 ) in the double scaling limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand then demand the compatibility of this solution with ( 8.23 ). The\ndemand that the double scaling limit exists explains the presence of\n@xmath factor in ( 8.23 ). The coefficients @xmath should be bounded at\n@xmath .\n\nThe solution in the double scaling limit can be most easily found if to\napply the inverse Laplace transform:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe study of the analytical properties of @xmath and @xmath , see the\ndiscussion near Fig. 7.1 , leads to the conclusion that @xmath is\nanalytic everywhere except on the negative real axis and @xmath is\nanalytic everywhere except on the positive real axis.\n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of ( 8.21 ) has the following form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis equation and the equation for @xmath , which can be similarly\nderived, imply that @xmath and @xmath have monodromy of order four\naround zero \u2074 \u2074 4 We can see this also in the following way. The\nmonodromy of @xmath around zero is inherited from the monodromy of\n@xmath around infinity. At large values of @xmath the solution in the\ndouble scaling limit should match with the perturbative solution ( 8.23\n). The monodromy of the latter is of order four, as it follows from (\n8.22 ). .\n\nAnother consequence of ( 8.27 ) is the following. Let us analytically\ncontinue this equation to @xmath by the path that does not cross the\nreal axis. Then, since @xmath is analytic for @xmath , @xmath should\nhave zeroes at @xmath and may have poles only at @xmath .\n\nFinally, @xmath has a square root branch point at @xmath , same as the\nsquare root branch point for @xmath at finite @xmath . This implies that\nat @xmath @xmath is expanded in inverse half-integer powers of @xmath .\n\nThe most general solution for @xmath with stated above properties is\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      @xmath      (8.28)\n     @xmath      @xmath      \n  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe requirement of compatibility of the solutions ( 8.23 ) and ( 8.28 )\nfixes unambiguously all the coefficients @xmath and @xmath . This\nrequirement in particular implies the presence of an overall factor\n@xmath in ( 8.28 ) and that @xmath should be bounded at @xmath . The\nalgorithmic procedure for calculation of @xmath and @xmath , realized\nwith the help of Mathematica , is presented in appendix E.2 .\n\nAs a result, at first three orders of the strong coupling expansion we\nget\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis result was initially obtained in [ 32 ] . The derivation there\ncontained number of assumptions which we were able to prove in [ KSV2 ]\nconfirming that result. The obtained expansion ( 8.29 ) coincides with\nthe two-loop string prediction [ 225 , 186 ] . This was the first\ntwo-loop test at strong coupling of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz\nproposal.\n\n#### 8.3 @xmath sigma model\n\nThe appearance of the @xmath sigma model in a special regime of the\nAdS\/CFT system can be understood from the point of view of the string\ntheory. If we consider a folded string solution, then the centrifugal\nforces make all the fluctuations on the AdS space, as well all the\nfermion excitations massive. Therefore the low-energy excitations in the\ntheory should be described by the fluctuating modes that live on @xmath\n, i.e. by the @xmath sigma model. The mass of the AdS fluctuating modes\ndetermines the energy scale below which the @xmath sigma model\napproximation is applicable.\n\nWe can test the @xmath sigma model regime if we consider the string\nwhich moves around equator of the @xmath in addition to the rotation in\n@xmath , and therefore is described by the @xmath angular momentum\n@xmath and the @xmath angular momentum @xmath . This is the\nconfiguration which is described by the @xmath equation.\n\nIn order to stay in the @xmath sigma model regime, we should put @xmath\n. More precisely, @xmath should be at most of the order @xmath . We\nagain come back to a parameter @xmath . As we will see below, the\ndensity \u2075 \u2075 5 number per unit volume of holes of the BES\/FRS equation is\nproportional to @xmath .\n\nThe @xmath sigma model, through the mechanism of dimensional\ntransmutation, acquires a nontrivial mass scale @xmath which should\ndepend on the coupling constant by the law\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nA very nontrivial check of the integrability in the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence would be to identify the @xmath particles with holes of\nthe BES\/FRS equation as far as we stay at the energies much lower than\nthe masses of fluctuations in AdS. This regime is possible when @xmath\nis finite. In this case we come back to the scaling law ( 8.12 ) for the\nstrong coupling behavior of @xmath .\n\nThe identification of the BES\/FRS holes and the excitations of the\n@xmath sigma model was done by Basso and Korchemsky in [ 34 ] . They\nshowed that in the regime ( 8.12 ) the BES\/FRS equation can be reduced\nto the integral equation obeyed by the particles of the @xmath sigma\nmodel. Here we will give a different derivation of their result.\n\nLet us consider in addition to the BES\/FRS equation ( 8.1 ) in the\nu.h.p, the BES\/FRS equation in the l.h.p. It reads\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor the meaning of notation @xmath see appendix A .\n\nIn our derivation we will rely on the properties of the kernels @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand on the fact that @xmath and @xmath are odd functions.\n\nConsidering the BES\/FRS equation for @xmath we can make the following\ntransformations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n                       @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.33)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nLet us introduce an additional notation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing this notation we can rewrite\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSummarizing, we can rewrite the BES\/FRS equation in the upper and the\nlower half planes as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.36)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nLet us consider the interval @xmath . In this interval @xmath . We\ntherefore can derive\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that remarkably @xmath is almost decoupled from @xmath . In the\nl.h.s. of ( 8.37 ) we recognize the l.h.s. of perturbative functional\nequation for the @xmath sigma model ( 9.24 ).\n\nThe exact equation for the @xmath sigma model is written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us then take the l.h.s. of the last equation and evaluate it using (\n8.3 ). After some algebra we will get\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.39)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe functions @xmath and @xmath have the same periodicity as @xmath and\nbranch points at the positions @xmath . Therefore at the leading order\nwe expect\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that this gives the correct integral equation for the @xmath\nsigma model.\n\nThe calculation of the coefficient @xmath is tricky and was done\nexplicitly in [ 34 ] . It is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore we see that the induced mass of the @xmath sigma model has a\ncorrect RG behavior (prefactor @xmath ).\n\n#### 8.4 Connection to the perturbative string theory calculations.\n\nWe have already discussed the limits which lead @xmath at strong\ncoupling. The limit which leads to @xmath at strong coupling is @xmath\nwith @xmath fixed. The interest for this limit, which was studied in [\nV1 ] , is motivated by the fact that naively the expansion ( 8.11 ) can\nbe directly compared with the string theory results. However, the order\nof limits in calculation of ( 8.11 ) is different from that used on the\nstring theory side. On the string theory side the logarithmic scaling\nregime is attained in the following two-step limiting procedure:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      @xmath      \n     @xmath      @xmath      (8.42)\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo compare, ( 8.11 ) is obtained using the following order of limits\n\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      @xmath      \n     @xmath      @xmath      (8.43)\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------\n\nThere is a qualitative difference between two limiting orders ( 8.4 )\nand ( 8.4 ), which may become important starting from two loops. It is\nshown at the r.h.s. of Fig. 8.1 .\n\nThe limiting procedure ( 8.4 ) is organized in a way that the distance\nbetween the Bethe roots in the vicinity of the branch point is larger\nthan the Baxter scale. Therefore in the vicinity of the branch point we\nneed both terms in the Baxter equation and approximation in which the\nBES\/FRS equation was derived is inapplicable. This situation is similar\nto the WKB solution of quantum mechanics in a smooth potential.\n\nIn the limiting procedure ( 8.4 ) the distance between the Bethe roots\nin the vicinity of the branch point is much smaller than the Baxter\nscale. This is similar to the WKB solution in quantum mechanics with a\nsteep function at the turning point.\n\nThis qualitative difference is absent in the case when we consider the\nstrong coupling regime with @xmath . As shown at the l.h.s. of Fig. 8.1\n, the density of roots is always large in this case.\n\nIn [ V1 ] the discrepancy at two-loop level was found between ( 8.11 )\nand the solution in [ 48 ] of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the order\nof limits ( 8.4 ). We however were not able to show explicitly that this\ndiscrepancy is due to the explained qualitative difference between two\ncases.\n\nWe see therefore that there are reasons to doubt the possibility of\napplication of the BES\/FRS equation, at least without modifications, for\nthe comparison of the Bethe Ansatz and perturbative string results. The\ncalculation in [ 48 ] was done using the order of limits ( 8.4 ) and\ntherefore should match the string theory prediction [ 187 ] . However,\nthere is a discrepancy at the two-loop level.\n\nAnother possibility to check the results of [ 48 , 187 ] was proposed in\n[ 37 ] based on the @xmath sigma model regime. The two-loop prediction\nof [ 37 ] matched that of [ 48 ] . This matching should be however\nbetter understood, since the order of limits used in [ 37 ] was\ndifferent from ( 8.4 ) (and from ( 8.4 )).\n\n### Chapter 9 Mass gap in integrable sigma models\n\n#### 9.1 Formulation of the problem\n\nAnother important application of the techniques developed in previous\nchapters is the perturbative solution of integral equations which appear\nin two-dimensional integrable sigma models.\n\nTwo-dimensional nonlinear sigma models are often considered as toy\nmodels for QCD. They share with QCD the property of the asymptotic\nfreedom [ 226 ] . Although these theories do not have dimensionful\nparameters on the classical level, they acquire a dynamical mass scale\non the quantum level via the dimensional transmutation mechanism. We\nwill call this mass scale @xmath .\n\nThe symmetry group @xmath of the target space of the sigma model is the\nanalog of the QCD gauge group. The sigma models with the target space\nbeing a coset manifold @xmath are classically integrable [ 168 ] . It is\nbelieved that when @xmath is simple the integrability is preserved on\nthe quantum level. Examples of such quantum integrable theories are\n@xmath vector sigma model and @xmath principal chiral field (PCF) model.\n@xmath sigma model is an example of the theory which is integrable on\nthe classical but not on the quantum level.\n\nAs in QCD, the sigma models can be studied perturbatively at scales much\nlarger than the dynamical mass scale. In the infrared regime the\nperturbative description is not applicable. Instead, it is possible to\nsolve these theories exactly. For example, large @xmath solutions of\nsuch models as @xmath and @xmath sigma models were found in [ 71 , 72 ,\n227 , 228 ] . These solutions showed that the excitations are described\non the quantum level by massive particles. Since @xmath is the only\ndimensionful parameter of the theory, the mass of the particles should\nbe proportional to it:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIf to assume that the description in terms of particles is appropriate\nfor finite values of @xmath then quantum integrable sigma models can be\nsolved by the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz in the infinite volume [ 7 ] , as\nwe discussed in the second chapter.\n\nIn this chapter we will explain how to determine the coefficient of\nproportionality @xmath in ( 9.1 ) for the @xmath sigma model at finite\n@xmath . Although we will consider only this particular case, most of\nthe statements can be applied for any sigma model solvable by the\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz.\n\nThe idea of determination of the coefficient @xmath is not new. It goes\nback to [ 38 , 39 ] . We refer also to [ 229 ] for an overview. The mass\ngap ( 9.1 ) was found in [ 38 , 39 ] numerically with a precision that\nallowed to guess the analytical expression. Our contribution is to give\nan analytical derivation of the mass gap \u00b9 \u00b9 1 In [ 230 ] it was stated\nthat Balog had provided such analytical derivation (see ref.[19] there).\nHis result was however not published. .\n\nThe determination of the mass gap is not the only issue of this chapter.\nWe will also discuss the renorm-group behavior and Borel summability\nproperties of the @xmath sigma model. This will bring us an additional\nevidence that the Bethe Ansatz is a proper description of this QFT.\n\n###### Sigma-model in an external field\n\nLet us consider an asymptotically free model with a running coupling\nconstant @xmath that satisfies the Gell-Man--Low equation \u00b2 \u00b2 2 We may\nchoose @xmath equal to @xmath from ( 2.1 ). This is however not at all\nobligatory. In fact, below we will make another choice which is related\nto @xmath via the finite renormalization ( 9.41 ). :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe dynamically generated scale @xmath is the RG invariant which can be\nbuilt from ( 9.2 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe quantity @xmath is invariant under finite renormalizations of the\ncoupling constant given by the transformations of the type\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis scheme independent object @xmath is an important prediction of the\nperturbation theory.\n\nFrom ( 9.3 ) we can see that the mass gap ( 9.1 ) cannot be found by\nperturbative means only. Therefore integrability, or another\nnonperturbative description, is needed. A typical way for identification\nof the coefficient @xmath is the comparison of the perturbative field\ntheory prediction with the prediction of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz.\nSince the theory is asymptotically free, we have to introduce a large\nscale in order to insure that we are in the perturbative regime. A\nstrong external field @xmath coupled to one of the charges @xmath of the\nsystem is often used for this purpose. @xmath sigma model in the\npresence of the external field was initially considered in the works of\nPolyakov and Wiegmann [ 68 , 231 ] . The thermodynamics of the system,\nwhich we consider at zero temperature, can be described by the free\nenergy which is a minimum with respect to the value of the charge @xmath\nof\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere @xmath is the energy of the system.\n\n@xmath sigma model contains only one type of particles that belong to\nthe vector multiplet of the @xmath group. We chose a charge @xmath which\ncounts the number of particles polarized in a particular direction. Then\n@xmath plays the role of the chemical potential. For @xmath larger than\nthe mass gap a condensate of equally polarized particles is created.\n\nIn the limit of infinite volume @xmath we should speak about intensive\nquantities: the density of the particles @xmath , the free energy\ndensity @xmath , and the energy density @xmath . These intensive\nquantities are related as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe free energy density @xmath is a function of @xmath . Instead, @xmath\n, which is the Legendre transform of @xmath , is a function of @xmath .\n\nPerturbative field theory predicts the following asymptotic weak\ncoupling expansion of the energy density:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the running coupling constant @xmath is evaluated at the scale\n@xmath . The ratio @xmath is exponentially small in terms of the\ncoupling constant.\n\nThe dependence of @xmath on @xmath can be figured out from the condition\n@xmath and decomposition ( 9.7 ). It is given by the expansion\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIt is useful to think about the coupling constant as the function of\n@xmath and to introduce the corresponding beta-function\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFrom ( 9.8 ) it follows that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe explicit value of the coefficients @xmath depends on the computation\nscheme which is used and on the definition of the coupling constant. The\nenergy of the @xmath sigma model at tree level and its one-loop\ncorrection were calculated in [ 38 , 39 ] \u00b3 \u00b3 3 More precisely, the free\nenergy was found. Then we can make the Legendre transform to obtain the\nexpression for the energy. . The two-loop correction was found in [ 37 ]\n\u2074 \u2074 4 This work contains a very good pedagogical explanation about how\nthe perturbative calculations are done. . The calculations were done in\nthe @xmath scheme. With the coupling constant defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthe first three coefficients @xmath were found to be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe definition ( 9.11 ) of the coupling constant is the same as in [ 37\n] , where it was called @xmath . The reason to use such definition is\nthat it leads to a particularly simple form of the coefficients @xmath ,\nas we discuss below.\n\nWe can rewrite the expansion ( 9.7 ) in terms of the ratio @xmath only:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.13)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe idea of [ 38 , 39 ] to calculate the mass gap ( 9.1 ) is based on\nthe fact that the energy of the considered system can be also found from\nthe Bethe Ansatz. Instead of @xmath , the solution should depend on the\nratio of the density and the mass of the particles, since the mass of\nthe particles serves as an input for the construction of the Bethe\nAnsatz. One should expect the expression of the following form\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.14)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nComparison of ( 9.13 ) and ( 9.14 ) gives us a possibility to find\n@xmath in ( 9.1 ). The expansions ( 9.13 ) and ( 9.14 ) contain also\nanother valuable information. They contain the invariant ratio @xmath .\nTherefore we can verify that the Bethe Ansatz reproduces a correct\nrenorm-group dynamics of the model. It is a nontrivial check of the\nbootstrap approach. A priory , the Bethe Ansatz does not contain\ncoupling constant at all. But it turns out to be useful to introduce a\ncoupling constant in order to rewrite ( 9.14 ) in terms of the power\nseries of the coupling constant (like ( 9.7 )).\n\n###### Integral equation\n\nSince only the states with a certain polarization are excited, the\nnested levels of the Bethe Ansatz are turned off. Therefore in the large\nvolume limit the system with a given density of particles @xmath is\ndescribed by the one integral equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (9.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere @xmath is a density of the Bethe roots distribution. The boundary\n@xmath of the Bethe roots distribution is the value of rapidity up to\nwhich the Fermi sea is filled. This value should be found from the\nnormalization condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe energy density of the system is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe energy density @xmath depends on the particle density @xmath through\nthe parameter @xmath . Our goal is to find this parametric dependence\nfor large @xmath , or equivalently large @xmath .\n\nOne can see (from numerical solution for example) that the density of\nroots grows when it approaches the points @xmath . Therefore we can use\nthe methods explained in the previous chapters to perturbatively solve\nthe integral equation. The discussed below solution is the extended\nversion of the work [ V2 ] .\n\nThe @xmath -matrix is given by ratio of the gamma functions. Using the\nformal equivalence \u2075 \u2075 5 In ( 2.16 ) we already used such notation.\nMoreover, there we defined the r.h.s. of ( 9.18 ) as the gamma function.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand introducing the resolvent\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwe can rewrite the integral equation ( 9.1 ) in an elegant form:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere the shift operator is defined by @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 9.2 Perturbative expansion\n\nLet us act on ( 9.20 ) with the operator @xmath , which is well defined\noperation. The r.h.s. of ( 9.20 ) will vanish and we are left with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe action of the shift operator in this notation is understood as an\nanalytical continuation.\n\nIf to consider this equation perturbatively in the regime\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthe overall operator @xmath can be dropped in the perturbative expansion\nby the following reason. This operator is perturbatively understood as a\npower series in @xmath . Integrating the obtained equation in each order\nof the perturbation theory we get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nup to a constant of integration. However, this constant is zero since\n@xmath is an odd function.\n\nThe equation ( 9.24 ) can be solved perturbatively. Its most general\nsolution is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath . The perturbative meaning of the expansion ( 9.25 ) is\nmost easily seen in terms of the variable @xmath .\n\nThe coefficients @xmath are not all independent. The coefficients for\nthe terms which contain logarithms can be defined uniquely through the\nother coefficients using equation ( 9.24 ). However, below we will show\na more efficient way to fix them.\n\nThe solution ( 9.25 ) gives us the value for the particle density from\nthe residue of the resolvent at infinity:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 9.3 Solution in the double scaling limit\n\nTo fix all the coefficients @xmath , we follow exactly the same\nprocedure as we did in the previous chapters. Namely, we consider a\ndouble scaling limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand perform the inverse Laplace transform defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe double scaling limit of ( 9.20 ) and further its inverse Laplace\ntransform give the following equation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (9.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere we neglected the exponentially small terms since our goal is to\nfind the asymptotic large @xmath expansion. Neglecting these terms\nallows reexpressing the energy in terms of @xmath . Indeed,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe study of the analytical structure of the resolvent goes similarly to\nstudy in chapter 7 (note that the role of @xmath and @xmath are\nexchanged in these two cases). The conclusion is that:\n\n-   @xmath is analytic everywhere except on the negative real axis,\n\n-   For @xmath @xmath has a branch cut. The monodromy around the branch\n    point @xmath is given by the equation:\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (9.31)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n-   @xmath has an infinite set of poles and zeroes on the negative real\n    axes. The position of poles and zeroes is such that all the poles\n    and zeroes of @xmath for @xmath are canceled out, except for the\n    pole at @xmath , which is a singularity of the r.h.s. of ( 9.3 ).\n\n-   The asymptotic behavior of @xmath at large @xmath is given by\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (9.32)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe solution of ( 9.3 ) which satisfies these properties is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.33)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe dependence of @xmath on @xmath is not a consequence of ( 9.3 ). It\ncomes from the comparison of ( 9.3 ) and ( 9.25 ). @xmath contains only\nfinite number of terms at each order of @xmath expansion. Therefore the\nsolution ( 9.3 ) is well defined.\n\nTo fix all the coefficients @xmath and @xmath , we should consider (\n9.25 ) in the double scaling limit. In this limit the expansion\norganizes at each order of @xmath as a @xmath expansion. This expansion\nshould match with the Laplace transform of the small @xmath expansion of\n@xmath . This requirement uniquely fixes all the coefficients. We used\nMathematica to obtain first 25 orders of the perturbative expansion. The\nroutine for this calculation is given in appendix E.3 .\n\n#### 9.4 Results for the mass gap coefficient and the RG dynamics.\n\nAt the leading and subleading orders the energy and particle densities\nare given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nBy explicit solution of this parametric dependence and comparison with (\n9.13 ) we get the correct value of the mass gap known in the literature\nand given by [ 38 , 39 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere the @xmath -parameter is defined in the @xmath scheme.\n\nWe would like to note that the importance of the solution is not only in\nfinding the coefficient of proportionality. The expression for the\nenergy density in terms of the parameter @xmath contains both @xmath and\n@xmath terms. The fact that we can cancel all the double logarithm terms\nby introducing a proper coupling constant is very nontrivial. Moreover,\nthis cancelation is only possible if the coupling constant has a\nbeta-function with the correct ratio @xmath predicted by the quantum\nfield theory. This shows that the Bethe Ansatz correctly reproduces the\nrenorm-group dynamics of the model.\n\nThe presence of the CDD factors \u2076 \u2076 6 The crossing and unitarity\nequations constrain the scalar factor in the scattering matrix up to a\nmultiplier known as the CDD factor. This factor can be fixed if the\ncomplete particle content of the theory is known. would change this\nrenorm-group dynamics. Therefore this calculation also serves as a\nverification of the assumption about the particle content of the theory.\n\n#### 9.5 Borel summability\n\nThe recursive procedure allows us to find analytical expression for the\nfirst @xmath orders of the perturbation theory. We are able therefore to\nanalyze the large order behavior of the coefficients of the asymptotic\nexpansion. Comparison of the large order behavior that we get from the\nBethe Ansatz with the prediction of the quantum field theory gives us an\nadditional check of the validity of the Bethe Ansatz description of the\n@xmath sigma model.\n\nLet us briefly recall the basic facts about asymptotic series.\nTypically, a small coupling expansion in a quantum field theory is an\nasymptotic expansion with zero radius of convergence. Probably the only\nknown example of the convergent series is when models are considered in\nthe \u2019t Hooft planar limit.\n\nIn opposite to the case with convergent series, there is no bijection\nbetween the function and the asymptotic series. Although the asymptotic\nexpansion of the function is uniquely defined, the inverse is not true.\nIt is often postulated that the function which corresponds to a given\nasymptotic expansion is given by the Borel ressumation of the asymptotic\nseries.\n\nSuppose that this series is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe Borel sum of this series is defined by the integral\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe integrand is given by the series which is convergent provided that\n@xmath grow at most factorially. In the most interesting cases @xmath\ngrow exactly in factorial way. Therefore the series has a finite radius\nof convergence. The integrand in ( 9.37 ) is defined using the\nanalytical continuation of the function\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is well defined by its series expansion for a sufficiently small\n@xmath .\n\nLet us suppose that @xmath has a singularity (we will consider only\npoles for simplicity) at @xmath with @xmath . Then we can choose\ndifferent contours of integration, as it shown in Fig. 9.1 .\n\nDifferent choices of the contours obviously lead to different functions\n@xmath . However, these functions have the same asymptotic expansion. We\nsee that the Borel transform is an ambiguous procedure in this case. A\nseries ( 9.36 ) with such properties is called non-Borel-summable.\n\nWhen all the singularities of @xmath are situated to the left from the\nimaginary axes, we can uniquely choose the contour of integration. In\nthis case the Borel summation is the unambiguous procedure. An\nasymptotic series for which Borel transform is uniquely defined is\ncalled Borel-summable.\n\nThe large order behavior of the asymptotic expansion gives a valuable\ninformation about the existence\/absence of singularities in the Borel\nplane. If the large order behavior of the coefficients @xmath is\napproximated by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthen @xmath has a singularity at @xmath . If the sign of @xmath is\npositive, we get a non-Borel-summable theory. Therefore sign oscillation\nof the asymptotic expansion is a necessary condition for the Borel\nsummability. Of course, this condition is not at all sufficient.\n\nLet us now investigate what is the asymptotic behavior of the\ncoefficients in the @xmath sigma model. The large @xmath behavior for\nthe coefficients @xmath is approximated by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe qualitative behavior of the coefficients @xmath is different for\nlarge and small values of @xmath . For @xmath , and therefore @xmath ,\nwe have @xmath , so we have a sign oscillating series. We will see below\nthat this is in agreement with the observation that exactly at @xmath\nthe asymptotic expansion is Borel-summable.\n\nFor sufficiently small @xmath the coefficients of the series become\npositive. So, @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for @xmath . We see that at\nleast for sufficiently small @xmath the series is non-Borel-summable.\nThe Borel ambiguity is of order @xmath as it should be from the field\ntheory point of view (see ( 9.13 )).\n\nFor other values of @xmath the behavior of the coefficients is more\ncomplicated. It seems that they reflect the concurrence between two\nsingularities at @xmath in the Borel plane.\n\nFor @xmath the asymptotic behavior of @xmath is estimated by @xmath ,\nwhere @xmath is positive. This shows that we have an additional\nsingularity in the Borel plane at @xmath . This singularity determines\nthe asymptotic behavior of the coefficients for @xmath .\n\nLet us compare our results with the predictions of the quantum field\ntheory. In quantum field theory there are two sources of the\nsingularities in the Borel plane: instantons and renormalons. Both of\nthem are present in the @xmath sigma model.\n\n###### Instantons.\n\nInstanton is defined as a solution of the equations of motion in the\nimaginary time with finite value of the Euclidian action. As was\nobserved by Lipatov [ 232 ] , there are singularities in the Borel plane\nrelated to instanton solutions. We will apply the method of [ 232 ] to\nfind the position of these singularities.\n\nThe relation between the coupling constant @xmath that we use and @xmath\nthat was used in ( 2.1 ) is the following:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor our discussion it would be sufficient only the leading order. Let us\nconsider a physical quantity\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe @xmath -th order of the asymptotic expansion of @xmath can be found\nfrom the correspondent residue under the functional integral\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.43)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing the saddle point approximation at large values of @xmath , both\nfor @xmath and @xmath , we can estimate that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the extremal value of the action. The smallest nonzero\nvalue of @xmath is @xmath . A particular instanton solution which\ncorresponds to this value is the following: @xmath , and @xmath form the\ninstanton solution for the @xmath sigma model with topological charge\nequal one, @xmath for @xmath . Of course, we should integrate over all\nsolutions of this type. This will lead to a common multiplier in ( 9.44\n) that does not affect the position of the Borel singularity. Higher\ninstanton solutions are built analogically. For the @xmath -th instanton\nsolution @xmath .\n\nSubstituting @xmath to ( 9.44 ) we obtain the positions of the Borel\nsingularities related to the instantons:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe instanton solutions are not stable for @xmath \u2077 \u2077 7 To show this we\ncan consider the one-parametric deformation @xmath , @xmath , where\n@xmath is a constant unit vector which satisfies the condition @xmath .\nThe value of the action, @xmath interpolates monotonously between @xmath\nand @xmath . . Naively we could think that an unstable solution is not a\nlocal minimum of the action and therefore it does not lead to\nnonperturbative corrections. However, there are examples from the\nquantum mechanics which show that the situation is less trivial and that\nunstable instantons may lead to the singularities in the Borel plane.\n\nFrom our explicit calculation we observed for @xmath a leading\nsingularity in the Borel plane equal to @xmath . It is natural to\nidentify it with the instanton solution. For @xmath this singularity, if\npresent, is not a leading one and therefore cannot be seen from our\nanalysis. Thus we cannot conclude about the presence or absence of\nnonperturbative corrections related to instantons for @xmath .\n\n###### Renormalons.\n\nRenormalon ambiguities do not correspond to any physical effects but\nreflect an ambiguity in the definition of the asymptotic perturbative\nexpansion. It is believed that the ambiguities related to renormalons\ncan be fixed by proper definition of the subleading terms in the\noperator product expansion. For a review of the subject see for example\n[ 233 ] .\n\nThe renormalons in the @xmath sigma model were studied by David [ 234 ,\n235 ] . For @xmath the @xmath sigma model is just an @xmath -component\ngaussian field theory. It contains only UV renormalons at positions\n@xmath with @xmath being negative integer. The @xmath corrections to the\nlarge @xmath solutions suggest that for finite @xmath both UV and IR\nrenormalons are likely to be present. The IR renormalons are situated at\npositions @xmath with @xmath being positive integer.\n\nIn view of this field theory prediction we can naturally interpret our\nresults in the following way. For @xmath we observe that the asymptotic\nexpansion is governed by the leading UV renormalon singularity at @xmath\n. For finite @xmath there are two leading singularities: the UV\nrenormalon at @xmath and the IR renormalon at @xmath . The concurrence\nof them is reflected in the nonsymmetrical with respect to the real axis\noscillating behavior of the coefficients of the expansion.\n\nWe see that the results about the large order behavior obtained from the\nBethe Ansatz are in accordance with the predictions of the field theory.\nWe got a new confirmation that the Bethe Ansatz correctly describes the\n@xmath sigma model.\n\n### Conclusions and discussions\n\nThe study of the AdS\/CFT correspondence gave us an example of integrable\nsystem with remarkable properties and posed new questions to answer in\nthe field of quantum integrable systems. In this thesis we described the\nAdS\/CFT integrable system in analogy with known integrable systems based\non the rational @xmath -matrix.\n\nWe saw that the symmetry group is always behind all the equations that\ndescribe rational integrable systems, whether these are Bethe Ansatz\nequations, fusion Hirota equations or integral equations for the\nresolvents of the density functions.\n\nIt seems that the deepest way to describe an integrable system is to\nconsider the Hirota equations ( @xmath -system). Imposing different\nrequirements on the analytical structure of the transfer matrices we can\nobtain different integrable systems, not necessarily based on the\nrational @xmath -matrix. In this way the AdS\/CFT system can be also\nobtained.\n\nIt is not always simple to deal with the Hirota equations due to their\nquadratic structure. We saw however that the @xmath -system is defined,\nroughly speaking, by the \u201dexponentiation\u201d of the functional equations\nfor the resolvents (compare ( 3.26 ) and ( 3.50 )). This resembles to\nthe description of the Lie group via its Lie algebra. The functional\nequations for the resolvents are linear and are simple to investigate.\nTherefore we may consider them as an indicator of the possible relations\namong different integrable theories and then probably raise this\nrelation to the level of @xmath -systems.\n\nFor example, we saw that the structure of the functional equations for\nthe resolvents in the @xmath XXX spin chain is simple and is defined by\ntwo deformed Cartan matrices (one for @xmath algebra and another for\n@xmath algebra) ( 3.26 ). The excitations over the antiferromagnetic\nvacuum in such a spin chain in the thermodynamic limit describe a\ncertain relativistic field theory. To see this we should perform a\nparticle-hole transformation which is very simple in the language of\nfunctional equations. In this way we also see that an overall scalar\nfactor of the scattering matrix is defined basically by the inverse\ndeformed Cartan matrix of the @xmath algebra. The \u201dexponentiation\u201d of\nthe functional equations through TBA leads to a @xmath -system which\nremarkably coincides with the fusion relations for the transfer matrices\nof the spin chain. This leads to a conjecture that transfer matrices of\na spin chain discretization coincide with the @xmath -functions which\nappear in the TBA approach that describes the field theory.\n\nAnother example is the functional equations for the @xmath integrable\nspin chains. We showed that whatever is the choice of the Kac-Dynkin\ndiagram, the functional equations are always organized into a fat hook\nstructure (more generally, @xmath -hook structure). Then, through the\nTBA we get a @xmath -system defined on such fat hook (or @xmath -hook).\nOne should then ask what is the meaning of the obtained @xmath\n-functions. Provided by proper boundary condition, the @xmath -system on\nthe fat hook is solved by the Bethe Ansatz equations through the chain\nof Backlund transforms [ 40 ] ; the @xmath -functions have the meaning\nof the transfer matrices of the corresponding spin chain [ 40 ] .\nHowever the boundary conditions that allow Bethe Ansatz solution are not\nthe ones that are obtained through TBA, therefore relation between\n@xmath -functions of TBA and transfer matrices is not clear.\n\nIn the @xmath -hook case the solution in terms of the Bethe equations is\nstill an open problem, though some progress was made in [ 108 ] . The\n@xmath -hook case is more involved also because we do not know how to\nidentify the representations of the @xmath algebra with the points of\n@xmath -hook.\n\nThe AdS\/CFT integrable system which is much more complicated from the\nfirst glance, in fact can be treated very similarly to the theories with\nthe rational @xmath -matrix. To show this in a more explicit way we may\nuse the kernels @xmath and @xmath defined respectively by ( 6.71 ) and (\n6.61 ). These kernels are specially designed to treat the presence of\nthe square root cut. Using @xmath , we can rewrite the Bethe equations\nin a more tractable form (see section 6.4 ). For example\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.46)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see the appearance of the rational structure in such notation.\n\nAs we showed in [ V3 ] , the solution of the crossing equations can be\nalso naturally formulated in terms of the kernel @xmath and the shift\noperator @xmath . Using this representation for the dressing phase, we\ncan write down the functional representation of the BES and the BES\/FRS\nequations (as well as the other integral equations which follow from the\nBeisert-Staudacher asymptotic Bethe Ansatz). It is particularly simple\nto derive these functional equations directly from the Bethe Ansatz.\n\nIn the third part of the thesis we presented a way to perturbatively\nsolve the functional equations at strong coupling. The usefulness of the\nfunctional representation is based first of all on the defining property\nof the kernel @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich allows performing various analytical transformations of the\nfunctional equations. Such transformations of the BES equation at strong\ncoupling allow to reduce a problem to a simple functional equation (\n8.19 ) which does not contain the kernel @xmath . The solution of ( 8.19\n) was found by considering of the related Riemann-Hilbert problems in\ntwo different scaling regimes and then identification of unknown\nconstants by comparing these two regimes.\n\nWe applied the same strategy for the solution of the BES\/FRS equation\nand for performing weak coupling asymptotic expansion of the energy of\nthe @xmath sigma model. When solving the latter problem we learned that\nour approach can be reformulated in terms of the Wiener-Hopf solution of\nthe integral equations.\n\nTo a great extent, the AdS\/CFT integrable system was sufficiently well\nstudied from the point of view of the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz allows computation of the energy in the infinite\nvolume. Recent developments based on TBA allowed for study of finite\nsize operators [ 41 , 42 , 43 ] , [ 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ] , [ 158 , 157 ]\n, [ 161 , 236 ] . The anomalous dimension of the Konishi operator, the\nsimplest nontrivial finite-size operator, was found analytically at weak\ncoupling up to five loops [ 159 , 237 ] . This anomalous dimension was\nalso computed numerically up to a sufficiently large values of the\ncoupling constant [ 238 ] which allowed predicting first two orders of\nthe strong coupling expansion. Still, the analytic derivation at strong\ncoupling expansion is missing.\n\nThere is one intriguing question that can be asked on the level of the\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The integrable system as we know it now may be\nan effective one and there it may be a different, probably much simpler\nformulation. The one reason for this idea is that the integrable system\nwas built around a fast spinning string solution and we would rather\nlike to describe all possible states. This idea appeared soon after the\ndiscovery of the all-loop integrability. In particular, in [ 155 ] it\nwas suggested that the @xmath sector can be described in terms of the\nHubbard model. This description turned out to be incorrect starting only\nfrom four loops.\n\nOne probable answer to the question what is a simpler formulation is\njust a @xmath -system constructed through TBA. Then we still should give\nan interpretation for the @xmath -functions. We therefore come back to\nthe question if there a spin chain behind @xmath -hook. If such spin\nchain exists, we can think about it as a discretization of the string\nsigma model.\n\nAnother possibility is that the Zhukovsky cut appears effectively from\nthe condensation of particles from a hidden level. This idea was\nformulated in [ 239 , 240 ] . In [ 241 ] it was shown on the classical\nlevel of the sigma model that the central equation of the\nBeisert-Staudacher Bethe Ansatz can be indeed reproduced by this\napproach. The consideration of [ 241 ] was not however generalized to\nthe quantum level, also it is not evident how to include fermionic\ninteractions in this approach. We hope that the intuition developed in\nour work can help to improve the study in this direction.\n\nLet us finally recall recent promising formulation of the string sigma\nmodel as a Pohlmeyer reduced theory [ 242 , 243 , 244 ] . This\nformulation is relativistically invariant and describes excitations\naround true vacuum. Therefore finding of the quantum integrable model\nbehind this theory would potentially give a desired simpler description\nof the AdS\/CFT system.\n\nWe see that despite a huge progress in recent years there are still many\nquestions to answer and that the study of integrability has many\ndirections to develop in the future.\n\n### Note added\n\nIt is important to mention two papers that appeared after the defense of\nthis thesis.\n\nIn [ 245 ] the calculation of the generalized scaling function at\ntwo-loops from the string theory was done. The result coincides with the\none of [ 48 , 37 ] . Before [ 245 ] string theory calculation [ 187 ]\nwas in disagreement with [ 48 , 37 ] as we discussed in this thesis.\n\nIn [ 246 ] certain infinite dimensional representations of @xmath were\nidentified with the nodes of the @xmath -hook plotted in Fig. 4.11 .\nHence, the @xmath -functions living on the @xmath -hook can be\ninterpreted as transfer matrices in these representations.\n\n### Appendix A Conventions for action of the shift operator.\n\nThroughout this text we often use the shift operator @xmath which is\ndefined in the following way:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nA usage of this operator can potentially lead to a number of\nambiguities. The goal of this appendix is to define the conventions\nwhich will give a precise meaning to all the expressions that contain\nthe shift operator.\n\n###### Analytical continuation.\n\nWhen the function @xmath is multivalued, we should define in ( A.1 ) the\npath that connects points @xmath and @xmath . The default definition is\nthe following. For @xmath a default set of branch cuts should be given.\nThen the points @xmath and @xmath are to be connected by the path that\ndo not intersect the cuts.\n\nSometimes we need also an analytical continuation over the straight line\nirrespectively if it crosses any cut or not. To denote this case we use\nnotations\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nCorrespondingly, if we want use the operator @xmath to make a shift by\n@xmath and the shift must be made by analytical continuation over the\nstraight line, we use notations\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe difference between ( A.1 ) and ( A.2 ) is shown in Fig. A.1\n\n###### Function in the power of the operator.\n\nFor a given operator @xmath , by definition\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor example\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn most cases a choice of the branch of the logarithm is not important\nsince the logarithm is exponentiated. However, if an ambiguity may\nappear we take a standard definition of the branch cut of the logarithm\nand consider ( A.4 ) in the region of the variable @xmath where no\ncrossing of the logarithm cut occurs.\n\n###### Rational function of the shift operator\n\nWhenever the shift operator appears in the denominator, simultaneously\nonly positive or only negative powers of @xmath are allowed. Then the\ndenominator is understood as a power series assuming that @xmath or\n@xmath is sufficiently small. For example:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe definition makes sense if the action of ( A.6 ) on a function gives\na convergent series.\n\nNote that according to this definition for example\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIndeed,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThere is however one situation when we can use simultaneously @xmath and\n@xmath in the denominator. That is when due to cancelations the actual\nexpression is a polynomial. An example is a definition of a \u201dD-number\u201d\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhich is used for operations with string configurations (of Bethe roots)\nof the length @xmath .\n\nThere is also one case when we formally deal with nonconvergent series.\nNamely, we define\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe reason for such definition is that the second derivative of the\nlogarithm of the formal equality ( A.10 ) gives a true equality.\n\nFor expressions of type\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a rational function we use the following definition.\nFirst, we represent @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAll the expressions used in the text allow such representation. The\nexpression @xmath should be understood as @xmath .\n\nThen we define ( A.11 ) by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFrom the definition ( A.13 ) of ( A.11 ) it follows that in general\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHowever, since in all the cases presented in this text @xmath is a\nconvergent series, l.h.s. and r.h.s. of ( A.14 ) may differ only by a\nconstant:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThroughout the text we track out this constant which is typically @xmath\n. However, the essential information about algebraic structure of the\nexpression is contained in the argument @xmath of the exponent and\nreader may not follow the preexponent constants.\n\n### Appendix B Structure of the integral equations for the @xmath Bethe\nansatz.\n\nHere we will derive the formula ( 4.27 ) and give an explicit form for\n@xmath in ( 4.28 ).\n\nLet us first consider the bosonic node. One can keep in mind the node 4\nin Fig. 4.9 . However all the arguments are applicable for any node. The\nBethe equations are written as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIf there are roots @xmath that are part of some stack configuration,\nthen the terms in ( B.1 ) which contain them will cancel against terms\nwith @xmath and\/or @xmath belonging to the same stack. Therefore what is\nleft are the roots @xmath which form string configurations themselves.\nThese roots interact in a standard way with @xmath and @xmath and\ntherefore ( 4.27 ) is correct for bosonic node. This is because ( 4.27 )\nis the same equation that appeared in @xmath case. It also happens that\npart of @xmath roots belong to the end of the stack (type B in Fig. 4.8\nif @xmath is bosonic or type C if @xmath is fermionic). Such roots\nshould be separated from other @xmath Bethe roots. The corresponding\nnode for such roots is joined to @xmath by the colorless (black) line\n(in terms of Fig. 4.9 . For @xmath this node is below the node 4).\n\nThe fermionic Bethe roots generically form stacks of type B or C. Let us\nderive the integral equations for the resolvents corresponding to these\nstacks. The most general situation for the fermionic node is shown in\nFig. B.1 . We will also adopt numeration from this figure.\n\nWe introduce the following notations for the resolvents:\n\n-   @xmath - resolvent for s-stack generated by the 0 node. If @xmath\n    this is the type B stack. If @xmath - type C.\n\n-   @xmath , @xmath - the resolvent of @xmath -string for the node\n    @xmath .\n\n-   @xmath , @xmath - the resolvents shown on the picture. Their meaning\n    is slightly different depending on whether node @xmath is bosonic or\n    fermionic.\n\n    If the node @xmath is fermionic (case I) then @xmath is the\n    resolvent for type C @xmath -stacks formed by the nodes @xmath and\n    @xmath . @xmath is the resolvent for type C stacks terminated by the\n    @xmath -string at the node @xmath .\n\n    If the node @xmath is bosonic (case II) then @xmath is the resolvent\n    for type C stacks terminated by the @xmath -string at the node\n    @xmath , @xmath is the resolvent for type B stack terminated at the\n    node @xmath , and @xmath is the resolvent for @xmath -strings of the\n    node @xmath .\n\n    The resolvents @xmath and @xmath and the corresponding Bethe roots\n    enter the equations considered below in the same way independently\n    of whether we deal with case I or II.\n\n-   @xmath - the resolvent for @xmath -stacks originated by the node\n    @xmath .\n\n-   @xmath - the resolvent for @xmath -string if the node @xmath is\n    bosonic, otherwise it is the resolvent for @xmath -stack originated\n    at the node @xmath .\n\nOne have to prove the equations ( 4.27 ) for the @xmath -stacks\noriginated at the node 0. First we consider the case @xmath when the\nconsidered stacks are of B-type. Using the notations of Sec. 1.3 one can\nwrite Bethe equations for the center of this stack as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe corresponding integral equations are\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor @xmath one can apply @xmath operator on this equation. It is\nstraightforward to check that we reproduce ( 4.27 ) if @xmath satisfies\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis is indeed the case since the bosonic nodes satisfy ( 4.27 ).\n\nThe marginal case @xmath gives the correct equations if we apply @xmath\nand ( B.4 ) and define @xmath .\n\nNow we consider the case @xmath (type C stacks). In this case the Bethe\nequation for the center of the @xmath -stacks are written as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe corresponding integral equation is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.6)\n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nThis equation is also valid for @xmath and coincides with ( B.3 ) for\nthe same value of @xmath . Therefore one can safely apply @xmath on (\nB.6 ) for @xmath . This application leads again to ( 4.27 ).\n\nThe case @xmath should be treated separately. In this case for the\napplication of @xmath one need both equations ( B.3 ) and ( B.6 ). The\nobtained integral equation will coincide with ( 4.27 ) if the following\nequation holds:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis equation is nothing than the integral equation for the simple Bethe\nroots of @xmath node.\n\nWe are left with the special case when @xmath . In this case the same\nconsiderations show that we again obtain ( 4.27 ) if the following\nequation is correct\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis is indeed the case.\n\nTherefore we considered all possible cases and proved ( 4.27 ).\n\nIt is left to derive the integral equation for the corner point @xmath .\nIf the terminating node of the Kac-Dynkin diagram is fermionic than this\nnode will be exactly in the corner. One can think of it as the @xmath\nnode in Fig. B.1 (the @xmath node is absent in this case). Then it is\neasy to see that the integral equations will be\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nor in the notations @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe role of @xmath and @xmath can be interchanged depending on the\nsituation.\n\nIf the terminating node of the Kac-Dynkin diagram is a bosonic one, then\nin the terms of Fig. B.1 there is no @xmath and @xmath node. The corner\nresolvent will be @xmath . The integral equation for it is written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe did not found a particularly nice equation that follows from the\ngiven one.\n\n### Appendix C Solution of the crossing equations in the mirror theory.\n\nThe goal of this appendix is to show how the solution [ V3 ] of the\ncrossing equations can be modified to be applicable in the mirror\ntheory. The mirror theory is the initial point for the construction of\nthe thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz. It was formulated in [ 41 , 42 ] as the\nanalytical continuation of the physical theory. The dressing phase was\nalso found there as the analytical continuation. We would use a\ndifferent way and define the mirror theory from the bootstrap approach.\nThis would give us mirror crossing equations solution of which leads to\nthe mirror dressing phase.\n\nWhile in the physical theory the physical region is defined by the\ncondition @xmath , in the mirror theory the physical region is defined\nby the condition @xmath [ 42 ] . Therefore let us define a mirror\nJukowsky variable @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nfor which condition @xmath is satisfied \u00b9 \u00b9 1 Mirror Zhukovsky variables\nwhere also used in [ 47 ] . Mirror and physical Zhukovsky variables are\nrelated by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.2)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nThe mirror theory is conjectured to be integrable. It has the same\nsymmetry algebra as the physical theory. Therefore we can apply the\nbootstrap approach similarly as it was done for the physical theory. We\nwould get then the Bethe Ansatz equations with the central node equation\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere dots stay for the interaction with the Bethe roots from nested\nlevels. This interaction as well as the nested Bethe equations are\nexactly the same as in ( 6.41 ) except for the replacement @xmath .\n\nThe dressing phase @xmath does not coincide with the dressing phase of\nthe physical theory. We will now formulate the mirror crossing equations\nwhich this dressing phase should satisfy. The crossing equations can be\nderived by simple modification for the case of the mirror theory of the\napproach of Janik [ 16 ] . These equations now read\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the @xmath stands for the analytical continuation over the contour\n@xmath shown in Fig. C.1 . Note that @xmath is not the same contour as\nwas used for the crossing transformation in the physical theory. In\nfact, @xmath .\n\nSolution of ( C.4 ) undergoes the same steps as in the case of the\nphysical theory. The only difference is that instead of the cut @xmath (\n@xmath ) we use the cut @xmath ( @xmath ). Therefore the solution of the\nmirror crossing equations is given by the following expression:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nLet us find the relation between physical dressing factor @xmath and the\nmirror dressing factor @xmath . For this we first need establish the\nrelation between @xmath and @xmath . When @xmath has singularities only\nin the lower half plane then\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.7)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nIf @xmath has singularities only in the upper half plane then\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.8)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nIf @xmath has singularities in the lower and the upper half planes then\nwe have to represent @xmath as a sum of two functions and then apply ( C\n) and ( C.8 ).\n\nBy application of transformations ( C ) and ( C.8 ) to the mirror\ndressing factor ( C.5 ) we obtain in the region @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.9)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nTherefore equation ( C.3 ) can be also written in the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere \u201dan.cont.\u201d means that expression in brackets is obtained by\nanalytical continuation from the region @xmath to the real values of\n@xmath and @xmath . Except for this analytical continuation, the r.h.s.\nof ( C.10 ) coincides with the r.h.s. of the Bethe Ansatz equation (\n6.47 ) for the @xmath sector of the physical theory.\n\nWe are now at the point to compare our considerations with the results\nobtained in the literature. The mirror theory was initially formulated\nas analytical continuation of the physical theory, the mirror dressing\nphase was defined not in the way that we define it here, but by the\nanalytical continuation of @xmath .\n\nIt was shown that the bound states of magnons in the mirror theory\nappear for the excitations on the AdS [ 42 ] (in the physical theory\nanalogical bound states appeared for excitations on @xmath ), therefore\nthe @xmath sector was considered for the asymptotic Bethe Ansatz. The\nBethe equations for this sector were given in the form ( C.10 ) [ 42 ] .\nThen after studying of the mirror dressing phase and the dressing phase\nfor bound states obtained from fusion it was realized that the product\nof the mirror dressing phase and the BDS factor @xmath has much simple\nanalytical properties [ 47 , 213 , 247 ] . The product of the mirror\ndressing phase and the BDS factor was called in [ 213 ] the improved\ndressing phase. A representation analogical to ( C.5 ) was first time\nderived in [ 47 ] .\n\nIn our approach we define the mirror theory purely by the bootstrap\nmethod and therefore without any reference to the physical theory. We\nsee that what is called in [ 213 ] the improved dressing phase is in\nfact a true dressing phase of the mirror theory which follows from the\nsolution of the crossing equations ( C.4 ).\n\nLet us finally comment on the dressing factor for the magnon bound\nstates. The magnon bound states from the point of view of the Bethe\nAnsatz are string-type configurations [ 248 ] , exactly as in the case\nof XXX spin chain. Using the notations of section 1.3 we can write down\nthe dressing factor for the interaction of @xmath -string and @xmath\n-string as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen, using representation ( C.5 ) we can immediately see that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn fact, the same derivation can be made in the physical theory. We have\njust to replace @xmath with @xmath .\n\nA word of caution should made here. Derivation of ( C.12 ) based on the\nstring configurations is not valid in the strip where Zhukovsky cut is\ndefined. This is a strip @xmath for the physical theory and @xmath for\nthe mirror theory. However, once the dressing factor ( C.12 ) is\nestablished in the permitted region it can be smoothly continued to the\nforbidden strips.\n\n### Appendix D @xmath Heisenberg magnet. Technical details\n\nThe most general solution of ( 7.27 ) in the @xmath order is the\nfollowing\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (D.1)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nTo fix the coefficients @xmath and @xmath we should consider the\nfollowing solution in the double scaling limit\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (D.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nComparison of large @xmath expansion of @xmath and one that follows from\n( D.2 ) fixes the coefficients @xmath and @xmath to be\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (D.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n### Appendix E Mathematica code for asymptotic expansions\n\n#### e.1 Derivatives of the gamma functions\n\nFor the calculation of the asymptotic expansion of the cusp anomalous\ndimension and the energy density of the @xmath sigma model we need to\nknow the value of the following ratio:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (E.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn principle we can evaluate this ratio using the code\n\n            D[Gamma[x], {x, n}]\/Gamma[x] \/\/ FunctionExpand \/\/ Expand           \n\nHowever, this evaluation at large values of @xmath turns out to be the\nmost time consuming place in the whole recursive procedure. Therefore we\nwill present here a quicker code.\n\nThe code is based on the equality\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (E.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand its consequence for @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (E.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nUsing the fact that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (E.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the dots stay for the polynomial in @xmath with @xmath , we obtain\nthe recursive procedure to calculate ( E.1 ). The code for this\nrecursive procedure is the following:\n\n    DG[a_,1] := DG[a,1] = D[Log[Gamma[a+x]],x]\/. x->0\/\/FunctionExpand;\n    DG[a_,n_\/;n>1] := DG[a, n]=\n    (-1)^n Gamma[n]FunctionExpand@Zeta[n,a]-(D[Log[f[x]],{x,n}]\/.f[x]->1\n    \/.Derivative[n][f][x]->0\/.Derivative[m_][f][x]:>DG[m])\/\/Expand;\n\nBelow we will use a slightly modified version of this code.\n\n#### e.2 Cusp anomalous dimension\n\nWe reexpand the solution ( 8.23 ) in the double scaling limit ( 8.25 ):\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (E.5)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nThe inverse Laplace transform of this series is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.6)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.7)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nFrom the other side, the solution in the double scaling limit @xmath is\ngiven by ( 8.28 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (E.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nComparing ( E.6 ) and ( E.8 ) we see that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (E.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe coefficients @xmath are expanded in the power series of @xmath \u00b9 \u00b9 1\nThe recursion procedure that we build allows to express all the\ncoefficients as @xmath times a polynomial in @xmath ; @xmath due to (\nE.15 ). :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing this expansion we can find the coefficient for the @xmath term in\n( E.9 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the coefficient in the expansion\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince the l.h.s. of ( E.11 ) contains only nonpositive powers of @xmath\n, we conclude that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis gives us the recursion relation:\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (E.14)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nThis relation expresses \u00b2 \u00b2 2 @xmath and @xmath are related by ( E.7 ).\n@xmath in terms of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath with @xmath . Since\n@xmath for @xmath , the recursion finally allows to express @xmath in\nterms of @xmath . The latter cannot be found from the condition ( E.13\n). It is fixed by the normalization condition ( 8.1 ) which implies that\nthe coefficients @xmath satisfy the constraint\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe consequence of this constraint is that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis completes the recursive procedure and it can be implemented in\nMathemtica . The code is the following:                G              \n               = Gamma; ClearAll[a, F1, F2, F3, F4];              \n               a[0, 0] = 1; a[0, k_ \/; k < 0] = 0;              \n               a[0, k_] := a[0, k] = - Sum[a[n, k - n] + a[-n, k - n], {n, 1, k}];              \n               F1[n_, k_, s_] :=  F1[n, k, s] =              \n               FunctionExpand[(              \n               G                              [1 + s\/4]              \n               G                              [n+s\/4])\/(              \n               G              \n               [1 + s\/4 - k]              \n               G                              [s\/4 - k])]\/              \n               G                              [k + 1];              \n               F2[n_, p_, s_] :=  F2[n, p, s] =              \n               FunctionExpand[              \n               G                              [n + s\/4]\/              \n               G              \n               [n - p + s\/4]];              \n               F3[n_, p_, k_, s_] :=  F3[n, p, k, s] =              \n               FunctionExpand[(              \n               G                              [n + s\/4]              \n               G              \n               [n + k - p + 1 + s\/4])\/(              \n               G              \n               [n + 1 + s\/4 - p]                             \n               G              \n               [n + s\/4 - p])]\/              \n               G                              [k + 1];              \n               F4[n_, p_, k_, s_] :=  F4[n, p, k, s] =              \n               FunctionExpand[(              \n               G                              [n + s\/4]              \n               G              \n               [1 + s\/4 - n - k + p])\/(              \n               G              \n               [n + 1 + s\/4 - p]                             \n               G              \n               [n + s\/4 - p])]\/              \n               G              \n               [2 p + 1 - 2 n - k];              \n\n    a[n_ \/; n != 0, m_] :=  a[n, m] =  Block[{s = Sign[n], nn = Abs[n]},\n      - Expand@Plus@@Expand\/@{\n      Sum[invT[s, nn + k] F1[nn, k, s] a[0, m - k], {k, 0, m}],\n      Sum[invT[s, p] F2[nn, p, s] a[s (nn - p), m], {p, 1, nn - 1}],\n      Sum[invT[s, p] F3[nn, p, k, s] a[s (nn+k-p),m-k],{k,1,m},{p,0,k+nn-1}],\n      Sum[invT[s, p] F4[nn, p, k, s] a[-s(nn+k-p),m-k],{k,1,m},{p,0,k+nn-1}]}];\n\nThe function            invT[s, p]           encodes @xmath .

The result\nobtained in this way is however not well structured, its further\nsimplification is time consuming. Here we will give another code for\n             invT[s,p]             that leads from the beginning to a\nnice representation of the result.\n\nWe evaluate the derivatives of the gamma functions as was explained in\nsection E.1 . This evaluation is the recursive procedure with @xmath as\nthe input. In our case @xmath . For these particular values of @xmath we\nhave the following explicit expressions:\n\nfor @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.18)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nfor @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.19)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe ratios @xmath for even values of @xmath and @xmath for odd vales of\n@xmath are rational numbers.\n\nLet us look more carefully on the structure of the recursive procedure\nwhich takes ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ) as the input and gives @xmath as the\noutput. Each coefficient @xmath has an overall multiplier @xmath due to\nthe expansion over the combination @xmath . Except for this\nmultiplication all the operations which are involved in the recursive\nprocedure reduce to the polynomial combinations, with rational\ncoefficients, of ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ).\n\n###### Cancelation of logarithms and @xmath.\n\nAs was initially observed in [ 32 ] , the coefficients of the expansion\nof the scaling function do not contain @xmath if to expand over the\nshifted constant @xmath . The coefficients of the expansion also do not\ncontain @xmath . We checked these observations up to the tenth order and\nwill assume that they are true for arbitrary order. Using this\nassumption and the rational structure of the recursive procedure, we can\nput @xmath and @xmath in ( E.18 ).\n\n###### The property of maximal transcendentality.\n\nLet us assign the transcendentality @xmath to @xmath of odd argument and\nto @xmath of even argument. We assign transcendentality 0 to @xmath and\nto rational numbers. As we checked up to the tenth order and assume to\nbe true for any order, the coefficient @xmath of the expansion ( E.17 )\nhas the transcendentality @xmath which is the maximal possible\ntranscendentality at this order. This was initially observed also in [\n32 ] . Due to this property we can leave only the terms with maximal\ntranscendentality in ( E.18 ) and ( E.2 ). We put @xmath in ( E.18 ) and\n@xmath in ( E.2 ).\n\nAfter these simplifications we can put @xmath in the combination @xmath\n. Indeed, since @xmath is now the only place where @xmath appears,\n@xmath becomes an overall multiplier and can be restored at the end of\nthe calculation ( @xmath should contain @xmath as an overall\nmultiplier).\n\nUsing these simplifications, we propose the following code for @xmath :\n\n                            G             \n              = Gamma;ClearAll[DG, DGp, D1G, invT];             \n\n              DG[1] = 0; DGp[1] = 0; DG[0] = 1; DGp[0] = 1; D1G[0] = 1;             \n\n              DG[n_ \/; n > 1] := DG[n] = Expand[             \n\n              (-1)^n                            G             \n              [n] If[EvenQ[n],  0,             \n              \\[Zeta]             \n              [n]] - (D[Log[h[x]], {x, n}]             \n\n              \/.h[x] -> 1\/.

Derivative[m_][h][x] :> DG[m]];             \n\n              invT[_, 0] = 1; invT[_, 1] = 0;             \n\n              invT[1, p_ \/; p >= 2] := invT[1, p] =             \n\n              Expand@Sum[(-1\/2)^p 1\/(             \n              G                            [r + 1]             \n              G             \n              [p - r + 1]) DGp[r] D1G[p - r],{r, 0, p}];             \n\n              invT[-1, p_ \/; p >= 2] := invT[-1, p] =             \n\n              Expand@(invT[1, p] \/.             \n              \\[Beta]                            [x_] -> (-             \n              \\[Beta]                            [x]));             \n\nNow we can evaluate @xmath , using the improved definition of\n              invT[s,p]              . For example, the first five\norders are given by\n                 In=   Table[f[n]\/\\[Pi]^n, {n, 0, 4}]\/\/Expand                \n\n              Out=  {4, 0, -(              @xmath\n              [2]\/\\[Pi]^2), -((27              @xmath\n              [3])\/32\/\\[Pi]^3),             \n\n              -(2              @xmath\n              [2]^2 + (21              @xmath\n              [4])\/4)\/\\[Pi]^4}             \n\nThe result coincides with the one given in [ 32 ] . This code allows to\ncalculate first 10 orders in few seconds and first 30 orders in half of\nan hour.\n\n#### e.3 Energy density of the @xmath sigma model\n\nIn chapter 9 we gave a general form of the perturbative expansion of the\nresolvent in the large @xmath limit ( 9.25 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe replace in ( E.21 ) @xmath with the double scaling variable @xmath ,\nperform large @xmath expansion, and make the inverse Laplace transform (\n9.28 ). To do these steps it is useful to represent @xmath as @xmath .\nThe result is:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (E.22)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThis expression should be equal to the solution in the double scaling\nlimit ( 9.3 ):\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.23)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nTo obtain the expression of type ( E.3 ) we should perform a small\n@xmath expansion of ( E.3 ). Before doing this let us rewrite the\nargument of the exponent in @xmath in the following way:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe asymptotic expansion of the energy density @xmath can be expressed\nas @xmath times a power series in @xmath and @xmath . Due to the\nexpected renorm-group properties of the solution it is possible to\nintroduce a such coupling constant @xmath that this series will be\nexpressed as the power series of the coupling constant. Assuming this\nproperty, which we checked up to 10 first orders, we replace @xmath with\nzero. Below we give a more accurate explanation of this step.\n\nNote that to derive the correct expansion of @xmath and @xmath in the\npowers of @xmath and @xmath , given by ( 9.34 ) \u00b3 \u00b3 3 We leave the\nderivation of ( 9.34 ), which requires keeping the term @xmath , as an\nexercise for a curious reader (see also formula (22) in [ V2 ] ). The\nlogic of the derivation remains the same, even if @xmath is present. ,\nwe cannot do the replacement @xmath . It is only admissible when our\ngoal is to express @xmath in terms of the coupling constant.\n\nWithin @xmath , expansion of ( E.3 ) at small @xmath leads to:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (E.25)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe requirement\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (E.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nunambiguously fixes the coefficients @xmath and @xmath in a recursive\nway. To express @xmath in terms of @xmath and @xmath known from the\nearlier steps of recursion we need to consider ( E.26 ) with @xmath ,\n@xmath , @xmath . To do the same for @xmath we need to consider ( E.26 )\nwith @xmath , @xmath , @xmath . The recursion procedure allows to\nexpress @xmath and @xmath in terms of @xmath which is explicitly known.\n\nAmong all the equations ( E.26 ) with @xmath we use only those for which\n@xmath . All the other equations with @xmath can serve for the\nverification of the self-consistency of our solution.\n\nThe evaluation of the derivatives of the gamma-functions is made using\nthe trick of Sec. E.1 . As in the case of the cusp anomalous dimension,\na special structure of the answer allows to simplify this calculation.\nAs we observed up to tenth order, the coefficients of asymptotic\nexpansion are given in terms of zeta-functions of odd argument and\nrational numbers only. Assuming that this property holds at any order,\nwe perform the following replacements in @xmath : @xmath , @xmath ,\n@xmath .\n\nThe Mathematica code for the recursive procedure is the following:\n\n    (* Derivatives of the gamma functions *)\n    ClearAll[DG, G, subs]; G = Gamma;\n    subs = {_Log -> 0, EulerGamma -> 0, \\[Pi] -> 0, Zeta -> \\[Zeta]};\n    DG[_, 0] = 1;\n    DG[a_List, n_?IntegerQ \/; n > 0] := DG[a, n] =\n      Block[{f, y}, (Plus @@ FunctionExpand@ Flatten[\n      {1, -1} D[Log@G@a, {x, n}] \/. x -> 0] \/. subs) -\n      (D[Log[f[y]], {y, n}] \/. f[y] -> 1 \/.

{"input":"## Chapter 1 Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Introduction\n\nIn many practical situations involving a propagating flame,\ninhomogeneities are present in the mixture through which the flame\npropagates. These inhomogeneities can be caused by fluctuations or\nstratifications in the temperature, the composition or the flow field .\nUnderstanding the effects of such inhomogeneities on the propagation and\nstability of laminar flames in simple configurations is crucial to\nprovide a platform for further investigations that take into account\nmore complex aspects such as turbulence. Similarly, since in most\napplications combustion generates large amounts of heat and occurs in a\ngravitational field, it is vital to understand the combined effects of\nthermal expansion and buoyancy on flame propagation and stability in\nsuch simple situations.\n\nThe aim of this thesis is to investigate the combined effect of thermal\nexpansion and buoyancy on the propagation and stability of flames\npropagating through inhomogeneous mixtures. The inhomogeneity is\nprescribed in the unburned gas, into which the flame propagates, in one\nof two ways: either a) as a non-uniform flow field against which a\npremixed flame propagates, or b) as a stratification in the\nconcentrations of the fuel and oxidiser, which leads to the propagation\nof a triple flame. The simple configuration considered throughout the\nthesis is a channel with rigid walls that are impermeable to the fluid.\nWe begin with a brief literature review that summarises the work done in\nthe areas relevant to each chapter of the thesis. More thorough reviews\nand descriptions of further areas of relevance to each chapter are\ncontained within the chapters themselves and the papers by Pearce and\nDaou [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , on which much of this thesis is based.\n\nThe coupling between the flame and the flow is modelled with the\nNavier\u2013Stokes equations, coupled to equations for the temperature and\nthe mass fractions of fuel and oxidiser, with a one-step Arrenhius\nreaction. A short derivation of the governing equations is given in \u00a7\n1.2 of this chapter. Before discussing work that has been undertaken\nusing these governing equations, it is instructive to first note a\nsimplification that has been used in many studies, known as the constant\ndensity approximation . This approximation neglects the effect of the\nflame on the flow by assuming that the density of the fluid is constant.\nThe effect of the flow on the flame is taken into account through the\nadvection term in the temperature and mass fraction equations, where the\nflow can be prescribed. The approximation has been justified\nasymptotically from the governing equations of combustion theory in the\nlimit of weak heat release in [ 4 ] . Decoupling the temperature and\nmass fraction equations from the Navier\u2013Stokes equations considerably\nsimplifies combustion problems and has been useful for investigating,\nfor example, the so-called thermo-diffusive [ 5 ] instabilities in\ncombustion, which arise due to differences in the rate of transport of\nfuel and oxidiser. Although we are not concerned with such instabilities\nin this thesis, we occasionally utilise the constant density\napproximation, either for comparison of results to help understand the\neffects of thermal expansion, or in order to investigate an effect that\narises from combustion without having to account for the complex\ninteractions brought about by the effect of the flame on the fluid\nthrough which it propagates.\n\nAnother significant simplification of the governing equations of\ncombustion was utilised by Darrieus and Landau in their early studies on\nthe stability of a planar premixed flame [ 6 , 7 ] . These studies took\nthe effect of the flame on the flow into account through thermal\nexpansion but ignored the transport of temperature and mass fractions.\nDarrieus and Landau found using this approximation that a planar flame\nshould always be unstable due to the difference in density across the\nflame. Planar flames can, however, be observed in the laboratory; the\nanalysis of Darrieus and Landau fails at short wavelengths, where\ntransport processes inside the flame influence the flame structure and\nvelocity [ 8 ] . The hydrodynamic or Darrieus\u2013Landau instability of\npremixed flames has been the focus of several studies, as reviewed in [\n9 ] .\n\nLater studies investigated the effects of a full coupling between the\nNavier\u2013Stokes and the transport equations on the propagation speed and\nstability of premixed flames in the limit of infinite activation energy\nand an infinitely thin flame front [ 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ] . These\nstudies provided the necessary correction terms to the dispersion\nrelation derived by Darrieus and Landau, finding that planar premixed\nflames can indeed be stable. Since the aforementioned studies, there has\nbeen a significant amount of work investigating the effects of thermal\nexpansion on the propagation and stability of thin flames in both\nlaminar and turbulent regimes (see e.g. the reviews given in [ 8 , 9 ,\n15 ] ).\n\nThere has been significantly less work, however, on thick flames, which\ncorrespond to flames in relatively narrow channels. These are the focus\nof Chapter 2 of this thesis. Since the development of a suitable\nanalytical methodology based on a thick flame asymptotic limit by Daou\net\u00a0al. [ 16 ] , studies on thick flames in the constant density\napproximation have addressed the effect of heat loss [ 16 , 17 ] , the\neffect of nonunity Lewis numbers [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] and the influence of\noscillatory flow [ 21 ] . More recently, the influence of thermal\nexpansion on thick flames has been investigated [ 22 , 23 ] under\ndifferent distinguished limits of the governing parameters. In Chapter 2\n, which is based on work by Pearce and Daou [ 3 ] , we extend the\nknowledge of premixed flame propagation by investigating thick premixed\nflames subject to the effects of thermal expansion in cases where the\nprescribed flow against which the flame propagates has infinitely large\namplitude. The results of the analysis in this distinguished limit are\nrelevant to several important topics of research, as will be discussed\nin more detail in Chapter 2 .\n\nOne such topic of interest is the so-called bending effect of turbulent\ncombustion. The bending effect is observed experimentally when the\neffective flame speed @xmath of a premixed flame is plotted versus the\nturbulence intensity [ 24 ] . In Chapter 3 we provide a discussion of\nthe bending effect in laminar premixed flames and explain how this\nrelates to turbulent combustion. The main motivation in this chapter is\nto describe the relevance of asymptotic results in the thick flame\nasymptotic limit to the bending effect.\n\nAs well as investigating the effect of inhomogeneities in the flow on\npremixed flames, in this thesis we also investigate combustion in\ninhomogeneous mixtures of fuel and oxidiser, in the same channel\nconfiguration as the one utilised in Chapters 2 and 3 . Premixed flames\ncan still propagate through mixtures with small fluctuations in the\ntemperature or the concentrations of fuel and oxidiser. There have been\nseveral studies investigating how such fluctuations affect the\npropagation and stability of premixed flames (see [ 25 ] and the\nreferences therein). However, if the fuel and oxidiser are stratified, a\ndifferent structure known as a triple flame propagates through the\nmixture. Triple flames consist of a fuel-rich premixed branch, a\nfuel-lean premixed branch and a trailing diffusion flame.\n\nTriple flames were first identified experimentally by Phillips [ 26 ] .\nInitial theoretical investigations were carried out by Ohki and Tsuge [\n27 ] , followed by Dold and collaborators [ 28 , 29 ] . Much research\nhas focused on triple flames and their properties since, mostly\nconcerning triple flames in the constant density approximation (see the\nreview papers [ 30 ] and [ 31 ] ). The first work to investigate the\neffects of thermal expansion on triple flames was a mainly numerical\nstudy by Ruetsch et\u00a0al. [ 32 ] . There have been several studies since\nthat have investigated the effects of thermal expansion on triple flames\n[ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ] , with a key result being the increase in triple\nflame speed due to thermal expansion above that of the planar premixed\nflame, when the flame-front is thin (corresponding to a wide channel).\n\nOne aspect of triple flames that is not very well understood is the\neffect of buoyancy on their propagation and stability. Triple flames\npropagating in a direction parallel to the direction of gravity have\nbeen investigated numerically and experimentally in [ 37 , 38 , 39 , 40\n] . It was found that the propagation speed of a triple flame\npropagating downwards is decreased in comparison to that of a triple\nflame in the absence of gravity. The change in the propagation speed was\nexplained in [ 39 ] as being due to an increase in the acceleration of\nthe gas ahead of the triple flame leading edge, caused by buoyancy.\nConversely, upward propagation leads to an increase in the propagation\nspeed. It seems, however, that no prior dedicated studies have been\nundertaken on triple flames propagating in a direction perpendicular to\ngravity. In this thesis we provide such a study.\n\nIn order to investigate the effect of buoyancy on a triple flame, it is\nimperative to first understand this effect on the \u201cstrongly burning\u201d\ndiffusion flame, which forms one of the triple flame\u2019s branches;\nsteadily propagating triple flames are only expected for parameter\nvalues where a planar diffusion flame exists and is stable. For this\nreason Chapter 4 of this thesis contains a stability analysis of a\nhorizontal planar diffusion flame, subject to the combined effect of\nthermal expansion and gravity. The chapter is based on work by Pearce\nand Daou [ 2 ] , which seems to be the first study in the literature to\ninvestigate the instability of a planar diffusion flame due to\nbuoyancy-driven convection.\n\nIn Chapter 5 we move on to investigate the combined effect of thermal\nexpansion and gravity on triple flames steadily propagating\nperpendicular to the direction of gravity, using the results of Chapter\n4 to concentrate on areas in parameter space where the planar diffusion\nflame is stable. The original published work by Pearce and Daou [ 1 ]\nseems to be the first dedicated study of this aspect of triple flame\nbehaviour.\n\nTo complete our investigation of the combined effect of thermal\nexpansion and gravity on triple flames, in Chapter 6 we study the\ntransient behaviour of triple flames from their initiation in contexts\nwhere the underlying planar diffusion flame is either stable or\nunstable. Included in this study is an investigation of the energy\nrequired for initiation of triple flames from a two-dimensional ignition\nkernel. Steady, non-propagating, two-dimensional solutions representing\n\u201cflame tubes\u201d are determined; their thermal energy is used to define a\nminimum ignition energy for the two-dimensional triple flame in the\nmixing layer. Similar axisymmetric structures representing inhomogeneous\nflame balls [ 41 , 42 ] , flame disks [ 43 ] and flame isolas [ 44 ]\nhave previously been identified and linked to the ignition of\naxisymmetric flames in the mixing layer, but to our understanding, no\nsuch study has yet been performed for two-dimensional triple flames in\nthe mixing layer.\n\nThe thesis is structured as follows. The remainder of the current\nchapter is given to a theoretical background of mathematical combustion,\nincluding the derivation of the governing equations and some quantities\nused for scaling throughout the thesis. Chapter 2 contains a study of\nthe effects of thermal expansion on premixed flames propagating through\na narrow channel against a parallel flow of large intensity. Chapter 3\nfocuses on the bending effect of laminar premixed flames. Chapter 4\nconsists of an investigation of the instability of a planar diffusion\nflame, caused by buoyancy-driven convection. Chapter 5 discusses the\nbehaviour of steadily propagating triple flames under the combined\neffect of buoyancy and thermal expansion. Chapter 6 presents a study of\ntwo-dimensional triple flame initiation in mixing layers. Finally, we\nend the thesis with conclusions and recommendations for further study in\nChapter 7 .\n\n### 1.2 Theoretical background\n\n#### 1.2.1 Governing equations\n\nIn this section we provide the governing equations of combustion theory,\nwith an overview of their derivation from a continuum mechanics\nperspective. Expanded versions of the derivation (including the\nderivation of the transport equations using the kinetic theory of gases)\ncan be found in [ 45 ] and [ 46 ] . The derivation of the general\ngoverning equations of continuum mechanics can be found in [ 47 ] . A\ngeneral introduction to fluid dynamics, including a derivation of the\nNavier\u2013Stokes equations, is given in [ 48 ] .\n\nConsider a fixed control volume @xmath , depicted in figure 1.1 . The\nvolume is bounded by a control surface @xmath with outer unit normal\n@xmath . A bulk velocity @xmath passes through the volume. Note that the\nmass-weighted @xmath is the resultant of the individual velocities\n@xmath of the @xmath individual species, so that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the density of each species. Then the molecular\ndiffusion velocity @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nEquations ( 1.1 ) and ( 1.2 ) lead to\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nNow, consider some extensive property @xmath , whose magnitude depends\non the size of the control volume @xmath . Then a quantity @xmath ,\nwhose magnitude does not depend on the size of @xmath , can be\nconsidered to be the \u201cdensity\u201d of @xmath per unit volume of the fluid.\nThe two quantities can be related by the formula\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nSuppose the amount of @xmath changes due to external influences at a\nrate given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is an effective density of source strength. The rate of\nchange of @xmath is given by the amount of @xmath lost through the\nsurface @xmath plus the increase of @xmath associated with external\ninfluences [ 48 ] . This statement may be written mathematically as\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (1.6)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nRearranging and applying the divergence theorem and Leibniz\u2019s rule to (\n1.6 ) gives\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere we have used the fact that @xmath is fixed. The left hand side of\n( 1.7 ) is referred to as the material time derivative of @xmath [ 47 ]\n. Equation ( 1.7 ) will now be used to derive the conservation equations\nfor mass, momentum, energy and the concentration of species.\n\n##### Conservation of mass\n\nLet @xmath be the total mass @xmath of the fluid. Then @xmath is the\nmass density @xmath of the fluid. Since matter can neither be created\nnor destroyed, the quantity ( 1.5 ) can be set to zero in this case.\nThen equation ( 1.7 ) becomes\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nor, since the control volume @xmath is arbitrary,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nEquation ( 1.8 ) is the continuity equation .\n\n##### Conservation of momentum\n\nLet @xmath be the momentum of the flow, @xmath . Then @xmath is the\nmomentum flux @xmath . In this case the material time derivative ( 1.7 )\nis given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the resultant force acting on the fluid. This follows\nfrom Newton\u2019s second law, which states that the force acting on the\nfluid is equal to the rate of change of the fluid\u2019s momentum. We can\nsplit the resultant force @xmath into two parts: the force acting on the\nsurface of @xmath , represented by the stress tensor @xmath , and the\nresultant of the body forces @xmath per unit mass, acting on the @xmath\nth species [ 45 , 47 , 46 , 48 ] . The surface force is given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nusing the divergence theorem. Thus, equation ( 1.7 ) becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a dyadic tensor. Using equation ( 1.8 ) and the fact\nthat @xmath is arbitrary, we can rewrite equation ( 1.10 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor a viscous Newtonian fluid the stress tensor @xmath can be written as\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (1.12)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the pressure, @xmath is the dynamic viscosity and @xmath\nis the unit tensor. This form of the stress tensor for fluids, along\nwith physical descriptions of the meaning of each term, is discussed in\n[ 47 ] and [ 48 ] .\n\nWe assume the only external body force acting on the fluid is gravity.\nSince gravitational acceleration is the same for all species this leads\nto\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, if the viscosity @xmath does not depend on the temperature of\nthe fluid, which we assume for simplicity throughout this thesis, we\nhave, using ( 1.11 ), ( 1.12 ) and ( 1.13 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquation ( 1.14 ) is referred to as the Navier\u2013Stokes equation .\n\n##### Conservation of species\n\nLet @xmath be the mass @xmath of the @xmath th species. Then @xmath is\nthe density @xmath of the @xmath th species. The mass of the @xmath th\nspecies inside @xmath can be changed either as a result of a chemical\nreaction, with rate of production @xmath of the @xmath th species per\nunit volume, or due to diffusion across @xmath . The magnitude of this\ndiffusive transport is proportional to the mass flux @xmath of the\nmolecular random motion [ 46 ] and can be written\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nusing the divergence theorem. In this case the quantity ( 1.5 ) is given\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nso that, using the fact that @xmath is arbitrary, equation ( 1.7 )\nbecomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, defining the mass fraction of the @xmath th species as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand using equation ( 1.8 ), we can write equation ( 1.16 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, assuming Fick\u2019s law (see [ 45 ] or [ 46 ] for a derivation in\nthis context), which states\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the diffusion coefficient of the @xmath th species, we\ncan write equation ( 1.18 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere we have assumed @xmath is constant. We will discuss the form of the\nreaction term @xmath later.\n\n##### Conservation of energy\n\nLet @xmath be the total energy of the material inside @xmath . The total\nenergy can be written as @xmath , where @xmath is the kinetic energy and\n@xmath is the internal energy [ 47 ] . In this case @xmath can be\nwritten as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is the internal energy density and the term on the right\nhand side defines the kinetic energy of the fluid. The energy of the\nfluid inside @xmath can be changed by work done by the surface or body\nforces, or by energy entering @xmath through the boundary @xmath ; we\nignore radiative heat transfer. Thus equation ( 1.7 ) becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis due to the energy flux @xmath across @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis the work done by the surface forces acting on @xmath , and\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis the work done by the body forces acting on each species in @xmath ,\nwhich are moving at @xmath . Note that the divergence theorem was used\nin rewriting the above equations. Using equations ( 1.21 )\u2013( 1.24 ) and\nthe fact that @xmath is arbitrary leads to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, taking the scalar product of equation ( 1.11 ) with @xmath and\nsubtracting from ( 1.25 ), we obtain a simpler form of the energy\nconservation equation, given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the symbol @xmath indicates that the two tensors are to be\ncontracted twice to form a scalar [ 45 ] . We now make several\nassumptions to simplify the energy conservation equation ( 1.26 ).\nFirstly, we define the enthalpy @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSecondly, from ( 1.12 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we assume the viscous dissipation [ 48 ] term @xmath , with @xmath\ndefined in ( 1.12 ), takes the value\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is justifiable for low speed, subsonic flows [ 46 ] . Thirdly, we\nassume the energy flux @xmath takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the first term on the right hand side results from Fourier\u2019s law\nof heat conduction, and the second term is due to partial enthalpy\ntransport by diffusion [ 46 ] ; for simplicity, we assume the thermal\nconductivity @xmath is constant. In equation ( 1.30 ) the quantities\n@xmath relate to the enthalpy @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, if the body force is gravity, using ( 1.3 ) and ( 1.13 ), we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing equations ( 1.8 ) and ( 1.26 ), the assumptions ( 1.27 )\u2013( 1.32 ),\ntogether with the assumption that the process is isobaric, lead to the\nenthalpy equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, we assume the caloric equation of state [ 49 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the temperature and @xmath and @xmath are the reference\ntemperature and enthalpies, respectively. Here we have assumed that each\nspecies has the same constant specific heat capacity @xmath . Using (\n1.20 ), ( 1.31 ) and ( 1.34 ), equation ( 1.33 ) can be written in terms\nof the temperature as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere @xmath is the temperature change due to chemical reactions given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that @xmath can also be written in terms of the thermal diffusivity\n@xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have assumed @xmath is constant.\n\n##### Chemical reactions\n\nIn this section we prescribe the form of the chemical reaction terms\n@xmath in equations ( 1.20 ) and ( 1.36 ). Reactions in combustion\napplications can be extremely complicated, consisting of multi-step\nreactions of many different species. A summary of common reaction\nmechanisms used in mathematical modelling of combustion is given in [ 46\n] . Here we assume a simple, one-step reaction between fuel F and\noxidiser O\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath denote the amount of fuel and oxidiser in the\nreaction, respectively, and @xmath denotes the heat released in the\nreaction. Then\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith the Arrenhius law [ 50 ] assumed for the global reaction rate\n@xmath , given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the fuel\nmass fraction, the oxidiser mass fraction, the universal gas constant,\nthe temperature, the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy of\nthe reaction, respectively. Then the temperature change due to chemical\nreactions is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, substituting the relations ( 1.39 )\u2013( 1.42 ) into the equations (\n1.20 ) and ( 1.35 ) and rescaling the mass fractions by @xmath , we\nobtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.43)\n     @xmath      (1.44)\n     @xmath      (1.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the heat released per unit mass of fuel and @xmath is\nthe amount of oxidiser consumed per unit mass of fuel, given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n##### Equation of state\n\nWe complete the set of governing equations by specifying the ideal gas\nlaw equation of state [ 48 , 45 , 46 ] , which gives the pressure in\nterms of the density, the temperature and the universal gas constant\n@xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n##### Low Mach number approximation\n\nTo finish the formulation of the governing equations we adopt the low\nMach number approximation, common in flame theory and more rigorously\njustified using asymptotic analyses in several studies, such as those by\nRehm and Baum [ 51 ] and Majda and Sethian [ 52 ] . If we assume low\nMach number, the spatial variations in pressure are small. The total\npressure can therefore be split into a background term consisting of\nthermodynamic pressure and a perturbational term consisting of\nhydrostatic pressure and hydrodynamic pressure (see [ 51 ] ). We define\nthe hydrodynamic pressure as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is the thermodynamic pressure, which we assume to be\nconstant (see [ 50 , p. 14] ) and given by the equation of state ( 1.46\n) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere @xmath is the density in the absence of combustion. @xmath is the\nhydrostatic pressure which satisfies the equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is found by considering ( 1.14 ) in the frozen limit with no flow\n(i.e. in hydrostatic equilibrium) and noting that, following from\nequation ( 1.47 ), the ambient atmosphere in the absence of heating must\nbe taken to have constant density @xmath . Subtracting ( 1.48 ) from (\n1.14 ) then gives\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (1.49)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nNow, since\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is the Mach number (see [ 53 ] ), the perturbational\npressure term can be neglected in the ideal gas equation ( 4.6 ), which\ncan then be written @xmath or, after considering ( 1.47 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n##### Summary of governing equations\n\nThe governing equations ( 1.8 ), ( 1.43 )\u2013( 1.45 ), ( 1.49 ) and ( 1.50\n) can now be written together in full:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.51)\n     @xmath      (1.52)\n     @xmath      (1.53)\n     @xmath      (1.54)\n     @xmath      (1.55)\n     @xmath      (1.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the reaction term @xmath is given by ( 1.40 ). These equations\nmust be supplemented by suitable initial conditions and boundary\nconditions, which depend on the configuration and will be specified in\nfuture chapters.\n\n#### 1.2.2 Planar premixed flame\n\nA fundamental problem in combustion is the propagation of the planar\npremixed flame through an unbounded premixed gas. The asymptotic\nstructure of the planar premixed flame for large activation energies\n@xmath is shown in figure 1.2 . Throughout this thesis we will use\nseveral properties of the planar premixed flame as reference quantities,\nnamely the adiabatic flame temperature @xmath , the flame thickness\n@xmath and the propagation velocity @xmath . In this section we derive\nexpressions for these quantities.\n\nIn order to derive such expressions we utilise the well-known technique\nof activation energy asymptotics . This technique has been used\neffectively in many combustion studies, including generalisations of the\nfollowing analysis to more complex situations (see e.g. [ 10 , 11 , 12 ,\n13 , 14 ] ). The method relies on the fact that the activation energy of\nthe reaction is large, which is true in most combustion applications.\n\nThe governing equations of a planar premixed flame are given by the\nsteady, one-dimensional form of equations ( 1.51 )\u2013( 1.56 ). In a frame\nof reference attached to the flame-front, these equations become\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.57)\n     @xmath      (1.58)\n     @xmath      (1.59)\n     @xmath      (1.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe conditions far upstream as @xmath correspond to a fresh mixture with\nunburnt temperature @xmath and mass fractions @xmath and @xmath . Far\ndownstream as @xmath the conditions correspond to burnt gas where if we\nassume a stoichiometric mixture the temperature is adiabatic and the\nfuel and oxidiser have been fully consumed. The planar flame speed\n@xmath is defined as the speed of the incoming flow at @xmath in the\ncurrent frame of reference. The boundary conditions can be written\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.61)\n     @xmath      (1.62)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the density in the fresh mixture and @xmath is the\ndensity under adiabatic conditions. Note that ( 1.57 ) can be integrated\nto give @xmath , so that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.63)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n##### Planar flame temperature\n\nMultipling equation ( 1.59 ) by @xmath , then integrating from @xmath to\n@xmath and adding to the integral of equation ( 1.58 ) from @xmath to\n@xmath , gives the adiabatic flame temperature as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.64)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nhaving used the boundary conditions ( 1.61 )\u2013( 1.62 ).\n\n##### Planar flame speed\n\nUsing equations ( 1.58 )\u2013( 1.60 ) and ( 1.63 ) with the fact that @xmath\n, @xmath and @xmath are assumed constant, the governing equations for a\nplanar premixed flame can be written\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.65)\n     @xmath      (1.66)\n     @xmath      (1.67)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the subscript @xmath denotes diffusivities in the unburnt gas at\n@xmath . These equations can be non-dimensionalised by writing\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.68)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich after substitution into equations ( 1.65 )-( 1.67 ) and dropping\nthe superscript gives the non-dimensional governing equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.69)\n     @xmath      (1.70)\n     @xmath      (1.71)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.72)\n     @xmath      (1.73)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere we have noted that @xmath , based on our assumption that the\nmixture is stoichiometric. Substituting ( 1.68 ) into the boundary\nconditions ( 1.61 )\u2013( 1.62 ) leads to the non-dimensional boundary\nconditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.74)\n     @xmath      (1.75)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow we consider the commonly utilised limit of infinite activation\nenergy, @xmath . In this limit the reaction term is negligible to all\norders in @xmath , except in a thin layer corresponding to @xmath . Thus\nwe can split the domain into three zones: two outer zones consisting of\nthe preheat zone and the burnt gas and a thin inner zone consisting of\nthe reaction layer (see figure 1.2 ). In the outer zones the reaction\nrate is zero so that the equations ( 1.69 )\u2013( 1.71 ) become\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThese equations can be solved to give the outer solutions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.76)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the burnt gas we have @xmath to prevent unboundedness as @xmath ;\nthus from the boundary conditions ( 1.75 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn the preheat zone we have @xmath and @xmath from boundary conditions (\n1.74 ), which gives\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nThe outer fuel mass fraction profiles intersect at the point @xmath\nwhere @xmath . Since the problem is translationally invariant, we can\nchoose @xmath to be the origin so that @xmath . Thus the outer profiles\nare given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath      (1.77)\n     @xmath   @xmath      (1.78)\n  -- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe constants @xmath and @xmath in ( 1.77 ) can be determined by\nmatching with the inner solution. We begin by expanding both in terms of\n@xmath\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere superscripts are used to denote successive terms in inner\nexpansions in terms of @xmath . Now, since the reaction zone thickness\nis @xmath , we let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere we have anticipated that to leading order @xmath and @xmath inside\nthe reaction zone. Now, for a balance between the reaction and diffusion\nterms inside the reaction zone in equation ( 1.69 ), it is clear that\n@xmath . Also, since @xmath to leading order, we have @xmath to leading\norder. Thus we let\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.79)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHence the governing equations for the inner solution are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.80)\n     @xmath      (1.81)\n     @xmath      (1.82)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe boundary conditions on equations ( 1.80 )\u2013( 1.82 ) are now found by\nmatching with the outer solutions using the formula\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.83)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfor each dependent variable @xmath . Matching with the solution for the\nburnt gas, given in ( 1.78 ), gives\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.84)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nExpanding the solution for the temperature in the unburnt gas, given by\n( 1.77 ), as @xmath leads to\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nMatching with the inner solution as @xmath gives @xmath and thus\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.85)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSimilarly, it can be shown that @xmath , so that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.86)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, adding equations ( 1.80 ) and ( 1.81 ), we obtain\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich can be integrated twice, using boundary condition ( 1.84 ), to\nfind\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.87)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince this is also valid as @xmath , we have @xmath from boundary\nconditions ( 1.85 ) and ( 1.86 ). Similarly, adding equations ( 1.80 )\nand ( 1.82 ) and integrating with the use of ( 1.84 ) shows that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.88)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand thus @xmath from ( 1.85 ) and ( 1.86 ). Using ( 1.87 ) and ( 1.88 )\nwe can now write the inner problem as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.89)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.90)\n     @xmath      (1.91)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe problem ( 1.89 )\u2013( 1.91 ) can be solved by multiplying equation (\n1.89 ) by @xmath and integrating from @xmath to @xmath , using\nconditions ( 1.90 )-( 1.91 ), to find\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nso that, using ( 1.79 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.92)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand finally, inserting ( 1.92 ) into the definition of @xmath on the\nleft hand side of ( 1.73 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.93)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nto leading order in @xmath . This is the required result, giving the\nplanar premixed flame speed, with thermal expansion taken into account.\n\n##### Planar flame thickness\n\nThe planar flame thickness is defined by the diffusive length scale [ 10\n, 12 , 14 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.94)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n## Chapter 2 Taylor dispersion and thermal expansion effects on flame\npropagation in a narrow channel\n\n### 2.1 Introduction\n\nIn this chapter, which is based on a paper by Pearce and Daou [ 3 ] , we\nprovide a theoretical study of a variable density premixed flame\npropagating through a narrow channel against a Poiseuille flow of large\namplitude. Under these conditions, the dependence of the propagation\nspeed of the premixed flame on the Peclet number is investigated. The\nessential governing parameters are the flame-front thickness @xmath and\nthe amplitude of the flow @xmath (which together define the Peclet\nnumber @xmath ), as well as the activation energy of the reaction @xmath\n. The problem studied has relevance to several important areas of\nresearch.\n\nThe first area concerns premixed flames propagating through narrow\nchannels, which have been the subject of considerable renewed interest\nin recent years. In addition to traditional applications such as fire\nsafety in mine shafts [ 55 , p. 271] , recent applications are concerned\nwith emerging technologies that utilise microscale combustion [ 56 ] .\nRelated investigations have addressed the development of a suitable\nanalytical methodology, based on a thick flame asymptotic limit [ 16 ] ,\nthe effect of heat loss [ 16 , 17 ] , the effect of non-unity Lewis\nnumbers [ 18 , 19 , 20 ] , the influence of oscillatory flow [ 21 ] and\nthe influence of thermal expansion [ 22 , 23 ] under different\ndistinguished limits of the governing parameters. The asymptotic results\nin the current chapter can be considered to be an extension of the\nresults of Daou et\u00a0al. [ 16 ] and Short and Kessler [ 22 ] , who studied\nthe same configuration but in the limit of small Peclet number in the\nconstant density and variable density cases, respectively. A low value\nof @xmath is not the case, however, in many practical applications (see,\nfor example, the experimental results given in the review article [ 57 ]\n, which were obtained for a fixed value of @xmath ). For this reason the\nasymptotic analysis in the current study is performed in the limit\n@xmath with @xmath and numerical results are obtained for moderately\nlarge Peclet numbers.\n\nThe second area of research is related, albeit indirectly, to turbulent\ncombustion. At high values of @xmath the flame could become turbulent,\nan aspect of the problem not addressed here. Nevertheless, the results\nare still useful as a first step towards an understanding of the effects\nof the small scales in the flow on a turbulent premixed flame; at\npresent there seems to be no analytical description of even laminar\npremixed flames for arbitrary values of @xmath in situations where the\nflame is thick compared to the length scale of the flow. This latter\nsituation is fundamental to a proper evaluation of Damk\u00f6hler\u2019s second\nhypothesis [ 58 ] concerning the effect of small scale flow on turbulent\npremixed flames, which has received little attention in the literature.\nConversely, there have been many studies on turbulent premixed flames in\nthe flamelet regime of large flow scales compared to the flame thickness\n[ 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 ] , which was the subject of Damk\u00f6hler\u2019s first\nhypothesis. A detailed discussion of the relevance of Damk\u00f6hler\u2019s second\nhypothesis to turbulent premixed flames can be found in the paper by\nDaou et\u00a0al. [ 16 ] . A thorough review of turbulent combustion in\ngeneral can be found in the monograph by Peters [ 15 ] .\n\nThe third area of relevant research is Taylor dispersion, a well-studied\ntopic that began with Taylor\u2019s seminal paper discussing the enhanced\ndispersion of a solute due to a parallel flow in a channel [ 64 ] .\nTaylor investigated a distinguished limit characterised by a small\ndiffusion time in comparison to the advective time; in this limit the\ndepth-averaged concentration of the solute was shown to be governed by a\none-dimensional equation with an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath\n, which was found to be larger than the diffusion coefficient @xmath and\ndependent upon the profile of the parallel flow. Specifically, in the\ncase of a cylindrical channel of radius @xmath and an imposed Poiseuille\nflow of cross-sectional average @xmath , Taylor found the effective\ndiffusion coefficient to be given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nfor a solute with diffusion coefficient @xmath .\n\nA comprehensive review of the subject of Taylor dispersion can be found\nin the book by Brenner and Edwards [ 65 ] . Here we simply note that\nthere seem to be relatively few analytical studies in the literature\nthat investigate Taylor dispersion with a variable density flow (see [\n66 , 67 , 68 ] ). In these studies the effective diffusion coefficient\nhas been found to be a function of the density. Although there has been\na small number of studies on Taylor dispersion in reaction-diffusion\nequations (e.g. [ 69 ] ), this study is the first to discuss Taylor\ndispersion in the context of combustion. One of the limits taken in the\ncurrent chapter can be considered to characterise the Taylor regime of a\npremixed flame, whereby the flame is described by the one-dimensional\nplanar premixed flame equation with an effective diffusion coefficient.\nThe determination of the propagation speed (an eigenvalue representing\nthe speed of the travelling premixed flame) is intimately linked to the\neffective diffusion coefficient in the limit of infinite activation\nenergy. It is surprising that despite this direct link, Taylor\ndispersion does not yet seem to have been investigated in the context of\npremixed (laminar or turbulent) combustion.\n\nThe main aims of the investigation are: 1) to quantify the effect of a\nsmall-scale parallel (Poiseuille) flow on the propagation speed of a\npremixed flame for fixed values of the Peclet number, taking gas\nexpansion into account (see formula ( 2.53 ) later); 2) to demonstrate\nthat the enhancement of the propagation speed coincides exactly with the\nTaylor dispersion formula ( 2.1 ); 3) to provide an analytical\nconfirmation of Damk\u00f6hler\u2019s second hypothesis in our particular case\ncorresponding to a laminar flow with a single scale which is small\ncompared to the flame thickness (see the discussion in \u00a7 2.6 ). We\nbelieve that achieving these aims, albeit in a simplified adiabatic\ncontext (such as in [ 70 ] ), as is carried out in this study, is a\ncontribution of a fundamental nature that will provide a solid basis for\nfuture studies accounting for additional realistic effects. These\ninclude more complex multi-scale flows and the influence of heat losses,\nwhich are not accounted for here to concentrate on the pure interaction\nbetween the flow and the flame and to ensure that the analysis is\ntractable. The practical aspects of heat losses are known to be\nimportant in real micro-combustion applications; indeed, to minimise the\ninfluence of such heat losses, it is well known that thermal management\nis required experimentally, such as external wall heating [ 71 ] or heat\nrecirculation [ 72 , 73 ] ; see also the review by Fernandez-Pello [ 56\n] .\n\nThe chapter is structured as follows. In \u00a7 2.2 we formulate the problem.\n\u00a7 2.3 consists of an asymptotic analysis in the limit @xmath , with\n@xmath . In \u00a7 2.4 we consider the limit of infinite activation energy,\n@xmath , in order to provide an analytical description of the\npropagation speed in terms of @xmath . In \u00a7 2.5 we expand and discuss\nthe results of the preceding asymptotic analyses and compare with\nnumerical solutions of the governing equations, with particular emphasis\non describing the relationship between the effective propagation speed\n@xmath and Peclet number @xmath for several values of the flame front\nthickness @xmath and activation energy @xmath . Finally, a summary of\nthe main findings is given in \u00a7 2.6 .\n\n### 2.2 Formulation\n\nConsider a premixed flame propagating through a channel of height @xmath\n. Far upstream of the flame a fully developed Poiseuille flow, defined\nby\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis prescribed (see figure 2.1 ). The governing equations at low Mach\nnumber are given by the Navier\u2013Stokes equations coupled to equations for\ntemperature and mass fractions, along with the ideal gas equation of\nstate. The fluid velocity is given by @xmath . The combustion is\nmodelled as a single irreversible one-step reaction of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere F (assumed to be the deficient reactant) denotes the fuel and\n@xmath the heat released per unit mass of fuel.\nThe overall reaction rate @xmath is taken to follow an Arrhenius law of\nthe form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the\ndensity, the fuel mass fraction, the universal gas constant, the\ntemperature, the pre-exponential factor and the activation energy of the\nreaction, respectively. The flame propagates through the channel in the\n@xmath -direction with velocity @xmath , where @xmath is an eigenvalue\nto be determined as part of the solution to the problem.\nWith tilda denoting dimensional quantities, scaled non-dimensional\nvariables are introduced using\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe unit speed is taken to be\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich is the laminar burning speed of the planar flame for @xmath . Here\n@xmath is the adiabatic flame temperature, @xmath is the Zeldovich\nnumber or non-dimensional activation energy and @xmath is the thermal\nexpansion coefficient. The quantities @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath\ndenote the values of the temperature, fuel mass fraction and density in\nthe unburnt gas as @xmath , respectively.\nIn non-dimensional form the governing equations in a coordinate system\nattached to the flame front, which is travelling in the negative @xmath\n-direction at speed @xmath , are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.2)\n     @xmath      (2.3)\n     @xmath      (2.4)\n     @xmath      (2.5)\n     @xmath      (2.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nassuming that the thermal diffusivity @xmath and the fuel mass diffusion\ncoefficient @xmath satisfy @xmath . Here @xmath and @xmath is the\nhydrodynamic pressure.\nThe walls located at @xmath and @xmath are considered to be rigid and\nadiabatic. Symmetry conditions are applied at @xmath . The boundary\nconditions are therefore given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.7)\n     @xmath      (2.8)\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.9)\n     @xmath      (2.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nalong with suitable initial conditions. The non-dimensional parameters\nare defined as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich are the non-dimensional flame-front thickness, the Peclet number,\nthe fuel Lewis number and the Prandtl number, respectively. Here @xmath\nis the kinematic viscosity @xmath . Note that @xmath is the dimensional\nflame-front thickness given by @xmath and @xmath is the non-dimensional\namplitude of the imposed Poiseuille flow, @xmath . Finally, the\nnon-dimensional reaction rate @xmath is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe problem is now fully formulated and is given by equations ( 2.2 )-(\n2.6 ), with boundary conditions ( 2.7 )-( 2.10 ). The non-dimensional\nparameters in this problem are @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,\n@xmath and @xmath .\n\nNote that by integrating the steady form of equation ( 2.4 ) over the\nwhole domain, using the continuity equation ( 2.2 ) with the boundary\nconditions ( 2.7 )-( 2.10 ) and assuming total fuel consumption\ndownstream, we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the mean speed of the parallel inflow at @xmath .\nTherefore\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nappears as an effective propagation speed, as commonly defined in\nturbulent combustion. In the current study of a Poiseuille flow in a\nrectangular channel, using the boundary condition ( 2.9 ), the effective\npropagation speed is given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n### 2.3 Asymptotic analysis in the limit @xmath\n\nTo simplify the problem we consider the steady form of equations ( 2.2\n)-( 2.6 ) with unity Lewis number\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this case only the equation for temperature needs to be considered,\nsince @xmath . This follows from adding equations ( 2.4 ) and ( 2.5 )\nand using boundary conditions ( 2.9 ).\n\nWe now consider the limit @xmath with @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The\nflow amplitude @xmath for @xmath . We introduce a rescaled coordinate\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nso that the governing equations ( 2.2 )-( 2.6 ) become\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.16)\n     @xmath      (2.17)\n     @xmath      (2.18)\n     @xmath      (2.19)\n     @xmath      (2.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThese equations are subject to the boundary conditions ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8\n), with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.21)\n     @xmath      (2.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe now introduce expansions for @xmath in the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that here @xmath is the leading order approximation to the\neffective flame speed @xmath , defined in ( 2.13 ). Note also that the\nhorizontal velocity component @xmath is @xmath , due to the imposed\nPoiseuille flow at @xmath given by ( 2.21 ), while the vertical\ncomponent of the velocity @xmath is taken to be @xmath to balance the\ntwo terms in the continuity equation ( 2.16 ).\n\nSubstituting ( 2.23 ) into equations ( 2.16 )-( 2.19 ), we obtain to\nleading order\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.24)\n     @xmath      (2.25)\n     @xmath      (2.26)\n     @xmath      (2.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquations ( 2.26 ) and ( 2.27 ) can be integrated with respect to @xmath\nto give @xmath and @xmath , after using the boundary condition ( 2.7 )\non @xmath , so that @xmath from ( 2.20 ).\nNow, using a similar method to Short and Kessler [ 22 ] , we look for a\nseparable solution for @xmath in the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSubstitution of ( 2.28 ) into equation ( 2.25 ) gives\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a constant. Equation ( 2.29 ) can be integrated twice\nwith respect to @xmath , using the boundary conditions ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8\n), to yield\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nso that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath has been absorbed into @xmath .\nIntegrating equation ( 2.24 ) with respect to @xmath from @xmath to\n@xmath , we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nafter using boundary conditions ( 2.7 )-( 2.8 ) on @xmath . Equation (\n2.30 ) implies that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nusing the fact that @xmath from equation ( 2.20 ) and boundary condition\n( 2.21 ). Thus @xmath , so that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe continuity equation ( 2.24 ) can then be integrated with respect to\n@xmath , using ( 2.31 ) and condition ( 2.7 ), to yield\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, at @xmath in equation ( 2.19 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich, after using ( 2.31 ) and condition ( 2.7 ), can be integrated\ntwice with respect to @xmath to give\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNext we look to @xmath in equation ( 2.16 ) to find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquation ( 2.35 ) can be integrated first with respect to @xmath from\n@xmath to @xmath , utilising the boundary conditions ( 2.7 )-( 2.8 ) on\n@xmath , and then with respect to @xmath to give\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo evaluate @xmath , we use boundary conditions ( 2.21 ) to obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, at @xmath of equation ( 2.19 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath . Integrating ( 2.38 ) with respect to @xmath from @xmath\nto @xmath , taking into account the boundary conditions ( 2.7 )-( 2.8 )\non @xmath and substituting ( 2.31 ), ( 2.32 ), ( 2.34 ), ( 2.36 ) and (\n2.37 ), we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsubject to the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis shows that in the limit @xmath , with @xmath , the problem of a\nvariable density premixed flame in a two dimensional channel can be\nreduced to a one dimensional boundary value problem. Equation ( 2.39 )\nis the equation that would describe a premixed flame propagating through\na one-dimensional channel with an effective diffusion coefficient\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is an important result because it corresponds to a generalised form\n(accounting for variable density effects) of the effective diffusion\ncoefficient found when studying the effect of a Poiseuille flow on\nmixing in the non-reactive Taylor dispersion problem, originally\ninvestigated by Taylor [ 64 ] . A premixed flame in the limit @xmath ,\nwith @xmath can be therefore considered to be in the Taylor dispersion\nregime.\n\nThe boundary value problem ( 2.39 )-( 2.41 ) will be solved numerically\nin \u00a7 2.5 to provide a description of the relationship between @xmath and\n@xmath . These results will also be compared to those of numerical\nsolutions of the full problem. Firstly, however, we will proceed to\nstudy the limit @xmath in order to find a leading order asymptotic\nsolution for @xmath .\n\n### 2.4 Explicit solution for large activation energy @xmath\n\nHere we consider the solution to the problem ( 2.39 )-( 2.41 ) in the\nlimit of infinite activation energy @xmath . Following a well known\napproach in this limit, the reaction is confined to a thin layer of\nthickness @xmath . The domain can therefore be split into two outer\nzones (which we refer to as the preheat zone and the burnt gas) and an\ninner zone (the reaction zone). We use the condition @xmath , which\nfollows from the total completion of the reaction far downstream.\n\nIn the outer zones the reaction rate is set to zero so that, from ( 2.39\n),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.43)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath . The solution to this equation in the burnt gas is found\nto be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhile in the preheat zone we have, denoting @xmath and @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\non using the condition ( 2.21 ). The constant @xmath can be determined\nby choosing the origin where the outer profiles intersect, since the\nproblem is translationally invariant in the @xmath -direction. This\ngives\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe propagation speed @xmath can now be determined by matching with the\ninner solution. Since the reaction layer is of thickness @xmath , in the\ninner region we let\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen to leading order we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe boundary conditions to equation ( 2.47 ) are found by matching with\nthe outer solutions using the formula\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nMatching with the solution in the burnt gas, given by ( 2.44 ), yields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.49)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, noting from ( 2.46 ) and ( 2.48 ) that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwe expand equation ( 2.45 ) for the temperature in the unburnt gas as\n@xmath to find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow @xmath can be found by integrating equation ( 2.47 ) subject to the\nboundary conditions ( 2.49 ) and ( 2.50 ). Multiplying ( 2.47 ) by\n@xmath and integrating with respect to @xmath from @xmath to @xmath\nyields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.51)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus, using ( 2.49 ) and ( 2.50 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.52)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nso that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.53)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis equation gives the leading order approximation @xmath to the\neffective flame speed @xmath for a given value of @xmath in the limit\n@xmath , @xmath , with @xmath .\n\n#### 2.4.1 Constant density results\n\nThe asymptotic results found for a variable density premixed flame can\nbe similarly derived in the simpler case of a constant density premixed\nflame. The constant density form of the boundary value problem ( 2.39\n)-( 2.41 ), derived in the limit @xmath with @xmath , is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.54)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsubject to the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the limit @xmath , this problem has the solution\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.57)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 2.4.2 Cylindrical channel results\n\nA similar asymptotic analysis to the one above can be performed (see\nAppendix A ) for a premixed flame propagating through a cylindrical\nchannel of diameter @xmath with an imposed Poiseuille flow. As in the\ncase of a rectangular channel it is found that the flame is governed by\nthe equation for a planar premixed flame with an effective diffusion\ncoefficient, in this case given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nin the variable density case and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nin the constant density case. Using the definition of the Peclet number\nthe constant density result can be written in dimensional form as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the cross-sectional average of the imposed Poiseuille\nflow. The result ( 2.58 ) is exactly the result ( 2.1 ) found by Taylor\n[ 64 ] in his original paper.\n\n### 2.5 Further results and discussion\n\nIn this section we compare the results of the asymptotic analyses\nundertaken in previous sections with the results of numerical\ncomputations. The main aim is to examine the relationship between the\neffective propagation speed @xmath , defined in ( 2.13 ), and the Peclet\nnumber @xmath for several values of the flame-front thickness @xmath and\nactivation energy @xmath , in both the variable density and constant\ndensity cases.\n\n#### 2.5.1 Numerical procedure\n\nThe numerical results are obtained by solving the steady form of\nequations ( 2.2 )-( 2.6 ) with boundary conditions ( 2.7 )-( 2.10 )\nusing the software package Comsol Multiphysics. This software has been\nextensively tested in combustion applications including our previous\npublications [ 1 , 2 ] . The problem is entered into the partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) interface in Comsol, which uses a finite\nelement discretisation to transform the set of non-linear PDEs into a\nset of non-linear algebraic equations in which the propagation speed\n@xmath appears as an additional unknown (eigenvalue). These equations,\naugmented by the requirement that the temperature is prescribed at the\norigin (an additional equation needed to determine the eigenvalue @xmath\n), are then solved using an affine invariant form of the damped Newton\nmethod, as described by Deuflhard [ 74 ] . In the constant density case\nwe solve ( 2.4 ) with @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and the reaction term\nreplaced by @xmath . The domain is covered by a non-uniform grid of\napproximately 200,000 triangular elements, with local refinement around\nthe reaction zone. Various tests are performed to ensure the results are\nindependent of the mesh. A channel of length @xmath is taken to\napproximate an infinitely long channel. Throughout this section we let\n@xmath , @xmath and @xmath unless otherwise stated. The numerical\ncalculations are performed for a fixed value of the activation energy,\n@xmath , unless otherwise stated. For each @xmath the value of @xmath is\nscaled by the value of @xmath calculated numerically for @xmath and\n@xmath . Finally the boundary value problems ( 2.39 )-( 2.41 ) and (\n2.54 )-( 2.56 ), derived in the limit @xmath , are solved using the\nBVP4C solver in Matlab, which uses a Lobatto IIIa method [ 75 ] .\n\n#### 2.5.2 Comparison of the asymptotic and numerical results\n\nFigures 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) summarise both the asymptotic and numerical\nresults in the constant density case and variable density case,\nrespectively. Plotted are 1) the solutions to the boundary value\nproblems ( 2.39 )-( 2.41 ) and ( 2.54 )-( 2.56 ), derived in the limit\n@xmath , @xmath , for several values of @xmath ; 2) the asymptotic\nresults ( 2.53 ) and ( 2.57 ), derived in the limit @xmath , @xmath ,\n@xmath ; 3) the results of numerical solutions of the full problem,\ngiven by equations ( 2.2 )-( 2.6 ) and boundary conditions ( 2.7 )-(\n2.10 ), for large values of both @xmath and @xmath .\n\nIt can be seen that in both the constant and variable density cases\nthere is strong agreement between the numerical results calculated for\nhigh values of @xmath with @xmath and the asymptotic results derived in\nthe limit @xmath for @xmath . It can also be seen that in both cases the\nasymptotic results derived in the limit @xmath (for a chosen value of\n@xmath ) approach the results derived in the limit @xmath , @xmath when\n@xmath is increased, as expected. Comparing the figures shows that a\nfinite value of the activation energy @xmath has a larger effect on the\npropagation speed in the variable density case than in the constant\ndensity case.\n\nA further comparison of figures 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) shows that @xmath has\na significantly larger effect on the propagation speed in the constant\ndensity case than when thermal expansion is taken into account. This can\nbe explained by considering the perturbation to the flame shape using\nthe method of Daou and Matalon [ 17 ] and Short and Kessler [ 22 ] .\nUsing the fact that @xmath and equation ( 2.34 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nNow, let @xmath be the location at which the leading order temperature\ntakes the constant value @xmath . Defining the perturbation @xmath , and\nletting @xmath denote the value of a variable at @xmath , so that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwe obtain the value of @xmath for which @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFinally, the relative distance between the temperature reaching @xmath\nat @xmath and reaching the same value at @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.59)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich gives a measure of the deformation to the flame due to the flow.\nThe equivalent of ( 2.59 ) in the constant density case is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus since @xmath , we have @xmath from ( 2.59 )-( 2.60 ) and therefore\nthe deformation to the flame shape is smaller in the variable density\ncase. This means that the effective propagation speed @xmath , which\ngives a measure of the burning rate of the flame, is expected to be less\nin the variable density case. Note that in the @xmath analysis of Short\nand Kessler [ 22 ] , the flame deformation was found to be larger in the\nvariable density case than the constant density case for values of\n@xmath giving a propagation speed @xmath , and smaller in the variable\ndensity case when @xmath . Since @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath , the\npropagation speed @xmath is always expected to be negative in our study\nand so the results ( 2.59 )-( 2.60 ) agree with those of Short and\nKessler [ 22 ] .\n\nAn illustration of the numerically calculated flame shape for selected\nvalues of the Peclet number in both the constant density and variable\ndensity cases is given in figure 2.3 , which shows that the deformation\nto the flame shape is indeed larger in the variable density case, as\nfound in ( 2.59 )-( 2.60 ).\n\nThe flame behaviour and its interaction with the flow is further\nillustrated in figures 2.4 and 2.5 , corresponding to numerical\nsimulations. Figure 2.4 shows a contour plot of the temperature @xmath ;\nalso shown is the velocity field induced by thermal expansion, namely\n@xmath . This is plotted rather than the full velocity field @xmath for\nclarity since the imposed Poiseuille flow is large compared to the\ninduced flow, which is consistent with the asymptotic findings (see\nequation ( 2.31 )). Figures 2.4 and 2.4 provide contour plots of the\nhorizontal and vertical components of the induced flow, respectively. It\nis seen that for a fixed value of @xmath , the maximum of the horizontal\ncomponent of the induced flow is located at the centreline @xmath , and\nthe maximum of the vertical component is located around @xmath . Figures\n2.5 and 2.5 plot these horizontal and vertical components at @xmath and\n@xmath , respectively for selected values of @xmath . Corresponding\nplots of the temperature @xmath and the reaction rate @xmath along the\ncentreline @xmath are shown in figures 2.5 and 2.5 . Figure 2.5\nillustrates the gas expansion through the flame. Furthermore the figure\ndemonstrates that the effective flame thickness increases with\nincreasing @xmath ; this is in line with the asymptotic results (see the\nasymptotic formula ( 2.42 ) and also the discussion in \u00a7 2.6 related to\nequation ( 2.61 )).\n\nReturning now to the effect of the Peclet number on the propagation\nspeed, comparing the asymptotic result ( 2.57 ), derived in the constant\ndensity approximation, with ( 2.53 ), derived in the variable density\ncase, provides a further reason for the larger effect of @xmath on\n@xmath in the constant density case. The constant density results are\nthe same as the variable density results, but with the term @xmath\nreplaced by @xmath in the leading order term for the effective\npropagation speed \u00b9 \u00b9 1 Note that the constant density asymptotic\nresults ( 2.54 )-( 2.56 ) are not recovered by simply setting @xmath in\nequations ( 2.39 )-( 2.41 ) due to the presence of @xmath in the\nreaction term, which throughout this study is set to @xmath in both\ncases. . This suggests that replacing the Peclet number in the variable\ndensity case by a scaled Peclet number, given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwould lead to strong agreement between the variable density and constant\ndensity numerical results.\n\nA plot of the numerically calculated value of @xmath versus @xmath in\nthe constant density and variable density cases is given in figure 2.6 .\nAs expected, the relationship between @xmath and @xmath in the two cases\nis much more similar than in figures 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) , but there is\nstill a quantitative difference. This can be attributed to the fact that\nthe finite activation energy has a more significant effect in the\nvariable density case than in the constant density case, as described\nabove. It is therefore expected that for larger values of @xmath the\nagreement between the numerically calculated value of @xmath and @xmath\nwould be closer between the two cases. To illustrate this, included in\nfigure 2.6 is a comparison of @xmath versus @xmath from the numerical\nsolution to ( 2.54 )-( 2.56 ) and ( 2.39 )-( 2.41 ), valid as @xmath ,\nwith @xmath . The figure shows that in this case the values of @xmath in\nthe constant and variable density cases are indeed closer together.\nHowever, performing numerical calculations of the full system with a\nlarger value of @xmath involves a significant amount of extra\ncomputation and is beyond the scope of this study.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the asymptotic results found in this\nstudy agree with results obtained previously in the limit @xmath .\nExpanding the constant density result ( 2.57 ) as @xmath gives\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich agrees with Daou et\u00a0al. [ 16 ] . Expanding the variable density\nresult ( 2.53 ) as @xmath gives\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThis agrees with the results found by Short and Kessler [ 22 ] , which\nfound @xmath to leading order.\n\n### 2.6 Conclusion\n\nIn this study we have investigated the propagation of a premixed flame\nthrough a narrow channel against a flow of large amplitude, taking the\neffect of the flame on the flow into account through the action of\nthermal expansion. This is the first study to consider a variable\ndensity premixed flame in a narrow channel with Peclet number @xmath ,\nwhich characterises the large amplitude flow. It is also the first to\ninvestigate Taylor dispersion in the context of combustion. The problem\nhas been studied analytically to determine the effective propagation\nspeed @xmath for @xmath , in the limit @xmath with both finite and\ninfinite values of the activation energy @xmath . The asymptotic studies\nare complemented by a numerical study whose results have been compared\nto the analytical results to test their effectiveness.\n\nIt has been found that, in the limit @xmath , a two-dimensional premixed\nflame propagating through a rectangular channel against a Poiseuille\nflow can be described by a boundary value problem that corresponds to a\none-dimensional premixed flame with an effective diffusion coefficient,\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nin the constant density case and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nin the variable density case. These values correspond to those found in\nstudies of enhanced dispersion due to a Poiseuille flow in non-reactive\nfluids, known as Taylor dispersion. A premixed flame propagating through\na channel in the limit @xmath , with @xmath can therefore be considered\nto be in the Taylor regime.\n\nFurther, analytical solutions to the derived one-dimensional boundary\nvalue problems have been obtained in the limit @xmath in both the\nconstant density and variable density cases. The asymptotic results have\nbeen found to show strong agreement with the numerical results in both\ncases, as well as with results derived in previous studies in the limit\n@xmath . Physical reasons for the differences between the constant and\nvariable density cases in the relationship of the propagation speed\nversus the Peclet number have been discussed.\n\nThe analytical results ( 2.53 ) and ( 2.57 ) can provide some insight\ntowards understanding the effect of small-scale eddies on the\npropagation of a turbulent premixed flame, when the flow amplitude\n@xmath in our study is identified with the turbulence intensity and the\nchannel height @xmath is identified with the turbulent flow (integral)\nscale. The situation where the flame is thick compared to the scale of\nthe flow is described by Damk\u00f6hler\u2019s second hypothesis, which may be\nstated in the form of a relationship between the dimensional effective\npropagation speed and the effective thermal diffusivity, given by @xmath\n. Here @xmath is the chemical time related to the planar premixed flame\nspeed @xmath (used in this study as unit speed to non-dimensionalise\nvelocities) by @xmath . Therefore on dividing these two equations,\nDamk\u00f6hler\u2019s second hypothesis is recovered, to leading order, in\nequation ( 2.57 ), as can be seen by noting that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.61)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe results ( 2.53 ) and ( 2.57 ) may also be used to provide a possible\nexplanation of the so-called bending effect of the turbulent premixed\nflame speed when plotted in terms of the turbulence intensity for fixed\nvalues of the Reynolds number (see e.g. [ 57 , 24 ] ). Therefore our\ndistinguished limit, namely @xmath with @xmath fixed (note that the\nReynolds number and Peclet number are equal if @xmath ), mimics the\nexperimental conditions of Bradley [ 57 ] and can be used to shed some\nlight on the experimental findings. An initial discussion of the\nrelevance of the asymptotic results in this chapter to the bending\neffect, along with further asymptotic results, is provided in Chapter 3\nof this thesis.\n\nFinally, it has been shown that, in the limit @xmath , @xmath , the\ngraphs of @xmath in the constant and variable density cases are\nidentical when plotted against a scaled Peclet number\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand graphs of the numerically calculated propagation speed against this\nscaled Peclet number have also been provided.\n\n## Chapter 3 The thick flame asymptotic limit and the bending effect of\npremixed flames\n\n### 3.1 Introduction\n\nIn this chapter, which provides a continuation of the work undertaken in\nChapter 2 , we are again mainly concerned with premixed flame\npropagation against a steady parallel flow of large amplitude, for fixed\nvalues of the Peclet number. The main motivation in this chapter is to\ndescribe the relevance of the asymptotic results in the thick flame\nasymptotic limit to the so-called bending effect of turbulent\ncombustion, as mentioned in the conclusion of Chapter 2 . The bending\neffect is reported to be observed experimentally when the effective\nflame speed @xmath is plotted in terms of the flow intensity @xmath , as\nseen in figure 3.1 , adapted from [ 24 ] . As discussed in [ 76 ] , this\nis a fundamental problem in turbulent combustion which has received\nconsiderable attention in the literature. Previous theoretical studies\nhave predicted linear, sub-linear, or exponential dependence of @xmath\non @xmath [ 24 ] . Experiments, on the other hand, have shown that the\neffective flame speed increases with the flow intensity @xmath at lower\nvalues of @xmath , but levels off at higher values of @xmath [ 77 ] ,\nwhich is widely known as the bending effect. The constant value to which\n@xmath seems to converge is found to depend on the Reynolds number [ 77\n] , which in our case is equivalent to the Peclet number since we assume\nunity Prandtl number. Taking into account the complexity associated with\nthe multi-scale nature of turbulence, it is of great interest to examine\nthis relationship for cases such as parallel or vortical flows, because\nof their relative simplicity.\n\nIn this chapter, we investigate the relationship between the effective\npropagation speed of a laminar premixed flame and the amplitude of a\nprescribed Poiseuille flow. The amplitude of the flow can be thought of\nas analagous to the turbulence intensity, as plotted in figure 3.1 . We\nare motivated by the asymptotic result ( 2.53 ), derived in Chapter 2 ,\nwhich shows a constant dependence of the effective propagation speed on\nthe Peclet number in the thick flame asymptotic limit. Furthermore, to\ncomplement the investigation other distinguished limits are considered\nto help understand the discrepencies between theory and experiments.\nFinally, we will provide numerical results to aid in this discussion.\n\nThe chapter is structured as follows. In \u00a7 3.2 we perform an asymptotic\nanalysis in the infinite activation energy limit, to provide a\ncomplementary asymptotic result to equation ( 2.53 ), derived in Chapter\n2 . In \u00a7 3.3 , we provide some further asymptotic results in the\nconstant density case, as well as numerical results for a full range of\nvalues of the flow amplitude @xmath and the Peclet number @xmath . This\nsection also contains a discussion of the relevance of the results to\nthe bending effect of turbulent combustion. We end the chapter with\nconclusions in \u00a7 3.4 .\n\n### 3.2 Infinite activation energy asymptotic analysis\n\nThe result ( 2.53 ) in Chapter 2 provided an asymptotic result for the\neffect of a Poiseuille flow on the propagation speed of a variable\ndensity premixed flame. The limits taken were @xmath , followed by\n@xmath , with @xmath . In this chapter we provide a complementary\nasymptotic analysis to the one performed in Chapter 2 , this time in the\nlimit @xmath , followed by @xmath , with @xmath , in order to assess the\neffect of taking the limits in this order. Note that, since the three\nmain non-dimensional parameters in the problem can be related to each\nother by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\ntaking @xmath with @xmath is equivalent to taking @xmath with @xmath .\nAll parameters have the same definitions as in Chapter 2 . In this\nchapter, attention will be restricted to steady flame propagation with\nunity Lewis number\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn the limit of infinite activation energy, @xmath , the reaction zone\nis confined to a thin sheet, @xmath , say. On either side of the thin\nsheet, the reaction rate can be set to zero. We introduce the change of\nvariables\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThen the steady form of the governing equations ( 2.2 )-( 2.6 ) can be\nwritten\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.4)\n     @xmath      (3.5)\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (3.6)\n     @xmath      (3.7)\n     @xmath      (3.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThese equations are subject to boundary conditions, which using ( 3.3 )\nin ( 2.7 )-( 2.10 ) are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.9)\n     @xmath      (3.10)\n     @xmath      (3.11)\n     @xmath      (3.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquations ( 3.4 )-( 3.8 ) are also subject to jump conditions across the\nflame sheet, which is located at @xmath . The derivation of these jump\nconditions is not given here, but can be found in e.g. [ 14 ] , where\nthe full set of conditions are listed; here we simply give the\nconditions used in the following asymptotic analysis:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 3.2.1 Solution in the limit @xmath, with @xmath\n\nIn this section we provide the leading order asymptotic solution to (\n3.4 )-( 3.13 ) in the limit @xmath , with @xmath . Note that this limit\nis equivalent to @xmath , with @xmath , due to ( 3.1 ). A similar\nasymptotic analysis was performed in [ 76 ] in the constant density\napproximation. Using a similar method to the one used in \u00a7 2.3 in\nChapter 2 , we introduce a scaled coordinate\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand expand each variable in powers of @xmath , so that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the leading order term for the effective propagation\nspeed @xmath , defined in ( 2.13 ).\n\nInserting the scaling ( 3.14 ) into ( 3.4 )-( 3.13 ) and dropping the\nprime notation, we find that the leading order solutions are the same as\nthose found in \u00a72.3 of Chapter 2 , and are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.16)\n     @xmath      (3.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen to @xmath in equation ( 3.7 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich can be integrated twice with respect to @xmath , using the\nboundary conditions ( 3.9 )-( 3.10 ) on @xmath and @xmath , and\nsubstituting in ( 3.16 ), to give\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is an arbitrary function of integration. Now, using the\nconditions ( 3.11 ) and ( 3.13 ) on @xmath and setting @xmath , a\ncondition which can be prescribed due to the translational invariance of\nthe problem, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe total burning rate is proportional to the flame surface area [ 70 ]\nby the relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\na relationship which can be derived by integrating the steady form of\nequation ( 2.4 ) up to the reaction sheet and utilising the continuity\nequation ( 2.2 ) with the boundary conditions ( 2.7 )-( 2.10 ). Thus we\ncan find the first approximation @xmath to the effective flame speed\n@xmath , which using ( 3.20 ) and ( 3.21 ) is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis result provides a complementary asymptotic expression to equation (\n2.53 ) in Chapter 2 . Note that equation ( 2.53 ) in Chapter 2 is\nexpected to be valid for @xmath , while equation ( 3.22 ) is expected to\nbe valid for @xmath . It can be seen that both expressions predict a\nconstant dependence of the effective propagation speed @xmath on the\nPeclet number in the thick flame asymptotic limit. A comparison of the\ntwo expressions is given in figure 3.2 , where it can be seen that there\nis good agreement between the two results for low and moderate values of\nthe Peclet number (approximately @xmath in the constant density case and\n@xmath in the variable density case). For high values of @xmath , the\nresults start to diverge, although this divergence is more marked in the\nconstant density case than the variable density case. The relevance of\nthe results to the bending effect will be discussed in the following\nsection.\n\n### 3.3 Further results and discussion\n\nIn this section we present the results of the asymptotic analysis of \u00a7\n3.2 and compare with the results of numerical simulations of the full\nsystem of governing equations, given by the steady form of ( 2.2 )-(\n2.10 ), with @xmath . We also compare with some further asymptotic\nresults that are available in the constant density case. All asymptotic\nresults in this section have been obtained by first taking the infinite\nactivation energy limit @xmath . The aim in this section is to provide a\ndiscussion of the relevance of these asymptotic and numerical results to\nthe bending effect of premixed flames.\n\nNote that throughout this section the numerical method used is the same\nas the one described in Chapter 2 . Numerical results in the constant\ndensity case are obtained by solving ( 2.4 ) with @xmath , @xmath ,\n@xmath and the reaction term replaced by @xmath , as described in\nChapter 2 . Finally, note that the effect of thermal expansion is\ninvestigated by varying the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath , while\ntaking the reaction term @xmath to be given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith @xmath given the fixed value @xmath , as is done in [ 1 ] .\n\n#### 3.3.1 Constant density results\n\nIn this section we provide asymptotic and numerical results in the\nconstant density case. The asymptotic result ( 3.22 ) obtained in \u00a7\n3.2.1 in the limit @xmath , with @xmath , can be written in the constant\ndensity case simply by setting @xmath , so that the leading order term\nfor the effective propagation speed is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFurther asymptotic results are available in the constant density case,\nin the separate limits a) @xmath , with @xmath and b) @xmath , with\n@xmath . Note that these limits both correspond to the thin flame limit\n@xmath . In both of these limits, the propagation speed @xmath can be\nwritten asymptotically as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere with @xmath . A derivation of ( 3.25 ) in the limit @xmath , with\n@xmath can be found in [ 70 ] . The derivation of ( 3.25 ) in the limit\n@xmath , with @xmath is slightly different and can be found in Appendix\nB . Equation ( 3.25 ) predicts a linear dependence of @xmath on @xmath\nwhen @xmath is small, which is in agreement with several of the\ntheoretical studies shown in figure 3.1 .\n\nWe now have a fairly complete asymptotic picture of the problem. The\nasymptotic results ( 3.24 ) and ( 3.25 ) are shown in figure 3.3 , where\nthey are compared with and complemented by numerical results in the\nconstant density case, obtained for a full range of values of @xmath and\n@xmath . It is clear that in all cases the numerically calculated\npropagation speed approaches a constant value, which depends on the\nPeclet number, as the flow amplitude @xmath increases to large values;\nthis is in line with the the asymptotic results ( 3.24 ) and shows a\nsimilar behaviour to the available experimental results summarised in\nfigure 3.1 . It can also be seen in figure 3.3 that there is a maximum\nin the curve of @xmath versus @xmath , which occurs at a higher value of\n@xmath as @xmath increases, as predicted by the asymptotic results (\n3.25 ). Finally, it can be seen that the numerical results for small\nvalues of @xmath agree very well with the formula ( 3.25 ), as is to\nexpected.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Variable density results\n\nIn this section we investigate the effect of thermal expansion on\npremixed flames propagating against a prescribed parallel inflow. We\nbegin with a discussion of the behaviour of a premixed flame in a\nchannel subject to thermal expansion when no flow is prescribed (i.e.\nthe case @xmath ).\n\nIf no flow is prescribed in the constant density case, the flame is\nplanar and propagates at the laminar flame speed, so that @xmath .\nHowever, this is not the case when thermal expansion is present. As can\nbe seen in figure 3.4 , the propagation speed of variable density flames\nis larger than the laminar flame speed if @xmath is small enough, even\nthough no flow is prescribed at @xmath in these calculations. For larger\nvalues of @xmath , the propagation speed is increased by a larger\namount.\n\nThe increase in the propagation speed as @xmath is due to the flame\nbeing necessarily curved. This is attributable to the effect of the\nno-slip sidewalls. Thermal expansion across the flame causes a shear\n(Poiseuille) flow to be induced downstream, and the flame becomes curved\n(or \u201ctulip\u201d shaped), as can be seen in figure 3.5 . Figures 3.4 and 3.5\nalso show results for a flame with @xmath , but @xmath =0 at the\nsidewalls (instead of the no-slip condition). As can be seen, in this\ncase the flame is planar and propagates at the laminar flame speed,\nwhich shows that the no-slip sidewalls are the cause of the increase in\npropagation speed due to thermal expansion as @xmath . A similar effect\nwas found in [ 82 ] and is numerically studied in detail in [ 83 ] .\n\nAt this point it should be noted that various transient behaviours of\npremixed flames in closed channels that arise as a result of the\nfrictional effects of sidewalls, combined with other effects of thermal\nexpansion such as the Darrieus\u2013Landau instability, have been\ninvestigated in the literature (for a review, see e.g. [ 9 ] ). However,\nin the infinitely long channel configuration studied here, it is\nsufficient to note that steady solutions exist and that the steady\nsolutions calculated here are all found to be stable to small\nperturbations.\n\nNow, we plot in figure 3.6 the effective propagation speed @xmath versus\nthe prescribed inflow amplitude @xmath for selected values of the Peclet\nnumber @xmath in both the constant and variable density cases. As\nexpected, it can be seen that as @xmath , the propagation speed in the\nconstant density case approaches @xmath and the propagation speed in the\nvariable density case approaches a value @xmath . It can also be seen\nthat the prescribed inflow has a larger effect on the propagation speed\nin the constant density case than in the variable density case. Thus for\nthe same value of the Peclet number, the propagation speed in the\nconstant density case is larger than the propagation speed in the\nvariable density case, if @xmath is large enough. This is to be expected\nas the asymptotic results ( 3.22 ), valid in the limit @xmath , show\nthis behaviour. The results ( 3.22 ) are included in figure 3.6 .\n\nTo summarise, despite the effect of wall friction and the lessened\neffect of a prescribed parallel flow on a variable density premixed\nflame, the qualitative shape of the curve of @xmath versus @xmath\nremains the same in the constant and variable density cases. This shows\nthat in a laminar flame at least, the bending effect cannot be\nattributed to the effects of thermal expansion.\n\n### 3.4 Conclusion\n\nIn this chapter we have discussed the relevance of asymptotic results\nobtained in the thick flame asymptotic limit to the bending effect of\nturbulent combustion. The asymptotic result ( 2.53 ), obtained in\nChapter 2 in the limit @xmath followed by @xmath , with @xmath , has\nbeen compared to the further asymptotic result ( 3.22 ), which has been\nderived in the limit @xmath followed by @xmath , with @xmath . It has\nbeen found that the results agree for moderately small values of the\nPeclet number, with closer agreement in the variable density case than\nin the constant density case. Numerical results have been provided,\nshowing that as the prescribed inflow amplitude @xmath increases to\nlarge values, the effective propagation speed @xmath approaches a\nconstant value, which depends on the Peclet number. This result is in\nline with both the asymptotic results ( 2.53 ) and ( 3.22 ) and with the\navailable experimental results on turbulent combustion, summarised in\nfigure 3.1 . We have therefore shown that for laminar flames in the\ncontext of a parallel flow, premixed flames in the thick flame\nasymptotic limit mimic the behaviour of turbulent premixed flames in the\nrelationship between the effective propagation speed and the flow\nintensity @xmath , which is analagous to the turbulence intensity.\n\nWe have also provided some asymptotic results for small values of @xmath\nin the constant density case, given by equation ( 3.25 ), in order to\nprovide a full asymptotic picture of the relationship between the\neffective propagation speed and @xmath . These results show that for\nsmall values of @xmath , the relationship between @xmath and @xmath is\nlinear. Finally, we have investigated the effect of thermal expansion on\nthe problem; it has been found that in the limit @xmath , variable\ndensity premixed flames in channels propagate at a speed larger than the\nlaminar flame speed, due to the fact that the flame curves as a result\nof the effect of wall friction. Despite this difference between constant\nand variable density premixed flames, it has been found that for\nvariable density premixed flames the effective propagation speed still\napproaches a constant value which depends on the Peclet number for large\nvalues of @xmath , which again mimics the behaviour of the turbulent\npremixed flames shown in figure 3.1 .\n\n## Chapter 4 Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard Instability Generated by a Diffusion Flame\n\n### 4.1 Introduction\n\nThe presence of flames in chemically reacting systems, whether premixed\nor non-premixed, naturally generates temperature gradients. Such systems\nare therefore prone to buoyancy-driven instabilities which have a\nparadigm in Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection. In this chapter, which is based\non a paper by Pearce and Daou [ 2 ] , we revisit the Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard\nproblem in the specific context of a diffusion or non-premixed flame, a\nfundamental problem which seems to have received no attention in the\nliterature. The aim of the work is to complement the available knowledge\non flame stability by determining the critical conditions which define\nthe threshold of instability of a planar diffusion flame under\ngravitational effects.\n\nThe Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard problem itself has been important in work on the\nstability of physical systems since the early studies at the beginning\nof the 20th century by B\u00e9nard [ 84 ] and Rayleigh [ 85 ] on the natural\nconvection of a fluid layer heated from below. The temperature gradient\nin the system causes the fluid at the bottom of the layer to be lighter\nthan the fluid at the top, an arrangement which becomes unstable if the\ntemperature gradient is strong enough. The instability is opposed by the\nviscous forces of the fluid. It was in Lord Rayleigh\u2019s seminal paper\nthat it was first demonstrated that a non-dimensional parameter which\nlater became known as the Rayleigh number must exceed a critical value\nin order for the aforementioned instability to manifest itself. This\nparameter was defined in terms of the gravitational acceleration @xmath\n, the height of the fluid layer @xmath , the temperature gradient @xmath\nand the coefficients of thermal expansion @xmath , thermal diffusivity\n@xmath and kinematic viscosity @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIf the Rayleigh number exceeds its critical value, which may be denoted\n@xmath , the resulting instability resolves itself into a steady state\nof \u2019convection rolls\u2019, observed by B\u00e9nard in his original experiments as\na regular structure of hexagonal cells. The problem of determining the\ncritical Rayleigh number and characterising the resulting instabilities\nhas been studied experimentally, numerically and analytically in a huge\namount of research, which we do not review here. For a complete overview\nof the canonical problem see Chandrasekhar [ 86 , pp. 1\u201375] and\nliterature reviews by Getling [ 87 , pp.1\u201326] and Bodenschatz et\u00a0al. [\n88 ] ; more recent reviews concerning turbulence in Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard\nconvection have been performed by Ahlers et\u00a0al. [ 89 ] and Lohse and Xia\n[ 90 ] .\n\nThe stability of steady states has also formed a crucial aspect of the\nstudy of both premixed and non-premixed flames. A thorough review of\nrecent literature concerning flame instabilities has been performed by\nMatalon [ 91 ] . A further review concentrating on instabilities in\npremixed flames can be found in [ 92 ] ; here we concentrate on\ninstabilities in non-premixed combustion.\n\nThere have been a large number of studies on the diffusive-thermal\ninstability of planar diffusion flames. Early studies focused on\noscillatory instabilities of diffusion flames for fuel and oxidiser\nLewis numbers greater than 1 [ 93 , 94 , 95 ] before further studies\nincluding cellular instabilities for values of the Lewis number below 1\n[ 96 , 97 , 98 , 99 , 100 , 101 , 102 ] . The common factor in these\nstudies is the use of the constant density approximation which\nsimplifies the study of combustion phenomena by separating the\nhydrodynamics from the equations for temperature and mass fractions.\nRecently this approximation was dispensed with by Matalon and Metzener [\n103 ] to investigate the effect of thermal expansion on the stability of\ndiffusion flames, again using the planar diffusion flame as the\nunperturbed state. It was found that, although thermal expansion does\nnot play as crucial a role as it does for premixed flames, it influences\nthe regions of parameter space for which the diffusive-thermal\ninstability occurs.\n\nA key point in the stability analyses previously performed on the planar\ndiffusion flame in the absence of gravity is that of the unconditional\nstability of the Burke\u2013Schumann diffusion flame, which arises in the\nlimit of infinite reaction rate. Our study is motivated by the idea that\nthe mechanism for the Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard instability described above could\nbe expected to have a similar effect on a layer of fluid heated from\nbelow by a horizontal diffusion flame if buoyancy is taken into account,\nleading to instabilities of a system previously considered\nunconditionally stable. There seems to our knowledge to be very little\nwork addressing the effect of gravity on planar diffusion flames in the\nliterature. Stability studies that have taken gravity into account have\nbeen focused on the flickering motion of diffusion flames [ 104 , 105 ,\n106 ] , diffusion flames over a solid fuel [ 107 ] or triple flames\naligned with the gravity vector [ 40 ] .\n\nIn the present study we consider the stability of a horizontal planar\ndiffusion flame in an infinitely long channel of given height under the\neffects of gravity. The main aim is to find the critical conditions for\ninstability in the form of the critical value of a suitably defined\nRayleigh number which defines the threshold of instability. An\ninvestigation into the instabilities in this problem will provide a\ncrucial step towards a full understanding of the interaction between\ndiffusion flames and hydrodynamics. This will also provide a basis for\ninvestigating the combined effect of thermal expansion and gravity on\nthe propagation of triple flames, which leave a trailing diffusion flame\nbehind them.\n\nWe formulate the problem in the low Mach number approximation, as\nderived in Chapter 1 . Further, in order to treat the problem\nanalytically as far as possible we employ the Boussinesq approximation\ncommonly used to study non-reactive Rayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection, which\nwas derived by Boussinesq [ 108 ] . A rigorous derivation of this model\nfrom the general equations of combustion theory has been performed by\nMatkowsky and Sivashinsky [ 4 ] . The results of a linear stability\nanalysis in this formulation will be compared to a numerical treatment\nof the non-Boussinesq equations in order to test the effect of\ncompressibility on the system.\n\nThe chapter is structured as follows. We begin in \u00a7 4.2 by providing the\ngoverning equations, which we then non-dimensionalise and simplify in\nthe Boussinesq approximation. We proceed in \u00a7 4.3 with an asymptotic\nanalysis in the Burke\u2013Schumann limit of infinite Damk\u00f6hler number,\nfollowed by a linear stability analysis in \u00a7 4.4 using the planar\nBurke\u2013Schumann flame as the base state. In \u00a7 4.5 we solve the linear\nstability problem for the growth rate eigenvalue numerically and\nanalytically as far as possible to investigate the Rayleigh number at\nwhich the planar Burke\u2013Schumann flame becomes unstable. In \u00a7 4.6 we\npresent the results of the linear stability analysis, including how the\ncritical Rayleigh number depends on the position of the flame in the\nchannel. Finally, we compare these results in \u00a7 4.7 with a full\nnumerical treatment to investigate the accuracy of the Boussinesq\napproximation and the effects of compressibility upon the stability of\nthe system, followed by a short investigation of the effect of finite\nchemistry. The chapter is closed with a discussion of the main findings\nand recommendations for future related studies.\n\n### 4.2 Formulation\n\nWe investigate the problem of the stability of a planar diffusion flame\nin an infinitely long channel of height @xmath . The channel walls are\nassumed to be porous with the fuel being provided at the upper wall and\nthe oxidiser provided at the lower wall (see figure 4.1 ); for\nsimplicity, the temperatures of the walls are assumed to be equal.\nAlthough this setup may be difficult to achieve experimentally, it is\nadopted here as a simple theoretical model to aid understanding of the\neffect of gravity on the planar diffusion flame. A similar setup has\nbeen used in several previous theoretical investigations (see e.g. [ 109\n, 43 , 110 ] ). Since we are taking the effects of density changes and\ngravity into account, the governing equations will consist of the\nNavier\u2013Stokes equations, coupled to equations for temperature and mass\nfractions of fuel and oxidiser. The combustion is modelled as a single\nirreversible one-step reaction of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere F denotes the fuel and O the oxidiser. The quantity @xmath denotes\nthe mass of oxidiser consumed and @xmath the heat released, both per\nunit mass of fuel.\nThe overall reaction rate @xmath is taken to follow an Arrhenius law of\nthe form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are\nthe density, the fuel mass fraction, the oxidiser mass fraction, the\nuniversal gas constant, the temperature, the pre-exponential factor and\nthe activation energy of the reaction, respectively.\n\n#### 4.2.1 Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions\n\nIn the low Mach number approximation, the governing equations are\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.1)\n     @xmath      (4.2)\n     @xmath      (4.3)\n     @xmath      (4.4)\n     @xmath      (4.5)\n     @xmath      (4.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the @xmath notation denotes dimensional terms and @xmath , @xmath\n, and @xmath denote the diffusion coefficients of heat, fuel and\noxidiser respectively. Here @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are all assumed\nconstant, as are the specific heat capacity @xmath , thermal\nconductivity @xmath and dynamic viscosity @xmath .\n\nAs shown in figure 4.1 the walls are assumed to be rigid, porous and at\nthe same temperature, giving the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.7)\n     @xmath      (4.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nBefore continuing we note that equations ( 4.3 )-( 4.5 ) have a steady,\none dimensional solution with no flow which, for large activation energy\n@xmath , as typically encountered in combustion, is very close to the\nfrozen solution (with zero reaction rate @xmath ) given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.9)\n     @xmath      (4.10)\n     @xmath      (4.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquations ( 4.9 )-( 4.11 ) determine the location of the stoichiometric\nsurface @xmath , where @xmath , and the values of the mass fractions\nthere in the absence of combustion as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a normalised stoichiometric coefficient.\n\nWe now introduce the non-dimensional variables\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nnote that @xmath is the hydrodynamic pressure with reference unit @xmath\n= @xmath . Here the reference length @xmath is the height of the\nchannel. @xmath is the adiabatic flame temperature given by @xmath . The\nnon-dimensional governing equations are then\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.13)\n     @xmath      (4.14)\n     @xmath      (4.15)\n     @xmath      (4.16)\n     @xmath      (4.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath . Note that\n@xmath is a modified pressure given by @xmath . The non-dimensional\nparameters are\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nwhich are the Rayleigh number, the Damk\u00f6hler number, the Prandtl number\nand the fuel and oxidiser Lewis numbers, respectively. Here, @xmath is\nthe kinematic viscosity @xmath and @xmath is the Zeldovich number or\nnon-dimensional activation energy defined as @xmath . It is worth\nmentioning that we have defined the Rayleigh number to be of the form\n@xmath , where @xmath measures the temperature difference and @xmath is\na reference temperature taken here to be @xmath . This form has been\nadopted previously in the literature, for example by Fr\u00f6hlich et\u00a0al. [\n111 ] , where the reference temperature was taken to be an average\nvalue.\nThe non dimensional reaction rate is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the ideal gas equation ( 4.6 ) takes the non-dimensional form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, ( 4.7 )-( 4.8 ) and ( 4.12 ) imply that the boundary conditions\nare\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.20)\n     @xmath      (4.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe non-dimensional problem is now fully formulated and is given by\nequations ( 4.13 )-( 4.19 ) with boundary conditions ( 4.20 ) and ( 4.21\n). The non-dimensional parameters in this problem are @xmath , @xmath ,\n@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .\n\n#### 4.2.2 Mixture fraction formulation\n\n##### Formulation\n\nWe can simplify the problem by making the assumption of unity Lewis\nnumbers,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this case we note that, from equations ( 4.15 )-( 4.17 ) and the\nboundary conditions ( 4.20 )-( 4.21 ), the quantity\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsatisfies the equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsubject to the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nClearly @xmath is a stationary solution of ( 4.24 )-( 4.25 ). This will\nbe the only solution we retain, in view of the focus of our linear\nstability analysis on the base state with no flow and @xmath . A\njustification for retaining only this solution is presented below.\n\nFor solutions that are periodic in @xmath of period @xmath , define the\n@xmath scalar product\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwith @xmath . Then equation ( 4.24 ) leads to\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nUsing integration by parts and equation ( 4.13 ), this can be written\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nor, using the Poincar\u00e9 inequality and the fact that @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor some constant @xmath . Hence,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath . We therefore conclude that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich justifies retaining only the stationary solution @xmath .\n\nIt follows on using ( 4.23 ) that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe now observe, by adding equations ( 4.15 ) and ( 4.16 ), that the\nquantity @xmath satisfies the equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsubject to the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.28)\n     @xmath      (4.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis suggests defining the mixture fraction @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich implies that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe governing equations ( 4.13 )-( 4.17 ) then become\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.32)\n     @xmath      (4.33)\n     @xmath      (4.34)\n     @xmath      (4.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand @xmath is given by equation ( 4.19 ). These equations are subject to\nthe boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.37)\n     @xmath      (4.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n##### Stationary planar diffusion flame\n\nThe problem defined by ( 4.32 )-( 4.38 ) admits a stationary planar\nsolution with no flow given by @xmath . The temperature can then be\ndetermined, using ( 4.34 ), by the numerical solution to the equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (4.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.40)\n     @xmath      (4.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that the Rayleigh number merely affects the pressure (as dictated\nby equation ( 4.33 )) in the one-dimensional stationary system and does\nnot affect the solution for temperature.\n\nWe now let @xmath and @xmath take typical values of 10, 0.85 and 1\nrespectively and solve equation ( 4.39 ) with conditions ( 4.40 ) and (\n4.41 ) for selected values of the Damk\u00f6hler number @xmath . We use the\nboundary value problem solver BVP4C, a finite difference code that\nimplements the three-stage Lobatto IIIa formula in Matlab [ 75 ] . We\nthen plot the maximum temperature of the solution against @xmath .\nFigure 4.2 shows the S-shaped curve that is generated; this is a\nclassical curve characterising diffusion flames and has been\ncomprehensively studied in the context of the constant density\napproximation [ 112 ] . The upper and lower branches are known as the\nstrongly burning and weakly burning branches respectively, and both have\nbeen shown to be stable in the context of constant density diffusion\nflames, while the middle branch has been shown to be unstable [ 113 ] .\n\nNotable in figure 4.2 is the presence of an extinction and an ignition\nvalue of the Damk\u00f6hler number represented by points @xmath and @xmath\nrespectively; for values of @xmath below the extinction value the\nstrongly burning solution cannot exist and for @xmath above the ignition\nvalue there is no weakly burning solution.\n\nWe are interested in instabilities caused by the effect of the\nhydrodynamics on the upper branch of the S-shaped curve, in particular\nin the Burke\u2013Schumann limit of infinite Damk\u00f6hler number. In \u00a7 4.7 , we\nwill numerically solve the governing equations in the mixture fraction\nformulation to investigate these instabilities; however, in order to\ntreat the problem analytically as far as possible we now proceed with a\nreformulation of the problem in the Boussinesq approximation.\n\n#### 4.2.3 Boussinesq approximation\n\nFor a detailed derivation of the governing equations of combustion\ntheory in the Boussinesq approximation in the context of a premixed\nflame see [ 114 ] . Here we use a similar approach and assume that the\nthermal expansion parameter @xmath is small. Thus we expand equation (\n4.19 ) as @xmath to obtain\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nUsing this result, and expanding all variables in successive powers of\n@xmath in equations ( 4.32 )-( 4.38 ), yields to leading order\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.42)\n     @xmath      (4.43)\n     @xmath      (4.44)\n     @xmath      (4.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich are subject to the boundary conditions ( 4.37 )-( 4.38 ).\n\nWe have thus reduced the number of equations in the unity Lewis number\ncase so that the problem is now given by equations ( 4.42 )-( 4.45 )\nwith boundary conditions ( 4.37 )-( 4.38 ). We proceed with an\nasymptotic analysis of the problem in the infinitely fast chemistry\nlimit @xmath , which will reduce the problem to a form comparable to the\nclassic non-reactive case studied in [ 86 ] and others.\n\n### 4.3 Asymptotic analysis\n\nWe now study the problem of the Burke\u2013Schumann diffusion flame, which\narises in the limit of infinite Damk\u00f6hler number. In this case @xmath\nthroughout the domain to prevent an unbounded reaction rate, except at\nan (infinitely thin) reaction sheet located at @xmath , say, where the\ntemperature is equal to its adiabatic value. Hence, using ( 4.30 )-(\n4.31 ),\n\n  -- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath      (4.46)\n     @xmath   @xmath      (4.47)\n     @xmath   @xmath      (4.48)\n  -- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThus the domain is split into two parts: the region above the reaction\nsheet and the region below it, with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.49)\n     @xmath      (4.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that ( 4.48 ) and ( 4.49 )-( 4.50 ) imply that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.51)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich defines the stoichiometric mixture fraction @xmath .\n\nWe expand all variables outside the thin reaction zone, as @xmath , in\nterms of the thickness of the reaction zone @xmath , where\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThis scaling follows from a reactive-diffusive balance in the reaction\nsheet. Indeed, writing @xmath , @xmath and @xmath with @xmath inside the\nreaction sheet gives, from the leading order of equation ( 4.15 ),\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath . Thus, since the diffusion term and the reaction term\n(which are given by the left hand side and the right hand side of the\nequation above, respectively) must balance, we have the required\nscaling. We therefore write the outer expansions as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nWe now substitute into the governing equations ( 4.42 )-( 4.45 ) which\nbecome, to leading order\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.52)\n     @xmath      (4.53)\n     @xmath      (4.54)\n     @xmath      (4.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfrom equations ( 4.49 )-( 4.50 ), so that the equation for @xmath is not\nnecessary. These equations are subject to the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.57)\n     @xmath      (4.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfrom ( 4.37 )-( 4.38 ).\n\nTo close the problem we need to provide jump conditions across the\nreaction sheet located at @xmath . These are given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath      (4.59)\n     @xmath   @xmath      (4.60)\n     @xmath   @xmath      (4.61)\n  -- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath is a coordinate normal to the reaction sheet. A\nderivation of these in a general context has been presented by Cheatham\nand Matalon [ 98 ] , who assumed a large activation energy parameter\n@xmath , with leakages of the components through the reaction sheet.\nSince this is not the case here, for the convenience of the reader a\nshort explanation of the derivation of conditions ( 4.59 )-( 4.61 ) is\ngiven in the remainder of this section, which can be skipped by those\nfamiliar with such an approach.\n\nConsider a small neighbourhood of a point @xmath on the reaction sheet,\nwhich has normal @xmath as shown in figure 4.3 . We temporarily consider\na coordinate system with origin @xmath and the @xmath -axis directed\nalong @xmath . Thus in a small neighbourhood of @xmath the reaction\nsheet is located at @xmath . We begin by assuming all state variables\nare continuous across the reaction sheet:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwith the notation @xmath .\n\nNow we introduce a stretched variable @xmath given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand inner expansions in the thin reaction layer for all variables in\nterms of the thickness of the reaction sheet @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.62)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that a subscript denotes successive terms in the inner expansion\nand a superscript denotes successive terms in the outer expansion of a\nvariable. The inner and outer variables must satisfy matching conditions\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor the velocity (and similar conditions on the other variables). Note\nthat by expanding the outer solution around @xmath we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.63)\n     @xmath      (4.64)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfor the velocity (and similar conditions on the other variables). We\nsubstitute the inner variables into equations ( 4.42 )-( 4.45 ) and\napply the matching conditions in order to derive jump conditions for the\nouter variables across the reaction sheet located at @xmath .\n\nTo leading order in equations ( 4.42 )-( 4.43 ), after substituting in\nthe inner expansions ( 4.62 ), we find\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich can be integrated, using matching condition ( 4.63 ), to find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.65)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nso that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nAt @xmath in the @xmath momentum equation ( 4.43 ), after noting ( 4.65\n), we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.66)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nDifferentiating matching condition ( 4.64 ) with respect to @xmath and\napplying to an integration of ( 4.66 ) then leads to\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nSimilarly, we look to @xmath in the @xmath momentum equation ( 4.43 )\nand apply the differentiated form of matching condition ( 4.64 ) to find\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nSince the temperature is adiabatic at the flame we already have\ncondition ( 4.48 ) on the outer temperature profile, which gives\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFinally, we have the jump condition on the mixture fraction, given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich is found by substituting ( 4.62 ) into ( 4.45 ) and integrating\nacross the reaction sheet. From the relations ( 4.56 ) between @xmath\nand @xmath , this gives the final condition\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe jump conditions above are valid at @xmath in the coordinate system\nchosen. We can now generalise this to all points lying on the reaction\nsheet instead of just a neighbourhood of @xmath (since @xmath is\narbitrary) and thus, by substitution of @xmath with the normal\ncoordinate @xmath , the conditions at the reaction sheet are given by\nconditions ( 4.59 )-( 4.61 ) across @xmath .\n\n### 4.4 Linear stability analysis\n\nTo summarise, dropping the superscript notation from equations ( 4.52\n)-( 4.56 ) gives the governing equations as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.67)\n     @xmath      (4.68)\n     @xmath      (4.69)\n     @xmath      (4.70)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.72)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese are to be solved on both sides of the reaction sheet located at\n@xmath , with the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.73)\n     @xmath      (4.74)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the jump conditions\n\n  -- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath      (4.75)\n              @xmath      (4.76)\n     @xmath               (4.77)\n  -- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nacross @xmath (where @xmath denotes a coordinate normal to the reaction\nsheet).\n\n#### 4.4.1 Base State\n\nEquations ( 4.67 )-( 4.70 ) admit a stationary planar solution with no\nflow given by, using bars to denote the base state,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.78)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsubject to boundary conditions ( 4.73 ) and ( 4.74 ).

It follows from ( 4.78 )-( 4.80 ) and conditions ( 4.73 )\nand ( 4.74 ) that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.81)\n     @xmath      (4.82)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus, using the condition on the right of ( 4.80 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.83)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nso that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.84)\n     @xmath      (4.85)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, the base state pressure profile @xmath can be found by\nintegrating the equation on the left of ( 4.78 ) with respect to @xmath\n.\n\n#### 4.4.2 Linear stability problem\n\nWe now perturb the base state by writing\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.86)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a small parameter measuring the magnitude of the\nperturbations (denoted by tilde). To @xmath in equations ( 4.67 )-( 4.70\n) we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.87)\n     @xmath      (4.88)\n     @xmath      (4.89)\n     @xmath      (4.90)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe wall boundary conditions on the perturbed variables are given by,\nusing ( 4.73 )-( 4.74 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.91)\n     @xmath      (4.92)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, we transfer the conditions ( 4.75 )-( 4.77 ) at the reaction\nsheet @xmath to @xmath by using a Taylor expansion around @xmath . For\nexample,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich, using the perturbation to @xmath in ( 4.86 ), becomes\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand therefore, at @xmath of the condition to the left of ( 4.77 ),\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHence, using the base state solution ( 4.84 )-( 4.85 ),\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe other reaction sheet conditions can be derived similarly, noting\nthat @xmath , @xmath , their derivatives and @xmath are continuous\nacross the reaction sheet in the base state. This leads to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.93)\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (4.94)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe linear stability problem has now been derived and is given by\nequations ( 4.87 )-( 4.90 ) for @xmath , subject to the boundary\nconditions ( 4.91 )-( 4.92 ) and the jump conditions ( 4.93 )-( 4.94 )\nacross @xmath . It is worth noting that @xmath takes different values\nbelow and above the reaction sheet, given by ( 4.84 ) and ( 4.85 ),\nrespectively.\n\nBefore continuing, it can be noted that equations ( 4.87 )-( 4.90 ),\nwhich are four equations in four variables, can be simplified into two\nequations in two variables. To this end, we first take @xmath ( 4.88 )+\n@xmath ( 4.89 ), which with the use of ( 4.87 ) gives\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.95)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe then take @xmath ( 4.89 ) to find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.96)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, substitution of ( 4.95 ) into ( 4.96 ) yields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.97)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus the perturbations @xmath and @xmath are governed by equations (\n4.90 ) and ( 4.97 ).\n\n#### 4.4.3 Fourier analysis\n\nWe consider normal mode solutions by setting\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.98)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAt this point it should be noted that three-dimensional perturbations of\nthe form @xmath , say, do not need to be considered because they lead to\nexactly the same problem, as derived below, if the substitution @xmath\nis made (known as Squire\u2019s transformation).\n\n##### Governing equations\n\nNote that for the derivation of the governing equations of the linear\nstability problem we do not need to consider @xmath or @xmath , but we\nshall here nevertheless write the continuity equation and the momentum\nequations in terms of the Fourier variables, which follows from\nsubstituting ( 4.98 ) into ( 4.87 )-( 4.89 ), for future use:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.99)\n     @xmath      (4.100)\n     @xmath      (4.101)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nContinuing with the equations for @xmath and @xmath , which follow from\nsubstituting ( 4.98 ) into ( 4.90 ) and ( 4.97 ), we have\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.102)\n     @xmath      (4.103)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere @xmath .\nSubstitution of ( 4.102 ) into ( 4.103 ) gives a single equation for\n@xmath in each region\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.104)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nIn other words, we have derived equations in the regions above and below\nthe reaction sheet, which depend on the derivative of the base\ntemperature in the respective region, given by ( 4.84 ) for @xmath and (\n4.85 ) for @xmath .\n\nFinally note that ( 4.103 ) implies that\n\n  -- -- -- ---------\n           (4.105)\n  -- -- -- ---------\n\nwhich will be useful when deriving the boundary conditions in the next\nsection.\n\n##### Boundary conditions\n\nOn using equations ( 4.99 ) and ( 4.105 ), which give @xmath in terms of\n@xmath and @xmath respectively, boundary conditions ( 4.91 )-( 4.92 )\nbecome, after substituting in ( 4.98 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.106)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\n##### Jump conditions\n\nConditions ( 4.94 ) can be written, after substituting in ( 4.98 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (4.107)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe velocity jump conditions ( 4.93 ) convert to\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.108)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nAlso on using ( 4.93 ) we have\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.109)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nNow, considering equation ( 4.99 ) and its successive differentiations\nwe can convert ( 4.108 ) to conditions on @xmath , namely,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand thus, using ( 4.109 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.110)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nFinally, substitution of ( 4.99 ) into ( 4.100 ) gives\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand hence ( 4.110 ) implies that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThus the linear stability problem for the system is fully formulated. It\nis given by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.111)\n     @xmath      (4.112)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwith the wall boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.113)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nthe mass\/momentum jump conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.114)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nand the reaction sheet conditions, which follow from using ( 4.105 ) in\n( 4.107 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n                 (4.115)\n                 (4.116)\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (4.117)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere the averaged flame position is given by @xmath .\n\nWe now have a sixth order ordinary differential equation for the\nvelocity perturbation @xmath in each region, with 13 auxiliary\nconditions (six boundary conditions at the wall and seven conditions at\nthe averaged reaction sheet). These conditions are sufficient to\ndetermine @xmath along with the eigenvalue @xmath , which will determine\nthe linear stability of the Burke\u2013Schumann diffusion flame. For given\nvalues of @xmath and @xmath , if the real part of the growth rate @xmath\nis greater than zero for any value of the wavenumber @xmath , the system\nis unstable. If the real part of @xmath is negative for all values of\n@xmath the system is stable.\n\n### 4.5 Solution of the linear stability problem\n\nIt is worth noting at this point that in the non-reactive case it can be\nshown that the growth rate @xmath is real and the marginal state is\ncharacterised by @xmath ; this is called the principle of the exchange\nof stabilities [ 86 , pp. 24\u201326] . Since this is not straightforward in\nour case, we instead begin by solving the linear stability problem\nnumerically using the BVP4C solver in Matlab to find the eigenvalue\n@xmath and investigate whether its imaginary part is zero at marginal\nstability. If so, we can characterise the marginal state as the state\nwhere @xmath and proceed to solve the problem in a similar approach to\nthe non-reactive case.\n\n#### 4.5.1 Numerical solution for @xmath\n\nIn this section, we numerically solve equations ( 4.111 ) and ( 4.112 )\nwith conditions ( 4.113 )-( 4.117 ). We use the\neigen-boundary-value-problem Matlab solver BVP4C [ 75 ] to find the\nvalue of the growth rate @xmath for given values of the wavenumber\n@xmath , the Rayleigh number @xmath and the stoichiometric coefficient\n@xmath . The key result is that @xmath is always found to be real.\nFigure 4.4 shows that as @xmath increases for selected values of @xmath\nand @xmath , @xmath passes from negative values to positive values and\nthere is a marginal value of @xmath at which the system changes from\nstability to instability and @xmath . We also plot the effect of the\nwavenumber on the growth rate for several values of the Rayleigh number\nin figure 4.5 , which clearly shows the existence of a critical Rayleigh\nnumber. If the Rayleigh number takes a value higher than its critical\nvalue, there is a band of wavenumbers for which @xmath and the system is\nunstable.\n\nAt this point we could produce many more plots investigating the\nstability of the system, however to avoid repetition we merely note that\nthe growth rate is always found to be real and thus @xmath characterises\nthe marginal state. We can therefore simplify the problem by setting\n@xmath in the governing equations and then solve to find the marginal\nRayleigh number. In the next section we will solve the marginal problem\nand then discuss the stability of the system in more detail.\n\n#### 4.5.2 Marginal state\n\nMotivated by the conclusions of the previous section, here we set @xmath\nin equations ( 4.111 ) and ( 4.112 ) with conditions ( 4.113 )-( 4.117\n), characterising the marginal state. This is the state at which the\nsystem passes from being stable to being unstable, and thus the Rayleigh\nnumber for which this state exists for a given wavenumber @xmath is the\nmarginal Rayleigh number at that wavenumber. Hence\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.118)\n     @xmath      (4.119)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwith the wall boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.120)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nthe mass\/momentum jump conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.121)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nand the reaction sheet conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.122)\n     @xmath      (4.123)\n     @xmath      (4.124)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere the averaged flame position is given by @xmath .\n\nFollowing a similar approach to that of Chandrasekhar [ 86 , pp. 36\u201342]\n, we let the velocity perturbation @xmath take the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIf we let\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.125)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwe find that the roots of these equations are given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThus we have six roots for the solution below the reaction sheet and six\nroots for the solution above it, given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere * denotes the complex conjugate. Here\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThus the solution for the velocity perturbation can be written as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (4.126)\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (4.127)\n     @xmath      \n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe problem has 13 auxiliary conditions while the general solution has\n12 constants of integration. We therefore need to apply 12 conditions in\norder to determine @xmath for a specified value of @xmath and use the\n13th condition to determine @xmath , from which we can find the marginal\nRayleigh number using the formula\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.128)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nTo write the boundary conditions on @xmath in matrix form, we begin by\nnoting, using ( 4.126 )-( 4.127 ), that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe conditions ( 4.120 )-( 4.123 ) can then be written in the matrix\nform @xmath for the vector of constants @xmath , which can be solved\nusing\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (4.129)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe then write the final condition ( 4.124 ), say, as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is a vector. A solution that satisfies all of the auxiliary\nconditions can therefore be found by solving the matrix equation ( 4.129\n) for given values of @xmath and @xmath in Matlab to find @xmath and\nthen using Matlab\u2019s fzero function with @xmath as the input. This will\nlead to a solution for @xmath and @xmath , from which the marginal\nRayleigh number can be found using equation ( 4.128 ). Note that the\ntemperature perturbation profile can be recovered from the velocity\nperturbation profile using the equations\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich are found by setting @xmath in ( 4.105 ) and using ( 4.125 ).\n\n### 4.6 Discussion of results\n\nIn this section we present the results found by solving the problem in\nthe marginal state using the method described at the end of the previous\nsection. The aim is to calculate the critical Rayleigh number @xmath ,\nwhich characterises the conditions at the threshold of instability, and\nits dependence upon the stoichiometric coefficient @xmath .\n\nWe begin with plots of how the Rayleigh number in the marginal state\nvaries with the wavenumber @xmath for two selected values of the\nstoichiometric coefficient @xmath , provided in figure 4.6 . Indicated\nin the figure are the calculated values of the critical Rayleigh number\n@xmath and the corresponding critical wavenumber @xmath for each value\nof @xmath . It can be seen that, for a given value of @xmath , if @xmath\nthere is a band of wavenumbers for which the growth rate @xmath ; thus\nif @xmath the perturbations made to the base state grow exponentially in\ntime and the system is unstable. Velocity perturbation profiles versus\n@xmath at the onset of instability @xmath for selected values of @xmath\nare presented in figure 4.7 .\n\nNext we plot, in figure 4.8 , the variation in @xmath with the\nstoichiometric coefficient @xmath and the flame position @xmath .\nIndicated in each plot is the critical Rayleigh number given in\nChandrasekhar [ 86 , p. 39] for the non-reactive problem with two rigid\nboundaries. The fact that @xmath in our reactive case is found to be\nvery close to the non-reactive critical Rayleigh number for large values\nof @xmath , but not exactly equal in the limit @xmath , can be explained\nby considering the equations governing the marginal state. As @xmath ,\nthe problem in the upper half-space above the reaction sheet reduces to\nthe non-reactive problem with two rigid boundaries, except for the\nconditions ( 4.122 ) and ( 4.123 ) at the reaction sheet. Thus, as\n@xmath the critical Rayleigh number approaches a value slightly\ndifferent to the non-reactive critical Rayleigh number, as can be seen\nin figure 4.8 . It is found that as the flame moves away from the lower\nboundary, @xmath first decreases slightly then increases to very large\nvalues as the flame approaches the upper boundary.\n\nIt can be seen in figure 4.8 that the order of magnitude of @xmath can\nsignificantly deviate from the order of magnitude of the critical\nRayleigh number in the non-reactive case, especially as @xmath . In\norder to facilitate comparison with the non-reactive case, we scale the\nRayleigh number, by using as reference length the distance of the flame\nfrom the upper boundary @xmath instead of @xmath . This scaled Rayleigh\nnumber is more comparable to the Rayleigh number in the non-reactive\ncase because both use as reference length the distance from the hot\nsurface to the cold upper boundary. The scaled critical Rayleigh number\nis given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn figure 4.9 we plot @xmath against the flame position @xmath and the\nstoichiometric coefficient @xmath and compare with two non-reactive\ncases. The first is the case of two rigid boundaries; the second is the\ncase of one rigid boundary and one free-surface boundary. Similarly to\nabove it is found that, as @xmath , @xmath is of the order of magnitude\nof the critical Rayleigh number in the rigid-rigid non-reactive case. It\nis also found that for @xmath (i.e. @xmath ), @xmath is of the order of\nmagnitude of the critical Rayleigh number in the rigid-free non-reactive\ncase. As the flame approaches the upper boundary, in the limit @xmath ,\n@xmath decreases to lower values.\n\n### 4.7 Numerical study\n\nWe now proceed to a full numerical treatment of the problem, using the\nfinite element package Comsol Multiphysics to directly simulate the\nphysical system. We solve the time-dependent equations ( 4.32 )-( 4.36 )\nwith boundary conditions ( 4.37 )-( 4.38 ). As initial condition we use\nthe planar strongly burning planar diffusion flame (which is found on\nthe upper branch of the curve in figure 4.2 ). The aims in this section\nare: first, to investigate the nature of the instabilities that occur\nfor values of the Rayleigh number slightly higher than @xmath ; second,\nto test the results of the linear stability analysis presented in the\nprevious section against numerical results; finally, to test the effect\nof thermal expansion and finite chemistry on @xmath .\n\nAll numerical calculations are performed for the parameter values @xmath\nand @xmath , in a numerical domain of aspect ratio 10; this aspect ratio\nhas been shown to be sufficiently large to approximate an infinite\ndomain in the non-reactive case by Gelfgat [ 115 ] . The domain is\ndiscretised into a non-uniform grid of approximately 120,000 triangular\nelements, with local refinement around the reaction zone and the upper\nand lower boundaries; various tests have been performed to ensure the\nmesh-independence of the results. We use a value of @xmath x @xmath to\napproximate an infinite Damk\u00f6hler number in all calculations unless\notherwise specified.\n\nWe begin with an illustrative calculation, shown in figure 4.10 , which\ndisplays the nature of the instability that occurs if @xmath takes a\nvalue slightly higher than @xmath . The figure shows the stationary,\nstable states that the system reaches for two selected values of @xmath\nwhen @xmath . The mechanism of the fluid instability is similar to that\nof the non-reactive case, described in detail by Chandrasekhar [ 86 ,\npp.9\u201310] and Getling [ 87 , p. 12] , whereby fluid of higher density\nlies above the hotter, lower density fluid causing convection to occur.\nThe induced flow enhances the transport of fuel and oxidiser to certain\nparts of the flame, generating a cellular structure, as shown in the\nfigure.\n\nNext, we test the validity of the linear stability results in the\nBoussinesq approximation and the effect of compressibility on the\ncritical Rayleigh number. In figure 4.11 we plot the relationship\nbetween (a) @xmath and @xmath and (b) @xmath and @xmath for several\nvalues of the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath . We also plot @xmath\nas predicted by the linear stability analysis, for comparison. As\nexpected, the values of @xmath calculated for a low value of @xmath are\nsimilar to the values calculated in the linear stability analysis. This\nis because the Boussinesq approximation is derived from an expansion in\nsmall @xmath of the governing equations.\n\nThe numerical results corresponding to larger, more realistic values of\nthe thermal expansion coefficient show several discrepancies with those\nof the linear stability analysis. Firstly, the non-Boussinesq system is\nfound to be more stable, a well known result in non-reactive\nRayleigh\u2013B\u00e9nard convection [ 116 ] . Secondly, the system is found to\nexhibit hysteresis at the onset of instability, whereby the system\nallows two different steady states for the same parameter values as\nshown in figure 4.12 ; again, it is well known in the literature for the\nnon-reactive case that this is associated with departures from the\nBoussinesq approximation [ 111 , 87 ] . Despite these differences,\nfigure 4.11 shows that the relationship between @xmath and @xmath is\nfound to be qualitatively similar for all of the selected values of\n@xmath .\n\nTo close this section, we now test the effect of finite chemistry on the\ncritical Rayleigh number by varying the Damk\u00f6hler number @xmath . The\nresults, presented in figure 4.13 , show that @xmath decreases as @xmath\ndecreases. In the limit @xmath there is little change in @xmath as\n@xmath varies; indeed, the curve in the figure can be seen to flatten\nout near @xmath . Thus the value @xmath used previously to approximate\ninfinitely fast chemistry is sufficiently large. As @xmath approaches\nits extinction value @xmath the system becomes considerably more\nunstable and @xmath is reduced significantly.\n\n### 4.8 Conclusion\n\nWe have studied, using analytical and numerical methods, the stability\nof a planar diffusion flame in an infinitely long channel with porous\nwalls, under gravitational effects. The conditions under which the\ndiffusion flame becomes unstable have been determined by calculation of\nthe critical Rayleigh number, which defines the threshold of\ninstability. Such results do not seem to be available in the literature.\n\nFirst, we have investigated the stability of the Burke\u2013Schumann flame,\nusing a linear stability analysis in the Boussinesq approximation. The\nrelationship between the position of the flame in the channel (governed\nby the stoichiometric coefficient) and the critical Rayleigh number has\nbeen determined. The growth rate of the linear stability problem was\nfirst confirmed to be real using numerical methods, so that the system\ncould be studied analytically in the marginal state using a similar\nmethod to that of the non-reactive problem.\n\nResults have been presented, which show that as the flame approaches the\nlower boundary with increasing stoichiometric coefficient, the critical\nRayleigh number is close to the well-known value it takes in the\nnon-reactive case with two rigid boundaries. A rescaling of the Rayleigh\nnumber using the distance between the flame and the cold upper boundary\nas reference length was performed to aid in the comparison between the\nreactive and non-reactive problems. The scaled critical Rayleigh number\nwas found to be (a) of the order of magnitude of the critical Rayleigh\nnumber in the non-reactive problem with two rigid boundaries, as the\nflame approaches the lower wall and (b) of the order of magnitude of the\ncritical Rayleigh number in the non-reactive problem with one rigid and\none free-surface boundary, when the flame is located a certain distance\nfrom the lower wall (which has been calculated).\n\nSecond, we have provided numerical solutions of the full set of\ngoverning equations for several values of the thermal expansion\ncoefficient using a finite-element method with a high Damk\u00f6hler number.\nThe results show that when the Rayleigh number is higher than its\ncritical value, the fluid forms convection rolls as in the non-reactive\ncase, which interact with the flame to generate cellular structures.\n\nFor weak values of the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath , which\ncorresponds to conditions in which the Boussinesq approximation is\nexpected to be valid, the numerical results show strong agreement with\nthose of the linear stability analysis. For larger values of @xmath ,\nthere is qualitative agreement between the numerical and analytical\nresults but several discrepancies caused by a higher thermal expansion\ncoefficient. The non-Boussinesq system was found to be more stable than\nthe system in the Boussinesq approximation and to exhibit hysteresis at\nthe onset of instability, which are well known results in the\nnon-reactive case.\n\nFinally, we have investigated the effect of finite chemistry on the\nsystem. The results show that the system becomes less stable as the\nDamk\u00f6hler number @xmath is decreased, especially as @xmath approaches\nits extinction value @xmath , below which the strongly burning diffusion\nflame cannot exist. For large values of @xmath the decrease in the\ncritical Rayleigh number with decreasing @xmath was found to be small.\n\nThe results in this study are a crucial step in the understanding of\ngravitational effects on diffusion flames with important ramifications\nto combustion in non-uniform mixtures such as triple flames. Chapter 5\nwill concentrate on the effect of gravity on steadily propagating triple\nflames, using the characterisation of the instability of the trailing\nplanar diffusion flame in this study as a basis.\n\n## Chapter 5 The effect of gravity and thermal expansion on the\npropagation of a triple flame in a horizontal channel\n\n### 5.1 Introduction\n\nThe study of triple flames, which consist of two premixed branches and a\ntrailing diffusion flame, has been extensive since their first\nexperimental observation by Phillips [ 26 ] . Early analytical studies\nwere carried out by Ohki and Tsuge [ 27 ] , followed by Dold and\ncollaborators [ 28 , 29 ] . These initial studies utilised the constant\ndensity approximation, decoupling the underlying hydrodynamics of the\nsystem from the equations of heat and mass. Most analytical studies\nsince have used this approximation while investigating several practical\naspects affecting triple flames. These aspects include preferential\ndiffusion [ 117 , 118 ] , heat losses [ 119 , 120 , 121 ] ,\nreversibility of the chemical reaction [ 122 , 123 ] and the presence of\na parallel flow [ 110 ] . For further references see the review papers [\n30 ] and [ 31 ] .\n\nIn this chapter, which is based on a paper by Pearce and Daou [ 1 ] , we\ndispense with the constant density approximation in order to describe\nthe coupled effect of thermal expansion and gravity on the propagation\nof a triple flame. To this end, it is imperative to first understand\nthis effect on the \u201cstrongly burning\u201d diffusion flame, which forms one\nof the triple flame\u2019s branches. Steadily propagating triple flames are\nonly expected for parameter values for which the diffusion flame exists\nand is stable. In Chapter 4 , we undertook a comprehensive study on the\nstability of a diffusion flame under the influence of gravity and\nthermal expansion in the channel configuration adopted in the present\nchapter (see also the paper by Pearce and Daou [ 2 ] on this topic).\nThere is thus a clear understanding of the values that the parameters\ncan take to ensure the existence and stability of the trailing diffusion\nflame.\n\nThe first attempt to understand the effects of variable density on\ntriple flames was undertaken by Ruetsch et al. [ 32 ] , who investigated\nthe problem numerically. They have also derived a scaling law describing\nthe increase in the propagation speed of the triple flame above the\nplanar premixed flame speed due to thermal expansion. The increase was\nattributed to the divergence of the flow field ahead of the flame. The\nresult was confirmed in [ 124 ] using numerical simulation; further\nrelated numerical studies were carried out in [ 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ] .\n\nTriple flames propagating in a direction parallel to the direction of\ngravity have been investigated numerically and experimentally in [ 37 ,\n38 , 39 , 40 ] . It has been found that the propagation speed of a\ntriple flame propagating downwards is decreased in comparison to that of\na triple flame in the absence of gravity. The change in the propagation\nspeed has been explained in [ 39 ] as being due to an increase in the\nacceleration of the gas ahead of the triple flame leading edge, caused\nby buoyancy. Conversely, upward propagation leads to an increase in the\npropagation speed. To our knowledge no dedicated studies have been\nundertaken on triple flames propagating in a direction perpendicular to\ngravity.\n\nIn the present chapter we investigate the combined effect of thermal\nexpansion and gravity on the propagation of a triple flame in a\nhorizontal channel with rigid walls, through which fuel and oxidiser are\ninjected. The main aim is to describe the behaviour of the triple flame\nin terms of three non-dimensional parameters; the flame-front thickness,\nthe thermal expansion coefficient and the Rayleigh number.\n\nThe chapter is structured as follows. In \u00a7 5.2 we provide a\nnon-dimensional formulation of the problem. In \u00a7 5.3 we present some\nimportant preliminary results used in later discussions, related to the\nplanar premixed flame and to the existence and stability of the planar\ndiffusion flame. In \u00a7 5.4 , we present the numerical results obtained.\nIn particular, the effect of thermal expansion and gravity on a triple\nflame is described, with special emphasis on the relationship between\nthe propagation speed @xmath and the flame-front thickness @xmath for\nvarious values of the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath and the\nRayleigh number @xmath . We close the chapter with a summary of the main\nfindings and recommendations for future studies.\n\n### 5.2 Formulation\n\nWe investigate the problem of a triple flame propagating through an\ninfinitely long channel of height @xmath , where fuel is provided at the\nupper wall and oxidiser at the lower wall, as shown in figure 5.1 . For\nsimplicity, the temperatures of the walls are assumed to be equal. The\ngoverning equations consist of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations coupled to\nequations for temperature and mass fractions of fuel and oxidiser. The\ncombustion is modelled as a single irreversible one-step reaction of the\nform\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere F denotes the fuel and O the oxidiser. The quantity @xmath denotes\nthe mass of oxidiser consumed and @xmath the heat released, both per\nunit mass of fuel.\nThe overall reaction rate @xmath is taken to follow an Arrhenius law of\nthe form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are\nthe density, the fuel mass fraction, the oxidiser mass fraction, the\nuniversal gas constant, the temperature, the pre-exponential factor and\nthe activation energy of the reaction, respectively.\n\n#### 5.2.1 Governing Equations\n\nThe governing equations in the low Mach number formulation will be\nwritten here using a co-ordinate system attached to the flame front.\nMore precisely, if @xmath denotes the propagation speed of the flame\nfront relative to the laboratory (with @xmath indicating a propagation\nto the left), we shall use the co-ordinates\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThis leads to\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nDropping primes, we write the governing equations as the continuity\nequation\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (5.1)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nmomentum equations\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (5.2)\n           (5.3)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\ntemperature equation\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (5.4)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nfuel and oxidiser mass fraction equations\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.5)\n     @xmath      (5.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand the equation of state\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere @xmath is the hydrodynamic pressure and @xmath , @xmath , and\n@xmath denote the diffusion coefficients of heat, fuel and oxidiser,\nrespectively. @xmath refers to the temperature of the unburnt mixture\nwhich is also the temperature of both channel walls, while @xmath is the\ndensity of the unburnt mixture. We assume that @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath are constant, as are the specific heat capacity @xmath , thermal\nconductivity @xmath and dynamic viscosity @xmath . The flame speed\n@xmath is an eigenvalue of the problem and must be determined as part of\nthe solution.\nThe conditions as @xmath correspond to the frozen solution with no flow,\nwhich is independent of @xmath and is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.8)\n     @xmath      (5.9)\n     @xmath      (5.10)\n     @xmath      (5.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath refer to the prescribed mass fractions at the\nfuel and oxidiser sides respectively. The channel walls are also\nconsidered rigid; thus the lateral boundary conditions are\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.12)\n     @xmath      (5.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nDownstream as @xmath the solution corresponds to the one-dimensional\nstrongly burning solution of the diffusion flame, which is again\nindependent of @xmath .\nFor large activation energies, the flame-front region is expected to be\ncentred around the stoichiometric surface @xmath where @xmath .\nUpstream, the position of the stoichiometric surface can be determined\nfrom equations ( 5.8 )-( 5.10 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a normalised stoichiometric coefficient.\nWe now introduce the non-dimensional variables\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere the subscript \u2019st\u2019 denotes values at the upstream stoichiometric\nsurface. Here @xmath is the adiabatic flame temperature, @xmath is the\nZeldovich number or non-dimensional activation energy and @xmath is the\nthermal expansion coefficient. In non-dimensionalising we have used as\nunit speed\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is the laminar burning speed of the stoichiometric planar flame to\nleading order for @xmath .\nInserting the scalings above into equations ( 5.1 )-( 5.7 ) leads to the\nnon-dimensional equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.16)\n     @xmath      (5.17)\n     @xmath      (5.18)\n     @xmath      (5.19)\n     @xmath      (5.20)\n     @xmath      (5.21)\n     @xmath      (5.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a modified pressure given by @xmath and @xmath is the\nnon-dimensional propagation speed relative to the laboratory. The\nnon-dimensional parameters are defined as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich are the Rayleigh number, the flame-front thickness @xmath measured\nagainst the unit length @xmath , the fuel and oxidiser Lewis numbers and\nthe Prandtl number, respectively. Here @xmath is the kinematic viscosity\n@xmath . Note that @xmath is related to the Damk\u00f6hler number used in\nChapter 4 by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe non-dimensional reaction rate is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a heat release parameter given by @xmath . Note that in\nthe low Mach number approximation the two parameters @xmath and @xmath\nare in fact equal, which follows from equation ( 5.7 ). In this study,\nhowever, we leave the two distinct to aid comparison of our results with\nthose previously obtained in the constant density approximation [ 118 ]\n, where @xmath appears in the reaction term @xmath and only there. To\nassess the effect of thermal expansion we shall vary the coefficient\n@xmath , while maintaining @xmath constant, as in [ 118 , 119 ] . Thus\nas @xmath the equations in our study reduce to those of the constant\ndensity approximation \u00b9 \u00b9 1 In asymptotic studies with @xmath , of\ncourse @xmath is unimportant and can be set to zero. However, for finite\nvalues of @xmath , say @xmath (which is commonly used in numerical\nstudies), @xmath has a noticeable effect. .\n\nFinally, ( 5.12 )-( 5.13 ) imply that the boundary conditions are\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.24)\n     @xmath      (5.25)\n     @xmath      (5.26)\n     @xmath      (5.27)\n     @xmath      (5.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe non-dimensional problem is now fully formulated and is given by\nequations ( 5.16 )-( 5.22 ), subject to the boundary conditions ( 5.24\n)-( 5.28 ). The non-dimensional parameters in this problem are @xmath ,\n@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath\n. Throughout this study we will make the assumption of unity Lewis\nnumbers,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n### 5.3 Preliminary study: the planar premixed flame and the planar\ndiffusion flame\n\nAs a preliminary study whose results will be useful for subsequent\ndiscussions, in this section we investigate the planar premixed flame\nand the planar diffusion flame. We will begin with a discussion of how\nthe propagation speed of the planar premixed flame is affected by the\nparameters @xmath and @xmath . We will then study the planar diffusion\nflame to determine the values of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath for which it\nis expected to exist in a stable state.\n\n#### 5.3.1 Planar premixed flame\n\nThe equations governing the planar premixed flame are the stationary,\n@xmath -independent form of equations ( 5.16 )-( 5.22 ), subject to the\nboundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.30)\n     @xmath      (5.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe stationary, one-dimensional problem is solved using the\nfinite-element package Comsol Multiphysics. The aim is to investigate\nthe effect of the parameters @xmath and @xmath on the numerically\ncalculated planar premixed flame propagation speed @xmath , which can be\ncompared to its asymptotic value as @xmath . We give the other\nparameters fixed values of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath .\n\nIn the limit @xmath the (dimensional) propagation speed of the\nstoichiometric planar flame undergoing thermal expansion should approach\nthe asymptotically derived value @xmath , given by equation ( 5.15 ).\nThus, since we have scaled the velocity by this value, the numerically\ncalculated propagation speed @xmath should approach unity for all values\nof @xmath as @xmath . Figure 5.2 shows that the numerically calculated\nvalue of @xmath does indeed approach unity with increasing @xmath for a\nfixed value of @xmath , as expected.\n\nFor the remainder of this study we let @xmath take a typical value,\nnamely @xmath . From figure 5.2 it can be seen that for this value of\n@xmath , the propagation speed @xmath deviates from its expected value\nof unity by about 12%. However, to achieve a notable increase in\naccuracy would involve significant extra computational cost.\n\nIt will also be useful in later discussions to describe how @xmath\nvaries with the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath . Figure 5.3\npresents a plot of @xmath versus @xmath for a fixed value of @xmath .\n\n#### 5.3.2 Planar diffusion flame\n\nSteadily propagating triple flames are not expected if @xmath exceeds\nthe extinction value @xmath of the planar diffusion flame. Here we\ntherefore numerically solve the underlying one-dimensional equations\nindependent of @xmath , to produce a plot of @xmath versus @xmath ,\nwhich is provided in figure 5.4 .\n\nA plot of the values of @xmath for which the trailing planar diffusion\nflame becomes unstable under gravity will also be useful in later\ndiscussions. This stability problem was investigated in Chapter 4 (see\nalso the paper by Pearce and Daou [ 2 ] ), from which important results\nrelevant to our study are summarised in figure 5.5 . Shown is an\nadaptation of figure 4.13 , plotting the critical value of @xmath versus\nthe Rayleigh number @xmath , for @xmath . This critical value defines\nthe neutral stability curve which separates the two stability regions in\nthe figure. These regions, labelled A and B, define the regions of\nstability and instability of the planar diffusion flame, respectively.\n\n### 5.4 Results for a triple flame propagating in a channel\n\nIn this section we present the results obtained by solving the\nstationary form of equations ( 5.16 )-( 5.22 ) with boundary conditions\n( 5.24 )-( 5.28 ), using the finite-element package Comsol Multiphysics.\nThe main aim of the work is to calculate the propagation speed @xmath in\nterms of the parameters @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , which represent\nthermal expansion, strain rate and gravity, respectively. The other\nparameters are assigned the values @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath throughout this section. We begin with an investigation into the\neffect of thermal expansion on a triple flame in the absence of gravity.\nThis is followed by a study on the combined effect of gas expansion and\ngravity.\n\n#### 5.4.1 Effect of thermal expansion on a triple flame in the absence\nof gravity\n\nIn this section we investigate the effect of thermal expansion on a\ntriple flame in the absence of gravity. We therefore let @xmath\nthroughout the section. Since the aim of the study is to calculate\n@xmath , we will begin with a plot of @xmath versus @xmath for several\nvalues of the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath . In order to fully\nunderstand the effect of the two parameters @xmath and @xmath , we will\nend with a comparison of how the streamlines and reaction rate contours\nchange with increasing @xmath for several fixed values of @xmath .\n\n##### Propagation speed of a triple flame\n\nFigure 5.6 shows a plot of the propagation speed @xmath of the triple\nflame (scaled by the numerically calculated propagation speed @xmath of\nthe planar premixed flame, shown in figure 5.3 ) versus @xmath for\nseveral values of the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath . The maximum\nvalue @xmath can take for each @xmath is the extinction value @xmath of\nthe trailing planar diffusion flame, which can be found in figure 5.4 .\nThe monotonic relationship between @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath\ndecreasing to negative values when @xmath is close to @xmath , is a well\nknown property of constant density triple flames with Lewis numbers\ngreater than or equal to unity [ 118 ] . It is found that this property\nremains valid for triple flames undergoing thermal expansion, for all\nvalues of @xmath , as shown in figure 5.6 .\n\nIt can also be seen in figure 5.6 that, if @xmath , @xmath approaches a\nvalue larger than that of the planar premixed flame as @xmath approaches\nzero (i.e. @xmath as @xmath ). This result agrees with previous studies,\nwhich have found that thermal expansion causes an increase in the\npropagation speed of a triple flame above the speed of the planar\npremixed flame [ 32 , 124 ] .\n\nIn fact, it can be derived (see [ 32 ] ) that under the influence of\nthermal expansion, and in the limit @xmath , the ratio of the\npropagation speed of the triple flame to that of the planar premixed\nflame can be approximated by the formula\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus in the case @xmath , say, the propagation speed of the triple flame\n(when scaled by the propagation speed of the planar premixed flame) can\nbe expected to approach approximately the value 2.58 as @xmath .\nTherefore our results are in good agreement with the predictions made in\n[ 32 ] , as can be seen in figure 5.6 .\n\n##### Comparative cases for fixed @xmath\n\nFigures 5.7 \u2013 5.10 show the reaction rate contours and streamlines of\nthe system for increasing values of @xmath , with several fixed values\nof the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath . Examining, for example,\nfigure 5.10 shows the mechanism for the increase in triple flame speed\nabove that of the planar premixed flame with thermal expansion as @xmath\n, discussed in the previous section.\n\nThe figure shows that, for small @xmath , ahead of the flame front the\nstreamlines diverge. As explained in detail in [ 32 ] , the divergence\nof the streamlines occurs because the fluid velocity normal to the flame\nfront increases with thermal expansion, while the fluid velocity\ntangential to the flame front remains the same. The flow velocity vector\nis therefore bent towards the centreline (or stoichiometric surface) of\nthe triple flame as it crosses the flame front. This must be\naccommodated by a divergence of the streamlines, which causes a drop in\nthe horizontal component of the fluid velocity just ahead of the flame\nfront. For small @xmath , since the flame front is quasi-planar, the\nfluid velocity just ahead of the flame should be approximately equal to\nthe propagation speed of the planar-premixed flame @xmath . Thus, since\nthe fluid velocity drops ahead of the flame front, the fluid velocity\nupstream of the flame must be above @xmath .\n\n#### 5.4.2 Effect of gravity on a triple flame\n\nIn this section we investigate the combined effect of thermal expansion\nand gravity on a triple flame. Throughout this section we let the\nthermal expansion coefficient take the typical value @xmath . Note that\nwe only consider values in parameter space for which the underlying\nplanar diffusion flame is stable, as shown in figure 5.5 . Since the aim\nof the study is to calculate the propagation speed @xmath , we will\nbegin with a plot of @xmath versus @xmath for several values of the\nRayleigh number @xmath . We will then plot graphs of @xmath versus\n@xmath for selected values of @xmath to further capture the complex\nrelationships that are displayed between the physical parameters and the\npropagation speed. We will end with a comparison of how the streamlines\nand reaction rate contours change with increasing @xmath for several\nfixed values of @xmath .\n\n##### Propagation speed of a triple flame\n\nFigure 5.11 shows a plot of the propagation speed @xmath of the triple\nflame versus @xmath , for selected values of the Rayleigh number @xmath\n. The figure shows, firstly, that in the limit @xmath the Rayleigh\nnumber has very little effect on the propagation speed of a triple\nflame. This could be easily deduced by considering equation ( 5.18 ) and\nnoting that, as @xmath , the buoyancy term does not enter the problem at\n@xmath unless @xmath . Secondly, the figure shows that there is a\ncritical Rayleigh number, calculated as approximately @xmath , above\nwhich the graph of @xmath versus @xmath ceases to be monotonic. Finally,\nit shows the complex behaviour of the system for even higher values of\n@xmath . It is found that there can exist three different steady\nsolutions for some low values of @xmath (i.e. the system exhibits\nhysteresis). It is also found that at @xmath , there is a local maximum\nin the graph of @xmath versus @xmath . As @xmath approaches its\nextinction value @xmath , @xmath is found to fall to negative values as\nin the case without gravity.\n\nSome of the complex behaviour of the system can be captured by\nmaintaining @xmath fixed and varying @xmath . Graphs of @xmath versus\n@xmath for selected values of @xmath are plotted in figure 5.12 . In\nfigures 5.12 \u2013 5.12 , in which @xmath takes a low value, the hysteresis\ndisplayed by the system can be clearly seen, whereby for certain values\nof @xmath there are three solutions for @xmath . The middle branches of\nthese hysteresis curves have been found to consist of unstable\nsolutions. For a slightly higher value of @xmath there is no longer\nfound to be a multiplicity of solutions; the propagation speed has a\nlocal minimum at a certain value of @xmath before increasing as @xmath\nreaches higher values, as shown in figure 5.12 . In figure 5.12 , in\nwhich @xmath , @xmath is seen to increase monotonically with @xmath .\nFigure 5.12 shows that if @xmath for a triple flame without gravity, the\npropagation speed remains near zero as @xmath increases. Finally, figure\n5.12 shows that when @xmath is near its extinction value (with the\npropagation speed being negative), @xmath decreases monotonically with\n@xmath .\n\nFor sufficiently small @xmath , as in figures 5.12 \u2013 5.12 , it can be\nseen that @xmath decreases with increasing @xmath for not too large\n@xmath . This can be explained by considering the physical behaviour of\nthe system, which we proceed to investigate next.\n\n##### Comparative cases for fixed @xmath\n\nFigures 5.13 \u2013 5.15 show the reaction rate contours and streamlines of\nthe system with increasing values of @xmath , for several fixed values\nof @xmath . \u00b2 \u00b2 2 It is important to note that the solutions plotted for\n@xmath in figures 5.13 \u2013 5.15 lie on the upper branch of the hysteresis\ncurves described in \u00a7 5.4.1 , where applicable. All of the steady\nsolutions plotted in figures 5.13 \u2013 5.15 have been found to be stable by\nrunning time-dependent simulations. From these diagrams it can be seen\nthat buoyancy forces cause the formation of vortices upstream of the\nflame (or downstream of a negatively propagating triple flame). For\nhigher values of @xmath , the vortex formed is found to be larger in its\nsize and the strength of its flow.\n\nThese vortices can be explained as being caused by the temperature\ngradient from cold to hot along the positive @xmath -direction in the\nchannel. It has been found that in a channel or pipe in the absence of a\nflame, differentially heated end walls cause the fluid in the channel or\npipe to flow from hot to cold along the top of the domain, and from cold\nto hot along the bottom of the domain [ 125 ] . The flow is explained in\n[ 125 ] as being due to buoyancy forces caused by the change in density\nwith temperature. A similar mechanism can explain the vortices caused by\na triple flame in a channel and thus the reduction in the propagation\nspeed of the triple flame for small values of @xmath , when the Rayleigh\nnumber is increased above zero.\n\nThe flow of fluid from hot to cold at the top of the domain and cold to\nhot at the bottom causes a downward flow in front of a positively\npropagating triple flame, bending the stoichiometric isosurface ahead of\nthe flame downwards. Effectively this reduces the component of the\npropagation velocity in the horizontal direction.\n\nMore precisely, for small values of @xmath (for which the flame front is\nquasi-planar), the fluid velocity perpendicular to the flame front\nacross the flame is approximately given by the planar premixed flame\nspeed @xmath . Thus, when the stoichiometric isosurface ahead of the\nflame is bent to an angle @xmath to the horizontal by the downward flow\nahead of the flame, the propagation speed can be expected to be\napproximately @xmath , as shown in figure 5.16 . Therefore for small\n@xmath , an increase in the Rayleigh number (which causes the vortices\nahead of the flame to be stronger, and hence bends the stoichiometric\nisosurface further downwards and increases @xmath ) leads to a decrease\nin the propagation speed @xmath , in the absence of other effects.\n\nThis physical behaviour is best illustrated by considering the triple\nflame under the influence of gravity but in the absence of thermal\nexpansion, so that the acceleration of the flow field as it crosses the\ntriple flame does not mask the effects of buoyancy. To do this, we must\nmake use of the Boussinesq approximation, and expand the ideal gas\nequation of density, given by equation ( 5.22 ), as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis gives @xmath to leading order in every term in equations ( 5.16 )-(\n5.21 ), except the buoyancy term in equation ( 5.18 ), which becomes\n@xmath .\n\nNow we numerically solve equations ( 5.16 )-( 5.21 ) with boundary\nconditions ( 5.24 )-( 5.28 ) in the Boussinesq approximation, for a\nsmall value of the Rayleigh number, as @xmath . Plotted in figure 5.17\nis the vertical component of the velocity along the centreline of the\ntriple flame located at @xmath . It can be seen that there is a\ndownwards flow upstream of the point where the reaction rate reaches a\nmaximum, and an upwards flow downstream of it. This clearly illustrates\nthe vortex formed by the triple flame and the downwards flow ahead of\nthe flame front.\n\n### 5.5 Conclusion\n\nIn this study, the effect of thermal expansion and gravity on a triple\nflame propagating in a horizontal channel where the fuel and oxidiser\nconcentrations are prescribed at the walls has been investigated. This\nseems to be the first investigation dedicated to triple flame\npropagation in a direction perpendicular to gravity. The problem has\nbeen formulated in the low Mach number approximation and solved\nnumerically. The effect of the flame-front thickness @xmath on the\npropagation speed @xmath has been described for several values of the\nthermal expansion coefficient @xmath and the Rayleigh number @xmath .\n\nIt has been found that the well-known monotonic relationship between\n@xmath and @xmath that is present in the constant density case (which\narises in the limit @xmath ) remains valid for @xmath , when @xmath\n(i.e. in the absence of gravity). In fact, the influence of @xmath on\nthe triple flame for @xmath is found to agree with the conclusions of\nthe study [ 32 ] , where the physical mechanism for the increase in\npropagation speed has been explained.\n\nUnder the influence of gravity we have shown that the monotonic\nrelationship between @xmath and @xmath is only present for values of\n@xmath below a critical value which has been determined. Further, it has\nbeen shown that, if @xmath takes a value higher than this critical\nvalue, there is a local maximum in the graph of @xmath versus @xmath ,\nas can be seen in figure 5.11 . The system has been shown to exhibit\nhysteresis for even higher values of the Rayleigh number.\n\nThe complex relationship between @xmath and @xmath has been further\ninvestigated by fixing @xmath and varying @xmath . It has been found\nthat the graph of @xmath versus @xmath (see figure 5.12 ) depends\nstrongly on the value of @xmath chosen. Time-dependent simulations have\nshown that all of the steady solutions presented are stable, except for\nsolutions on the middle branch of the hysteresis curves presented in\nfigure 5.12 . Finally, a physical argument has been provided, which\nexplains the decrease of @xmath with increasing gravity for small values\nof @xmath .\n\nThe results of this study provide valuable insight into the behaviour of\na triple flame under gravitational effects and illustrate the complexity\nand variety of the scenarios that arise. A further aspect of the problem\nthat has yet to be studied is the transient behaviour of a triple flame\nthat is unstable due to gravitational effects. This will be addressed in\nChapter 6 , which involves the numerical solution of the time-dependent\nequations for values of @xmath higher than the critical Rayleigh number\nfor the instability of a planar diffusion flame.\n\n## Chapter 6 Initiation and instability of triple flames subject to\nthermal expansion and gravity\n\n### 6.1 Introduction\n\nUnderstanding the transient behaviour of a flame from initiation to\nsteady propagation, and in some cases instability, is a vital part of\nfundamental combustion research. In this chapter we study the problem of\ntriple flame initiation in a mixing layer, taking the combined effect of\nthermal expansion and gravity into account. As well as investigating the\neffect of these phenomena on the energy required for initiation of\ntriple flames from a two-dimensional ignition kernel, we study the\ntransient behaviour of a triple flame with a trailing diffusion flame\nthat is either stable or unstable due to gravitational effects.\n\nThe problem of ignition in homogeneous mixtures, which leads to the\npropagation of premixed flames, has been the focus of a large amount of\nresearch. In the particular case of spherically expanding premixed\nflames, a criterion for the energy required for ignition is provided by\nthe thermal energy of a non-propagating, spherically symmetric solution\nof the governing equations known as a Zeldovich flame ball [ 126 ] .\nFlame balls have been found to be typically unstable under adiabatic\nconditions, and small perturbations can lead to either an outwardly\npropagating flame or an inwardly propagating flame and eventual\nextinction [ 126 , 127 , 128 , 129 ] . Further studies in the literature\nhave investigated the transient behaviour of spherical premixed flames\nfrom an initial ignition kernel, depending on aspects such as heat loss\nand Lewis numbers (see e.g. [ 130 , 131 , 132 , 133 ] ).\n\nThere has been considerably less focus on flame ignition in situations\nwhere the reactants are non-premixed. The work that has been done on\nboth laminar and turbulent non-premixed ignition is summarised in the\ndetailed review paper [ 134 ] . Most studies on non-premixed flame\nignition have been concerned with autoignition, sometimes referred to as\n\u201cself-ignition\u201d. There are very few papers that have investigated the\nenergy required for \u201cforced ignition\u201d of non-premixed flames by an\nexternal heat source or spark. The transient behaviour of flames in\ninhomogeneous mixtures from forced ignition has been investigated using\nDirect Numerical Simulations (DNS) in the laminar case in [ 124 , 135 ]\n, and more recently with the effects of turbulence included in [ 136 ,\n137 , 138 , 139 ] . These numerical studies do not, however, contain a\ndetailed investigation of the energy required for ignition. To our\nknowledge there have been no dedicated investigations of the energy\nrequired for forced ignition of laminar two-dimensional triple flames in\nmixing layers, even without taking thermal expansion and gravity into\naccount.\n\nSome recent papers have extended the concept of Zeldovich flame balls to\nthe inhomogeneous case, theoretically [ 41 ] and numerically [ 42 ]\ndescribing the existence and properties of flame balls in reactive\nmixing layers. Similarly to Zeldovich flame balls, these inhomogeneous\nflame balls may provide a corresponding criterion for the minimum energy\nfor the successful flame ignition of axisymmetric flames in the mixing\nlayer. Here we extend the current understanding of flame ignition by\nproviding a criterion for the minimum ignition energy for\ntwo-dimensional triple flames in the mixing layer, via a two-dimensional\nignition kernel. This is achieved by first investigating steady,\ntwo-dimensional, non-propagating solutions of the governing equations\nwhich we refer to as \u201cflame tube\u201d solutions. Such solutions have been\nobserved in previous numerical simulations [ 140 , 141 , 30 , 142 ]\nwhere the planar solutions are prone to cellular instabilities due to\nLewis number effects [ 141 ] , but these studies were not concerned with\nignition. More relevant to the ignition problem are the papers [ 43 ]\nand [ 44 ] . These studies include investigations of \u201cflame isolas\u201d and\n\u201cflame disks\u201d, respectively, which are similar axisymmetric, stationary\nsolutions of the governing equations. Although [ 43 ] and [ 44 ] only\npartially address the ignition problem, in the paper [ 44 ] ,\nnon-propagating \u201cflame disk\u201d solutions are argued to indicate that a\nminimum energy is required for ignition of axisymmetric flames in the\nmixing layer. To our understanding, no such study has yet been performed\nfor two-dimensional triple flames in the mixing layer, as investigated\nin this chapter, with the effects of thermal expansion and gravity\nincluded.\n\nIn this chapter we also investigate the transient evolution of the\npropagating triple flames that arise when a perturbation is added to the\nunstable flame tube solutions. Steadily propagating triple flames are\nwell studied. Aspects of these structures that have been investigated\ninclude preferential diffusion [ 117 , 118 ] , heat losses [ 119 , 120 ,\n121 ] , reversibility of the chemical reaction [ 122 , 123 ] , the\npresence of a parallel flow [ 110 ] and thermal expansion [ 32 , 1 ] ;\nfor further references see the review papers [ 30 ] and [ 31 ] . Here we\nare specifically interested in the combined effect of thermal expansion\nand gravity on both the ignition energy of triple flames from\ntwo-dimensional ignition kernels and the transient behaviour of the\ntriple flames.\n\nWhen investigating triple flames propagating perpendicular to the\ndirection of gravity it is crucial to first understand whether or not\nthe planar diffusion flame is stable, since this forms the trailing\nbranch of the triple flame. In Chapter 4 we provided such a study; we\nhave also investigated, in Chapter 5 , the combined effect of thermal\nexpansion and gravity on steadily propagating triple flames (see also\nthe papers by Pearce and Daou [ 1 , 2 ] ). The current chapter completes\nthe picture by investigating the transient behaviour of triple flames\nfrom their initiation in contexts where the underlying planar diffusion\nflame is either stable or unstable.\n\nThe chapter is structured as follows. In \u00a7 6.2 we formulate the problem.\nIn \u00a7 6.3 we provide the results obtained from the numerical solution of\nthe governing equations. \u00a7 6.3 is split into three parts: the first part\nconsists of important preliminary results; the second part provides the\nresults of numerical simulations for values of the parameters where the\nunderlying diffusion flame is stable; and the third part is concerned\nwith areas of parameter space where the underlying diffusion flame is\nunstable. Finally, we end the chapter with conclusions in \u00a7 6.4 .\n\n### 6.2 Formulation\n\nWe investigate the problem of triple flame initiation in an infinitely\nlong channel of height @xmath , where fuel is provided at the upper wall\nand oxidiser at the lower wall, as shown in figure 6.1 . The walls are\ntaken to be rigid, porous, isothermal and of equal temperature. The\ngoverning equations for fuel and oxidiser are coupled to the\nNavier\u2013Stokes equations for the fluid velocity vector @xmath in order to\ntake thermal expansion and gravity into account. For simplicity, the\ncombustion is modelled as a single irreversible one-step reaction of the\nform\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere F denotes the fuel and O the oxidiser; @xmath denotes the mass of\noxidiser consumed and @xmath the heat released, both per unit mass of\nfuel. The overall reaction rate @xmath is taken to follow an Arrhenius\nlaw of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are\nthe density, the fuel mass fraction, the oxidiser mass fraction, the\nuniversal gas constant, the temperature, the pre-exponential factor and\nthe activation energy of the reaction, respectively.\n\n#### 6.2.1 Governing equations\n\nWe adopt the low Mach number formulation and assume that @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath are constant, where @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are the\ndiffusion coefficients of heat, fuel and oxidiser, respectively. We also\nassume that the specific heat capacity @xmath , the thermal conductivity\n@xmath and the dynamic viscosity @xmath are constant. These assumptions\nlead to the governing equations\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.1)\n     @xmath      (6.2)\n     @xmath      (6.3)\n     @xmath      (6.4)\n     @xmath      (6.5)\n     @xmath      (6.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere @xmath is the hydrodynamic pressure, @xmath is the temperature of\nthe unburnt mixture and the channel walls, and @xmath is the density of\nthe unburnt mixture. The mass fractions at the channel walls, which are\nassumed to be rigid, are also prescribed; the boundary conditions at the\nwalls are therefore given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.7)\n     @xmath      (6.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn this chapter we are concerned with the initiation of a pair of triple\nflames, which are expected to propagate in opposite directions [ 124 ,\n135 ] ; we therefore impose symmetry conditions at the centreline, which\nwe take to be located at @xmath , and solve the problem for @xmath . In\nthe unburnt gas at @xmath we assume that the induced flow is fully\ndeveloped and the temperature and mass fractions are \u201cfrozen\u201d. The\nboundary conditions at @xmath and @xmath are therefore given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.9)\n     @xmath      (6.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor large activation energies, the flame-front region is expected to be\ncentred around the stoichiometric surface @xmath where @xmath . In the\nunburnt gas at @xmath , the position of the stoichiometric surface can\nbe determined from the frozen solution ( 6.9 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a normalised stoichiometric coefficient.\nWe now introduce the non-dimensional variables\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the subscript \u2019st\u2019 denotes values at the stoichiometric surface.\nHere @xmath is the adiabatic flame temperature, @xmath is the Zeldovich\nnumber or non-dimensional activation energy and @xmath is the thermal\nexpansion coefficient. In non-dimensionalising we have used as unit\nspeed\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is the laminar burning speed of the stoichiometric planar flame to\nleading order for @xmath . The scalings ( 6.12 ) are inserted into ( 6.1\n)-( 6.6 ) to give the non-dimensional governing equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.14)\n     @xmath      (6.15)\n     @xmath      (6.16)\n     @xmath      (6.17)\n     @xmath      (6.18)\n     @xmath      (6.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe non-dimensional parameters are defined as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich are the Rayleigh number, the flame-front thickness @xmath measured\nagainst the unit length @xmath , the fuel and oxidiser Lewis numbers and\nthe Prandtl number, respectively. Here @xmath is the kinematic viscosity\n@xmath . Note that @xmath is related to the Damk\u00f6hler number used in\nChapter 4 by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe non-dimensional reaction rate is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a heat release parameter given by @xmath . Although they\nare technically equal in the low Mach number approximation, here we have\nfollowed [ 1 ] and kept the parameters @xmath and @xmath distinct; we\nset @xmath throughout the chapter and vary @xmath in order to assess the\neffect of thermal expansion without changing the Arrhenius reaction term\n( 6.20 ). Thus when @xmath the equations reduce to those of the constant\ndensity approximation.\n\nFinally, with the scalings ( 6.12 ) inserted into ( 6.7 )-( 6.10 ), the\nnon-dimensional boundary conditions can be written\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.21)\n     @xmath      (6.22)\n     @xmath      (6.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSuitable initial conditions must also be prescribed. The non-dimensional\nproblem is now fully formulated and is given by equations ( 6.14 )-(\n6.20 ), subject to the boundary conditions ( 6.21 )-( 6.23 ). The\nnon-dimensional parameters in this problem are @xmath , @xmath , @xmath\n, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .\n\n#### 6.2.2 Mixture fraction formulation\n\nIn this section we simplify the problem in the special case of unity\nLewis numbers\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe set the Lewis numbers equal to unity in order to concentrate on the\neffects of thermal expansion and gravity on triple flames, without the\nadded complication of thermo-diffusive instabilities. Following the\nmethod of \u00a7 4.2.2 in Chapter 4 , we note that for @xmath the mixture\nfraction @xmath , defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsatisfies\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.26)\n     @xmath      (6.27)\n     @xmath      (6.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe can therefore solve the reaction-free equation ( 6.26 ) and use\nequation ( 6.25 ) to find the fuel and oxidiser mass fractions if\nnecessary. Thus the governing equations simplify to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.29)\n     @xmath      (6.30)\n     @xmath      (6.31)\n     @xmath      (6.32)\n     @xmath      (6.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich are subject to the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.34)\n     @xmath      (6.35)\n     @xmath      (6.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand suitable initial conditions. The non-dimensional problem is now\nformulated in terms of @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ,\n@xmath and @xmath . In the next section we solve this problem\nnumerically, with particular emphasis on the effect of @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath .\n\nAt this point it is instructive to briefly discuss the limitations of\nthe model used. First, the model utilised here is two-dimensional.\nAlthough in Chapter 4 we showed that three-dimensional effects do not\naffect the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of gravitational\ninstabilities of the planar diffusion flame, far beyond the threshold of\ninstability these effects may become important. However, currently a\ntransient simulation of the three-dimensional problem would involve\nprohibitively expensive computations. Understanding the two-dimensional\nproblem is an important step towards a full description of the effect of\ngravity on triple flames. Second, we neglect the effects of heat-loss,\ndifferential diffusion and the stoichiometric coefficient @xmath ; these\naspects of the problem would be interesting to investigate in future\nstudies but are ignored here for the sake of simplicity and clarity.\nFinally, in simulations of the non-reactive problem of a fluid layer\nheated from below, it is well known that the problem can become\ndependent on the initial conditions at high values of the Rayleigh\nnumber [ 143 ] . In all time-dependent simulations in this chapter we\ntake the initial conditions to be a steady flame tube solution (plus a\nsmall perturbation) and acknowledge that, far beyond the threshold of\ngravitational instability, different behaviour may arise if the initial\nconditions are taken to be different.\n\n### 6.3 Results and discussion\n\nIn this section we present the results obtained by numerically solving\nthe problem ( 6.29 )-( 6.36 ) in the finite element package Comsol\nMultiphysics. This has been extensively tested in combustion\napplications, including our previous publications on diffusion flames [\n2 ] and triple flames [ 1 ] . The domain is covered by a grid of\napproximately 200,000 triangular elements, with local refinement around\nthe reaction zone. Solutions have been tested to be independent of the\nmesh and the size of the domain.\n\nThe section is split into three parts. First, we provide some important\npreliminary results. Second, we investigate the transient initiation of\ntriple flames in situations where the underlying diffusion flame is\nstable, including a study on the energy required for ignition. Third, we\ninvestigate the ignition energy and transient behaviour of a triple\nflame with a trailing diffusion flame that is unstable due to\ngravitational effects.\n\nIn order to provide a criterion for the energy required for initiation\nof triple flames, we investigate steady, non-propagating solutions of\nequations ( 6.29 )-( 6.36 ), which we refer to as flame tubes . The\nenergy of these flame tube solutions can be the required criterion for\nthe ignition energy of a triple flame. We define the energy @xmath of a\nflame (per unit depth) by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is found that if a flame tube with a small \u201cenergy-increasing\u201d\nperturbation is used as an initial condition for time-dependent\nsimulations, a triple flame forms, which propagates into the unburnt\ngas. A flame tube with a small \u201cenergy-decreasing\u201d perturbation leads to\nextinction. The perturbations are added to the temperature field as a\nkernel of finite size, surrounding the flame tube, and of order of\nmagnitude @xmath . Throughout the chapter we provide illustrative\nexamples of the two outcomes for various values of the parameters.\n\n#### 6.3.1 Preliminary results\n\nIn this section we provide some preliminary results that will be useful\nin the following sections. We begin by investigating the effects of\n@xmath and @xmath on @xmath , the value of @xmath below which positively\npropagating triple flames cannot exist . This preliminary study is\nimportant because flame tubes are not expected to exist for @xmath .\nFigure 6.2 shows a) the effect of @xmath on @xmath for @xmath and b) the\neffect of @xmath on @xmath for @xmath .\n\nIt should be noted that technically flame tube solutions also do not\nexist in the asymptotic limit @xmath . This can be seen by considering\nthe problem ( 6.29 )-( 6.36 ) in the limit of infinite activation energy\nand taking @xmath . The problem reduces to finding stationary, two\ndimensional tubes in a homogeneous mixture; such a problem is known to\nhave no solution. This is because the leading order term for the\ntemperature is governed by the cylindrically symmetrical Laplace\nequation in the unburnt gas, whose only solution that satisfies the\nboundary conditions in the far field is @xmath . This, of course, is a\ncontradiction since the temperature should be given by @xmath at the\nreaction zone.\n\nNext, we mention results obtained in Chapter 4 , on the instability of a\nplanar diffusion flame in an infinitely long channel. The results are\nsummarised in figure 5.5 , which plots the critical Rayleigh number\n@xmath against @xmath in the case @xmath . For values of the Rayleigh\nnumber below @xmath , a stable planar diffusion flame exists and a\nstable triple flame is expected to propagate along the channel. If\n@xmath , the planar diffusion flame is unstable.\n\nFinally, figure 6.3 shows the propagation speed of steadily propagating\ntriple flames versus @xmath , for selected values of the parameters,\ncorresponding to the range of values that will be used for\ntime-dependent simulations in later sections. These results were\nobtained by solving ( 6.29 )-( 6.36 ) in a coordinate system attached to\nthe flame front, which travels at speed @xmath relative to the\nlaboratory, i.e. @xmath . Figure 6.3 is important because it is expected\nthat if initiation is successful, a steadily propagating triple flame\nwith propagation speed given in the figure will be the result.\n\nFigure 6.3 provides similar results to those found in Chapter 5 . The\ndifference between the results in figure 6.3 and the results in figures\n5.6 and 5.11 is in the boundary conditions imposed; in the current\nchapter we consider a pair of triple flames propagating away from each\nother towards open boundaries, with symmetric conditions imposed at\n@xmath . Chapter 5 was concerned with a triple flame propagating into an\nundisturbed fluid, with zero gradients imposed downstream.\n\n#### 6.3.2 Initiation of triple flames\n\nWe proceed with an investigation of the energy required for initiation\nof a triple flame in an infinitely long channel and the transient\nbehaviour of a triple flame after initiation. In this section we focus\non values of the parameters for which the underlying diffusion flame is\nstable , as summarised in figure 5.5 . The effects of the flame-front\nthickness @xmath , the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath and the\nRayleigh number @xmath will all be investigated in separate sections.\n\n##### Effect of @xmath\n\nIn this section we investigate the effect of the flame-front thickness\n@xmath on the initiation of a triple flame. The ignition energy @xmath\nis given by the energy of steady flame tube solutions of equations (\n6.29 )-( 6.36 ). It is instructive to begin by showing where the flame\ntube solutions lie in parameter space and in particular in relation to\nthe well-known S-shaped curve of one-dimensional diffusion flame\nsolutions.\n\nThe S-shaped curve, generated by plotting the maximum temperature of\none-dimensional, steady diffusion flame solutions of ( 6.29 )-( 6.36 )\n(with @xmath ) in terms of @xmath , is given in figure 6.4 . The curve\nconsists of an upper (stable) \u201cstrongly burning\u201d branch, a middle\n(unstable) branch and a lower (stable) \u201cweakly burning\u201d branch (not\nshown). As expected, the maximum value of @xmath for which flame tubes\ncan exist is given by @xmath , the value at which a triple flame has\nzero propagation speed. The curve of flame tube temperature versus\n@xmath terminates on the upper branch of the S-shaped curve at @xmath .\nThe figure shows that, although flame tube solutions do not exist in the\nlimit @xmath (as discussed in \u00a7 6.3.1 ), solutions have been calculated\nnumerically for very small values of @xmath .\n\nWe plot the flame tube energy @xmath and the maximum flame tube\ntemperature @xmath versus @xmath for selected values of @xmath and\n@xmath in figure 6.5 . It can be seen that @xmath monotonically\nincreases with increasing @xmath in all cases. When thermal expansion is\npresent but gravity is not taken into account, the ignition energy for\neach value of @xmath is lower than in the constant density case @xmath ,\n@xmath . It can be seen that the ignition energy increases sharply as\n@xmath approaches @xmath , which is the value of @xmath at which the\ntriple flame speed is zero (see figure 6.2 ) and above which no flame\ntube solutions are found. The effects of thermal expansion and gravity\nwill be described in more detail in the following sections.\n\nNow we investigate the transient behaviour of the unstable flame tube\nsolutions for @xmath , @xmath when they are subject to small\nperturbations. Plotted in figures 6.6 and 6.7 , in which @xmath and\n@xmath respectively, are the maximum temperature @xmath and flame energy\n@xmath for flame tubes subject to either an energy-increasing or an\nenergy-decreasing perturbation. These figures show that, if an\nenergy-increasing perturbation is added, the flame tube solution will\nevolve in time into a steadily propagating triple flame, with speed\ngiven in figure 6.3 . If an energy-decreasing perturbation is added, the\nflame extinguishes and the maximum temperature and flame energy both\ndecay to zero.\n\nIllustrative examples of this behaviour for two selected values of\n@xmath are shown in figure 6.8 . The upper rows in figures 6.8 and 6.8\nshow, for @xmath and @xmath respectively, reaction rate contours for a\nflame tube subject to an energy-increasing perturbation, which leads to\na triple flame. The lower rows in figures 6.8 and 6.8 show a flame tube\ndecaying to extinction due to an energy-decreasing perturbation.\n\n##### Effect of @xmath\n\nIn this section we investigate the effect of thermal expansion on the\nignition of a triple flame in the absence of gravity. Figure 6.9 shows\nthe ignition energy @xmath and the maximum flame tube temperature @xmath\nversus the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath for selected values of\n@xmath . It can be seen that, for a fixed value of @xmath , increasing\n@xmath leads to a monotonic decrease in the ignition energy @xmath . A\nkey result of these calculations is that for all values of @xmath , the\nflame tube solutions have @xmath . This is physically plausible since\n@xmath solves the stationary form of the governing equations ( 6.29 )-(\n6.33 ) if @xmath , as well as the boundary conditions ( 6.34 )-( 6.36 ).\nThis is a significant simplification of the governing equations and\nrepresents an efficient way to numerically calculate flame tube\nsolutions, if gravity is not accounted for.\n\nNow we investigate the transient behaviour of the unstable flame tube\nsolutions when thermal expansion is accounted for, by setting @xmath .\nFigure 6.10 , with @xmath , plots a) maximum temperature @xmath and b)\nflame energy @xmath against time after an energy-increasing and an\nenergy-decreasing perturbation. As can be seen from the figure, after an\nenergy-increasing perturbation the maximum temperature increases\nmonotonically from that of the flame tube to that of the steadily\npropagating triple flame, which has propagation speed given in figure\n6.3 . An energy-decreasing pertubation again leads to extinction.\n\nAn illustrative example of this behaviour for @xmath is shown in figure\n6.11 . The upper row shows the reaction rate for a flame tube subject to\nan energy-increasing perturbation, which leads to a triple flame. The\nlower row in figure 6.11 shows a flame tube decaying to extinction due\nto an energy-decreasing perturbation.\n\n##### Effect of @xmath\n\nIn this section we investigate the combined effect of thermal expansion\nand gravity on the initiation of a triple flame. Figure 6.12 shows the\nignition energy @xmath and the maximum flame tube temperature @xmath\nversus the Rayleigh number @xmath for selected values of @xmath . It can\nbe seen that the relationship between @xmath and @xmath is dependent\nupon the value of @xmath , however for all values of @xmath an increase\nin @xmath leads to an increase in the ignition energy @xmath . For large\nvalues of @xmath , an increase in @xmath leads to a larger increase in\n@xmath than for smaller values of @xmath .\n\nUnlike in the previous sections, when gravity is present the flame tube\nsolutions do induce a flow due to the temperature gradient from the\nflame tube at @xmath to the cold gas at @xmath , as was found in the\ncontext of triple flames in Chapter 5 . An important result that can be\nseen in figure 6.12 is that flame tube solutions still exist for values\nof @xmath where the planar diffusion flame is unstable - this will be\ndiscussed further in the following section.\n\nNow we investigate the transient behaviour of the unstable flame tube\nsolutions when thermal expansion and gravity are accounted for, by\nsetting @xmath and @xmath . Figure 6.13 plots a) maximum temperature\n@xmath and b) flame energy @xmath against time after an\nenergy-increasing and an energy-decreasing perturbation, for @xmath . As\ncan be seen from the figure, after an energy-increasing perturbation the\nmaximum temperature increases monotonically from that of the flame tube\nto that of the steadily propagating triple flame, which has propagation\nspeed given in figure 6.3 . An energy-decreasing pertubation again leads\nto extinction. An illustrative example of this behaviour for @xmath is\nshown in figure 6.14 .\n\n#### 6.3.3 Gravitational instability of triple flames\n\nIn this section we investigate the initiation of triple flames in\nsituations where the underlying diffusion flame is unstable. As was\ndemonstrated in figure 6.12 of the previous section, unstable flame tube\nsolutions still exist for values of the Rayleigh number where the\nunderlying planar diffusion flame is unstable. Therefore, we can still\nprovide a criterion for the ignition energy of a triple flame in this\ncase. Plots of the ignition energy @xmath and maximum flame tube\ntemperature @xmath versus @xmath for @xmath are provided in figure 6.15\n. For this value of the Rayleigh number, the underlying diffusion flame\nis unstable for all values of @xmath , as can be seen in figure 5.5 .\n\nWe can therefore use flame tubes (with energy shown in figure 6.15 ) as\nan initial condition for time-dependent calculations to investigate the\nevolution of triple flames with a trailing diffusion flame which is\nunstable due to gravitational effects. The transient behaviour of the\ntriple flames that arise after an energy-increasing perturbation to the\nflame tube solutions for @xmath is shown in figure 6.16 , which plots\nreaction rate contours at several points in time. It can be seen that\ninitially, a triple flame propagates, similarly to the flames that were\nshown in the previous section. After a certain amount of time, however,\nthe trailing diffusion flame becomes unstable due to gravity, causing\nconvection in the fluid, which leads to a cellular trailing diffusion\nflame. The induced convection can be strong enough to cause local\nextinction, which occurs first at the axis of symmetry located at @xmath\n, as can be seen from figure 6.16 .\n\nThe induced convection can be seen in figure 6.17 , which plots the\nvertical component of the velocity @xmath along the centreline of the\nchannel located at @xmath , at several values of the time @xmath . The\nfigure shows the vortex induced by the temperature gradient from the hot\ntriple flame to the cold unburnt gas, as discussed in detail in \u00a7 5.4.2\nof Chapter 5 . This vortex propagates along the channel with the tip of\nthe triple flame. The triple flame initially leaves behind a trailing\ndiffusion flame. As can be seen from figure 6.17 , at approximately\n@xmath the diffusion flame starts to induce convection. The magnitude of\nthe induced convection increases, with the largest magnitude of @xmath\noccurring at the axis of symmetry @xmath , which causes the local\nextinction that was seen in figure 6.16 .\n\n### 6.4 Conclusion\n\nIn this chapter we have investigated the combined effect of thermal\nexpansion and gravity on the ignition energy of triple flames by\nstudying stationary, non-propagating solutions of the governing\nequations, which have been referred to as \u201cflame tubes\u201d. We have also\ndescribed the transient initiation of two-dimensional triple flames in\nthe mixing layer, using the (unstable) flame tube solutions as initial\nconditions. Finally, we have investigated the time-dependent behaviour,\nfrom initiation to instability, of triple flames in situations where the\nunderlying diffusion flame is unstable due to gravitational effects.\n\nThe chapter provides several new contributions. It is the first work to\nprovide a detailed parametric study of \u201cflame tube\u201d solutions in\ntwo-dimensional mixing layers, providing an equivalent criterion for the\nignition energy of triple flames to the one provided by Zeldovich flame\nballs for premixed flames and corresponding flame balls in axisymmetric\nmixing layers. It has been found that the flame tube solutions exist\nonly for @xmath , where @xmath is the value of the flame-front thickness\n@xmath for which a triple flame has zero propagation speed. Flame tubes\nare not expected to exist in the asymptotic limit @xmath , but have been\nfound to exist numerically for small values of @xmath . The flame tubes\nare unstable and it has been found that an \u201cenergy-increasing\u201d\nperturbation leads to the propagation of a triple flame and an\n\u201cenergy-decreasing\u201d perturbation leads to extinction.\n\nThis study is also the first to describe the initiation of triple flames\nin a horizontal channel with the combined effect of thermal expansion\nand gravity taken into account. In cases where gravity is not present,\nit is found that the flow velocity @xmath , so that the Navier\u2013Stokes\nequations do not need to be solved. However, when gravity is present, a\nflow is induced by the temperature gradient from the flame tube to the\ncold gas. The relationship between @xmath and the energy @xmath of the\nflame tubes is found to depend on @xmath . A key result from these\ncalculations is that flame tube solutions are still found to exist for\nvalues of the Rayleigh number above its critical value for the\ngravitational instability of the planar diffusion flame. Therefore a\ncriterion for the ignition energy of a triple flame can still be given\neven though its trailing diffusion flame is expected to be unstable.\n\nThe final contribution of the chapter is the investigation of the\ntransient behaviour of a triple flame from its initiation (using a flame\ntube as initial condition) to the eventual instability of its trailing\ndiffusion flame for large enough values of @xmath . It has been found\nthat initially a triple flame forms and propagates into the unburnt gas.\nAfter a certain amount of time, the trailing diffusion flame becomes\nunstable and forms convection rolls, as predicted in Chapter 4 . These\ncan lead to local extinction of the trailing diffusion flame, which\noccurs first at the axis of symmetry located at @xmath .\n\n## Chapter 7 Conclusion\n\nThe main aim of this thesis has been to assess the combined effect of\nthermal expansion and gravity on the propagation and stability of flames\nin inhomogeneous mixtures. Flame propagation has been investigated in\nsituations where the inhomogeneity is prescribed in the unburned gas,\neither a) as a non-uniform flow field against which a premixed flame\npropagates or b) as a stratification of the fuel and oxidiser, leading\nto the propagation of a triple flame.\n\nIn Chapter 2 , we have investigated the propagation of a premixed flame\nthrough a narrow channel against a Poiseuille flow of large amplitude,\ntaking the effect of the flame on the flow into account through the\naction of thermal expansion. The problem has been studied analytically\nto determine the effective propagation speed @xmath for a Peclet number\n@xmath , in the thick flame asymptotic lmit @xmath with both finite and\nasymptotically infinite values of the activation energy @xmath . The\nlimit @xmath , with @xmath is equivalent to taking the amplitude @xmath\nof the Poiseuille flow @xmath , with @xmath . It has been found that, in\nthe distinguished limit considered, a two-dimensional premixed flame\npropagating through a rectangular channel against a Poiseuille flow can\nbe described by a problem which corresponds to the propagation of a\none-dimensional premixed flame with an effective diffusion coefficient,\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nin the constant density case and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nin the variable density case. These effective values correspond to those\nfound in studies of enhanced dispersion due to a Poiseuille flow in\nnon-reactive fluids, known as Taylor dispersion. A premixed flame\npropagating through a channel in the limit @xmath , with @xmath can\ntherefore be considered to be in the Taylor regime. The derived\none-dimensional problem has been solved numerically for a full range of\nvalues of the Peclet number and activation energy. An analytical\nsolution to the one-dimensional problem has also been obtained in the\nlimit @xmath in both the constant density and variable density cases.\nFurther results have been obtained by solving the full system of\ngoverning equations for a wide range of values of the parameters. The\nasymptotic results have been found to show strong agreement with the\nnumerical results.\n\nThe analytical result obtained in Chapter 2 , given by ( 2.53 ),\npredicts that in the thick flame limit considered, the effective\npropagation speed has a value that depends only on the Peclet number.\nThis result may be used to provide a possible explanation of the\nso-called bending effect of the turbulent premixed flame speed when\nplotted in terms of the turbulence intensity for fixed values of the\nReynolds number (see e.g. [ 57 , 24 ] ). Our distinguished limit, namely\n@xmath with @xmath fixed (note that the Reynolds number and Peclet\nnumber are equal if @xmath ), mimics the experimental conditions of\nBradley [ 57 ] and can be used to shed some light on the experimental\nfindings. A more thorough discussion of the relevance of the asymptotic\nresults obtained in the thick flame limit to the bending effect is\nprovided in Chapter 3 . In this chapter, further asymptotic results have\nbeen provided, in order to provide a full asymptotic picture of the\nrelationship between the effective propagation speed and the parallel\nflow amplitude @xmath . A numerical study for a full range of values of\n@xmath and @xmath has also been undertaken. The numerical results show\nthat as the prescribed inflow amplitude @xmath increases to large\nvalues, the effective propagation speed @xmath approaches a constant\nvalue, which depends on the Peclet number. This result is in line with\nboth the asymptotic results ( 2.53 ) and ( 3.22 ) and with the available\nexperimental results on turbulent combustion. The asymptotic and\nnumerical results both show that for small values of @xmath , the\nrelationship between @xmath and @xmath is linear. Finally, we have\ninvestigated the effect of thermal expansion on the problem; it has been\nfound that for variable density premixed flames the effective\npropagation speed still approaches a constant value which depends on the\nPeclet number for large values of @xmath , which again mimics the\nbehaviour of the turbulent premixed flame experimental findings.\n\nIn Chapter 4 , we have investigated the combined effect of gravity and\nthermal expansion on the stability of a planar diffusion flame in an\ninfinitely long channel with rigid walls. The conditions under which the\ndiffusion flame becomes unstable have been determined by calculation of\nthe critical Rayleigh number, which defines the threshold of\ninstability. First, we have investigated the stability of the\nBurke\u2013Schumann flame, using a linear stability analysis in the\nBoussinesq approximation. The growth rate of the linear stability\nproblem has been confirmed to be real using numerical methods, so that\nit is possible to study the system analytically in the marginal state\nusing a similar method to that of the non-reactive problem. Results have\nbeen presented, which show that as the flame approaches the lower\nboundary of the channel with increasing stoichiometric coefficient, the\ncritical Rayleigh number is close to the well-known value it takes in\nthe non-reactive case with two rigid boundaries. Second, we have\nperformed numerical calculations of the full system of governing\nequations for several values of the thermal expansion coefficient, for\nlarge values of the Damk\u00f6hler number. The results show that when the\nRayleigh number is higher than its critical value, the fluid forms\nconvection rolls as in the non-reactive case, which interact with the\nflame to generate cellular structures. The numerical results show strong\nagreement with those of the linear stability analysis. Finally, we have\ninvestigated the effect of finite chemistry on the system. The results\nshow that the system becomes less stable as the Damk\u00f6hler number @xmath\nis decreased.\n\nNext, in Chapter 5 , the combined effect of thermal expansion and\ngravity on a triple flame propagating steadily in a horizontal channel\nhas been investigated. The results obtained in Chapter 4 have been used\nto identify areas of parameter space where a triple flame is expected to\npropagate steadily. The effect of the flame-front thickness @xmath on\nthe propagation speed @xmath of a triple flame has been described for\nseveral values of the thermal expansion coefficient @xmath and the\nRayleigh number @xmath . It has been found that the well-known monotonic\nrelationship between @xmath and @xmath that is present in the constant\ndensity case (which arises in the limit @xmath ) remains valid for\n@xmath , when @xmath (i.e. in the absence of gravity). However, we have\nshown that under the influence of gravity the monotonic relationship\nbetween @xmath and @xmath is only present for values of @xmath below a\ncritical value, which has been determined. Further, it has been shown\nthat, if @xmath takes a value higher than this critical value, there is\na local maximum in the graph of @xmath versus @xmath . The system has\nbeen shown to exhibit hysteresis for even higher values of the Rayleigh\nnumber. The results in this chapter provide valuable insight into the\nbehaviour of a triple flame under gravitational effects and illustrate\nthe complexity and variety of the scenarios that arise.\n\nFinally, in Chapter 6 , we have studied the combined effects of thermal\nexpansion and gravity on the transient evolution of triple flames from\ntheir initiation via a hot ignition kernel, as well as the energy\nrequired for ignition of triple flames. We have identified\ntwo-dimensional, non-propagating solutions of the governing equations,\nwhich have been referred to as \u201cflame tubes\u201d and which can provide a\ncriterion for the minimum energy for forced ignition of two-dimensional\ntriple flames in the mixing layer. We have provided a detailed\nparametric study of flame tubes, including the combined effect of\nthermal expansion and gravity. We have shown that \u201cenergy-increasing\u201d\nperturbations to flame tubes (which are unstable) lead to the\npropagation of a triple flame and \u201cenergy-decreasing\u201d perturbations lead\nto extinction. It has been found that flame tubes still exist for values\nof the Rayleigh number above the critical value for gravitational\ninstability of the planar diffusion flame, so that a criterion for the\nignition energy is still available for triple flames in this case.\nFinally, the transient behaviour of a triple flame with a trailing\ndiffusion flame that is unstable due to gravitational effects has been\ninvestigated. It has been found that, after initiation, a triple flame\nforms initially before the trailing diffusion flame becomes unstable and\nforms a cellular flame due to convection rolls in the surrounding fluid.\nThe induced convection can be strong enough to cause local extinction.\n\nThere are many opportunities for future work in the area of flame\npropagation in inhomogeneous mixtures. In the area of premixed flames,\nstudied in Chapters 2 and 3 , the effect of more complicated flows on\npremixed flame propagation would help to further understand the\ninteraction between laminar premixed flames and flow. This would provide\na platform for a thorough understanding of the behaviour of turbulent\npremixed flames, which is currently lacking, as can be seen by the lack\nof a convincing explanation for the bending effect of turbulent flames,\ndiscussed in Chapter 3 . Further work in this area could also\ninvestigate the Taylor dispersion regime of premixed flames discussed in\nChapter 2 for more complex flows.\n\nIn the area of diffusion flames, discussed in Chapter 4 , work could be\ndone to further understand the behaviour of diffusion flames that are\nunstable due to gravitational effects, including a detailed parametric\nstudy of their behaviour beyond the threshold of gravitational\ninstability. It would also be interesting to further investigate the\nbehaviour of the triple flames studied in Chapters 5 and 6 in situations\nwhere the planar diffusion flame is unstable due to gravitational\neffects. A future study could also repeat the work of Chapters 4 - 6 in\nthe case of triple flames in a counterflow configuration. Such a study\ncould build on the theoretical and numerical investigations in this\nthesis, which were the first to describe in detail the combined effect\nof thermal expansion and gravity on the propagation and stability of\ntriple flames propagating in a direction perpendicular to the direction\nof gravity.\n\n## References\n\n-    Pearce and Daou [2013a] P.\u00a0Pearce and J.\u00a0Daou.

We\nconsider the constant density form of the infinite activation energy\ngoverning equations ( 3.4 )-( 3.13 ). For an imposed Poiseuille flow of\namplitude @xmath , this is achieved by considering equation ( 3.7 ) with\n@xmath , @xmath and @xmath , which gives\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nUsing ( 3.9 )-( 3.13 ), equation ( B.1 ) is subject to boundary\nconditions and jump conditions given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.2)\n     @xmath      (B.3)\n     @xmath      (B.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe asymptotic limit considered in this section is @xmath , with @xmath\n. This limit is equivalent to @xmath , with @xmath . The aim is to find\nan asymptotic formula for the effective propagation speed @xmath , which\nis defined in ( 2.13 ). The method is similar to the one used in [ 70 ]\n.\n\nWe begin by introducing the stretched variable\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nso that ( B.1 )-( B.4 ) become, using the definition ( 2.13 ) for @xmath\n,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.6)\n     @xmath      (B.7)\n     @xmath      (B.8)\n     @xmath      (B.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nLetting @xmath and expanding variables in succesive powers of @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwe find that to leading order in equation ( B.6 ), the solution is the\nplanar flame solution\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen, at @xmath in ( B.6 ), we have, using ( B.11 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, in this case ( B.8 )-( B.9 ) lead to\n\n  -- -------- -- --\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      \n  -- -------- -- --\n\nso equation ( B.12 ) can be integrated from @xmath to @xmath to give\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHence, applying condition ( B.7 ) at @xmath we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand so\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, equation ( B.15 ) leads to @xmath , so we must consider the\nboundary layer near @xmath in order to find the next order solution to\nthe effective propagation speed @xmath . In the boundary layer the\nnecessary scalings are found to be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand we expand the effective propagation speed, using ( B.11 ) and ( B.14\n), as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen, to @xmath in equation ( B.6 ) we find, after integrating from\n@xmath to @xmath and applying the boundary\/jump conditions ( B.8 )-( B.9\n),\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is subject to the boundary conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquation ( B.18 ) is a Ricatti equation; the problem ( B.18 )-( B.19 )\nhas been solved in [ 70 ] to give\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath (note that here the flow amplitude is denoted @xmath ,\nwhereas @xmath is used in [ 70 ] ).

This is the result discussed in \u00a7 3.3 .\n","output":["We investigate the effect of thermal expansion and gravity on the propagation\nand stability of flames in inhomogeneous mixtures.

We show that in a narrow channel (corresponding to\na relatively thick flame), if the Peclet number is fixed and of order\nunity, a premixed flame propagating against a parallel flow is governed\nby the equation for a planar premixed flame with an effective diffusion\ncoefficient. The enhanced diffusion is shown to correspond to Taylor\ndispersion, or shear-enhanced diffusion. Several important applications\nof the results are discussed. One of the topics of relevance is the\nbending effect of turbulent combustion. The results of our analysis show\nthat, for a large flow intensity, the effective propagation speed of the\npremixed flame for depends only on the Peclet number (which is equal to\nthe Reynolds number if the Prandtl number is unity).

Finally, the\ninitiation of triple flames from a hot two-dimensional ignition kernel\nis investigated. Particular attention is devoted to the energy required\nfor ignition and the transient evolution of triple flames after\ninitiation. Steady, non-propagating, two-dimensional solutions\nrepresenting \u201cflame tubes\u201d are determined; their thermal energy is used\nto define a minimum ignition energy for the two-dimensional triple flame\nin the mixing layer. The transient behaviour of triple flames following\n\u201cenergy-increasing\u201d or \u201cenergy-decreasing\u201d perturbations to the flame\ntube solutions is described in situations where the underlying diffusion\nflame is either stable or unstable.\n"]}
{"input":"### 1 Introduction\n\nMany theorems about finite graphs involving paths, cycles or spanning\ntrees do not generalise to infinite graphs verbatim. However, if we\nconsider only infinite graphs which are locally finite, \u00b9 \u00b9 1 A graph is\nlocally finite if each of its vertices has only finitely many\nneighbours. then an elegant solution is known for generalising most of\nthese theorems. To understand this solution, it is important to know\nthat for connected locally finite graphs @xmath adding their ends \u00b2 \u00b2 2\nAn end of a graph is an equivalence class of rays, where a ray simply is\na 1-way infinite path and two rays are equivalent whenever no finite set\nof vertices separates them in the graph. yields a natural\ncompactification @xmath , their Freudenthal compactification [ 12 , 13 ]\n.\n\nFormally, to obtain @xmath we extend the 1-complex of @xmath (also\ndenoted @xmath ) to a topological space @xmath (where @xmath is the set\nof ends of @xmath ) by declaring as open, for every finite set @xmath of\nvertices and each component @xmath of @xmath the set @xmath , and taking\nthe topology on @xmath this generates. Here, @xmath is the union of the\n1-complex of @xmath , the set of all inner edge points of edges between\n@xmath and the component @xmath , and the set of all ends of @xmath all\nwhose rays have tails in @xmath . \u00b3 \u00b3 3 For the experts: Here, we\nintroduced @xmath using a basis that slightly differs from the usual\none, but which generates the same topology. With our basis it will be\neasier to see the similarities to the basis of the tangle\ncompactification.\n\nNow, we explain the elegant solution: replacing, in the wording of the\ntheorems, paths with homeomorphic images of the unit interval ( arcs for\nshort) in the Freudenthal compactification @xmath , cycles with\nhomeomorphic images of the unit circle ( circles for short) in @xmath ,\nand spanning trees with uniquely arc-connected subspaces of @xmath\nincluding the vertex set of the graph ( topological spanning trees for\nshort, see [ 13 ] for a precise definition), does suffice to extend\nthese theorems. The arcs, circles and topological spanning trees\nconsidered are allowed to contain ends of @xmath (and in a moment we\nwill see that sometimes they have to).\n\nFor a nice illustration of how this solution works, consider the\nso-called \u2018tree-packing\u2019 [ 13 , Theorem 2.4.1] , proved independently by\nNash-Williams and Tutte in 1961: A finite multigraph contains @xmath\nedge-disjoint spanning trees if and only if for every partition @xmath\nof its vertex set it has at least @xmath cross-edges. Aharoni and\nThomassen [ 1 ] constructed, for every @xmath , a locally finite graph\n@xmath witnessing that the naive extension of tree-packing to locally\nfinite graphs fails in that the graph @xmath has enough edges across\nevery finite partition of its vertex set but no @xmath edge-disjoint\nspanning trees (see [ 13 ] for details). However, as Diestel [ 10 ] has\nshown in 2005, as soon as we replace \u2018spanning trees\u2019 with \u2018topological\nspanning trees\u2019 we do obtain a correct extension (also see [ 13 ,\nTheorem 8.5.7] ): A locally finite multigraph contains @xmath\nedge-disjoint topological spanning trees if and only if for every finite\npartition @xmath of its vertex set it has at least @xmath cross-edges.\nIn particular, at least one of any @xmath edge-disjoint topological\nspanning trees of @xmath must use an end.\n\nAnother example is a theorem by Fleischner [ 13 , Theorem 10.3.1] from\n1974: If @xmath is a finite 2-connected graph, then @xmath has a\nHamilton cycle. \u2074 \u2074 4 For every graph @xmath and each natural number\n@xmath we write @xmath for the graph on @xmath in which two vertices are\nadjacent if and only if they have distance at most @xmath in @xmath .\nThis theorem was extended by Georgakopoulos [ 17 ] in 2009: If @xmath is\na locally finite 2-connected graph, then @xmath has a Hamilton circle.\n\nMore generally, Diestel and K\u00fchn [ 6 , 7 ] (2004) and Berger and Bruhn [\n2 ] (2009) were able to generalise the full cycle space theory of finite\ngraphs to locally finite ones. We refer the reader to [ 13 , Theorem\n8.5.10] for details since these go beyond the scope of this\nintroduction.\n\nBut graphs that are not locally finite\u2014in general\u2014cannot be compactified\nby adding their ends, so the elegant solution no longer applies. For\nexample, in the introduction of Chapter 6 we will see that a @xmath (a\ncomplete bipartite graph with one countable bipartition class and the\nother of size 2) has enough edges across every finite partition of its\nvertex set for @xmath . But this graph has no ends, so the naive\nextension of topological spanning trees defaults to spanning trees, any\ntwo of which must share an edge (otherwise, none would be connected).\nThus, it is considered one of the most important problems in infinite\ngraph theory to come up with an extension that allows us to extend the\ncycle space theory to non-locally finite graphs. Recently, in 2015,\nDiestel [ 14 ] proposed a possible solution to this problem and\nconstructed a new compactification which uses tangles instead of ends,\nthe tangle compactification . Before we present the special\ncharacteristics of this compactification, we give a brief introduction\nto tangles.\n\nA separation of finite order of a graph @xmath is a set @xmath with\n@xmath finite and @xmath such that @xmath has no edge between @xmath and\n@xmath . If @xmath is an end of a graph @xmath , then it orients each\nseparation @xmath of finite order towards a big side @xmath in that\nevery ray contained in @xmath has some tail in @xmath (clearly, it\ncannot both have a tail in @xmath and a tail in @xmath since @xmath is a\nfinite separator). Observe that every end of a graph @xmath orients all\nthe finite order separations consistently in that e.g. for every two\nfinite order separations @xmath and @xmath with @xmath and @xmath the\nend does not choose @xmath and @xmath as big sides. From a more abstract\npoint of view (but for a different purpose), Robertson and Seymour [ 25\n] defined an @xmath - tangle (or tangle ) in a graph as an orientation\nof all its finite order separations towards a big side that is\nconsistent in some sense including the above. Every end induces an\n@xmath -tangle, so each graph\u2019s end space can be considered as a natural\nsubset of its tangle space, and in fact, if a graph is locally finite\nand connected, then its @xmath -tangles turn out to be precisely its\nends (and its tangle compactification coincides with its Freudenthal\ncompactification). However, for graphs that are not locally finite,\nthere may be @xmath -tangles that are not induced by an end, and adding\nthese on top of the ends suffices to compactify those graphs\u2014whereas\nadding only the ends does not.\n\nUnderstanding the tangles that are not induced by an end is important,\nbut for this, we need some notation first: If @xmath is a graph, then we\nwrite @xmath for its tangle compactification, and we denote by @xmath\nthe collection of all finite sets of vertices of this graph, partially\nordered by inclusion. Furthermore, for every @xmath we write @xmath for\nthe collection of all components of @xmath . Finally, for every\nsubcollection @xmath we denote the vertex set of @xmath by @xmath . Now\nwe may start: Every finite order separation @xmath corresponds to the\nbipartition @xmath of @xmath with @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand this correspondence is bijective for fixed @xmath . Hence if @xmath\nis an @xmath -tangle of the graph, then for each @xmath it also chooses\none big side from each bipartition @xmath of @xmath , namely the @xmath\nwith @xmath where @xmath is the big side of the corresponding finite\norder separation @xmath . Since it chooses these sides consistently, for\neach @xmath they form an ultrafilter on @xmath . Furthermore, these\nultrafilters are compatible in that they are limits of a natural inverse\nsystem @xmath . Here, each @xmath is the Stone-\u010cech Hausdorff\ncompactification of @xmath (where @xmath is endowed with the discrete\ntopology), i.e each @xmath is the set of all ultrafilters on @xmath ,\nequipped with a natural topology. The bonding maps @xmath are the unique\ncontinuous maps extending the maps @xmath which send, for all @xmath ,\nevery component of @xmath to the unique component of @xmath including\nit. Strikingly, it turns out that the @xmath -tangles are precisely the\nlimits of this inverse system, and the ends of a graph are precisely\nthose of its @xmath -tangles which induce for each @xmath a principal\nultrafilter on @xmath . In particular, if a graph @xmath is locally\nfinite and connected, then all @xmath are finite, and hence all\nultrafilters on them are principal. So by the above correspondence, we\nsee that every @xmath -tangle of @xmath is induced by an end, and so the\ntangle compactification coincides with the Freudenthal compactification\nfor connected locally finite graphs.\n\nThis inverse limit description of the @xmath -tangles is the key to a\nbetter understanding of the tangles that are not induced by ends: every\n@xmath -tangle which is not induced by an end does induce a\nnon-principal ultrafilter on some @xmath , and, as shown by Diestel,\neach of these non-principal ultrafilters alone determines that tangle.\nTherefore, we call these tangles ultrafilter tangles . It turns out\nthat, for every ultrafilter tangle @xmath there exists a unique element\n@xmath of @xmath whose up-closure in @xmath consists precisely of those\n@xmath for which the tangle @xmath induces a non-principal ultrafilter\non @xmath .\n\nWe conclude our general introduction with a brief description of the\ntangle compactification. More details will be given in Section 2.3 . To\nobtain the tangle compactification @xmath of a graph @xmath we extend\nthe 1-complex of @xmath to a topological space @xmath (where @xmath\ncorresponds to the tangle space) by declaring as open, for every @xmath\nand each subcollection @xmath , the set @xmath , and taking the topology\non @xmath this generates. Here, @xmath is the union of the 1-complex of\n@xmath , the set of all inner edge points of edges between @xmath and\n@xmath , and the set of all limits @xmath with @xmath . Note that @xmath\nmeans that the @xmath -tangle corresponding to the limit @xmath orients\nthe finite order separation\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ntowards @xmath , so @xmath consists precisely of those @xmath -tangles\nwhich orient this finite order separation towards @xmath . Clearly, all\nsingleton subsets of the tangle compactification are closed in it. Now\nwe know enough to understand the topics and results of this work. In the\nremainder of this introduction let me indicate briefly what awaits the\nreader later.\n\n##### Chapter\u00a02.\n\nIn this chapter we introduce basic notation, inverse limits and some\nlemmas from general topology. Furthermore, we provide a summary of\nDiestel\u2019s original paper on the tangle compactification [ 14 ] , and we\ngive an overview for the various topologies used for infinite graphs in\nthis work.\n\n##### Chapter\u00a03.\n\nIn this chapter we prove some basic results about the tangle\ncompactification needed later, such as a version of the Jumping Arc\nLemma from [ 13 ] . Also, we find a combinatorial description of the\nsets @xmath (for ultrafilter tangles @xmath ):\n\n###### Lemma 3.3.4.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph. The following are equivalent for all @xmath :\n\n1.   There exists an ultrafilter tangle @xmath with @xmath .\n\n2.   Infinitely many components of @xmath have neighbourhood equal to\n    @xmath .\n\nWe call the sets @xmath satisfying (i) and (ii) of this lemma the\ncritical elements of @xmath . The following theorem involves these sets:\n\n###### Theorem 3.3.5.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph. The following are equivalent for all distinct\nvertices @xmath and @xmath of the graph @xmath :\n\n1.   There exist infinitely many independent @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths in\n    @xmath .\n\n2.   There exists an end of @xmath dominated \u2075 \u2075 5 A vertex @xmath of a\n    graph @xmath dominates an end @xmath of @xmath if no finite subset\n    of @xmath separates @xmath from a ray in @xmath . by both vertices\n    @xmath and @xmath or\n    there exists some critical element of @xmath containing both\n    vertices @xmath and @xmath .\n\nFor the next result we first need some additional definitions. An edge\nend of a graph is an equivalence class of rays, where two rays are\nequivalent whenever no finite set of edges separates them in the graph.\nTwo vertices of a graph @xmath are said to be finitely separable if\nthere exists some finite set @xmath of edges such that the two vertices\nare contained in distinct components of @xmath . Briefly speaking, for\nconnected graphs @xmath , the compact Hausdorff topological space @xmath\nis obtained from @xmath and its edge ends by equipping this set with a\nvery coarse topology \u2076 \u2076 6 whose basic open sets can be thought of as\ncomponents of @xmath plus certain edge ends and half-open partial edges\nof @xmath for each finite set @xmath of edges first, and then\nidentifying every two points which share the same open neighbourhoods (a\nprecise definition is provided in Section 2.5 ).\n\nBy generalising the notion of \u2018not finitely separable\u2019 to an equivalence\nrelation @xmath on @xmath (where @xmath ) we derive this space from the\ntangle compactification as a natural quotient:\n\n###### Theorem 3.4.14.\n\nIf @xmath is a connected graph, then @xmath is homeomorphic to the\nquotient @xmath of the tangle compactification @xmath .\n\n##### Chapter\u00a04.\n\nSince inverse limits have claimed their place in the infinite\ntopological graph theory as useful tools to construct limit objects such\nas circles, arcs and topological spanning trees from finite minors (see\nthe 5th edition of [ 13 ] for an inverse limit description of the\nFreudenthal compactification), it makes sense to investigate whether it\nis possible to describe the tangle compactification via a similar\ninverse limit. As our main result in this chapter, we show that this is\nindeed possible. For this, we construct an inverse system @xmath of\ntopological spaces @xmath that are based on multigraphs with finite\nvertex set but possibly infinite edge set. These multigraphs are\nobtained from the graph @xmath by contraction of possibly disconnected\nvertex sets, but we will see that this is best possible. The topological\nspaces @xmath are compact and all of their singleton subsets are closed\nin them. As promised, we show that the inverse limit\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nof our inverse system describes the tangle compactification:\n\n###### Theorem 4.3.1.\n\nFor every graph @xmath its tangle compactification is homeomorphic to\nthe inverse limit @xmath .\n\n##### Chapter\u00a05.\n\nWhenever we consider a compactification of a topological space, three\nparticular questions come to mind: Is it the coarsest compactification?\nIf not, how does a coarsest one look like, and why can we not just take\nthe one-point compactification and be done? In this chapter, we only\nconsider compactifications of the 1-complex of @xmath extending the end\nspace in a meaningful way, and we call these @xmath - compactifications\n(since the end space is denoted @xmath ). First, we characterise the\ngraphs admitting a one-point @xmath -compactification @xmath , one with\n@xmath (see Proposition 5.2.2 ), and we give an example of such a graph\nshowing that\u2014in general\u2014the one-point @xmath -compactification does not\nreflect the structure of the graph at all. However, there exist simple\nexamples admitting a one-point @xmath -compactification reflecting their\nstructure while their tangle compactification adds at least @xmath many\npoints on top of the ends. Hence Diestel [ 14 ] asked:\n\n1.  For which graphs is their tangle compactification also their\n    coarsest\n    @xmath -compactification?\n\n2.  If it is not, is there a unique such @xmath -compactification, and\n    is there a canonical way to obtain it from the tangle\n    compactification?\n\nTo answer these questions, we first construct an inverse system @xmath\nof Hausdorff compactifications @xmath of the @xmath (where each @xmath\nis equipped with the discrete topology) whose inverse limit @xmath we\nuse to obtain an @xmath -compactification @xmath of the graph @xmath in\nthe way Diestel used @xmath to compactify it. Here, for each @xmath the\nHausdorff compactification @xmath of @xmath adds as many points to\n@xmath as @xmath includes critical elements of @xmath . We will see that\n@xmath includes the end space as a natural subspace since the bonding\nmaps @xmath respect the natural maps @xmath (recall that @xmath sends\nevery component of @xmath to the unique component of @xmath including\nit), and:\n\n###### Proposition 5.3.8.\n\nThere exists a natural bijection between @xmath and the collection of\nall critical elements of @xmath .\n\nSince one-point @xmath -compactifications in general do not reflect the\nstructure of the original graph in a meaningful way, we wish to impose\nfurther conditions on the @xmath -compactifications considered in (ii).\nFor this, we introduce @xmath -systems: these are inverse systems of\nHausdorff compactifications of the @xmath whose inverse limits\ngeneralise the directions \u2077 \u2077 7 A map @xmath with domain @xmath is a\ndirection of @xmath if @xmath maps every @xmath to a component of @xmath\nand @xmath whenever @xmath (this condition says that @xmath chooses the\ncomponents consistently). Diestel and K\u00fchn [ 5 ] have shown that the\ndirections of a graph are precisely its ends. of the graph @xmath , and\nhence its ends. Both @xmath and @xmath come from @xmath -systems, and:\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.1.\n\nEvery @xmath -system induces an @xmath -compactification of its graph\n@xmath . In particular, @xmath and @xmath are @xmath -compactifications\nof the graph @xmath .\n\nMoreover, we obtain the following analogue of [ 14 , Theorem 1] for\n@xmath :\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.2.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph.\n\n1.  @xmath is a compact space in which @xmath is dense and @xmath is\n    totally disconnected.\n\n2.   If @xmath is locally finite and connected, then @xmath and @xmath\n    coincides with the Freudenthal compactification of @xmath .\n\nStudying the technical @xmath -systems leads us to the following result\ncomparing our new compactification @xmath and the tangle\ncompactification @xmath :\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.7.\n\nFor every graph @xmath its @xmath -compactification @xmath is coarser\nthan its tangle compactification @xmath .\n\nThen we are finally in a position to answer the first question and half\nof the second question of Diestel from above:\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.10 and 5.4.11.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph. @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification\nof the graph @xmath induced by a @xmath -system while @xmath is the\nfinest one. Furthermore, the following are equivalent:\n\n1.   There exists a homeomorphism between @xmath and @xmath fixing\n    @xmath .\n\n2.   Every @xmath is finite.\n\n3.  @xmath .\n\nAs our third main result of this chapter, we answer the second half of\nDiestel\u2019s second question from above, and show that there is a canonical\nway to obtain @xmath from the tangle compactification. For this, we\ndefine the natural equivalence relation @xmath on the collection of all\nultrafilter tangles by letting @xmath whenever @xmath holds.\n\n###### Theorem 5.5.11.\n\nFor every graph @xmath the @xmath -compactification @xmath is\nhomeomorphic to the quotient @xmath of the tangle compactification\n@xmath .\n\nIf @xmath denotes the set of all ultrafilter tangles of a graph @xmath ,\nthen we find the following cardinality bound and comparison:\n\n###### Proposition 5.5.15.\n\nFor every graph @xmath the following hold:\n\n1.  @xmath ,\n\n2.  @xmath .\n\nStrikingly, we will see an explicit definition of a set @xmath of finite\norder separations yielding our fourth main result in this chapter:\n\n###### Theorem 5.6.4.\n\nFor every graph @xmath the elements of the inverse limit @xmath are\nprecisely the @xmath -tangles of the graph @xmath with respect to the\nset @xmath .\n\nIn particular, @xmath actually is another \u2018tangle compactification\u2019 for\na smaller separation system. Finally, we find an inverse subsystem of\nthe inverse system @xmath whose inverse limit @xmath describes the\n@xmath -compactification @xmath :\n\n###### Theorem 5.7.5.\n\nFor every graph @xmath the inverse limit @xmath is homeomorphic to the\n@xmath -compactification @xmath .\n\n##### Chapter\u00a06.\n\nEarlier, I expressed my hopes for the tangle compactification to\ngeneralise the elegant solution from the locally finite case to the\ngeneral case. To explain why I think that modifications to the tangle\ncompactification cannot be avoided, I show that every possible notion of\na topological spanning tree I could think of does not meet my\nexpectations. More precisely, for the case that our graph @xmath is a\n@xmath (see Fig. 1 ) I will a name set of edges which I expect to induce\na topological spanning tree for any sensible notion of a topological\nspanning tree, but none of whose candidates are topologically connected.\n\nThe heavy edge set from the drawing of our graph @xmath in Fig. 1 is the\nthin sum \u2078 \u2078 8 A family @xmath of subsets of @xmath is thin if no edge\nlies in @xmath for infinitely many @xmath . Then the thin sum @xmath is\nthe collection of all edges that lie in @xmath for an odd number of\nindices @xmath . See [ 13 ] for details. of all facial cycles, and I\nexpect it to be an element of the cycle space for any notion of a cycle\nspace of this graph. Similarly, I further expect every two edges at a\nmiddle vertex together to form an element of any such cycle space.\nConsequently, I think that the upper fan in Fig. 1 should induce a\ntopological spanning tree which contains no edge of the lower fan (since\nthis would create an element of the cycle space). But if we take as\n@xmath the upper fan plus the lower vertex @xmath and add any subset of\nthe tangle space, then this turns out to be a (topologically)\ndisconnected subspace of the tangle compactification: Indeed, if we\ncover @xmath with any basic open neighbourhood @xmath of the 1-complex\nof @xmath , and if we cover @xmath with @xmath (which is open since all\nsingleton subsets of the tangle compactification are closed in it), then\n@xmath and @xmath meet only in inner edge points of the lower fan which\nare no points of @xmath . Thus @xmath induces an open bipartition of\n@xmath . Informally, the problem here is that the tangles are not\n\u2018sufficiently connected\u2019 to certain vertices of the graph, which allows\nus to separate @xmath from @xmath so easily. This is why I think that it\nmakes sense to consider modifications to the tangle compactification.\n\nIf we modify the tangle compactification to yield a new compactification\nwith the potential of overcoming this and so many other difficulties,\nthen it would be of great advantage if we could see to it that this new\ncompactification also be Hausdorff: then, for connected graphs, the\nwhole field of (non-metric) continuum \u2079 \u2079 9 A continuum is a compact\nconnected Hausdorff topological space. See Section 2.4 for further\ndetails. theory would open up, providing us with a useful topological\ntool box. This is why I construct two new spaces: First, in this chapter\nwe study classic hindrances to earlier attempts, and we find inspiration\nleading to the construction of the auxiliary space @xmath . This\nauxiliary space is Hausdorff, but in general it is not compact. Thus in\nthe next section we will enhance the idea behind the auxiliary space\n@xmath to obtain a Hausdorff compactification @xmath from the tangle\ncompactification.\n\nThe auxiliary space @xmath is obtained from @xmath (for the experts:\nhere, @xmath is endowed with MTop ) in two steps: First, we add\nauxiliary edges (which\u2014formally\u2014are internally disjoint copies of the\nunit interval) between every end of the graph and each of its dominating\nvertices, and between any two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of the\nsame critical element of @xmath (one new auxiliary edge for each\ncritical element of @xmath both vertices are contained in, and\ninternally disjoint from the edge @xmath of @xmath in case it exists).\nSecond, we generalise the topology of @xmath onto this new space in a\nnatural way.\n\nIn the first half of this chapter, we study the arc-connected subspaces\nof @xmath induced by the auxiliary edges. More precisely, we have a\ncloser look at the auxiliary arc-components of @xmath , where an\nauxiliary arc is an arc in @xmath which is included in the closure of\nthe auxiliary edges. Rather strikingly, our first main result of this\nchapter holds without imposing any cardinality bounds on the graph\nconsidered:\n\n###### Theorem 6.4.2.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph. Then between every two distinct points @xmath\nand @xmath of @xmath there exists an auxiliary arc if and only if @xmath\nand @xmath are not finitely separable.\n\nThis suggests that we might be able to take advantage of the results in\nChapter 3 , namely that @xmath is the quotient @xmath of the tangle\ncompactification, in order to generalise statements about @xmath to\nstatements about the auxiliary space @xmath . We will see that every\nnormal spanning tree of the graph @xmath induces a topological spanning\ntree (with respect to the common definition in terms of arcs) of @xmath\n, so the auxiliary space @xmath overcomes one of the classic hindrances\nfrom [ 8 ] (which will be presented in detail in the introduction of\nChapter 6 ).\n\nMotivated by these findings, we use the synergy between @xmath and\n@xmath to prove a generalised version of tree-packing \u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u2070 10 As\nmentioned earlier, the so-called \u2018tree-packing\u2019 [ 13 , Theorem 2.4.1]\nwas proved independently by Nash-Williams and Tutte in 1961: A finite\nmultigraph contains @xmath edge-disjoint spanning trees if and only if\nfor every partition @xmath of its vertex set it has at least @xmath\ncross-edges. for countable graphs:\n\n###### Theorem 6.7.4.\n\nLet @xmath be a countable connected graph. Then the following are\nequivalent for all @xmath :\n\n1.  @xmath has @xmath topological spanning trees in @xmath which are\n    edge-disjoint on @xmath .\n\n2.  @xmath has at least @xmath edges across any finite vertex partition\n    @xmath .\n\nIn the outlook of Chapter 6 we will see an idea on a generalisation of\nthin sums for circles of @xmath , but I abandoned further investigation\nwhen the idea of @xmath came to my mind as a better candidate than\n@xmath .\n\n##### Chapter\u00a07.\n\nIn the previous chapter we have seen that since none of the possible\nnotions of a topological spanning tree of the tangle compactification I\ncould think of met my expectations, I suggested to modify the tangle\ncompactification. Furthermore, I claimed that it would be of great\nadvantage if our modifications would yield a Hausdorff compactification,\nsince then\u2014for connected graphs\u2014the whole field of (non-metric)\ncontinuum theory would open up, providing us with a useful topological\ntool box. Then we studied the auxiliary space @xmath which\u2014in general\u2014is\nonly Hausdorff but not compact. In this chapter we enhance the idea\nbehind this auxiliary space to obtain a Hausdorff compactification\n@xmath from the tangle compactification.\n\nStarting from the tangle compactification, we add limit edges\n(which\u2014formally\u2014are internally disjoint copies of the unit interval)\nbetween every end of the graph and each vertex dominating it, and\nbetween every ultrafilter tangle @xmath and each vertex in @xmath .\nTreating the inner limit edge points almost like their incident tangles\nallows us to turn the topology of the tangle compactification into a\ncompact Hausdorff one of the new space, yielding the Hausdorff\ncompactification @xmath . (As mentioned earlier, we will modify the\ninverse system @xmath to construct @xmath formally, see Chapter 7 for\ndetails.)\n\nTo be precise, the Hausdorff compactification @xmath only compactifies\nthe 1-complex of @xmath endowed with a slightly coarser topology: at\neach vertex we only take @xmath -balls instead of stars of arbitrary\nhalf-open partial edges (for the experts: @xmath is a Hausdorff\ncompactification of @xmath ). Since we wish to study graphs of arbitrary\nbig cardinality while the cardinality of arcs and circles is that of the\nunit interval (and hence constant), this discrepancy potentially\nprohibits us from fully understanding these graphs (e.g. sufficiently\nbig graphs would not have a Hamilton circle by definition). Hence we\nsuggest generalisations of arcs, circles and topological spanning trees\nfor the Hausdorff compactification @xmath solely in terms of continua\n(see Chapter 7 for details).\n\nWhen @xmath came to my mind, this work had already reached critical\nlength, so I only provide sketches. However, the examples I studied so\nfar looked really promising, and I am eager to continue my research on\nthis space.\n\n##### Chapter\u00a08.\n\nSince the tangle compactification in general is not Hausdorff, but the\nquotient @xmath is, and since this quotient is homeomorphic to @xmath\n(cf. Chapter 3 ) for connected graphs @xmath , one might ask whether\n@xmath is the maximal Hausdorff quotient of the tangle compactification.\nStrinkingly, an already known example witnesses that\u2014in general\u2014this is\nnot the case. In this chapter we study several graphs, but I did not\nsucceed in finding a combinatorial description of the equivalence\nrelation on the tangle compactification yielding its maximal Hausdorff\nquotient (it seems like wild auxiliary arcs are the key here, where an\narc is wild if it induces the ordering of the rationals on some subset\nof its vertices).\n\nHowever, as our main contribution we at least present sufficient\ncombinatorial conditions for when @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff\nquotient of the tangle compactification of a connected graph @xmath .\nFor these results we need two new pieces of notation: First, if @xmath\nis a graph and @xmath is a set, then we write @xmath for the collection\nof all edges of @xmath with both endvertices in @xmath . Second, if\n@xmath is a normal spanning tree of a graph @xmath , then by [ 13 ,\nLemma 8.2.3] every end @xmath of @xmath contains precisely one normal\nray of @xmath (a ray in @xmath starting at the root of @xmath ) which we\ndenote @xmath .\n\n###### Proposition 8.2.2.\n\nLet @xmath be a connected graph such that for all two distinct vertices\n@xmath and @xmath of @xmath the following are equivalent:\n\n1.   The vertices @xmath and @xmath are not finitely separable.\n\n2.   There exists some @xmath containing both @xmath and @xmath such\n    that no @xmath disjoint from @xmath separates @xmath and @xmath in\n    @xmath .\n\nThen @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff quotient of the tangle\ncompactification @xmath .\n\nIf (ii) holds for two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of a graph\n@xmath , witnessed by such an @xmath , then we can inductively find\ninfinitely many edge-disjoint @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths in @xmath , so\n@xmath and @xmath are not finitely separable. In particular, (ii)\nimplies (i). Therefore, all connected finitely separable graphs satisfy\nthe premise of this proposition. The next result involves normal\nspanning trees and binary trees:\n\n###### Proposition 8.4.2.\n\nIf @xmath is a connected graph such that for every @xmath the graph\n@xmath has a normal spanning tree @xmath whose subtree @xmath contains\nno subdivision of the (infinite) binary tree, then @xmath is the maximal\nHausdorff quotient of the tangle compactification @xmath .\n\nIn the outlook of this chapter we point out the difficulties preventing\nus from giving a characterisation of these graphs, and we state our\ndesired result as a conjecture.\n\nPersonally, I hope that a (possibly modified) tangle compactification\nallows us to further generalise the elegant solution from the locally\nfinite case to the general case, and that is why in this work I study\nthe tangle compactification of infinite graphs.\n\n### 2 Definitions & general facts\n\n#### 2.1 Basic Notation\n\nAny terms regarding graphs that are not defined in this work can be\nfound in [ 13 ] .\n\nA finite partition of a set is said to be cofinite if at most one\npartition class is infinite.

If @xmath and @xmath are two disjoint\nsets and @xmath , then we write @xmath for the set of all inner points\nof @xmath \u2013 @xmath edges (of @xmath ) at distance less than @xmath from\ntheir endpoint in @xmath (with respect to the metric of the edge). The\n\u2018*\u2019 on the right side is supposed to help us remember \u2018from where to\ntake our @xmath -balls\u2019.\n\nTwo vertices of @xmath are said to be finitely separable whenever there\nexist some finitely many edges separating them. \u00b9\u00b9 \u00b9\u00b9 11 i.e. @xmath\nfinite @xmath such that the two vertices are contained in distinct\ncomponents of @xmath . If every two distinct vertices of @xmath are\nfinitely separable, then we call @xmath finitely separable .\n\nIf @xmath is a normal spanning tree (NST) of @xmath and @xmath is an end\nof @xmath , we denote by @xmath the normal ray of @xmath in @xmath (see\n[ 13 , Lemma 8.2.3] ).\n\nIf @xmath is a ray and @xmath is a vertex of @xmath , then @xmath\ndenotes the tail of @xmath starting with @xmath , and @xmath denotes the\nfinite intial segment of @xmath ending with @xmath .\n\nWe denote by @xmath the (infinite) binary tree on the set of finite 0--1\nsequences (with the empty sequence as the root).\n\n#### 2.2 Inverse Limits\n\nBelow we give a minimal introduction to inverse limits of inverse\nsystems accumulated from [ 13 , Chapter 8.7 of the 5th edition] , [ 24 ]\nand [ 16 ] :\n\nA partially ordered set @xmath is called directed if for every @xmath\nthere is some @xmath with @xmath . Assume that @xmath is a family of\ntopological spaces indexed by some directed poset @xmath . Furthermore\nsuppose that we have a family @xmath of continuous maps which are\ncompatible in that @xmath for all @xmath , and which are the identity on\n@xmath in case of @xmath . Then both families together form an inverse\nsystem , and the maps @xmath are called its bonding maps . We denote\nsuch a system by @xmath , or @xmath for short if @xmath is clear from\ncontext. The inverse limit @xmath (or @xmath for short) of this system\nis the subset\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nof @xmath whose product topology we pass on to @xmath via the subspace\ntopology. Whenever we define an inverse system without specifying a\ntopology for the spaces @xmath , we tacitly assume them to carry the\ndiscrete topology. We end this introduction by listing some Lemmas which\nwe will put to use later:\n\n###### Lemma 2.2.1 ([24, Lemma 1.1.2]).\n\nIf @xmath is an inverse system of Hausdorff topological spaces, then\n@xmath is a closed subspace of @xmath .\n\nA topological space is totally disconnected if every point in the space\nis its own connected component.\n\n###### Lemma 2.2.2 ([24, Proposition 1.1.3]).\n\nLet @xmath be an inverse system of compact Hausdorff totally\ndisconnected topological spaces. Then @xmath is also a compact Hausdorff\ntotally disconnected topological space.\n\n###### Lemma 2.2.3 ([16, Lemma 1.1.3]).\n\nThe inverse limit of an inverse system of non-empty compact Hausdorff\nspaces is a non-empty compact Hausdorff space.\n\n###### Lemma 2.2.4 (Generalized Infinity Lemma, [24, Proposition 1.1.4]\nand [16, Corollary 1.1.4]).\n\nThe inverse limit of an inverse system of non-empty finite sets is\nnon-empty.\n\n###### Lemma 2.2.5 ([16, Lemma 1.1.1]).\n\nLet @xmath be an inverse system of topological spaces and denote by\n@xmath the restriction of the @xmath th projection map @xmath to @xmath\nwhere @xmath . Then the collection of all subsets of @xmath of the form\n@xmath with @xmath open in @xmath is a basis for the topology of @xmath\n.\n\nMoreover, if for every @xmath the set @xmath is a basis of the topology\nof @xmath , then the collection of all subsets of @xmath of the form\n@xmath with @xmath in @xmath is a basis for the topology of @xmath . \u00b9\u00b2\n\u00b9\u00b2 12 This last sentence is not part of [ 16 , Lemma 1.1.1] , but its\nclaim follows immediately from the original statement.\n\nA topological space @xmath is T @xmath if for every pair of distinct\npoints, each has an open neighbourhood avoiding the other. Equivalently,\n@xmath is T @xmath if and only if every finite subset of @xmath is\nclosed. A topological space @xmath is T @xmath if it is Hausdorff. Note\nthat we use normal font here, whereas the binary tree @xmath uses\nitalic.\n\n###### Lemma 2.2.6 ([16, Corollary 1.1.6]).\n\nLet @xmath be a compact space, @xmath an inverse system of T @xmath\ntopological spaces, and @xmath a compatible system of continuous\nsurjective maps. Let @xmath map each @xmath to @xmath . Then @xmath is a\ncontinuous surjection. \u00b9\u00b3 \u00b9\u00b3 13 In [ 16 ] the @xmath are required to be\nHausdorff (T @xmath ), but T @xmath suffices since the proof only uses\nthat singleton subsets of the @xmath are closed. Furthermore, [ 16 ]\ndoes not state that @xmath is continuous.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nSince [ 16 ] only states that @xmath is surjective, we quickly show that\nit is also continuous. For this, by Lemma 2.2.5 consider any basic open\nset @xmath of @xmath where @xmath is open in @xmath . Then @xmath\nimplies that @xmath which is open in @xmath since @xmath is continuous.\n\u220e\n\n###### Lemma 2.2.7 ([16, Corollary 1.1.5]).\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be inverse systems of compact Hausdorff spaces.\nLet @xmath be a compatible system of continuous surjections. Then the\nmap\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nis a continuous surjection.\n\nA subset @xmath of @xmath is cofinal in @xmath if for every @xmath there\nis some @xmath with @xmath . If @xmath and @xmath are two topological\nspaces, we write @xmath to say that @xmath and @xmath are homeomorphic.\n\n###### Lemma 2.2.8 ([13, Lemma 8.7.3 of the 5th edition]).\n\nLet @xmath be an inverse system of compact spaces, and let @xmath be\ncofinal in @xmath . Then @xmath satisfies @xmath with the homeomorphism\nthat maps every point @xmath to its restriction @xmath .\n\nA function @xmath is monotone if @xmath is connected for every @xmath .\nAssume that @xmath is a family of topological spaces, and furthermore\nsuppose that for every @xmath we have a continuous map @xmath . Then the\nfamily of the @xmath together with the family of all @xmath forms an\ninverse sequence , denoted @xmath . Clearly, every such inverse sequence\ngives rise to an inverse system @xmath where @xmath for @xmath and\n@xmath . Hence, given an inverse sequence @xmath , we write @xmath for\nthe inverse limit of the inverse system it induces.\n\n###### Theorem 2.2.9 (Capel, [4, Theorem 4.11], [19, Theorem 200]).\n\nIf @xmath is an inverse sequence such that @xmath is an arc and @xmath\nis monotone and surjective for every @xmath then @xmath is an arc.\n\n#### 2.3 \u2018Ends and tangles\u2019 plus further notation\n\nThis section not only serves as a summary of \u2018Ends and tangles\u2019 ( [ 14 ]\n), but also as an introduction of its basic definitions and notation,\nsome of which we modified to meet our needs. At the end of this section,\nwe introduce some additional notation, and we remind of a useful\nconstruction from the proof of [ 5 , Theorem 2.2] . But first, we start\nwith the promised summary:\n\nA separation of a graph @xmath is a set @xmath with @xmath and @xmath\nsubsets of @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath has no edge from @xmath to\n@xmath . Clearly, every separation @xmath induces a bipartition of the\nset of components of @xmath , and vice versa. The cardinal @xmath is the\norder of the separation @xmath . Every separation @xmath has two\norientations , namely the ordered pairs @xmath and @xmath , which we\nalso refer to as oriented separations . \u00b9\u2074 \u00b9\u2074 14 Usually we refer to an\noriented separation simply as \u2018separation\u2019, relying upon context\ninstead. Informally, we think of @xmath and @xmath as the small side and\nthe big side of @xmath , respectively. The order of an oriented\nseparation @xmath simply is the order of @xmath , namely @xmath . If\n@xmath is a set of separations of the graph, then we denote by @xmath\nthe collection of the orientations of its elements. We shall call @xmath\nthe inverse of @xmath and vice versa. For the sake of readability we use\nthe more intuitive \u2019arrow notation\u2019 known from vector spaces: when\nreferring to an element of @xmath as @xmath (or @xmath ), we denote its\ninverse by @xmath (or @xmath ). Then the map @xmath is an involution on\n@xmath . We define a partial ordering @xmath on @xmath by letting\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nNote that our involution reverses this partial ordering, i.e. for @xmath\nwe have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe triple @xmath is known as a separation system .\n\nAn orientation @xmath of @xmath is a subset of @xmath with @xmath for\nevery @xmath . If no two distinct @xmath satisfy @xmath then we say that\n@xmath is consistent. We say that an orientation @xmath of @xmath avoids\nsome @xmath if @xmath and @xmath intersect emptily. A non-empty set\n@xmath is a said to be a star if @xmath holds for all distinct @xmath .\nThe interior of a star @xmath is the set @xmath . In the context of a\ngiven graph @xmath , the set @xmath will be denoted by @xmath , and\n@xmath will denote the set of all separations of @xmath of finite order.\nFurthermore, @xmath will denote the set of all stars in @xmath . For the\nrest of this chapter, we let @xmath be a fixed infinite graph. By @xmath\nwe denote the set of all finite stars @xmath of finite interior, and by\n@xmath we denote the set of all stars @xmath of finite interior. Outside\nthis section, @xmath will be used to denote topological spanning trees.\n\nFor every @xmath we say that an @xmath - tangle of @xmath is a\nconsistent orientation of @xmath avoiding @xmath . Moreover, an @xmath -\ntangle of @xmath is said to be a @xmath -tangle of @xmath , and we write\n@xmath for the collection of all @xmath -tangles of @xmath . \u00b9\u2075 \u00b9\u2075 15 As\nDiestel showed in [ 14 ] , this definition is equivalent to the\ndefinition known from Robertson & Seymour. If @xmath is an end of @xmath\n, then by [ 14 , Corollary 1.7] letting\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ndefines a bijection @xmath from the ends of @xmath to the @xmath\n-tangles of @xmath . Therefore, we call these @xmath -tangles the end\ntangles of @xmath . By abuse of notation, we will write @xmath for the\ncollection of all end tangles of @xmath . The elements of @xmath we call\nthe ultrafilter tangles of @xmath , and we write @xmath for the\ncollection of all these. \u00b9\u2076 \u00b9\u2076 16 This definition differs from the one\ngiven by Diestel, but both turn out to be equivalent due to [ 14 ,\nTheorem 2] . In particular, we have @xmath .\n\nFor every @xmath we denote by @xmath be the set of all components of\n@xmath , and @xmath is the set of all ultrafilters on @xmath . For every\n@xmath we define the map @xmath be letting it send every component of\n@xmath to the unique component of @xmath including it, i.e. such that\n@xmath . For subsets @xmath we write @xmath , and for ultrafilters\n@xmath we write\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath for two sets @xmath with @xmath denotes the collection of\nall supersets @xmath of elements of @xmath , the set-theoretic\nup-closure of @xmath in @xmath . Due to [ 14 , Lemma 2.1] , letting\n@xmath send each @xmath to @xmath for all @xmath yields an inverse\nsystem @xmath whose inverse limit we denote by @xmath . Hence taking the\nup-closure in the definition of @xmath ensures that @xmath is an\nultrafilter on @xmath , even if there is some finite component of @xmath\nwhose vertex set is included in @xmath .\n\nNext, for every @xmath and @xmath we let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath . Then by [ 14 , Lemma 2.3] the map\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a bijection from @xmath to @xmath . Furthermore, the ends of @xmath\nare precisely those of its @xmath -tangles which this map sends to a\nfamily of principal ultrafilters. Now let @xmath be the set of all\nnon-principal elements of @xmath . For every @xmath we define a map\n@xmath by letting\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor every @xmath . By [ 14 , Lemma 3.1] this map is well-defined, and it\nsends each @xmath to the unique @xmath with @xmath . In particular, we\nhave\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nby [ 14 , Lemma 3.2] . Combined, these Lemmas yield\n\n###### Lemma 2.3.1.\n\nFor all @xmath the map @xmath restricts to a bijection between @xmath\nand @xmath with inverse @xmath .\u220e\n\nIn particular, we have\n\n###### Corollary 2.3.2.\n\nFor every @xmath each non-principal @xmath uniquely extends to an\nelement of @xmath .\u220e\n\nFor every @xmath we set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand every element of @xmath is said to witness that @xmath is an\nultrafilter tangle. By [ 14 , Lemma 3.3 & 3.4] , for every @xmath and\n@xmath the non-principal ultrafilter @xmath uniquely determines @xmath\nin that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nAccording to [ 14 , Theorem 3.6] , for each @xmath the set @xmath has a\nunique least element @xmath with @xmath . Furthermore, [ 14 , Lemma 3.7]\nstates that, if @xmath and @xmath is not generated by @xmath for any\nfinite @xmath , then there is some @xmath such that @xmath .\n\nFinally, we use @xmath to compactify @xmath . For this, we equip the\n@xmath with the Stone topology, i.e. we equip @xmath with the topology\ngenerated by declaring as basic open for every @xmath the set \u00b9\u2077 \u00b9\u2077 17\nIn [ 14 ] , the notion for these sets is simply @xmath . Since in this\nwork we will compare the tangle compactification with other spaces, we\nslightly modify a lot of the topological notation from [ 14 ] .\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen by [ 14 , Lemma 4.1] , the bonding maps @xmath are continuous, so [\n14 , Proposition 4.2] tells us that @xmath is compact, Hausdorff and\ntotally disconnected. \u00b9\u2078 \u00b9\u2078 18 We added \u2018Hausdorff\u2019 here. Next, for\nevery @xmath let @xmath be the restriction of the @xmath th projection\nmap @xmath , and for every @xmath and @xmath write\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen by [ 14 , Lemma 4.4] , the collection\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a basis for the topology of @xmath . Now, we extend the 1-complex of\n@xmath to a topological space @xmath by declaring as open, for all\n@xmath and @xmath , the sets\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand endowing @xmath with the topology this generates. Then we arrive at\nthe main result of [ 14 ] :\n\n###### Theorem 2.3.3 ([14, Theorem 1]).\n\nLet @xmath be any graph.\n\n1.  @xmath is a compact space in which @xmath is dense and @xmath is\n    totally disconnected.\n\n2.   If @xmath is locally finite and connected, then all its @xmath\n    -tangles are ends, and @xmath coincides with the Freudenthal\n    compactification of @xmath .\n\nThe following is extracted from the proof of [ 14 , Theorem 1] , and it\nwill be reproved in a more general context in the proof of Theorem 5.4.1\n:\n\n###### Lemma 2.3.4 ([14, Proof of Theorem 1]).\n\nFor all @xmath and every @xmath we have @xmath .\u220e\n\nEven though @xmath in general is not Hausdorff, Diestel remarks that\nthere exist two workarounds: First, the space @xmath is a Hausdorff\ncompactification of @xmath which still reflects the structure of @xmath\n. Second, we can exchange \u2018compact\u2019 for \u2018Hausdorff\u2019 by modifying the\ntopology of @xmath similarly to the way we would obtain MTop from VTop\n(see 2.5 for definitions of MTop and VTop ).\n\nFrom now on, we will write @xmath and @xmath as well as @xmath by abuse\nof notation. If @xmath is an end of @xmath , we write @xmath for the set\n@xmath , and we write @xmath for the set of vertices of @xmath\ndominating @xmath . Furthermore, we write @xmath and @xmath , as well as\n@xmath for the union @xmath . For every @xmath we write @xmath and\n@xmath . On @xmath we define the equivalence relation @xmath by letting\n@xmath whenever @xmath holds.\n\nA map @xmath with domain @xmath is a direction of @xmath if @xmath maps\nevery @xmath to a component of @xmath and @xmath whenever @xmath .\nClearly, the directions of @xmath are precisely the elements of the\ninverse limit of @xmath , and we have seen above that these are\nprecisely the ends of @xmath . However, the constructive proof of the\noriginal Theorem from Diestel and K\u00fchn [ 5 ] linking ends to directions\nyields much more:\n\n###### Lemma 2.3.5 (@xmath).\n\nLet @xmath be an arbitrary infinite graph and @xmath an end of @xmath\nwhich is dominated by at most finitely many vertices. Then there exists\na sequence @xmath of non-empty finite sets of vertices of @xmath such\nthat for all @xmath the component @xmath includes both @xmath and @xmath\n. In particular, the collection of all @xmath forms a countable\nneighbourhood basis of @xmath in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet an @xmath be an arbitrary end of @xmath which is dominated by at\nmost finitely many vertices, and let @xmath . We now copy the main part\nof the proof of [ 5 , Theorem 2.2] for the sake of completeness: Denote\nby @xmath the collection of all finite sets of vertices of @xmath . For\nevery @xmath we write\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is the component of @xmath in which every ray of @xmath has\na tail. Starting with an arbitrary non-empty @xmath we will construct a\nsequence @xmath of non-empty elements of @xmath such that for all @xmath\nthe component @xmath includes both @xmath and @xmath .\n\nTherefore, we proceed inductively, as follows: Suppose that @xmath has\nbeen constructed. Since @xmath is not dominated by a vertex of @xmath ,\nwe find for every @xmath some @xmath with @xmath . Set @xmath and let\n@xmath be the neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath . Then @xmath is finite\ndue to @xmath . By the choice of @xmath we have @xmath . For all @xmath\n, together with @xmath this yields @xmath . Hence @xmath is connected\nand avoids @xmath , so it is included in @xmath . This completes the\nconstruction.\n\nSince all the @xmath are disjoint, the descending sequence @xmath has\nempty overall intersection: every vertex in @xmath has distance at least\n@xmath from @xmath (because every @xmath - @xmath path meets all the\ndisjoint sets @xmath ), so no vertex can lie in @xmath for every @xmath\n. We now leave the proof of [ 5 , Theorem 2.2] .\n\nNow we for every @xmath we let @xmath . Then the collection of all open\nsets @xmath forms a countable neighbourhood base of @xmath : Indeed, let\n@xmath be a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath . Without loss\nof generality we may suppose that @xmath and write @xmath . Since @xmath\nis empty, there is some @xmath such that @xmath avoids @xmath . Hence\n@xmath is a connected subgraph of @xmath , so in particular it is\nincluded in @xmath . Therefore @xmath holds as desired. \u220e\n\n#### 2.4 General Topology\n\nIf @xmath is a topological space, then a homeomorphic image of the unit\ninterval in @xmath is an arc in @xmath . The following Lemma is\nimmediate from the continuity of the quotient map:\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.1.\n\nIf @xmath is a topological space and @xmath is an equivalence relation\non @xmath such that @xmath is T @xmath , then every element of @xmath is\na closed subset of @xmath .\u220e\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.2 ([28, Theorem 7.2 a)@xmathd)]).\n\nIf @xmath and @xmath are topological spaces and @xmath is continuous,\nthen for each @xmath we have @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.3 ([28, Corollary 31.6]).\n\nA Hausdorff topological space is path-connected if and only if it is\narc-connected.\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.4 ([28, Corollary 13.14]).\n\nIf @xmath are continuous, @xmath is Hausdorff, and @xmath and @xmath\nagree on a dense set @xmath in @xmath , then @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.5 (The pasting Lemma, [23, Theorem 18.3]).\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be topological spaces and @xmath , where @xmath\nand @xmath are closed in @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath be continuous.\nIf @xmath for every @xmath , then @xmath and @xmath combine to give a\ncontinuous function @xmath , defined by setting @xmath if @xmath and\n@xmath if @xmath .\n\nThe following lines on continuum theory are accumulated from [ 28 ,\nChapter 28] : A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff topological\nspace.\n\n###### Theorem 2.4.6 ([28, Theorem 28.2]).\n\nLet @xmath be a collection of continua in a topological space @xmath\ndirected by inclusion. Then @xmath is a continuum.\n\nA continuum @xmath in a topological space @xmath is said to be\nirreducible about a subset @xmath of @xmath if @xmath and no proper\nsubcontinuum of @xmath includes @xmath . In case of @xmath we say that\n@xmath is irreducible between @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Theorem 2.4.7 ([28, Theorem 28.4]).\n\nIf @xmath is a continuum, then any subset @xmath of @xmath lies in a\nsubcontinuum irreducible about @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is a connected T \u2081 topological space, then a cut point of\n@xmath is a point @xmath such that @xmath is not connected. If @xmath is\nnot a cut point of @xmath , we call @xmath a noncut point of @xmath . A\ncutting of @xmath is a set @xmath where @xmath is a cut point of @xmath\nand @xmath together with @xmath disconnects @xmath in that @xmath and\n@xmath are disjoint non-empty open subsets of @xmath with @xmath . A cut\npoint @xmath separates @xmath from @xmath if there is a cutting @xmath\nof @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Given @xmath we write @xmath for the\nset consisting of @xmath and all the points @xmath which separate @xmath\nfrom @xmath . The separation ordering on @xmath is defined by letting\n@xmath if and only if @xmath or @xmath separates @xmath from @xmath .\nThis is actually a partial ordering on @xmath .\n\n###### Theorem 2.4.8 ([28, Theorem 28.11]).\n\nThe separation ordering on @xmath is a linear ordering.\n\n###### Theorem 2.4.9 ([28, Theorem 28.12]).\n\nIf @xmath is a continuum with exactly two noncut points @xmath and\n@xmath , then @xmath and the topology on @xmath is the order topology.\n\nNext, we have a look at compactifications: A compactification of a\ntopological space @xmath is an ordered pair @xmath where @xmath is a\ncompact topological space and @xmath is an embedding of @xmath as a\ndense subset of @xmath . Sometimes we also refer to @xmath as a\ncompactification of @xmath if the map @xmath is clearly understood. In [\n28 , chapter 19] we find the following definitions: A Hausdorff\ncompactification of a topological space @xmath is a compactification\n@xmath of @xmath with @xmath Hausdorff. If @xmath and @xmath are\ncompactifications of @xmath we write @xmath whenever there exists a\ncontinuous mapping @xmath with @xmath , i.e. such the diagram\n\n[]\n\ncommutes. \u00b9\u2079 \u00b9\u2079 19 The class of all compactifications of @xmath need not\nbe a set, hence we do not speak of a partial ordering. We write @xmath\nwhenever @xmath holds while @xmath fails. If there exists a\nhomeomorphism @xmath witnessing @xmath we say that @xmath and @xmath are\ntopologically equivalent (clearly, this is symmetric). This definition\nis stated differently in [ 28 ] , but both turn out to be equivalent for\nHausdorff compactifications:\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.10 ([28, Lemma 19.7]).\n\nTwo Hausdorff compactifications @xmath and @xmath of @xmath are\ntopologically equivalent if and only if @xmath holds. \u00b2\u2070 \u00b2\u2070 20 We\nadapted the statement of the original Lemma to our definition of\n\u2018topologically equivalent\u2019.\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.11 ([28, Lemma 19.8]).\n\nSuppose that @xmath and @xmath are two Hausdorff compactifications of\n@xmath with @xmath witnessed by a mapping @xmath . Then the following\nhold:\n\n1.  @xmath is a homeomorphism from @xmath to @xmath .\n\n2.  @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.12.\n\nIf @xmath and @xmath are two Hausdorff compactifications of @xmath and\n@xmath witnesses @xmath then @xmath is unique.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath be any witness of @xmath . We have to show @xmath . By choice\nof @xmath and @xmath , we have @xmath and @xmath . In particular, both\n@xmath and @xmath agree on @xmath . Since @xmath is dense in @xmath ,\nLemma 2.4.4 yields @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\nNext, we have a look at two particular Hausdorff compactifications of\ndiscrete topological spaces which are known as the one-point Hausdorff\ncompactification and the Stone-\u010cech Hausdorff compactification. The\nfollowing insights are accumulated from [ 15 , Chapter 3.5] \u00b2\u00b9 \u00b2\u00b9 21 In\n[ 15 ] the definition of \u2018compactification\u2019 seems to vary from our\ndefinition of \u2018Hausdorff compactification\u2019 at first sight since it does\nnot mention \u2018Hausdorff\u2019. A closer look at the definition of \u2018compact\u2019 in\n[ 15 ] reveals that it is hidden there. :\n\nIf @xmath is a discrete topological space and @xmath is a point that is\nnot in @xmath , then we can extend @xmath to a topological space @xmath\nby declaring as open, for every finite subset @xmath of @xmath , the set\n@xmath . The pair of this space and the identity on @xmath is known as\nthe one-point Hausdorff compactification of @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.13.\n\nIf @xmath is a discrete topological space and @xmath is its one-point\nHausdorff compactification, then @xmath is a least Hausdorff\ncompactification of @xmath in that every Hausdorff compactification\n@xmath of @xmath satisfies @xmath .\n\nMore generally, if @xmath is a topological space and @xmath is a\nHausdorff compactification of @xmath such that @xmath is a singleton,\nthen @xmath is called the one-point Hausdorff compactification of @xmath\n(which is unique up to topological equivalence) and we write @xmath as\nbefore. In order to state an existential Theorem concerning one-point\nHausdorff compactifications we need the following definitions from [ 23\n, \u00a729] : A topological space @xmath is said to be locally compact at\n@xmath if there is some compact subspace @xmath of @xmath that contains\na neighbourhood of @xmath . If @xmath is locally compact at each of its\npoints, then @xmath is said to be locally compact .\n\n###### Theorem 2.4.14 ([23, Theorem 29.1 and subsequent remarks]).\n\nA topological space @xmath has a one-point Hausdorff compactification if\nand only if @xmath is locally compact and Hausdorff, but not compact.\n\nIf @xmath is a discrete topological space we let @xmath be the set of\nall ultrafilters on @xmath equipped with the topology whose basic open\nsets are those of the form @xmath , one for each @xmath . Furthermore,\nwe let @xmath map each @xmath to the non-principal ultrafilter on @xmath\ngenerated by @xmath . Then @xmath is known as the Stone-\u010cech Hausdorff\ncompactification of @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.15.\n\nIf @xmath is a discrete topological space and @xmath is its Stone-\u010cech\nHausdorff compactification, then @xmath is a greatest Hausdorff\ncompactification of @xmath in that every Hausdorff compactification\n@xmath of @xmath satisfies @xmath .\n\n###### Theorem 2.4.16 ([27]).\n\nIf @xmath is a topological space, then the relation @xmath on @xmath\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis an equivalence relation and @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff quotient\nof @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is a topological space and @xmath is given by Theorem 2.4.16 ,\nthen we write @xmath for the quotient space @xmath . For more details on\nthis topic, e.g. regarding uniqueness of @xmath and an intuitive\nconstruction of @xmath , we redirect the reader to [ 27 ] .\n\nIf @xmath is a topological space, we write @xmath for the relation on\n@xmath defined by letting @xmath whenever there exist no disjoint open\nneighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath in @xmath . Now fix a topological\nspace @xmath . For every ordinal @xmath we define an equivalence\nrelation @xmath on @xmath and a quotient space @xmath of @xmath , as\nfollows: Set @xmath and @xmath . For successors @xmath we let @xmath be\nthe quotient map and put\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nas well as @xmath . For limits @xmath we take @xmath and @xmath . Then\n\n###### Theorem 2.4.17 ([27, Lemma 4.11 & Construction 4.12]).\n\nIf @xmath is a topological space, then there exists a minimal ordinal\n@xmath with @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath holds (where @xmath is as in\nTheorem 2.4.16 ), i.e. @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 2.4.18.\n\nLet @xmath be a countable non-empty subset of @xmath and let @xmath be\nsuch that @xmath . Then the map\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nhas the following property: For every @xmath there is some @xmath with\n@xmath and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Proof.\n\nFor @xmath this is clear, so suppose that @xmath . Assume for a\ncontradiction that there is no such @xmath and put\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nClearly we have @xmath .\n\nFirst, we show that @xmath . If @xmath then this is clear, so suppose\nthat @xmath . Hence\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\n(at @xmath we used @xmath ). This completes the proof of @xmath .\n\nSecond, we show that @xmath . If @xmath then this is clear, so suppose\nthat @xmath . Hence\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nThis completes the proof of @xmath .\n\nTherefore @xmath together with @xmath implies @xmath , and hence @xmath\n. If @xmath then @xmath is linear with\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nso in particular we find some @xmath with @xmath , contradicting our\nassumption that @xmath . Otherwise if @xmath , then @xmath is linear\nwith\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n(recall that we have @xmath due to @xmath and @xmath ). But then as\nbefore we find some @xmath with @xmath , contradicting our assumption\nthat @xmath . \u220e\n\n#### 2.5 Topologies on graphs: an overview\n\n##### The 1-complex of @xmath.\n\nRecall Section 2.1 .\n\n1.

If @xmath is finite, then @xmath (with the closures taken in @xmath\n    ), and there is no arc in @xmath with one endpoint in @xmath and the\n    other in @xmath .\n\n2.   If @xmath is infinite, then @xmath , and there may be such an arc\n    (for example, there exists such an arc if both graphs @xmath and\n    @xmath are connected).\n\nThe first statement of this lemma admits a straightforward\ngeneralisation to the tangle compactification:\n\n###### Lemma 3.1.2.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath be a finite cut with sides\n@xmath and @xmath . Then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwith the closures taken in the tangle compactification (in particular\n@xmath ), and no connected subset of @xmath meets both @xmath and @xmath\n.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nConsider @xmath and pick a bipartition @xmath of @xmath respecting\n@xmath in that @xmath and @xmath hold. If @xmath is a tangle of @xmath ,\nthen @xmath is in one of @xmath and @xmath , say in @xmath , and this\nneighbourhood witnesses @xmath . Furthermore, we have @xmath : Let\n@xmath be any open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath . Then @xmath\navoids @xmath and hence must meet @xmath , since otherwise @xmath is not\ndense in @xmath which is impossible. \u220e\n\nBut the second statement extends only partially: Indeed, consider the\ngraph @xmath from Fig. 2 , and let @xmath consist precisely of the red\nedges. Furthermore, let @xmath be the singleton of the vertex of\ninfinite degree, and let @xmath be the vertex set of the black ray. Then\n@xmath is an infinite cut with sides @xmath and @xmath , but @xmath and\n@xmath intersect emptily since we have @xmath and @xmath where @xmath is\nthe sole end of the graph @xmath . In particular, @xmath and @xmath are\nconnected graphs while there is no arc in @xmath with one endpoint in\n@xmath and the other in @xmath since we also have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHowever, since the tangle compactification of connected locally finite\ngraphs coincides with their Freudenthal compactification, the following\npartial generalisation of the second statement of the Jumping Arc Lemma\nis immediate:\n\n###### Lemma 3.1.3.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath be an infinite cut with sides\n@xmath and @xmath . If the graph @xmath is connected and locally finite,\nthen the tangle compactification coincides with the Freudenthal\ncompactification, and we have @xmath . Otherwise, @xmath is possible.\nHowever, in case of @xmath there may be an arc in @xmath with one\nendpoint in @xmath and the other in @xmath .\u220e\n\nThe following lemma shows that arcs in the tangle compactification do\nnot take advantage of the ultrafilter tangles:\n\n###### Lemma 3.1.4.\n\nIf @xmath is any graph, then every arc in its tangle compactification\navoids all ultrafilter tangles.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath be any are in the tangle compactification of the graph @xmath\n. Pick a homeomorphism @xmath and without loss of generality suppose for\na contradiction that @xmath is in @xmath .\n\nFirst we show that @xmath meets @xmath : If not, then in particular\n@xmath is in @xmath . Choose @xmath with @xmath and pick @xmath\nwitnessing this, i.e. with @xmath and @xmath . Then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ninduces an open bipartition on @xmath which is impossible, so without\nloss of generality we may assume that @xmath is a point of @xmath .\nSince @xmath is an arc, we may even assume that @xmath is a vertex\n@xmath of @xmath .\n\nNow let @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath , since otherwise\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ninduces an open bipartition on @xmath which is impossible. Hence we may\nlet @xmath be an edge in @xmath that @xmath traverses and write @xmath\nfor the endvertex of @xmath in @xmath . Pick @xmath with @xmath . Since\n@xmath is non-principal by choice of @xmath , we know that @xmath is an\ninfinite element of @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath in some @xmath ,\nsince otherwise\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ninduces an open bipartition on @xmath which is impossible. Proceeding\ninductively, we find infinitely many edges @xmath in @xmath which @xmath\ntraverses. Since @xmath is finite, by pigeon-hole principle we find some\n@xmath which is incident with infinitely many of the @xmath . In\nparticular, @xmath is a point of @xmath since @xmath lies in the closure\nof those @xmath . But then @xmath has degree at least 3 at @xmath , a\ncontradiction. \u220e\n\nTo see that the tangle compactification in general is not sequentially\ncompact, we consider the leaves of a @xmath and apply the following\nlemma:\n\n###### Lemma 3.1.5.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath be an ultrafilter tangle. Then\nno sequence of vertices of @xmath converges to @xmath in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume for a contradiction that there is some sequence @xmath of\nvertices @xmath of @xmath with @xmath in @xmath for @xmath . Without\nloss of generality we may assume that no @xmath is in @xmath . Our\nsequence @xmath meets infinitely many components of @xmath , since\notherwise @xmath is a contradiction. Pick a subsequence (without loss of\ngenerality the whole sequence) such that @xmath and @xmath live in\ndifferent components of @xmath for all @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath\nbe the set of all components @xmath of @xmath for which there exists\nsome even @xmath with @xmath , and set @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath holds, then there is no @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath , so\n@xmath is a contradiction. Otherwise @xmath similarly results in @xmath\nas desired. \u220e\n\n#### 3.2 Obstructions to Hausdorffness\n\nWe define the relation @xmath on @xmath by letting @xmath whenever there\nare no disjoint open neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath in @xmath ,\ni.e. whenever @xmath and @xmath are not \u2018Hausdorff topologically\ndistinguishable\u2019. Clearly, @xmath in general is not transitive, hence we\ndenote by @xmath the transitive closure of @xmath , which is an\nequivalence relation. The relations @xmath and @xmath on @xmath are\nactually included in the set @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 3.2.1.\n\nLet @xmath be a any graph and @xmath . Then @xmath contains precisely\nthose vertices @xmath of @xmath with @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nFor the backward inclusion consider any vertex @xmath of @xmath with\n@xmath and assume for a contradiction that @xmath is not in @xmath . Put\n@xmath and let @xmath be the set of those components of @xmath which\ncontain neighbours of @xmath . Since @xmath holds, we know that @xmath\nis not in @xmath , and hence @xmath must be @xmath . But then @xmath is\na singleton by the choice of @xmath and @xmath , contradicting the fact\nthat @xmath is non-principal.\n\nFor the forward inclusion let any @xmath be given and put @xmath . By\nminimality of @xmath , the ultrafilter @xmath is generated by @xmath for\nsome component @xmath of @xmath . In particular, @xmath is in @xmath\nsince otherwise @xmath would be principal which is impossible. Put\n@xmath , i.e. @xmath is the set of all components of @xmath , and note\nthat @xmath is in @xmath , since otherwise\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ncontradicts @xmath . Since @xmath is non-principal, we know that @xmath\nmust be an infinite subset of @xmath . Now assume for a contradiction\nthat @xmath fails, witnessed by some basic open neighbourhoods @xmath of\n@xmath and @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , without loss of generality with\n@xmath . Let @xmath consist of those @xmath avoiding @xmath , and note\nthat @xmath is cofinite in @xmath , so @xmath holds as well as @xmath .\nTogether with\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nthis yields @xmath . Now set @xmath which is in @xmath and hence must be\ninfinite. Since @xmath is a subset of @xmath , we know that @xmath sends\nat least one edge to each of the infinitely many @xmath . In particular,\n@xmath does send at least one edge to @xmath , so @xmath and @xmath must\nmeet, a contradiction. \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 3.2.2.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be given. Then for every @xmath the set of all\ncomponents of @xmath which send an edge to every vertex in @xmath is\ncontained in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nIf @xmath is empty, then @xmath is the set of all components of @xmath\nwhich send an edge to every vertex in @xmath , and @xmath holds since\n@xmath is an ultrafilter on @xmath . Hence we may suppose that @xmath is\nnon-empty.\n\nFor every vertex @xmath of @xmath we denote by @xmath the set of all\ncomponents of @xmath which send an edge to @xmath . Then every set\n@xmath is contained in @xmath : Otherwise, for some @xmath the set\n@xmath of all components of @xmath which do not send an edge to @xmath\nis contained in @xmath . But then @xmath is an open neighbourhood of\n@xmath in @xmath which avoids every basic open neighbourhood of @xmath ,\ncontradicting Lemma 3.2.1 . Hence @xmath is contained in @xmath for\nevery @xmath in @xmath . Since @xmath is finite, the set @xmath is also\nin @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Observation 3.2.3.\n\nA graph @xmath is not planar as soon as there is some @xmath or @xmath\nwith @xmath or @xmath , respectively.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nIf @xmath satisfies @xmath , then we let @xmath be the set of all\ncomponents of @xmath whose neighbourhood is precisely @xmath . By\nCorollary 3.2.2 , we have @xmath , so @xmath must be infinite. Consider\nthe subgraph @xmath and obtain @xmath from @xmath by contracting every\nelement of @xmath to a singleton, deleting loops and reducing parallel\nedges. Then @xmath is a @xmath and a minor of @xmath , so the statement\nfollows from Kuratowski\u2019s Theorem ( [ 13 , Theorem 4.4.6] ).\n\nIf @xmath is dominated by three distinct vertices, pick a ray in @xmath\nwhich avoids all three vertices, and find for each of the three vertices\nan infinite fan to that ray such that no two fans meet (this can be\nachieved by inductively constructing all three fans simultaneously,\nadding paths in turn). Then it is easy to find a @xmath in the union of\nthe ray and the three infinite fans. Again, the statement follows from\nKuratowski\u2019s Theorem ( [ 13 , Theorem 4.4.6] ). \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.2.4.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be two distinct vertices of @xmath . Then the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n\n1.   There exist infinitely many independent @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths in\n    @xmath .\n\n2.   There is some @xmath satisfying @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(i) @xmath (ii). Let @xmath be some set of infinitely many independent\n@xmath \u2013 @xmath paths in @xmath and discard from it the trivial @xmath \u2013\n@xmath path. Write @xmath and choose @xmath to be some non-principal\nultrafilter on @xmath . Furthermore, put @xmath . Given @xmath with\n@xmath , we define an ultrafilter @xmath on @xmath , as follows:\n\nLet @xmath denote the set of those @xmath for which @xmath avoids @xmath\n. For every @xmath we write\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen for each bipartition @xmath of @xmath , the set @xmath is a\nbipartition of @xmath : indeed, for @xmath we have @xmath if and only if\nthere is some @xmath containing @xmath (since @xmath implies that @xmath\nis connected in @xmath ), so @xmath is a bipartition of @xmath as\nclaimed. In order to define @xmath , we have to choose for every\nbipartition @xmath of @xmath precisely one of @xmath and @xmath , which\nwe do now: Since @xmath meets only finitely many of the @xmath while\n@xmath is non-principal and @xmath can be written as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwe know that @xmath picks exactly one of @xmath and @xmath , say @xmath\n. Then we let @xmath choose @xmath , and @xmath otherwise. This\ncompletes the definition of @xmath , and clearly @xmath inherits the\nfilter properties from @xmath .\n\nOur next aim is to show that the @xmath are compatible with respect to\nthe bonding maps of the inverse system of ultrafilters. For this, let\n@xmath both be supersets of @xmath and write @xmath for the ultrafilter\n@xmath on @xmath . Assume for a contradiction that @xmath and @xmath are\ndistinct, and consider a bipartition @xmath of @xmath witnessing this\nwith @xmath and @xmath , say. By definition of @xmath we find some\n@xmath with @xmath . Therefore, @xmath holds due to @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nso @xmath is in @xmath as well as @xmath , a contradiction. Hence the\n@xmath are compatible as desired.\n\nFinally we extend the family of the @xmath to an element @xmath of\n@xmath by letting @xmath for every @xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath\nholds: Otherwise there is some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath\nand some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath with @xmath . Without\nloss of generality we may assume that @xmath is included in @xmath .\nThus @xmath implies @xmath by choice of @xmath , so in particular @xmath\nis infinite since @xmath is non-principal. Hence infinitely many of the\n@xmath meet @xmath , therefore witnessing that @xmath sends infinitely\nmany edges to @xmath . In particular, @xmath does send an edge to @xmath\n, so @xmath and @xmath must meet, a contradiction. Similarly, @xmath\nholds.\n\n(ii) @xmath (i). If @xmath is an end tangle, then put @xmath and pick\nsome @xmath \u2013 @xmath path @xmath in the sole component @xmath generating\n@xmath . Next, put @xmath and pick some @xmath \u2013 @xmath path @xmath in\nthe sole component @xmath generating @xmath . Proceeding inductively, we\nfind some disjoint @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths @xmath for every @xmath . Then\n@xmath is a set of infinitely many independent @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths.\nAlternatively, it suffices to note that @xmath must be dominated by\n@xmath and @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is an ultrafilter tangle, then @xmath holds by Lemma 3.2.1 .\nLet @xmath be the set of all components of @xmath sending an edge to\n@xmath , and define @xmath analogously. Then @xmath implies that both\n@xmath and @xmath are in @xmath , and hence @xmath is an infinite subset\nof @xmath . Next we choose some infinite subset @xmath of @xmath , and\nfor every @xmath we pick some @xmath \u2013 @xmath path @xmath in @xmath .\nAgain, @xmath is a set of infinitely many independent @xmath \u2013 @xmath\npaths. \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 3.2.5.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be two distinct vertices of @xmath . Then the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n\n1.  @xmath .\n\n2.   There is some @xmath containing @xmath and @xmath such that no\n    @xmath disjoint from @xmath separates @xmath and @xmath in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(ii) @xmath (i). Let @xmath be as in (ii). Hence, we inductively find\ninfinitely many @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths in @xmath which meet only in\n@xmath . By pigeon-hole principle, infinitely many of them meet exactly\nthe same vertices of @xmath and traverse these in the same order\n(starting in @xmath ), say @xmath for some @xmath . We denote the set of\nthese paths by @xmath and write @xmath for each @xmath and @xmath .\nApplying, for every @xmath , Lemma 3.2.4 to @xmath and the vertices\n@xmath and @xmath yields some @xmath with @xmath . Hence\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (1)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nholds as desired.\n\n(i) @xmath (ii). Suppose that @xmath holds, witnessed by some vertices\n@xmath of @xmath and some @xmath satisfying\u00a0( 1 ). Applying, for every\n@xmath , Lemma 3.2.4 to @xmath yields some collection @xmath of\ninfinitely many independent paths from @xmath to @xmath . Set @xmath .\nThen for every @xmath disjoint from @xmath we find for every @xmath some\n@xmath such that @xmath avoids @xmath . Then @xmath admits a path from\n@xmath to @xmath avoiding @xmath . \u220e\n\n#### 3.3 Critical vertex sets\n\nIn this section we yield a combinatorial description of the sets @xmath\nof ultrafilter tangles.\n\nFor every @xmath and @xmath we write @xmath for the set of components of\n@xmath whose neighbourhood is precisely @xmath . Furthermore, we let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Observation 3.3.1.\n\nSuppose that @xmath and @xmath are given. Then every @xmath meets only\nfinitely many elements of @xmath , so the set @xmath is cofinite in\n@xmath , and in particular @xmath holds. On the other hand, @xmath\nimplies @xmath : since every component in @xmath has neighbourhood\nprecisely @xmath , we have @xmath .\n\nWe call @xmath critical if @xmath holds, i.e. if @xmath is infinite.\nMoreover, we write @xmath for the set of all critical @xmath . Then\nObservation 3.3.1 implies @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 3.3.2.\n\nFor every @xmath and every @xmath we have @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nPut @xmath . By Corollary 3.2.2 (applied to @xmath ) we know that @xmath\nis in @xmath . In particular, @xmath is infinite, witnessing @xmath .\nHence @xmath holds by Observation 3.3.1 . Let @xmath be the set obtained\nfrom @xmath by discarding the finitely many components meeting @xmath\nfrom it, i.e. set @xmath . Then @xmath holds. Since @xmath is cofinite\nin @xmath we have @xmath . Recall that by definition of @xmath we know\nthat\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nSince @xmath by definition is a subset of @xmath , the equation above\nyields @xmath as claimed. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.3.3.\n\nFor all @xmath , every @xmath and each infinite @xmath there is some\n@xmath with @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nChoose some non-principal ultrafilter @xmath on @xmath which contains\n@xmath . By Corollary 2.3.2 , @xmath uniquely extends to an element\n@xmath of @xmath . In particular we have @xmath . For every @xmath the\nset @xmath is a singleton contained in @xmath , therefore witnessing\n@xmath , so @xmath follows. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.3.4.\n\nThe map @xmath is a bijection between @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe map is well defined by Lemma 3.3.2 . By definition of @xmath it is\ninjective. It remains to verify surjectivity. If @xmath is in @xmath ,\nthen @xmath holds, and Lemma 3.3.3 yields some @xmath with @xmath and\n@xmath , so @xmath gets mapped to @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Theorem 3.3.5.\n\nFor every two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of @xmath the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n\n1.   There exist infinitely many independent @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths in\n    @xmath .\n\n2.   There exists some @xmath with @xmath .\n\n3.   There exists some end of @xmath dominated by both @xmath and @xmath\n    or\n    there exists some @xmath with @xmath .\n\n4.   There exists an end of @xmath dominated by both @xmath and @xmath\n    or\n    there exists some @xmath containing both @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(i) @xmath (ii) is Lemma 3.2.4 .\n\n(ii) @xmath (iii) is due to Lemma 3.2.1 .\n\n(iii) @xmath (iv) is due to Lemma 3.3.4 . \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 3.3.6.\n\nFor every @xmath the following hold:\n\n1.   For every @xmath the set @xmath meets at most one component of\n    @xmath .\n\n2.   Every @xmath meets at most one component of @xmath .\n\n3.   For every @xmath the set @xmath meets at most one component of\n    @xmath .\n\n\u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.3.7.\n\nThere exists a connected infinite graph @xmath such that @xmath is an\ninfinite chain with respect to inclusion.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nPut @xmath , and let @xmath be a collection of pairwise disjoint\ncountably infinite sets @xmath avoiding @xmath . For every @xmath write\n@xmath . Let @xmath be the graph on @xmath in which, for every @xmath ,\neach @xmath is joined precisely to all @xmath . Then @xmath consists\nprecisely of the vertices of @xmath of infinite degree (every @xmath has\ndegree @xmath ), and for every @xmath we have @xmath witnessed by @xmath\nwhere @xmath is the component of @xmath including all @xmath and @xmath\nwith @xmath . Every finite @xmath which is distinct from all @xmath\nmisses some @xmath for some @xmath . Thus @xmath is empty, so @xmath is\nnot in @xmath . In particular, we have @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.3.8.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be given, and let @xmath send infinitely many\nedges to @xmath . Then there is some @xmath with @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume for a contradiction that no such @xmath exists. We will construct\na cover of @xmath consisting of open sets which does not admit a finite\nsubcover. For this, we cover @xmath as follows:\n\nFor @xmath we pick @xmath .\n\nFor every edge @xmath we chose @xmath .\n\nFor each @xmath we pick @xmath .\n\nFor each @xmath we have @xmath since @xmath fails. Thus we find some\n@xmath with @xmath and @xmath living in distinct components of @xmath ,\nand we choose @xmath which avoids @xmath .\n\nFor every @xmath we have @xmath by Lemma 3.2.1 since @xmath fails. Then\nwe choose @xmath (which contains @xmath by Lemma 3.3.2 and avoids @xmath\ndue to @xmath ). This completes the construction of the cover.\n\nSince every @xmath with @xmath is covered only by @xmath , our cover of\n@xmath has no finite subcover, contradicting the compactness of @xmath .\n\u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.3.9.\n\nThe vertices in @xmath are precisely the vertices of infinite degree.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy Lemma 3.3.4 we have @xmath . Clearly, every vertex in @xmath has\ninfinite degree. Conversely, for every vertex @xmath of infinite degree\nthere is some @xmath with @xmath by Lemma 3.3.8 . If @xmath is an end,\nthen @xmath follows. Otherwise @xmath is an ultrafilter tangle, and\nLemma 3.2.1 yields @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 3.3.10.\n\nThe tangle compactification of @xmath is Hausdorff if and only if @xmath\nis locally finite.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nIf @xmath is locally finite, then the tangle compactification coincides\nwith @xmath which is Hausdorff. Conversely, if the tangle\ncompactification is Hausdorff, then clearly @xmath is empty, and by\nLemma 3.2.1 we know that for each ultrafilter tangle its set @xmath must\nbe empty. Corollary 3.3.9 then yields that @xmath is locally finite. \u220e\n\n#### 3.4 ETop as a quotient\n\nThe coarsest topology for arbitrary infinite graphs known to be of any\nuse is ETop . In general, it is impossible to obtain ETop from VTop as a\nquotient. Indeed, suppose that @xmath is a @xmath . Since this graph has\nno ends and every two vertices are finitely separable, no two points of\n@xmath may be identified. But for this @xmath , the topology VTop does\nnot coincide with ETop , since the set of all leaves of @xmath is closed\nin VTop but not in ETop . Now if we consider the tangle compactification\nof @xmath instead of VTop and identify all of the (ultrafilter) tangles\nof @xmath with the center vertex, the resulting space is homeomorphic to\nETop . \u00b2\u00b3 \u00b2\u00b3 23 Indeed, an open neighbourhood of the center vertex and\nall ultrafilter tangles may miss at most finitely many leaves, since\notherwise we could construct an ultrafilter tangle outside of that\nneighbourhood.\n\nIn this chapter we generalise the common notion of \u2018finitely separable\u2019\nfrom vertices to @xmath -tangles in order to define an equivalence\nrelation on the tangle compactification whose quotient we show to be\nhomeomorphic to @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath and @xmath are two points of @xmath and @xmath is a finite cut\nof @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath ,\nthen we call @xmath and @xmath finitely separable . If @xmath and @xmath\nare both vertices of @xmath , then by Lemma 3.1.2 this definition\ncoincides with the standard definition of \u2018finitely separable\u2019 for\nvertices. Letting @xmath whenever @xmath and @xmath are not finitely\nseparable defines an equivalence relation on @xmath :\n\n###### Lemma 3.4.1.\n\nThe relation @xmath is transitive.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nGiven @xmath with @xmath and @xmath we have to show @xmath . Assume for\na contradiction that @xmath holds, witnessed by some finite cut @xmath\nof @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath . By Lemma 3.1.2 we have\nprecisely one of @xmath and @xmath , and each case contradicts one of\n@xmath and @xmath . \u220e\n\nHence @xmath is well defined, and it is a compact space since @xmath is.\nFurthermore, we know that\n\n###### Observation 3.4.2.\n\nIf @xmath is locally finite and connected, then @xmath .\n\nThe next few technical Lemmas already give a hint that @xmath and @xmath\nmight be related:\n\n###### Lemma 3.4.3.\n\nLet @xmath be a finite cut of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath , and\nlet @xmath consist of precisely one inner edge point @xmath from each\n@xmath . If this Lemma is applied outside the context of any @xmath ,\nthen we tacitly assume @xmath . Put\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor both @xmath (with the closures taken in @xmath ). Then both @xmath\nare @xmath -closed open sets and we have @xmath as well as @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nSince @xmath and the union of the @xmath with @xmath and @xmath are\nclosed, by Lemma 3.1.2 we know that @xmath is open. Similarly, @xmath is\nopen. \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 3.4.4.\n\n@xmath is Hausdorff.\u220e\n\n###### Corollary 3.4.5.\n\nLet @xmath be an arc. Then @xmath is dense in @xmath .\u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.4.6.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph with only finitely many components. Then every\npoint of @xmath is exactly of one of the following forms:\n\n1.   an inner edge point;\n\n2.  @xmath for some vertex @xmath of @xmath ;\n\n3.  @xmath for some undominated end @xmath of @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is some undominated end of @xmath , then @xmath is not\nnecessarily of the form (iii) , e.g. consider the example from Fig. 16\nwhere it is of the form (ii) .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nConsider any point @xmath of @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath contains an inner edge point, then @xmath is of the form (i).\n\nIf @xmath contains a vertex, then @xmath is of the form (ii).\n\nIf @xmath contains some @xmath ,then @xmath is of the form (ii) for each\n@xmath (which is non-empty since @xmath has only finitely many\ncomponents).\n\nFinally suppose that @xmath , and suppose for a contradiction that\n@xmath is not of the form (iii), i.e. that @xmath is not a singleton.\nPick distinct elements @xmath of @xmath and let @xmath witness @xmath .\nThen since @xmath avoids @xmath there exists for every @xmath some\nfinite cut @xmath with sides @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath lives in\n@xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath as well as @xmath which is a finite cut\ndue to @xmath . Now @xmath implies that there is some component @xmath\nof @xmath in which both @xmath and @xmath live. Since @xmath lives in\n@xmath for every @xmath and @xmath is finite, we know that @xmath . In\nparticular, @xmath avoids @xmath , and hence is a connected subgraph of\n@xmath . But then @xmath follows, a contradiction. \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 3.4.7.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph with only finitely many components. Furthermore\nlet @xmath be given together with some bipartition @xmath of @xmath and\ntwo distinct points @xmath and @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath and\n@xmath . If @xmath then @xmath meets @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume for a contradiction that @xmath avoids @xmath . By Lemma 3.4.6\nthere is some vertex @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , and since @xmath\navoids @xmath there is some @xmath with @xmath , without loss of\ngenerality with @xmath . Now @xmath implies that there exists for every\n@xmath some finite cut @xmath of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath\nsuch that @xmath and @xmath . Put @xmath and @xmath , and let @xmath be\nthe finite cut @xmath . Let @xmath be the component of @xmath containing\n@xmath . Then @xmath is a connected subgraph of @xmath avoiding @xmath\nand @xmath contains @xmath , so we have @xmath . Next consider the\nfinite bond @xmath . Then @xmath (due to @xmath ) together with @xmath\nimplies @xmath , and hence Lemma 3.1.2 yields @xmath . Thus @xmath\nwitnesses @xmath , a contradiction. \u220e\n\nFor the rest of this chapter, @xmath is assumed to be connected.\n\nNext we define an inverse system of multigraphs whose inverse limit is\nhomeomorphic to @xmath . For this, we begin by defining the multigraphs:\nFor every @xmath we denote by @xmath the (multi-)graph which is obtained\nfrom @xmath by contracting the vertex sets of the components of @xmath\n(therefore turning edges of these components into loops). For the rest\nof this chapter let @xmath be ordered by inclusion. We equip @xmath with\nthe topology generated by the following basis: For inner edge points we\ndeclare as open the usual neighbourhoods. For every vertex @xmath of\n@xmath we declare as open all neighbourhoods of the form\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (2)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the set of all loops at @xmath , @xmath for every\n@xmath , @xmath and @xmath is some closed interval included in @xmath\nfor every @xmath .\n\nFor every @xmath we define bonding maps @xmath which are the identity on\n@xmath and which send every vertex @xmath of @xmath to the vertex of\n@xmath whose corresponding component of @xmath includes the component of\n@xmath corresponding to @xmath . The following Lemmas are case checking:\n\n###### Lemma 3.4.8.\n\nThe maps @xmath are continuous.\u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.4.9.\n\nThe maps @xmath are compatible.\u220e\n\n###### Observation 3.4.10.\n\nThe @xmath are compact and Hausdorff.\n\nSince @xmath is an inverse system of non-empty compact Hausdorff spaces,\nits inverse limit\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis again non-empty, compact and Hausdorff by Lemma 2.2.3 . Furthermore,\nMiraftab [ 22 ] showed that\n\n###### Lemma 3.4.11.\n\nIf @xmath is a connected graph, then @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath .\n\nGiven @xmath we define @xmath as follows: Let @xmath be given. By Lemma\n3.4.6 there are three cases to distinguish: If @xmath is an inner edge\npoint of some edge @xmath , then we let @xmath map @xmath to @xmath .\nFor @xmath with @xmath some vertex of @xmath we let @xmath map @xmath to\nthe vertex of @xmath whose corresponding component of @xmath contains\n@xmath . This is well-defined since the finite cuts of @xmath are finite\ncuts of @xmath . Finally, if @xmath we let @xmath map @xmath to the\nvertex of @xmath whose corresponding component includes a tail of every\nray in @xmath . \u00b2\u2074 \u00b2\u2074 24 If @xmath has infinitely many components, then\nthere is some @xmath with @xmath and there is no natural choice for\n@xmath in @xmath . Furthermore, no @xmath would be compact. Hence we\nrequire @xmath to be connected.\n\n###### Lemma 3.4.12.\n\nThe maps @xmath are compatible.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be given. We have to show that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nholds, but this is clear from the definition of @xmath and @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 3.4.13.\n\nThe maps @xmath are continuous surjections.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nClearly, the @xmath are surjective by construction. Let @xmath be given\ntogether with @xmath some basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath .\nBy Lemma 3.4.6 we distinguish three cases:\n\nIf @xmath is an inner edge point we are done, so assume that @xmath is\nof the form @xmath for some vertex @xmath of @xmath . Hence @xmath is a\nvertex of @xmath and @xmath is of the form\u00a0( 2 ). Let @xmath be the\ncomponent of @xmath corresponding to @xmath . Then the non-loop edges at\n@xmath in @xmath form a finite cut @xmath of @xmath and thus also of\n@xmath . Put @xmath and use Lemma 3.4.3 to yield a tripartition @xmath .\nSince @xmath is one side of @xmath in @xmath and @xmath , we without\nloss of generality have @xmath , so @xmath maps @xmath into @xmath .\n\nFinally assume @xmath where @xmath is an undominated end of @xmath .\nThen @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and we are done by the previous case.\n\u220e\n\n###### Theorem 3.4.14.\n\nIf @xmath is a connected graph, then @xmath is homeomorphic to the\nquotient space @xmath of @xmath . In particular, @xmath is homeomorphic\nto @xmath .\n\n###### First proof.\n\nWe start by letting @xmath map @xmath to @xmath . Then @xmath is an\nelement of @xmath by Lemma 3.4.12 and @xmath is injective: Consider\ndistinct elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath . Without loss of\ngenerality none of @xmath and @xmath is an inner edge point. Let @xmath\nbe some finite cut of @xmath witnessing @xmath , then @xmath follows as\ndesired. But @xmath is also a continuous surjection by Lemmas 3.4.12 ,\n3.4.13 and 2.2.6 . Therefore, @xmath is a continuous bijection from a\ncompact space onto a Hausdorff space. By general topology, @xmath is a\nhomeomorphism, so @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath as claimed. Due to\nLemma 3.4.11 , we also know that @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Second proof (sketch).\n\nDefine @xmath using Lemma 3.4.6 as follows: Let @xmath be given. If\n@xmath is an inner edge point put @xmath . Else if @xmath is of the form\n@xmath for some vertex @xmath of @xmath let @xmath send @xmath to the\npoint of @xmath containing @xmath . Otherwise @xmath is of the form\n@xmath for some end @xmath of @xmath and we put @xmath . It is\nstraightforward to check that @xmath is a well defined bijection. Since\n@xmath is compact and @xmath is Hausdorff, it suffices to check that\n@xmath is continuous, which easily follows from Lemma 3.4.3 . \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 3.4.15.\n\nIf @xmath is a countable connected graph and @xmath satisfies @xmath ,\nthen @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy [ 18 , Theorem 3.1] we know that @xmath and @xmath are homeomorphic.\nHence Theorem 3.4.14 implies that @xmath and @xmath are also\nhomeomorphic. \u220e\n\n###### Observation 3.4.16.\n\nIn Section 5.3 we learn about a new compactification @xmath which is\nquite similar to @xmath . For this space, Lemmas 3.1.2 , 3.4.3 and 3.4.6\nadmit straightforward analogues, so @xmath is also a quotient of @xmath\n.\n\n### 4 The tangle compactification as inverse limit\n\n#### 4.1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, inverse limits emerged as useful tools to obtain \u2018limit\nobjects\u2019 of graphs, such as circles and TSTs, from compatible choices of\n\u2018finite objects\u2019 of some carefully chosen \u2018finite minors\u2019. Such inverse\nsystems are known for the Freudenthal compactification of locally finite\ngraphs ( [ 13 , Theorem 8.7.2, 5th edition] ) and for @xmath with ETop (\n[ 22 ] , or see @xmath from section 3.4 ). In this chapter, we will set\nup such an inverse system whose inverse limit describes the tangle\ncompactification. The \u2018finite minors\u2019 we are going to use for this\nactually are multigraphs with finite vertex set and possibly infinite\nedge set, and they are obtained from @xmath by contraction of possibly\nnon-connected sets of vertices. Hence the question comes to mind whether\nthere is a better inverse system based on finite minors of @xmath ?\n\nFirst, we consider an example graph whose tangle compactification cannot\nbe described in a meaningful way by an inverse system of minors. Let\n@xmath be the graph pictured in Fig. 3 , and for every @xmath denote by\n@xmath the ray in @xmath starting at the centre vertex of the infinite\nstar. As Diestel showed in [ 14 , Example 1.9] , every ultrafilter on\nthe naturals induces an @xmath -tangle of this graph. Indeed, since the\nsides of a finite order separation of this graph induce a bipartition of\nits end space, and hence of the naturals via the enumeration @xmath of\n@xmath , we can use the \u2018big\u2019 elements of the ultrafilter to declare the\ncorresponding sides of the finite order separations as \u2018big\u2019 (i.e.\norient the finite order separations such that their big sides induce\nelements of the ultrafilter). Then the principal ultrafilters on the\nnaturals induce precisely the end-tangles of this graph. Interestingly,\nit is not possible to describe the tangle compactification of this graph\nas an inverse limit of minors of @xmath (not even infinite ones), as\nlong as we deem the following premise meaningful:\n\nIf @xmath is an inverse system of minors @xmath of @xmath and for every\n@xmath there is a mapping @xmath such that @xmath is a homeomorphism,\nthen for every @xmath the map @xmath sends every ultrafilter tangle of\n@xmath to an infinite branch set of @xmath which is not included in some\n@xmath .\n\nNow if @xmath and @xmath are distinct non-principal ultrafilters on the\nnaturals, they induce distinct ultrafilter tangles @xmath and @xmath of\n@xmath . Since @xmath is injective, there is some @xmath in @xmath such\nthat @xmath sends the two ultrafilter tangles to different branch sets\nof @xmath . Since @xmath is a minor of @xmath , its branch sets are\nconnected, so by the premise they both meet in the centre vertex of the\ninfinite star, which contradicts the fact that distinct branch sets are\ndisjoint. Hence contracting non-connected sets of vertices in general\ncannot be avoided.\n\nBut perhaps we can use finite multigraphs instead? Indeed, this is\npossible, and as it will turn out there is an easy way to obtain such\nmultigraphs from ours. But making their edge sets finite comes at the\ncost of quality of life, which is why we forgo this option.\n\n#### 4.2 Setup\n\nGiven a graph @xmath , for every @xmath we denote by @xmath the set of\nall finite partitions of @xmath . Then we let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIf @xmath is in @xmath , we denote by @xmath the finite partition of\n@xmath induced by @xmath and the singleton subsets of @xmath . Letting\n@xmath whenever @xmath and @xmath refines @xmath defines a directed\npartial ordering on @xmath :\n\n###### Lemma 4.2.1.\n\n@xmath is a directed poset.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe poset properties are inherited from the subset and the refinement\nrelation; it remains to verify that @xmath is directed: For this, let\nany two elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath be given. First, we will\ndefine finite partitions @xmath and @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath\nand @xmath hold; but this is easy: Recall that the map @xmath sends\nevery component of @xmath to the unique component of @xmath containing\nit, so the preimage of every partition class @xmath of @xmath under\n@xmath consists precisely of those components of @xmath which are\nincluded in some component of @xmath that is also an element of @xmath .\nHence letting\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nwill do. Finally, choosing @xmath to be the coarsest refinement of\n@xmath and @xmath results in a finite partition of @xmath which\nsatisfies the two inequalities\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nso we are done by transitivity. \u220e\n\nNext we define the topological spaces of our inverse limit. For ever\n@xmath , we let @xmath be the multigraph on @xmath whose edges are\nprecisely the cross-edges of @xmath . The vertices of @xmath that are\nsingleton subsets @xmath of @xmath we consider to be vertices of @xmath\nand refer to them as @xmath ; the other vertices of @xmath are its dummy\nvertices \u00b2\u2075 \u00b2\u2075 25 This definition does not coincide with that of dummy\nvertices of the @xmath from the construction of @xmath in [ 13 , 5th\nedition] : e.g. if some @xmath is a singleton, but not a subset of\n@xmath , then @xmath is a dummy vertex here but a non-dummy vertex in [\n13 ] . . Now we let @xmath be the topological space obtained from the\nground set of the 1-complex of @xmath by endowing it with the topology\ngenerated by the following basis:\n\nFor inner edge points we choose the usual open neighbourhoods, and for\nvertices @xmath we choose as open neighbourhoods the sets of the form\n@xmath where the inner edge points @xmath may be chosen individually for\neach @xmath . Finally, for dummy vertices @xmath of @xmath we declare as\nopen the sets of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is some finite subset of @xmath , and for every @xmath the\npoint @xmath is an arbitrary inner edge point of @xmath while @xmath is\nthe endvertex of @xmath in @xmath . \u00b2\u2076 \u00b2\u2076 26 The purpose of @xmath is to\nmake our topological spaces T @xmath . Only allowing @xmath would also\nwork, but then our topological spaces are not T @xmath while the tangle\ncompactification is. This completes the definition of the basis.\n\nThe spaces @xmath are easily seen to be compact. To complete the setup\nof our inverse system, for all @xmath we choose the bonding map\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich sends the vertices of @xmath to the vertices of @xmath including\nthem; which is the identity on the interior of the edges of @xmath that\nare also edges of @xmath ; and which sends any other edge of @xmath to\nthe dummy vertex of @xmath that includes both its endvertices in @xmath\n. An easy proof by cases shows that these bonding maps are continuous.\n\u00b2\u2077 \u00b2\u2077 27 This is basically the definition of Diestel. Therefore, we\narrived at an inverse system @xmath , and we set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nBefore we verify that @xmath describes the tangle compactification, we\nintroduce some notation concerning @xmath : If @xmath is an open set in\n@xmath for some @xmath , then we denote by @xmath the open subset @xmath\nof @xmath where @xmath is the whole space @xmath for all @xmath except\nfor @xmath , which we choose to be @xmath . Given @xmath we define\n@xmath to be the continuous projection map\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFinally, whenever @xmath is an element of @xmath we denote @xmath by\n@xmath .\n\nBefore we verify that @xmath suits its purpose, we have a last look at\ntheir possibly infinite edge sets. Obviously, the multigraphs @xmath in\ngeneral are not finite, but their vertex set is finite. It is possible\nto turn these multigraphs into finite graphs, simply by deleting the\ninner edge points of edges incident with dummy vertices. If we then\nthink of these inner edge points as \u2018hidden\u2019 in the dummy vertices\nincident with the edges containing them, we can adjust the bonding maps\nso as to yield another inverse system whose inverse limit would still\ndescribe the tangle compactification. But obviously, the deletion of\nthese points renders this inverse system useless, since it contradicts\nour aim to improve everyone\u2019s quality of life. Therefore, we decided to\nkeep these points, and instead rely on the compactness of the spaces\n@xmath .\n\n#### 4.3 The homeomorphism\n\n###### Theorem 4.3.1.\n\nIf @xmath is an arbitrary infinite graph, then the tangle\ncompactification @xmath of @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe first task is to construct a bijection @xmath . For this, let an\narbitrary @xmath be given. We distinguish two cases:\n\nFirst assume that there is some @xmath such that @xmath is not a dummy\nvertex of @xmath , so @xmath is an element of @xmath or an inner edge\npoint of @xmath . In this case we let @xmath , which is a well defined\nchoice: If @xmath and @xmath are two such points we pick some @xmath .\nThen the point @xmath is not a dummy vertex either, so the definition of\n@xmath and @xmath implies @xmath .\n\nIn the second case, every @xmath is a dummy vertex. Then for every\n@xmath we let @xmath be the collection of all the sets @xmath for which\nthere is some finite partition @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath , and\nput @xmath . To complete the definition of @xmath , it remains to show\nthat @xmath is an element of @xmath . We start by verifying that\n\n###### Claim 1.\n\nThe @xmath are ultrafilters on @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nSince dummy vertices formally are non-empty sets of vertices, the empty\nset is not in @xmath .\n\nNext we show that, for every two elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath ,\nthe intersection @xmath is again an element of @xmath . Given two\nelements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath we choose witnesses @xmath and\n@xmath of @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Let @xmath be the coarsest\nrefinement of @xmath and @xmath , and let @xmath be the partition class\nsatisfying @xmath . Since @xmath and by compatibility, the only choice\nfor @xmath is the dummy vertex @xmath . Hence @xmath witnesses that\n@xmath is contained in @xmath .\n\nNow we show that @xmath is upwards closed. For this, let any @xmath be\ngiven together with a superset @xmath ; we have to show @xmath . Pick\nsome witness @xmath of @xmath and let @xmath be the coarsest refinement\nof @xmath and the bipartition @xmath of @xmath . Assume for a\ncontradiction that @xmath is not the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath .\nThen @xmath must be the dummy vertex @xmath since it is the only other\ndummy vertex of @xmath . Now let @xmath be the partition class of @xmath\nsatisfying @xmath . By compatibility we know that @xmath is a subset of\nboth @xmath and @xmath . But then, since @xmath is a subset of @xmath ,\nwe also know that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nholds, which is a contradiction since @xmath is non-empty.\n\nSo far we have seen that @xmath is a filter, so finally we verify that\n@xmath is a maximal one. For this, consider any bipartition @xmath of\n@xmath ; we show that exactly one of @xmath and @xmath is contained in\n@xmath . Since @xmath is a dummy vertex, we know that at least one of\n@xmath and @xmath is in @xmath , say @xmath . Now assume for a\ncontradiction that @xmath is contained in @xmath , too, witnessed by\nsome @xmath . Then @xmath refines the bipartition @xmath since @xmath is\na partition class of @xmath . In particular @xmath holds, and @xmath is\nthe dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath . But then, by definition of @xmath ,\nthe only possibility for @xmath is the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath ,\nwhich is a contradiction. \u220e\n\n###### Claim 2.\n\nFor all @xmath we have @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nLet @xmath be given. By Claim 1 both @xmath and @xmath are ultrafilters\non @xmath and @xmath , respectively, so @xmath is again an ultrafilter\non @xmath . Assume for a contradiction that @xmath and @xmath are\ndistinct, and pick some bipartition @xmath of @xmath with @xmath\ncontaining @xmath and @xmath containing @xmath . By definition of @xmath\nthere is some @xmath in @xmath witnessing @xmath , i.e. @xmath satisfies\n@xmath . Now choose witnesses @xmath and @xmath of @xmath and @xmath ,\nrespectively, and pick some @xmath in @xmath with @xmath . Since @xmath\nholds by definition and @xmath includes @xmath , the set @xmath is\nincluded in @xmath . But @xmath is the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath ,\nand @xmath is the dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath , so @xmath implies\n@xmath , and hence @xmath (by definition of @xmath and @xmath ) yields\nthe desired contradiction. \u220e\n\nTherefore, @xmath is indeed an element of @xmath and our construction of\n@xmath is complete. It remains to show that @xmath is bijective and\nbicontinuous; we begin with injectivity:\n\n###### Claim 3.\n\n@xmath is injective.\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be two distinct elements of @xmath with @xmath for\nsome @xmath . If @xmath and @xmath or vice versa, we are done, so\nsuppose that @xmath and @xmath either are both in @xmath or both in\n@xmath .\n\nFor the first case suppose that both @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath ,\nwitnessed by @xmath and @xmath , respectively, so neither of @xmath and\n@xmath is a dummy vertex. Pick some @xmath and note that, by definition\nof the bonding maps and well-definition of @xmath , we have @xmath as\nwell as @xmath . In particular, @xmath implies @xmath (again by\ndefinition of the bonding maps) and hence @xmath .\n\nFor the second case suppose that both @xmath and @xmath are elements of\n@xmath , and write @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath be the partition\nclasses of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Then in particular @xmath is\ncontained in @xmath and @xmath is contained in @xmath . Since @xmath and\n@xmath are disjoint, the ultrafilters @xmath and @xmath are distinct, so\n@xmath holds. \u220e\n\n###### Claim 4.\n\n@xmath is surjective.\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nLet any @xmath be given. If @xmath is not an element of @xmath we choose\nsome @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath is contained in the 1-complex of\n@xmath , and let @xmath . Then for every @xmath in @xmath we set @xmath\n, and for every @xmath for some such @xmath we put @xmath . Then @xmath\nis a well defined element of @xmath which @xmath sends to @xmath .\n\nOtherwise @xmath is in @xmath and of the form @xmath . For every @xmath\nthe ultrafilter @xmath chooses excatly one partition class @xmath of\n@xmath . Then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a well-defined point in @xmath : Assume for a contradiction that\nthere are some @xmath in @xmath with @xmath incompatible in @xmath in\nthat @xmath . Write @xmath and @xmath . Then the dummy vertex @xmath\nsatisfies\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich implies @xmath . Furthermore, using the definition of @xmath\nyields\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (3)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nSince @xmath and @xmath are both in @xmath it suffices to show that\nthese sets have empty intersection in order to yield a contradiction.\nFor this, let any @xmath be given. By definition of @xmath there is some\n@xmath with @xmath . Hence the component @xmath is not in @xmath , since\notherwise the vertices of @xmath would be contained in the left hand\nside of\u00a0( 3 ) which is empty, a contradiction. Thus @xmath and @xmath\nintersect emptily as desired. \u220e\n\nBy now we know that @xmath is a bijection. Before we verify that @xmath\nis also bicontinuous, let us quickly recall Lemma 2.2.5 : According to\nthis Lemma, the collection of all open sets of the form @xmath with\n@xmath some element of @xmath and @xmath some basic open set in @xmath\nis a basis of the topology of @xmath . Now that we know this basis, we\nare almost done:\n\n###### Claim 5.\n\n@xmath maps basic open sets of @xmath to basic open sets of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nLet any point @xmath of @xmath be given together with some basic open\nneighbourhood @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is not in @xmath we choose some @xmath in @xmath such that\n@xmath is contained in the 1-complex of @xmath , and set @xmath . Then\n@xmath is also a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath , so\n@xmath holds.\n\nOtherwise @xmath is an element of @xmath , so @xmath is of the form\n@xmath for some @xmath and some non-empty @xmath . Let @xmath and\nconsider the basic open neighbourhood @xmath of the dummy vertex @xmath\nin @xmath . Then one easily checks that @xmath holds. \u220e\n\n###### Claim 6.\n\n@xmath maps basic open sets of @xmath to open sets of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nLet any basic open set @xmath of @xmath be given and write @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is a basic open neighbourhood of some non-dummy point of\n@xmath , then @xmath is basic open in @xmath .\n\nOtherwise @xmath is of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is some dummy vertex of @xmath , the set @xmath is some\nfinite subset of @xmath , and for every @xmath the point @xmath is an\narbitrary inner edge point of @xmath while @xmath is the endvertex of\n@xmath in @xmath . Let @xmath be the partition class of @xmath with\n@xmath . Then\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\nwhich is open since the finitely many intervals @xmath are closed in\n@xmath . \u220e\n\nThis completes the proof that @xmath is a homeomorphism. \u220e\n\nFrom now on we treat @xmath as @xmath .\n\n### 5 A least tangle compactification\n\nWe call a compactification @xmath of (the 1-complex of) @xmath an @xmath\n-compactification of @xmath if @xmath is also a compactification of\n@xmath and @xmath is Hausdorff. Even though we speak of an @xmath\n-compactification \u2018of\u2019 @xmath , we formally treat it as a\ncompacitification of @xmath , e.g. if @xmath holds for another @xmath\n-compactification @xmath of @xmath , then any witness @xmath of this is\nrequired to fix @xmath as well as @xmath . Whenever @xmath is an @xmath\n-compactification of @xmath and @xmath is a singleton, we call @xmath a\none-point @xmath -compactification of @xmath . For every @xmath we\ndenote by @xmath the map sending each @xmath to the principal\nultrafilter on @xmath generated by @xmath . Furthermore, in this chapter\nevery @xmath carries the discrete topology.\n\n#### 5.1 Introduction\n\nAs the graph depicted in Fig. 3 (p. 3 ) shows, there exist graphs @xmath\nfor which @xmath is not the coarsest @xmath -compactification: Indeed,\nif @xmath is the graph from Fig. 3 , then @xmath has a one-point @xmath\n-compactification reflecting the structure of @xmath while @xmath adds\n@xmath many ultrafilter tangles to @xmath . But as a @xmath shows, it is\nnot always possible to just take the one-point @xmath -compactification\nof @xmath in order to obtain a strictly coarser \u00b2\u2078 \u00b2\u2078 28 By \u2018strictly\ncoarser\u2019 we mean \u2018coarser but not topologically equivalent\u2019. @xmath\n-compactification than @xmath , since @xmath does not even have a\none-point compactification (see Proposition 5.2.2 for a characterisation\nof the graphs @xmath admitting a one-point @xmath -compactification).\nHence Diestel [ 14 ] asked:\n\n1.  For which [graphs] @xmath is @xmath the coarsest [ @xmath\n    -]compactification [...]? \u00b2\u2079 \u00b2\u2079 29 In his paper, Diestel asked \u2018For\n    which @xmath is @xmath the coarsest compactification in which its\n    ends appear as distinct points?\u2019. In order to obviate coarser\n    versions of the topology of @xmath for some special @xmath from\n    leading this question ad absurdum, we interpreted it as stated in\n    (i).\n\n2.  If it is not, is there a unique such topology [i.e. @xmath\n    -compactification],\n    and is there a canonical way to obtain it from @xmath ?\n\nIn order to tackle these questions, we proceed as follows: In Section\n5.3 we construct for arbitrary @xmath an inverse system @xmath of T \u2082\n-compactifica-\ntions @xmath of the @xmath whose inverse limit @xmath we use to obtain\nan @xmath -compactification @xmath of @xmath in a similar way Diestel\nused @xmath to compactify @xmath . The purpose of @xmath on the one hand\nis to serve as a witness when we characterise those graphs @xmath for\nwhich @xmath is not the coarsest @xmath -compactification, and on the\nother hand it is our candidate for a positive answer regarding the first\npart of the second question. But we should have a closer look at the\nsecond question itself before we consider possible solutions.\n\nObviously, the second question tacitly assumes that any answer imposes\nsome further meaningful conditions on the @xmath -compactifications\nconsidered, as the example graph @xmath from Fig. 4 shows.\n\nBy Proposition 5.2.2 we know that this graph has a one-point @xmath\n-compactification, so @xmath clearly is not the coarsest @xmath\n-compactification of @xmath . But from an intuitive point of view, the\none-point @xmath -compactification of @xmath does not reflect the\nstructure of the graph at all. Instead of one point, three points as\nindicated by the grey ovals in the drawing feel far more intuitive.\nIndeed, if @xmath is one of @xmath and @xmath , then @xmath splits up\nthe drawing of the graph into a left hand side and a right hand side,\nwhich together induce a separation @xmath of the graph whose separator\nconsists precisely of @xmath .\n\nThe tangle compactification of @xmath respects @xmath and @xmath in that\nevery @xmath -tangle lives on precisely one side of each. Since the two\nseparations are nested, say @xmath as in the drawing, they partition\n@xmath into three classes @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Here, the tangles\nin @xmath are those living on the small side of @xmath , the tangles in\n@xmath are those living on the big side of @xmath , and the tangles in\n@xmath are those living in on the big side of @xmath and on the small\nside of @xmath . But @xmath and @xmath are not the only finite order\nseparations of @xmath with two infinite sides, so @xmath has more than\nthree @xmath -tangles. Hence our intuition suggests that some finite\norder separations reflect the structure of @xmath better than others. So\nwhat makes our two separations so special? The answer is rather simple:\nboth separations respect the @xmath -classes \u00b3\u2070 \u00b3\u2070 30 Recall that the\nequivalence relation @xmath was defined on @xmath by letting @xmath\nwhenever @xmath holds. which turn out to be @xmath , @xmath and @xmath .\nFurthermore, we have @xmath , and @xmath gives an indication that these\nmight be related; but this was to be expected somewhat (in fact, we will\nsee that the map @xmath defines a bijection between @xmath and @xmath ,\nsee Corollary 3.3.4 ).\n\nHere, my intuition tells me that it might be worth to have a closer look\nat the quotient @xmath . Surprisingly, I did not find graph theoretical\nindications substantiating my intuition, let alone graph theoretical\nreasons to consider certain @xmath -compactifications of @xmath\nrevealing @xmath as the coarsest one. That is why I try a more technical\napproach for a change. Remember that, on the one hand @xmath is a useful\ntechnical description of @xmath , but on the other hand @xmath can be\nunderstood as a generalisation of @xmath (with the ends viewed as\ndirections). Therefore, if we manage to abstract the essential ideas\nbehind the inverse system @xmath generalising @xmath , then this might\nlead to meaningful conditions regarding question (ii), and maybe @xmath\nturns out to be the coarsest @xmath -compactification satisfying these.\n\nFor this, let us take a closer look at how @xmath manages to induce an\n@xmath -compactification of @xmath . As is well known, @xmath is the\ninverse limit of the inverse system @xmath . Hence, if every @xmath is\nfinite, then @xmath is compact Hausdorff by Lemma 2.2.3 , and so is\n@xmath (Observation 2.5.1 ). But as soon as some @xmath is infinite, the\nspace @xmath is no longer compact. Let us have a closer look at the\ntangle compactification overcoming this hindrance. For every @xmath ,\nthe pair @xmath is the Stone-\u010cech Hausdorff compactification of @xmath ,\nso @xmath is compact Hausdorff by Lemma 2.2.3 . For @xmath , the space\n@xmath being compact in general does not imply that @xmath is compact,\ne.g. consider a @xmath . This is because every infinite @xmath gives\nrise to a \u2018bad\u2019 cover of @xmath consisting of open sets (one that has no\nfinite subcover). Since every @xmath is compact, this cannot possibly\nhappen in @xmath . Next, we investigate @xmath . The bonding maps @xmath\nof the inverse system @xmath by definition respect the bonding maps\n@xmath of the inverse system @xmath in that for all @xmath the diagram\n\n[]\n\ncommutes, so as a result @xmath includes a homeomorphic copy of @xmath .\nCapturing these properties formally leads us to the notion of a @xmath\n-system: A @xmath -system is an inverse system of Hausdorff\ncompactifications of the @xmath whose bonding maps respect the maps\n@xmath , and on the class of all @xmath -systems (for fixed @xmath ) we\ndefine a natural order-relation @xmath . We prove, making use of the\nfact that @xmath is the Stone-\u010cech Hausdorff compactification of @xmath\nfor every @xmath , that @xmath is the greatest @xmath -system with\nrespect to @xmath and up to @xmath -equivalence (this will be introduced\nformally in Section 5.4 ). Furthermore, every @xmath -system gives rise\nto an @xmath -compactification of @xmath in the same way @xmath yields\n@xmath . Hence the following two questions arise:\n\n1.  Is there a coarsest @xmath -compactification induced by a least\n    @xmath -system?\n\n2.  If there is, can it be used as a witness regarding question (i)?\n\nAs our first main result of this chapter, we will show in Theorem 5.4.10\nthat @xmath is indeed the least @xmath -system (up to @xmath\n-equivalence), and @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification of\n@xmath induced by a @xmath -system while @xmath is the finest @xmath\n-compactification of @xmath induced by a @xmath -system. This settles\nquestion (ii @xmath ).\n\nFurthermore, as our second main result of this chapter, we will show in\nTheorem 5.4.11 that @xmath and @xmath are topologically equivalent\n@xmath -compactifications if and only if every @xmath is finite. In\nparticular, @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification of the graph\n@xmath if and only if every @xmath is finite (i.e. @xmath coincides with\n@xmath ). This settles question (i) and (iii).\n\nIn Section 5.5 we show that @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath (the\nquotient we deemed worth a second look earlier) by a homeomorphism\nfixing @xmath , and we give a description of @xmath solely in terms of\ntangles. Together with the answer of (ii @xmath ) this settles question\n(ii).\n\nAs it turns out, it is even possible to describe @xmath using @xmath\n-tangles, simply by adjusting the underlying separation system (see\nSection 5.6 ).\n\nFinally, in Section 5.7 we show that there is an inverse subsystem of\nthe inverse system @xmath (from Chapter 4 ) whose inverse limit\ndescribes the space @xmath .\n\n#### 5.2 The one-point @xmath-compactification of @xmath\n\nIf @xmath is a graph, then @xmath is compact if and only if every @xmath\nis finite (Observation 2.5.1 ). Hence @xmath has a trivial @xmath\n-compactification if and only if every @xmath is finite. Now if @xmath\nis a graph with not all @xmath finite, then @xmath in general does not\nhave a one-point @xmath -compactification. In this section we\ncharacterise the graphs @xmath admitting a one-point @xmath\n-compactification.\n\nRecall that by Theorem 2.4.14 a topological space @xmath has a one-point\nHausdorff compactification if and only if @xmath is locally compact and\nHausdorff, but not compact. We start with a characterisation of the\ngraphs admitting a locally compact end space:\n\n###### Lemma 5.2.1.\n\nFor every graph @xmath the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  @xmath is a locally compact subspace of @xmath .\n\n2.   For every end @xmath of @xmath there is some @xmath such that for\n    all @xmath only finitely many components @xmath of @xmath with\n    @xmath contain ends of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(i) @xmath (ii). Assume for a contradiction that there is some end\n@xmath of @xmath for which (ii) fails. Since @xmath is locally compact,\nwe find some compact @xmath together with an open neighbourhood @xmath\nof @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath . Without loss of generality @xmath\nis induced by a basic open neighbourhood @xmath for some @xmath . Since\n(ii) fails for @xmath we find some @xmath such that infinitely many\ncomponents @xmath of @xmath with @xmath contain at least one end of\n@xmath . Then the collection @xmath is an open cover of @xmath which has\nno finite subcover of @xmath . In particular, it is an open cover of\n@xmath that has no finite subcover, contradicting the compactness of\n@xmath .\n\n(ii) @xmath (i). In order to show that @xmath is locally compact, let\n@xmath be an end of @xmath . Our task is to find a compact neighbourhood\nof @xmath in @xmath . Let @xmath for some @xmath as in (ii), and note\nthat @xmath is a closed neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath . For every\n@xmath let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ncarry the discrete topology and note that @xmath is finite and non-empty\nby choice of @xmath . Then by Lemma 2.2.3 the inverse system @xmath has\na compact inverse limit @xmath whose elements extend precisely to the\nends of @xmath in @xmath . In particular, it is easy to see that @xmath\nand @xmath are even homeomorphic, so @xmath is compact as desired. \u220e\n\nAs the following example shows, a locally compact end space in general\ndoes not suffice to ensure the existence of a one-point @xmath\n-compactification of @xmath : indeed, if @xmath is the graph depicted in\nFig. 32 , then @xmath obviously is not compact, and every open\nneighbourhood of the sole end of the graph includes a copy of @xmath .\nHence @xmath and @xmath are not locally compact at the sole end of the\ngraph, so @xmath has no one-point Hausdorff compactification by Theorem\n2.4.14 .\n\n###### Proposition 5.2.2.\n\nFor every graph @xmath the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  @xmath has a one-point @xmath -compactification.\n\n2.   There is some @xmath with @xmath infinite and for every end @xmath\n    of @xmath there is some @xmath such that for all @xmath the set\n    @xmath is finite.\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(i) @xmath (ii). If @xmath is a one-point @xmath -compactification of\n@xmath , then @xmath is a one-point Hausdorff compactification of @xmath\n. It follows from Theorem 2.4.14 that @xmath is locally compact but not\ncompact, so Observation 2.5.1 implies that there is some @xmath with\n@xmath infinite. Now assume for a contradiction that there is some\n@xmath not satisfying the condition from (ii). Since @xmath is locally\ncompact, we find a compact neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath .\nPick a basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath with @xmath .\nSince (ii) fails, there is some @xmath with @xmath infinite. Then the\ncollection\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a cover of @xmath of open sets which has no finite subcover of @xmath\n, contradicting the compactness of @xmath .\n\n(ii) @xmath (i). Since there is some @xmath with @xmath infinite, we\nknow that @xmath is not compact. Let @xmath be a point that is not in\n@xmath , and extend @xmath to a topological space @xmath by declaring as\nopen for every @xmath and @xmath the set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhenever @xmath is cofinite in @xmath and the set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis included in @xmath , and taking on @xmath the topology this\ngenerates. To see that this yields a topology, it suffices to show that\nfor every two open neighbourhoods @xmath and @xmath of @xmath there is\nsome open neighbourhood of @xmath included in their intersection. Due to\n@xmath we know that @xmath is cofinite in @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath\nfollows from @xmath and the choice of @xmath . Similarly, @xmath is\ncofinite in @xmath and @xmath , so\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nholds as desired. Clearly, @xmath is a dense subspace of @xmath .\nFurthermore, @xmath is Hausdorff: For this, let @xmath be an end of\n@xmath , and pick @xmath as in (ii). Then @xmath and @xmath are disjoint\nopen neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath , respectively. For other\npoints this is clear, so @xmath is Hausdorff as claimed. It remains to\nshow that @xmath is compact. For this, let @xmath be an arbitrary open\nneighbourhood of @xmath . It suffices to show that @xmath is compact.\nLet @xmath . Clearly, @xmath is homeomorphic to @xmath , so it suffices\nto show that @xmath is compact. Since @xmath is included in @xmath and\n@xmath is finite, for every @xmath the set @xmath is also finite. Hence\n@xmath is compact by Observation 2.5.1 as desired. \u220e\n\n#### 5.3 An inverse limit of Hausdorff compactifications\n\nIn order to create a coarser @xmath -compactification than @xmath , we\ncreate an inverse system @xmath of Hausdorff compactifications @xmath of\nthe @xmath , which we then use to obtain an @xmath -compactification\n@xmath of @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is a set, then we denote by @xmath the cofinite filter on\n@xmath . Recall that for two sets @xmath with @xmath we denote by @xmath\nthe collection of all supersets @xmath of elements of @xmath , and we\ncall @xmath the set-theoretic up-closure of @xmath in @xmath . Now we\nstart the construction: For every @xmath and every @xmath let @xmath be\nthe set-theoretic up-closure of @xmath in @xmath , i.e.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn particular, @xmath is again a filter on @xmath . Recall that, for\nevery @xmath , we chose @xmath to be the function with domain @xmath\nwhich sends every @xmath to the principal ultrafilter on @xmath\ngenerated by @xmath . Write\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nWe endow the spaces @xmath with the standard topology whose basic open\nsets are of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\none for each @xmath . This topology has a basis which suits our needs\nfar better: For every @xmath let @xmath be the collection of all\nsingleton subsets of @xmath and all sets @xmath which are cofinite in\n@xmath for some @xmath . Let @xmath be the collection of all sets @xmath\nwith @xmath . Then\n\n###### Lemma 5.3.1.\n\n@xmath is a basis for the topology of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nGiven @xmath and @xmath with @xmath we have to find some @xmath with\n@xmath . If @xmath holds for some @xmath , then we may choose @xmath as\n@xmath . Otherwise @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . Then\n@xmath implies that @xmath is cofinite in @xmath , so we may pick @xmath\n. \u220e\n\nWhenever we speak of a basic open neighbourhood of some element of\n@xmath , we mean \u2018basic\u2019 with respect to @xmath .\n\nThe @xmath compactify the @xmath as promised:\n\n###### Lemma 5.3.2.\n\n@xmath is a Hausdorff compactification of @xmath , for every @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nSince we equipped @xmath with the discrete topology and @xmath also\ninduces the discrete topology on @xmath , the map @xmath clearly is an\nembedding. Clearly, @xmath is dense in @xmath , and @xmath is Hausdorff\nsince for every two distinct @xmath and @xmath in @xmath we have @xmath\n. Finally we show that @xmath is compact: Let @xmath be any cover of\n@xmath by open sets @xmath . For every @xmath pick some @xmath such that\n@xmath and note that @xmath is finite. Hence @xmath is finite, and we\nare done. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.3.3.\n\nThe spaces @xmath are totally disconnected.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath be a subset of @xmath with @xmath . Pick two distinct\nelements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath . If one of @xmath and @xmath is\nprincipal, say @xmath for some @xmath , the open sets @xmath and @xmath\ninduce an open bipartition of @xmath . Otherwise we find distinct\nelements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Then the\nopen sets @xmath and @xmath induce an open bipartition of @xmath . \u220e\n\nIn order to obtain an inverse system @xmath from the spaces @xmath we\ndefine compatible bonding maps @xmath for all @xmath as follows: Let\n@xmath be given.\n\nSuppose first that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . Then\nwe put @xmath , i.e. @xmath where @xmath is the unique component of\n@xmath including @xmath .\n\nFor the second case suppose that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some\n@xmath . If @xmath holds, then we also have @xmath witnessed by @xmath ,\nso we may put @xmath . Otherwise @xmath implies that there is some\nunique component @xmath of @xmath including @xmath since every vertex in\n@xmath has a neighbour in each element of @xmath , so we put @xmath .\nThis completes the definition of the bonding maps. It remains to show\nthat they are continuous:\n\n###### Lemma 5.3.4.\n\nThe bonding maps @xmath are continuous.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath be given together with some basic open neighbourhood @xmath\nof @xmath .\n\nSuppose first that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath , and\nhence @xmath is of the form @xmath for @xmath . Then @xmath is an open\nneighbourhood of @xmath which @xmath maps to @xmath .\n\nFor the second case suppose that @xmath for some @xmath . If @xmath then\nthere exists a unique component @xmath of @xmath including @xmath , so\n@xmath is of the form @xmath . In particular, @xmath is an open\nneighbourhood of @xmath which @xmath maps to @xmath . Otherwise @xmath\nholds, then we have @xmath and moreover @xmath is a cofinite subset of\n@xmath since @xmath is basic open. In particular, @xmath is a cofinite\nsubset of @xmath with @xmath . Hence @xmath is an open neighbourhood of\n@xmath which @xmath maps into @xmath . \u220e\n\nTherefore, @xmath is an inverse system, and we write\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Proposition 5.3.5.\n\nThe topological space @xmath is compact, Hausdorff and totally\ndisconnected.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAccording to Lemmas 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 the topological spaces @xmath are\ncompact, Hausdorff and totally disconnected. By Lemma 2.2.2 , so is\n@xmath . \u220e\n\nAnalogously to [ 14 , Lemma 3.2] , we note a very useful fact:\n\n###### Lemma 5.3.6.\n\nFor all @xmath the map @xmath restricts to a bijection between @xmath\nand @xmath with inverse @xmath .\u220e\n\n###### Corollary 5.3.7.\n\nFor every @xmath , each @xmath uniquely extends to an element of @xmath\n.\u220e\n\nFor every @xmath let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ni.e. @xmath is in @xmath if and only if there is some @xmath with @xmath\n. The following is immediate from Lemma 5.3.6 and Corollary 5.3.7 :\n\n###### Proposition 5.3.8.\n\nIf @xmath is not in @xmath , then the set @xmath has a least element\n@xmath such that @xmath . The set @xmath determines @xmath , and @xmath\nholds for every @xmath . Furthermore, for every @xmath there is a unique\n@xmath with @xmath . This defines a bijection @xmath .\u220e\n\nFinally, we use @xmath to compactifiy @xmath in the same way Diestel\nused @xmath to compactify @xmath . For this, let @xmath send each @xmath\nto @xmath , i.e. @xmath is the restriction of the @xmath th projection\nmap @xmath to @xmath . By Lemma 2.2.5 and Lemma 5.3.1 , the collection\nof all sets of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwith @xmath and @xmath forms a basis for the topology of @xmath . Now\nconsider the 1-complex of @xmath and extend its topology to the\ntopological space\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nby declaring as open, for every @xmath and @xmath , the set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand taking the topology on @xmath this generates. Here, the graph @xmath\ncarries the 1-complex topology. Note that the subspace topology on\n@xmath is our original topology on @xmath . Let @xmath denote the basis\nwe used for @xmath . That @xmath is indeed an @xmath -compactification\nof @xmath will follow from the more general Theorems 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 .\n\n#### 5.4 @xmath-compactifications induced by @xmath-systems\n\nIn this section we study @xmath -systems which generalise the known\nconcepts of directions and the inverse systems @xmath and @xmath from\nthe previous section. Furthermore, we study @xmath -compactifications\ninduced by @xmath -systems in order to answer questions (i) and (ii\n@xmath ) from the introduction of this chapter.\n\nFix any infinite graph @xmath . For every @xmath denote by @xmath the\nset of all components of @xmath whose neighbourhood is not in @xmath ,\ni.e.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand note that this set must be finite due to pigeonhole principle. If\n@xmath is a Hausdorff compactification of @xmath for every @xmath and\n@xmath is an inverse system whose bonding maps respect the maps @xmath\nin that\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (4)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nholds for all @xmath , i.e. the diagram\n\n[]\n\ncommutes, then we call @xmath a @xmath - system (of @xmath ). Note that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a @xmath -system by Lemmas 5.3.2 and 5.3.4 , and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a @xmath -system, too. If every @xmath is finite, then @xmath is a\n@xmath -system, too. As our first main result of this section, we\ngeneralise Diestel\u2019s construction of the tangle compactification and\nshow that every @xmath -system gives rise to an @xmath -compactification\nof the graph @xmath :\n\nIf @xmath is a @xmath -system, put @xmath and for every @xmath let\n@xmath be the restriction of the @xmath th projection map @xmath .\nClearly, @xmath is continuous. If clear from context, we write @xmath\ninstead of @xmath . Now we extend @xmath (viewed as 1-complex) to a\ntopological space @xmath by declaring as open, for all @xmath and every\nopen set @xmath of @xmath , the set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath , and taking the topology on @xmath this generates.\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.1.\n\nIf @xmath is any infinite graph, then @xmath is an @xmath\n-compactification of @xmath . In particular, so are @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nFirst, we show that @xmath is dense in @xmath . Every open neighbourhood\nof an element of @xmath is of the form @xmath . Since @xmath is a dense\nsubset of @xmath , we know that @xmath meets @xmath , and hence @xmath\nmeets @xmath . In particular, @xmath meets @xmath , so @xmath is dense\nin @xmath .\n\nNext, we show that @xmath is compact. For this, we mimic the proof of [\n14 , Theorem 1 (i)] , replacing [ 14 , Lemmas 2.3 and 3.7] by\ntopological arguments. Hence consider any cover @xmath of @xmath by open\nsets @xmath . Since the subspace topology of @xmath is the original\ntopology of @xmath and @xmath is compact by Lemma 2.2.3 , the cover\n@xmath has a finite subset of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n(with @xmath finite) that covers @xmath . Our aim is to show that @xmath\nis the 1-complex of a finite graph: then @xmath will be compact as\ndesired. For this, put @xmath , and for each @xmath let @xmath be the\nopen set @xmath of @xmath . We claim that for each @xmath the inclusion\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (5)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nholds: Indeed,\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (6)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nholds by choice of @xmath and since the diagram\n\n[]\n\ncommutes. According to the definitions of @xmath and @xmath , and due to\n@xmath , it remains to show that @xmath holds. Using\u00a0( 4 ), this is\neasily calculated:\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n              @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nHence ( 5 ) holds as claimed, and the sets @xmath still cover @xmath\nby\u00a0( 6 ). Now consider the set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIf @xmath is finite, then so is @xmath , and we are done. Hence we\nassume for a contradiction that @xmath is infinite. Consider the closed\nset\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand for every @xmath set @xmath . In particular, every @xmath is closed\nin @xmath , and hence compact. Furthermore, since @xmath is infinite,\neach @xmath is non-empty. Together with @xmath and\u00a0( 4 ), this implies\nthat every @xmath is non-empty. By Lemma 2.2.3 we find an element in the\ninverse limit of the inverse system @xmath , which is easily extended to\nan element @xmath of @xmath since @xmath is cofinal in @xmath . In\nparticular, @xmath is a contradiction. Thus @xmath is compact, so in\nparticular @xmath is a compactification of (the 1-complex of) @xmath .\n\nSince @xmath is also Hausdorff by Lemma 2.2.3 , it is easy to see that\nso is @xmath . It remains to show that @xmath is a compactification of\n@xmath . We have already seen that @xmath is compact and @xmath is dense\nin @xmath . By ( 4 ) and abuse of notation we may assume @xmath . Hence\nit suffices to show that @xmath induces the right subspace topology on\n@xmath . For every @xmath and @xmath the open neighbourhood @xmath of\n@xmath in @xmath induces on @xmath the basic open neighbourhood @xmath\nof @xmath . Conversely, it is easy to see that every open set @xmath of\n@xmath induces on @xmath a set that is also open in @xmath . Therefore,\n@xmath is a subspace of @xmath . \u220e\n\nIn particular, we obtain the following analogue of [ 14 , Theorem 1] for\n@xmath :\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.2.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph.\n\n1.  @xmath is an @xmath -compactification of @xmath and @xmath is\n    totally disconnected.\n\n2.   If @xmath is locally finite and connected, then @xmath holds and\n    @xmath coincides with the Freudenthal compactification of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(i) By Theorem 5.4.1 we know that @xmath is an @xmath -compactification\nof @xmath , and @xmath is totally disconnected by Proposition 5.3.5 .\n\n(ii) If @xmath is locally finite, then @xmath is empty, so @xmath holds.\n\u220e\n\nIn order to compare @xmath -systems, we introduce the following notion:\nIf @xmath and @xmath are two @xmath -systems we write @xmath whenever\n@xmath holds for every @xmath (witnessed by unique @xmath , see Lemma\n2.4.12 ) and\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (7)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nholds for all @xmath . Condition ( 7 ) together with condition ( 4 )\nensures that the diagram\n\n[]\n\ncommutes for all @xmath , so that the mapping\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath            @xmath   @xmath      (8)\n              @xmath   @xmath               \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -- -----\n\nis a well-defined continuous surjection by Lemma 2.2.7 . Furthermore,\nthis yields\n\n###### Lemma 5.4.3.\n\nIf @xmath and @xmath are two @xmath -systems with @xmath and @xmath\ninduces the @xmath -compactification @xmath of @xmath whereas @xmath\ninduces the @xmath -compactification @xmath of @xmath , then @xmath is\nwitnessed by @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nPut @xmath . By ( 4 ) we know that @xmath fixes @xmath (by abuse of\nnotation). Clearly, it suffices to show that @xmath is continuous at\nevery @xmath (recall that @xmath ). For this, consider any basic open\nneighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , and recall that @xmath is\nopen in @xmath . By definition of @xmath we have @xmath . Since @xmath\nis continuous, we find some open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in\n@xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath is an open neighbourhood of @xmath in\n@xmath . Hence it suffices to show that @xmath maps it to @xmath . By\nchoice of @xmath and definition of @xmath we know that @xmath sends the\nopen subset @xmath of @xmath to the open subset @xmath of @xmath , so by\ndefinition of @xmath and @xmath is suffices to show @xmath . But this is\nclear from @xmath combined with the commuting diagram\n\n[]\n\n(recall that it commutes since @xmath witnesses @xmath ). \u220e\n\nIf both @xmath and @xmath hold, we say that @xmath and @xmath are @xmath\n- equivalent . The following lemma and corollary indicate that this\ndefinition is meaningful:\n\n###### Lemma 5.4.4.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be two @xmath -systems with @xmath and @xmath .\nFor every @xmath suppose that\n\n1.  @xmath witnesses @xmath , and\n\n2.  @xmath witnesses @xmath .\n\nLet @xmath be as in ( 8 ), and let @xmath be defined analogously using\nthe @xmath instead of the @xmath . Then @xmath is a homeomorphism with\ninverse @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nFor every @xmath Lemma 2.4.10 yields that @xmath is a homeomorphism, and\nby Lemma 2.4.12 we know that @xmath must be its inverse. In particular,\nevery @xmath is injective, and so must be @xmath . Furthermore, we\nalready know that @xmath is also a continuous surjection. Similarly,\n@xmath is a continuous bijection, and @xmath is its continuous inverse.\n\u220e\n\n###### Corollary 5.4.5.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be two @xmath -equivalent @xmath -systems. Let\n@xmath and @xmath be the two @xmath -compactifications of @xmath induced\nby @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Then @xmath and @xmath are\ntopologically equivalent, witnessed by the homeomorphism @xmath with\ninverse @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nCombine Lemmas 5.4.4 and 5.4.3 . \u220e\n\nAt first glance condition ( 7 ) complicates the definition of @xmath for\n@xmath -systems a lot, giving us a hard time working with it.\nSurprisingly, the following Lemma takes this extra work load off our\nshoulders:\n\n###### Lemma 5.4.6.\n\nSuppose that @xmath and @xmath are two @xmath -systems with @xmath\n(witnessed by @xmath ) for all @xmath . Then ( 7 ) holds for all @xmath\n.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nRecall that for every @xmath the witness @xmath satisfies @xmath . Hence\nfor every @xmath we compute:\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nThus both sides of ( 7 ) agree on @xmath , so by Lemma 2.4.4 they agree\non all of @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.7.\n\nIf @xmath is an infinite graph, then the following hold:\n\n1.   For every @xmath we have @xmath .\n\n2.  @xmath .\n\n3.  @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(i). This is immediate from Lemma 2.4.15 . For further insight, a\nconstructive proof follows:\n\nLet any @xmath be given and define @xmath as follows: If @xmath is\nprincipal we set @xmath . Otherwise @xmath is non-principal, so @xmath\nholds for exactly one @xmath due to\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand since @xmath is finite. Hence, we set @xmath .\n\nIt remains to verify that @xmath is continuous: For this, consider any\n@xmath together with some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in\n@xmath . If @xmath is generated by some @xmath with @xmath , then @xmath\nis a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath which @xmath maps to\n@xmath . Otherwise @xmath is non-principal there is some @xmath with\n@xmath and @xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath , so @xmath maps @xmath\nto @xmath as desired. Thus @xmath is continuous as desired.\n\n(ii) is immediate from (i) and Lemma 5.4.6 .\n\n(iii) is immediate from (ii) and Lemma 5.4.3 . \u220e\n\nNext, we prove two technical Lemmas, which we then combine in Theorem\n5.4.10 in order to show that @xmath is the least @xmath -system (with\nrespect to @xmath ).\n\n###### Lemma 5.4.8.\n\nLet @xmath be given together with a compactification @xmath of @xmath\nand suppose that\n\n  -- -------- -- -----\n     @xmath      (9)\n  -- -------- -- -----\n\nholds for all @xmath . Then @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nTo construct a witness @xmath of @xmath , we proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, we write @xmath (recall that @xmath is the set of all components\nof @xmath whose neighbourhood is not in @xmath ), and for every @xmath\nwe put\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a finite partition of @xmath into closed\u2014and hence clopen\u2014subsets.\nSimilarly, we write @xmath , and for every @xmath we set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwith the closure taken in @xmath . Since @xmath is finite and @xmath is\nHausdorff, we know that @xmath is closed in @xmath . Hence ( 9 ) yields\nthat\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a finite partition of @xmath into closed\u2014and hence clopen\u2014subsets.\n\nNext, we define mappings whose union we will take as @xmath in the end.\nLet @xmath map @xmath to @xmath for each @xmath , and note that @xmath\nis continuous since @xmath carries the discrete subspace topology. Since\nfor every @xmath the pair @xmath is the one-point Hausdorff\ncompactification of @xmath (equipped with the discrete subspace topology\ninherited from @xmath ) and @xmath is a Hausdorff compactification of\n@xmath , by Lemma 2.4.13 we have\n\n  -- -------- -- ------\n     @xmath      (10)\n  -- -------- -- ------\n\nwitnessed by some @xmath . Since @xmath carries the subspace topology of\n@xmath , we may widen the codomain of @xmath to @xmath without losing\ncontinuity. Finally, we take @xmath to be the union of @xmath and the\nall of the @xmath . By Lemma 2.4.5 we know that @xmath is continuous. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.4.9.\n\nLet @xmath be a @xmath -system and let @xmath be such that @xmath holds\nfor all @xmath . Then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nholds for all @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume for a contradiction that there is a pair @xmath with\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen one of @xmath and @xmath is non-empty, so without loss of\ngenerality we find some @xmath . Set @xmath . Then @xmath holds by\nassumption, witnessed by some @xmath . By choice of @xmath and @xmath we\nmay pick some @xmath (with the closure taken in @xmath ). Now put @xmath\n. Since @xmath is continuous, Lemma 2.4.2 implies\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n(with the closures taken in @xmath ). Using ( 4 ) yields\n\n  -- -------- -- ------\n     @xmath      (11)\n  -- -------- -- ------\n\nBy choice of @xmath and @xmath there exists a unique component @xmath of\n@xmath including @xmath , i.e. with @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath implies\n@xmath . Hence, combining ( 11 ) with @xmath yields\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nBut then @xmath implies @xmath since @xmath is Hausdorff. Recall that\n@xmath is an isolated point of @xmath , witnessed by the open\nneighbourhood @xmath . Put @xmath and note that this is open in @xmath\nsince @xmath is continuous. Moreover, @xmath together with Lemma 2.4.11\n(i)\u00a0and\u00a0(ii) yields @xmath . In particular, @xmath is also isolated in\n@xmath , witnessed by @xmath . Due to @xmath we have @xmath , and\nfurthermore @xmath yields @xmath (recall @xmath ). Hence @xmath follows.\nMoreover, since @xmath is isolated in @xmath , we even have @xmath ,\nwitnessed by @xmath , contradicting our choice of @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.10.\n\nFor every infinite @xmath the following hold up to @xmath -\/topological\nequivalence:\n\n1.  @xmath is the least @xmath -system (with respect to @xmath ).\n\n2.  @xmath is the greatest @xmath -system (with respect to @xmath ).\n\n3.  @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification of @xmath induced by\n    a @xmath -system.\n\n4.  @xmath is the finest @xmath -compactification of @xmath induced by a\n    @xmath -system.\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(i). Assume for a contradiction that there is another @xmath -system\n@xmath with @xmath . Write @xmath . Due to Lemma 5.4.6 we find some\nminimal @xmath with @xmath . By Lemma 5.4.8 there exist @xmath in @xmath\nwith\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ncontradicting Lemma 5.4.9 by choice of @xmath .\n\n(ii). Let @xmath be any @xmath -system. Since @xmath is the Stone-\u010cech\nHausdorff compactification of @xmath for every @xmath , Lemma 2.4.15\nyields @xmath for every @xmath . Thus Lemma 5.4.6 implies @xmath .\n\n(iii) and (iv) are immediate from Lemma 5.4.3 combined with (i) and\n(ii), respectively. \u220e\n\nSince we now know that @xmath is the coarsest @xmath -compactification\nof @xmath induced by a @xmath -system while @xmath is the finest one,\nthe question for a characterisation of those graphs with @xmath and\n@xmath being topologically equivalent immediately comes to mind.\n\n###### Theorem 5.4.11.\n\nFor every infinite @xmath the following are equivalent:\n\n1.   The @xmath -compactifications @xmath and @xmath of @xmath are\n    topologically equivalent.\n\n2.  @xmath and @xmath are @xmath -equivalent.\n\n3.   Every @xmath is finite.\n\n4.  @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBoth (iv) @xmath (iii) and (iii) @xmath (ii) are clear, whereas (ii)\n@xmath (i) holds by Corollary 5.4.5 . Hence it suffices to show (i)\n@xmath (iii).\n\n(i) @xmath (iii). Assume for a contradicting that (iii) fails, witnessed\nby some @xmath with @xmath infinite. Then @xmath is finite while @xmath\nis infinite, so @xmath is impossible. Let @xmath be a homeomorphism\nwitnessing (i). To yield a contradiction, we will use @xmath to find a\nwitness of @xmath .\n\nFor every @xmath let @xmath be a witness of @xmath (which exists by\nTheorem 5.4.7 ). Furthermore, let @xmath be obtained from the @xmath as\nin ( 8 ), i.e. by setting\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor every @xmath , and recall that this is a well-defined continuous\nsurjection by Lemma 5.4.6 . By Lemma 5.4.3 , the map @xmath witnesses\n@xmath . In particular, @xmath witnesses @xmath . Since so does @xmath ,\nLemma 2.4.12 yields @xmath . In particular, @xmath is bijective.\n\nPut @xmath and note @xmath by Lemma 2.4.11 . Next, we use the\ninjectivity of @xmath to yield that @xmath is injective. Assume for a\ncontradiction that @xmath is not injective, so there exist @xmath in\n@xmath with @xmath for some @xmath . By Corollary 2.3.2 , both @xmath\nand @xmath uniquely extend to elements @xmath and @xmath of @xmath ,\nrespectively. By Corollary 5.3.7 , @xmath uniquely extends to an element\n@xmath of @xmath . Since @xmath is unique, every other @xmath satisfies\n@xmath . Thus @xmath combined with the definition of @xmath forces\n@xmath and @xmath , contradicting the injectivity of @xmath . Hence\n@xmath is injective as claimed.\n\nTogether with @xmath this yields that @xmath is injective. Since @xmath\nis also a continuous surjection by Lemma 2.4.11 , and both @xmath and\n@xmath are compact Hausdorff, it follows from general topology that\n@xmath is a homeomorphism. In particular, the inverse of @xmath\nwitnesses @xmath , the desired contradiction. \u220e\n\n#### 5.5 A natural quotient of the tangle compactification\n\nIn this section, we show that @xmath is homeomorphic to the quotient\nspace @xmath , but first we describe @xmath in terms of tangles.\n\nRecall that we defined the equivalence relation @xmath on @xmath by\nletting @xmath whenever @xmath holds. Via the natural correspondence\nbetween @xmath and @xmath , this induces an equivalence relation @xmath\non @xmath (here we distinguish between elements of @xmath and elements\nof @xmath ). Since @xmath originally only served as a technical tool to\nhelp us better understand the ultrafilter tangles, we wish to be able to\ndescribe the @xmath -classes in terms of tangles. For this, we\ninvestigate the following natural class of stars: For every @xmath and\n@xmath define\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand put\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nNext, we will use these stars to describe @xmath (for @xmath ) in terms\nof tangles:\n\n###### Lemma 5.5.1.\n\nFor every @xmath we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn particular, @xmath is the unique minimal @xmath with @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nIt suffices to show @xmath .\n\nFor the forward inclusion let any @xmath with @xmath be given. Then\n@xmath is non-principal: Otherwise @xmath is generated by some @xmath\nwith @xmath , so @xmath implies @xmath , and hence @xmath is a\ncontradiction. Therefore, @xmath implies @xmath .\n\nFor the backward inclusion let any @xmath be given. Since @xmath is\nnon-principal, we know that @xmath holds for every @xmath . In\nparticular we have @xmath for every @xmath , and therefore @xmath holds\nas desired. \u220e\n\nThus @xmath can be described solely in terms of tangles, as desired.\nNext, we compute loads of technical Lemmas leading to an explicit\ndescription of a basis of the quotient topology of @xmath .\n\nLet @xmath be any graph. Define @xmath by setting @xmath and letting\n@xmath map each @xmath to @xmath (where @xmath is as in Proposition\n5.3.8 )\n\n###### Proposition 5.5.2.\n\nThe map @xmath is a well defined bijection between @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe map @xmath is well defined by Lemma 3.3.2 . Clearly, it suffices to\nshow that @xmath is bijective, which is the case by Proposition 5.3.8\nand Corollary 3.3.4 . \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.5.3.\n\nFor every @xmath and @xmath with @xmath there is a unique component\n@xmath of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy Lemma 3.3.6 the set @xmath meets at most one component of @xmath .\nSince @xmath holds, @xmath meets exactly one component @xmath of @xmath\n. Set @xmath . Then by Lemma 3.3.2 , @xmath is in @xmath and @xmath is\nin @xmath . Hence @xmath is in @xmath , so @xmath holds. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.5.4.\n\nFor every @xmath and @xmath the set @xmath is closed under the\nequivalence relation @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet any @xmath be given together with some @xmath . In particular @xmath\nholds, so by Lemma 5.5.3 there exist for both @xmath and @xmath unique\ncomponents @xmath and @xmath of @xmath , respectively, with @xmath and\n@xmath as well as @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath meets both @xmath and\n@xmath , the uniqueness of @xmath implies @xmath . Furthermore @xmath\nfollows since otherwise @xmath and @xmath would be disjoint elements of\n@xmath , which is impossible. Hence @xmath holds. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.5.5.\n\nLet @xmath , @xmath and @xmath be given. Furthermore, suppose that\n@xmath is cofinite in @xmath with @xmath . Then we have @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume for a contradiction that @xmath is distinct from @xmath . By\nLemma 3.3.2 we have @xmath . Now @xmath implies that @xmath is disjoint\nfrom @xmath , and hence from @xmath , a contradiction. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.5.6.\n\nFor all @xmath , every @xmath and each cofinite subset @xmath of @xmath\nthe set @xmath is closed under @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nPut @xmath . First, we show that @xmath is closed under @xmath . For\nthis, let any @xmath be given together with any @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath holds, then @xmath is generated by some @xmath with @xmath a\ncomponent of @xmath , and @xmath implies @xmath . In particular we have\n@xmath , so Lemma 5.5.4 implies @xmath and we are done.\n\nOtherwise @xmath holds, so @xmath together with Lemma 5.5.5 implies\n@xmath . Hence @xmath follows from Lemma 3.3.2 and @xmath . Therefore,\n@xmath is closed under @xmath .\n\nSince @xmath is cofinite in @xmath we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich is closed under @xmath since @xmath is closed under @xmath and the\n@xmath are also closed under @xmath by Lemma 5.5.4 . \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.5.7.\n\nFor every @xmath the set @xmath is closed in @xmath . In particular,\n@xmath is a compact subset of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nClearly, the closure of @xmath avoids @xmath . It remains to show that\nno @xmath lies in the closure of @xmath . If we have @xmath , then\n@xmath avoids @xmath since for every @xmath the ultrafilter @xmath is\nnon-principal. Otherwise we have @xmath , so @xmath with @xmath avoids\n@xmath since @xmath and @xmath are disjoint due to @xmath . Thus @xmath\nis a closed subset of the compact space @xmath and hence also compact. \u220e\n\nLet @xmath be the collection of all basic open sets of the 1-complex\ntopology of @xmath , all sets @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , and all\nsets @xmath with @xmath and @xmath cofinite in @xmath for some @xmath .\n\n###### Proposition 5.5.8.\n\nThe collection @xmath is a basis for the topology of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy Lemmas 5.5.4 and 5.5.6 , the elements of @xmath are open in @xmath .\n\nLet @xmath be any point of @xmath together with some arbitrary open\nneighbourhood @xmath . Our task is to find an element @xmath of @xmath\nwith @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is a vertex or an inner edge point, we are done. Else if\n@xmath is an end, we write @xmath and pick a basic open neighbourhood\n@xmath of @xmath in @xmath which is included in @xmath . Then we are\ndone by taking @xmath .\n\nFinally suppose that there is some @xmath with @xmath . For every @xmath\nwe pick some basic open neighbourhood @xmath in @xmath which is included\nin @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath holds for some @xmath we put @xmath . Then by Lemma 5.5.3\nthere is some unique component @xmath of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath\nis generated by @xmath . Then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath which is closed under\n@xmath by Lemma 5.5.4 and included in @xmath . In particular, @xmath is\nan open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath which is an element of @xmath\nand a subset of @xmath , so we are done.\n\nHence we may assume that @xmath holds for all @xmath . Since the @xmath\nform an open cover in @xmath of the set @xmath which is compact by Lemma\n5.5.7 , we find some finite subset @xmath of @xmath such that the @xmath\ncover @xmath . Next we put @xmath and note that @xmath holds.\nFurthermore, we set @xmath , and for all @xmath we put @xmath . Letting\n@xmath , our hope is that @xmath is a suitable candidate for @xmath .\n\nWe claim that @xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath . Assume not for a\ncontradiction, so @xmath is infinite and by Lemma 3.3.3 we find some\n@xmath with @xmath . But then there is some @xmath with @xmath , so in\nparticular @xmath holds. Since @xmath meets only finitely many elements\nof @xmath , the set @xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath , so in\nparticular @xmath is in @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath implies @xmath by\ndefinition of @xmath . This contradicts @xmath since @xmath and @xmath\nare disjoint. Therefore @xmath is finite as claimed, so by Lemma 5.5.6\nthe set @xmath is @xmath -closed.\n\nFurthermore, every @xmath is contained in @xmath since @xmath is\ncofinite in @xmath and @xmath is in @xmath by Lemma 3.3.2 .\n\nIt remains to show that @xmath is included in @xmath . Since @xmath is\nthe finite union of the sets @xmath , it follows that @xmath is the\nfinite union of the sets @xmath . Hence it suffices to verify that\n@xmath holds for all @xmath . For this, we observe that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nholds for all @xmath . Then Lemma 2.3.4 together with @xmath implies\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nas desired. \u220e\n\nNow that we know a basis of the topology of @xmath , only two technical\nLemmas stand in between of us and our desired result, namely that @xmath\ninduces a homeomorphism @xmath between @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 5.5.9.\n\nFor every @xmath and @xmath we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy Lemma 5.5.4 the set @xmath is @xmath -closed, and so is @xmath .\n\nWe start with the forward inclusion. If @xmath is any element of @xmath\n, then clearly @xmath is contained in @xmath . Else if @xmath is any\nelement of @xmath , then the ultrafilter @xmath is generated by @xmath\nand @xmath must hold. Furthermore, Lemma 5.5.3 implies @xmath . Hence\nfor @xmath we have @xmath . Let @xmath be the element of @xmath to which\n@xmath sends @xmath . In particular, @xmath holds and furthermore @xmath\nis generated by @xmath where @xmath is the unique component of @xmath\nincluding @xmath . In particular, @xmath must hold, so @xmath is an\nelement of @xmath as desired.\n\nFinally, we show the backward inclusion. For this, let any element\n@xmath of @xmath be given, and let @xmath be the element of @xmath which\n@xmath sends to @xmath . If @xmath is an end we are done, so suppose\nthat @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . Since @xmath is\ngenerated by @xmath we have @xmath by definition of @xmath . By Lemma\n5.5.3 there exists a unique component @xmath of @xmath with @xmath and\n@xmath . By the forward inclusion we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nso @xmath implies @xmath . Hence @xmath holds as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.5.10.\n\nFor all @xmath , every @xmath and each cofinite subset @xmath of @xmath\nwe have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy Lemma 5.5.6 the set @xmath is @xmath -closed.\n\nWe start with the forward inclusion. If @xmath is any element of @xmath\n, then clearly @xmath is contained in @xmath . If @xmath is any element\nof @xmath we consider two cases. First suppose that @xmath holds. Then\n@xmath is generated by @xmath for some @xmath . In particular, @xmath is\ncontained in @xmath , so @xmath maps @xmath to an element of @xmath by\nLemma 5.5.9 as desired. Second suppose that @xmath holds. Then @xmath\nand @xmath being a cofinite subset of @xmath implies @xmath by Lemma\n5.5.5 . Let @xmath be the element of @xmath to which @xmath sends @xmath\n. Then @xmath holds by definition of @xmath . In particular, @xmath\nbeing a cofinite subset of @xmath implies @xmath , resulting in @xmath\nas desired.\n\nFinally, we show the backward inclusion. For this, let any element\n@xmath of @xmath be given, and let @xmath be the element of @xmath which\n@xmath sends to @xmath . If @xmath is an end we are done, so suppose\nthat @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . If @xmath is\ngenerated by @xmath for some @xmath then @xmath is in @xmath and by\nLemma 5.5.9 we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nas desired. Otherwise @xmath is the only possibility for @xmath , so by\ndefinition of @xmath we have @xmath . Furthermore, Lemma 3.3.2 implies\n@xmath . Since @xmath is non-principal due to @xmath , the fact that\n@xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath implies @xmath . Hence @xmath is\ncontained in @xmath , so @xmath is in @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Theorem 5.5.11.\n\nFor every graph @xmath combining the bijection @xmath with the identity\non @xmath yields a homeomorphism between @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nSet @xmath which is a bijection by Proposition 5.5.2 .

By Proposition 5.3.8 the map @xmath is a bijection from @xmath onto\n@xmath . Furthermore, @xmath implies @xmath .\n\n(ii). By Lemma 3.3.4 we have @xmath . By Lemma 3.3.2 we know that @xmath\nholds for all @xmath . Since the set @xmath is infinite, there exist at\nleast @xmath many non-principal ultrafilters on it, and by Lemma 5.5.14\neach of these extends to a unique element of @xmath . In particular,\n@xmath has cardinality at least @xmath . Since @xmath is an equivalence\nrelation, this implies @xmath .\n\n(iii) follows from (i) and (ii) combined. \u220e\n\n#### 5.6 @xmath described by tangles\n\nIn [ 14 ] , @xmath was use as a technical description of @xmath .\nRecently, we created @xmath inspired by @xmath , and we showed that\n@xmath is homeomorphic to a natural quotient of @xmath , namely @xmath .\nSo perhaps it is possible to describe @xmath using tangles of @xmath ?\n\nIndeed, it turns out that considering a smaller separation system\nsuffices: Let @xmath be the set of all @xmath with @xmath for which\nthere is no @xmath such that both @xmath and @xmath are infinite. Write\n@xmath for the set of all @xmath -tangles with respect to @xmath . For\nevery @xmath and @xmath we let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nLike for elements of @xmath , it is easy to check that this is indeed an\nelement of @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 5.6.1.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be such that both @xmath and @xmath are finite.\nThen @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume for a contradiction that @xmath holds, witnessed by some @xmath .\nLet @xmath be the bipartition of @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . By\nchoice of @xmath , both @xmath and @xmath are infinite. Next, put\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nand note that both @xmath and @xmath are finite, since @xmath is finite.\nBy choice of @xmath we know that all but finitely many element of @xmath\nare included in @xmath , and all but finitely elements of @xmath are\nincluded in @xmath . We write @xmath and @xmath for the sets of those\nelements, respectively.\n\nIf @xmath holds, then there is some @xmath with @xmath . Without loss of\ngenerality we may assume that @xmath . Since both @xmath and @xmath are\ninfinite, so is @xmath , the desired contradiction.\n\nOtherwise @xmath holds, so @xmath and @xmath together with @xmath\nwitness @xmath , a contradiction. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.6.2.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be given. If @xmath is such that both @xmath and\n@xmath are finite, then @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nWe mimic the proof of [ 14 , Lemma 1.10] . By Lemma 5.6.1 we know that\nthe three separations @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath . First note that\nit suffices to show that @xmath implies @xmath : then @xmath follows\nfrom @xmath and the consistency of @xmath .\n\nAs @xmath holds, we have @xmath by consistency. Due to @xmath the only\npossibility for @xmath is @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\nThe next lemma is an analogue of [ 14 , Lemma 2.2] , and with a bit of\nextra work we can mimic Diestel\u2019s proof.\n\n###### Lemma 5.6.3.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be given. Then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Proof.\n\nSet @xmath and note that this is in @xmath . We check two cases:\n\nFirst suppose that @xmath holds for some @xmath and let @xmath be such\nthat @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath . We wish to show @xmath , since\nthen @xmath implies @xmath as desired. For this, set @xmath and let\n@xmath be such that @xmath and @xmath . By choice of @xmath we have\n@xmath . Now @xmath implies @xmath by definition of @xmath , so in\nparticular we have @xmath . By Lemma 5.6.1 , @xmath implies @xmath .\nFurthermore, @xmath holds since we have @xmath and @xmath by choice of\n@xmath . Hence @xmath together with @xmath implies @xmath by the\nconsistency of @xmath . In particular, Lemma 5.6.2 implies @xmath as\ndesired.\n\nSecond suppose that @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath , and\nassume for a contradiction that @xmath . In particular, we find some\ncofinite subset @xmath of @xmath with @xmath . Let @xmath be such that\n@xmath and @xmath . We wish to show @xmath , since then @xmath yields a\ncontradiction as desired. For this, set @xmath and let @xmath be such\nthat @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath is a cofinite subset of @xmath ,\nwe have @xmath . In particular, since @xmath holds by definition of\n@xmath , we also have @xmath . By Lemma 5.6.1 , @xmath implies @xmath .\nAs in the first case this yields @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Theorem 5.6.4.\n\nThe @xmath -tangles of @xmath with respect to @xmath are precisely the\nlimits of the inverse system @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nDefine @xmath by setting @xmath for every @xmath . By Lemma 5.6.3 this\nis well-defined, and it is easy to see that @xmath is injective. It\nremains to show that @xmath is surjective. For this, let any @xmath be\ngiven.\n\nIf @xmath is principal for all @xmath , then @xmath comes from an end\n@xmath of @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath induces an @xmath -tangle @xmath\nof @xmath with respect to @xmath , and @xmath induces the element @xmath\nof @xmath . Clearly, @xmath sends @xmath to @xmath .\n\nOtherwise @xmath is non-empty. By Proposition 5.5.2 , the map @xmath is\nbijective, so there is some @xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath corresponds\nto the @xmath -tangle @xmath of @xmath with respect to @xmath , and\n@xmath sends @xmath to @xmath . \u220e\n\n#### 5.7 @xmath as inverse limit\n\nIn section 4 we created an inverse system @xmath whose inverse limit\ndescribes the tangle compactification in that there exists a natural\nhomeomorphism between @xmath and @xmath . In this chapter we define a\nsubset @xmath of @xmath , and we show that @xmath describes @xmath .\n\nFor every @xmath let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand let @xmath be the set of all @xmath with @xmath of the form\n\n  -- -------- -- ------\n     @xmath      (12)\n  -- -------- -- ------\n\nwhere each @xmath is a cofinite partition of @xmath . Letting @xmath\ninherit the partial ordering from @xmath yields a directed poset:\n\n###### Lemma 5.7.1.\n\n@xmath is a directed poset.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet any two @xmath be given. Our task is to find some @xmath with @xmath\nand @xmath . Put @xmath and suppose that @xmath is of the form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwith @xmath some cofinite partition of @xmath for every @xmath . For\nevery @xmath set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n(this is a cofinite partition of @xmath ) and for every @xmath put\n@xmath . Then let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand note that @xmath is an element of @xmath . Define @xmath similarly.\nThen both @xmath and @xmath include @xmath . For every @xmath choose\n@xmath to be the coarsest partition of @xmath refining both @xmath and\n@xmath , and note that @xmath is again cofinite. Let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen @xmath holds as desired. \u220e\n\nIf we recall the inverse system @xmath from section 4 , then obviously\nthe inverse limit @xmath should describe @xmath . But the elements of\n@xmath are rather complicated, while a much easier attempt seems\npossible: For every @xmath write\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand consider the subset\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nof @xmath which is also directed since @xmath holds for all @xmath .\nFurthermore, we can show that\n\n###### Lemma 5.7.2.\n\n@xmath is cofinal in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet any @xmath be given where @xmath is of the form\u00a0( 12 ). For every\nelement @xmath of\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\npick a vertex @xmath . Set @xmath which is finite. Then @xmath holds as\ndesired. \u220e\n\nHence if @xmath describes @xmath , then so should @xmath by Lemma 2.2.8\n. But given @xmath and @xmath it is not straightforward to construct a\n@xmath together with an open set in @xmath corresponding to @xmath (an\napproach similar to the idea of the proof of Lemma 5.7.2 works to derive\n@xmath from @xmath ). Hence if we want to put our inverse limit\ndescription to use, the superior simplicity of @xmath comes at the cost\nof \u2018quality of life\u2019. Since the whole purpose of this inverse limit\ndescription is to increase our \u2018quality of life\u2019, we take @xmath over\n@xmath , keeping in mind that @xmath always is an option by Lemma 2.2.8\n.\n\nThus we set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIt remains to show @xmath . Since the definition of the @xmath deviates\nfrom that of the @xmath too much, we cannot simply claim that mimicking\nthe proof of Theorem 4.3.1 will do, but neither do we wish to redo all\nof the work. Since it is clear that a homeomorphism defined similarly to\nthe one constructed in the proof of Theorem 4.3.1 should do, we do not\nlose any insights when we use Lemma 2.2.6 over an explicit construction.\n\nFor this, we define a continuous surjection @xmath for every @xmath as\nfollows: We let @xmath map every vertex to the partition class of @xmath\ncontaining it. If @xmath is an inner edge point of some edge @xmath of\n@xmath , then if @xmath is an edge of @xmath we let @xmath , and\notherwise we let @xmath map @xmath to the non-singleton partition class\nof @xmath containing the endvertices of @xmath . Finally if @xmath is an\nelement of @xmath we let @xmath assign @xmath to @xmath where @xmath is\nthe unique element of @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is open in @xmath for some @xmath , then we denote by @xmath\nthe set @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath and @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 5.7.3.\n\nThe maps @xmath are compatible.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath be elements of @xmath , and let @xmath be given; we have to\nshow\n\n  -- -------- -- ------\n     @xmath      (13)\n  -- -------- -- ------\n\nThis is clear for @xmath , so we may assume that that @xmath is an\nelement of @xmath . Write @xmath , @xmath , and let @xmath and @xmath be\nthe unique elements of @xmath and @xmath , respectively. By definition\nof @xmath we know that in order to verify ( 13 ) it suffices to show\n\n  -- -------- -- ------\n     @xmath      (14)\n  -- -------- -- ------\n\nFor this we check several cases:\n\nFirst suppose that @xmath holds for some @xmath . Then @xmath is of the\nform\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere the @xmath are cofinite partitions of @xmath and @xmath is the\nunique infinite element of @xmath . If @xmath holds, then @xmath is of\nthe form @xmath where @xmath is the unique component of @xmath including\n@xmath . Then @xmath and @xmath yield\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nas desired. Otherwise @xmath implies @xmath . We may assume that @xmath\nis of the form\u00a0( 12 ). In particular, @xmath is the unique infinite\nelement of @xmath . Since @xmath is cofinite in @xmath and @xmath is\ncofinite in @xmath (Observation 3.3.1 ) we know that @xmath is cofinite\nin @xmath . Now some @xmath satisfies @xmath due to @xmath , and since\n@xmath is cofinite in @xmath , the only possibility for @xmath is @xmath\nas desired.\n\nFor the second case suppose that @xmath holds for some component @xmath\nof @xmath . In particular @xmath is in @xmath due to @xmath . Let @xmath\nbe the unique component of @xmath including @xmath . Then the definition\nof @xmath yields @xmath , and @xmath implies @xmath . Let @xmath be the\npartition class with @xmath (which exists due to @xmath ). In\nparticular, @xmath must contain @xmath since @xmath does, so @xmath\nfollows. Assume for a contradiction that @xmath and @xmath are distinct:\nthen @xmath and @xmath are disjoint partition classes of @xmath , so\n@xmath implies @xmath contradicting @xmath . Hence @xmath yields ( 14 )\nas desired. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 5.7.4.\n\nThe maps @xmath are continuous.\u220e\n\n###### Theorem 5.7.5.\n\nFor every graph @xmath we have @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nConsider the map\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nwhich clearly is injective. By Theorem 5.4.2 we know that @xmath is\ncompact. Since the @xmath are surjective, so are the @xmath . Hence by\nLemmas 5.7.3 and 5.7.4 the @xmath form a compatible system of continuous\nsurjections, and applying Lemma 2.2.6 yields that @xmath is also a\ncontinuous surjection. It remains to verify that @xmath is continuous.\nFor this, let any point @xmath of @xmath be given together with some\nbasic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is in @xmath we choose some @xmath such that @xmath is\ncontained in the 1-complex of @xmath , and set @xmath . Then @xmath is\nalso a basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath , so @xmath holds.\n\nOtherwise @xmath is an element of @xmath and we check two subcases.\nFirst, if @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath and @xmath , then\nwe let @xmath be a partition of @xmath such that @xmath is a singleton\npartition class of @xmath and @xmath . Next, we consider the basic open\nneighbourhood @xmath of the dummy vertex @xmath in @xmath . Clearly,\n@xmath holds as desired. For the second subcase suppose that @xmath is\nof the form @xmath for some @xmath with @xmath a cofinite subset of\n@xmath for some @xmath . Then we let @xmath be a partition of @xmath\nsuch that @xmath is a partition class of @xmath and @xmath . Considering\nthe basic open neighbourhood @xmath of the dummy vertex @xmath in @xmath\nyields @xmath as expected. Thus @xmath is continuous. \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 5.7.6.\n\nFor every infinite graph @xmath we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Proof.\n\nCombine Theorem 5.7.5 with Lemmas 2.2.8 and 5.7.2 . \u220e\n\n#### 5.8 Outlook\n\nOf course, finding meaningful graph theoretical reasons to consider\n@xmath -systems or @xmath is of highest interest. Since we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nit might be possible to show that the @xmath -tangles of @xmath w.r.t\n@xmath induce precisely the @xmath -tangles of @xmath w.r.t @xmath ,\nwhere @xmath is the set of all @xmath respecting the finite partition\n@xmath of @xmath .\n\nFinally, it remains to compare @xmath and @xmath in the wild. Since\n@xmath is so much bigger than @xmath , it might be easier to get some\ngeneralisation of thins sums to work in a modified version of @xmath\nthan in a modified version of @xmath . On the other hand, we might run\ninto dependencies on certain models of ZFC.\n\n### 6 Auxiliary edges and tree-packing\n\nIn this chapter, @xmath is always assumed to be connected.\n\n#### 6.1 Introduction\n\nBy now, the topological cycle space of locally finite graphs has been\nthe subject of extensive studies, but several problems are known to\noccur in straightforward generalisations to arbitrary infinite graphs.\nFor example consider the heavy edge sets in the following three graphs:\n\nAll heavy edge sets can be obtained as thin sum of all the facial cycles\nof their respective graphs, and hence should be elements of their cycle\nspaces. For the top left graph, a solution is known: Identifying the end\nwith its dominating vertex yields a compact Hausdorff quotient @xmath of\n@xmath whose topology is known as ITop . In this quotient, the ray\nactually converges to its dominating vertex, as pictured below:\n\nStudying this quotient proved rewarding, e.g. see [ 3 ] and [ 9 ] . For\nthe graph @xmath on the bottom left of Fig. 6 , however, @xmath is not\ndefined since the relation we would use to yield @xmath no longer is\ntransitive. Obviously, we could fix this by taking the transitive\nclosure of that relation, but this would result in vertex\nidentification, which we want to avoid at all cost. Finally, consider\nthe graph @xmath on the right in Fig. 6 . This graph has no end, and\nhence VTop is Hausdorff, but not compact, and identifying the two\nvertices of infinite degree does not change that. A space solving all\nour problems by using vertex identification is already known: @xmath is\ncompact Hausdorff, and many of the theorems known for locally finite\ngraphs admit easy generalisations to @xmath for arbitrary infinite\ngraphs (among these we find a working cycle space):\n\nThis is possible thanks to the inverse limit @xmath describing @xmath .\nBut @xmath has a huge downside: since it uses vertex identification, we\nlose the structure of the graph. For an extreme example, consider the\ngraph @xmath from Fig. 9 . Clearly, this graph admits a very rich\nstructure, e.g. its underlying binary tree plus the edge @xmath yields\nan NST and in @xmath we find an edge-less Hamilton circle (see [ 8 ,\nProposition 3.4 and Corollary 3.5] ). \u00b3\u00b3 \u00b3\u00b3 33 This is one reason why\nthe usage of ITop is commonly restricted to finitely separable graphs.\nBut since no two of its vertices are finitely separable, @xmath is just\na hawaiian earring, and we may say that @xmath takes the sledgehammer\napproach by sacrificing the structure of our graphs in exchange for easy\ngeneralisations.\n\nLet us have a look on the topologies considered so far from another\nperspective. Generally speaking, ITop approaches the generalisation\nproblem \u2018from bottom up\u2019 by using the straightforward generalisation\nVTop of the Freudenthal compactification\u2014which is natural on locally\nfinite graphs\u2014on arbitrary graphs, then fixing problems by moving on to\na Hausdorff quotient and restriction to a suitable class of graphs\n(which is still big enough to be of interest).\n\nThe tangle compactification on the other hand naturally extends the\nFreu-\ndenthal compactification to arbitrary infinite graphs in that it uses\n@xmath -tangles to compactify the 1-complex of @xmath . Yet it seems\nlike the tangle compactification is not the \u2018right setting\u2019 for\narbitrary infinite graphs: First of all, we recall from the introduction\nof this work that a @xmath admits some set of edges which we expect to\ninduce a TST of the tangle compactification, but which has no meaningful\nacirclic and topologically connected superset. Second, Lemma 3.1.4 tells\nus that arcs in the tangle compactification default to arcs in @xmath ,\ni.e. the arcs avoid the ultrafilter tangles. But it would be great if at\nleast leanly structured countable graphs would admit arc-connected\ncircles and TSTs using ultrafilter tangles in order to overcome the\ndifficulties discussed earlier.\n\nTherefore, we have two choices. First, we may stick to our definitions\nof circles and TSTs in terms of arcs while modifying the tangle\ncompactification in some way deemed natural. Second, we may adjust both\nthe tangle compactification and our definitions of circles and TSTs.\nSince our definitions of circles and TSTs heavily rely on the unit\ninterval while we do not impose any cardinal bounds on our graphs, the\nsecond choice is more appealing.\n\nIf we modify the tangle compactification, we should see to it that the\nresulting space @xmath is both compact and Hausdorff: then @xmath is a\ncontinuum and the field of continuum theory provides us with a useful\ntool box. But what could @xmath look like? Of course, it should solve\nour earlier problems from Fig. 6 . On the other hand, it should admit a\nTST even for the graph @xmath from Fig. 9 . Here, the obstruction in\n@xmath is the existence of an edge-less Hamilton circle. This circle\ndoes not look very \u2018circle-like\u2019 in that drawing, hence let us draw the\ngraph again, but this time we start with a circle in the plane ( @xmath\n, say) and embed the vertices of @xmath into it discretely, as sketched\nin Fig. 10 .\n\nNow the idea of a circle consisting exactly of the vertices and ends of\n@xmath appears much less inconvenient, doesn\u2019t it? Also, the (finite)\ncycles induced by the boundaries of the inner faces seem to converge to\n@xmath in some sense. Let us state this more clear:\n\nFor every @xmath denote by @xmath the set of all (finite) cycles which\nare induced by face boundaries of the drawing above, and which only meet\n@xmath in @xmath . Then for every @xmath there is some @xmath such that\nthe (finite) cycle @xmath with edge set @xmath is included in @xmath .\nAlso note that @xmath holds.\n\nThis gives us a first hint: if we introduce some sort of limit edges,\none between every end of @xmath and each of its dominating vertices, and\nif we embed these into @xmath appropriately (which is possible since we\nembedded @xmath discretely), then the edge-less Hamilton circle is no\nlonger edge-less. Furthermore, by the looks of the drawing, it should\nnot be a problem to define basic open neighbourhoods of the inner edge\npoints of these limit edges such that the sequence @xmath \u2018converges\u2019 to\nour Hamilton circle induced by the limit edges. On top of that, the\nobvious NST of @xmath (the underlying @xmath plus the edge @xmath ) now\nshould induce a TST, and the Hamilton circle minus one of its limit\nedges should be a TST.\n\nBut what about a @xmath or graphs admitting ultrafilter tangles in\ngeneral? In case of @xmath , if we remember why the expected TST did not\nwork out, the problem informally amounted to the ultrafilter tangles not\nbeing \u2018sufficiently connected\u2019 to the two vertices of infinite degree.\nFurthermore, we cannot meaningfully modify the topology of the tangle\ncompactification of this graph into a Hausdorff one without losing\ncompactness. But if we join every ultrafilter tangle @xmath of @xmath to\neach vertex in @xmath via a limit edge, and if we generalise the\ntopology of the tangle compactification in an MTop -like way onto the\nnew space (treating inner limit edge points almost like tangles), then\nwe obtain a continuum.\n\nSince the space @xmath is not that easy to work with, we dedicate this\nchapter to a Hausdorff auxiliary space @xmath which in general is not\ncompact, but whose structure combinatorially captures the basic\nstructure of @xmath . Informally, @xmath is obtained from @xmath with\nMTop by disjointly adding auxiliary (multi-)edges between every end of\n@xmath and each of its dominating vertices, and between any two distinct\nvertices of the same critical vertex set (one for each critical vertex\nset both are contained in). As basic open neighbourhoods of the inner\nedge points of auxiliary edges we take the same ones as for inner edge\npoints of edges of @xmath , and we carefully adjust the open\nneighbourhoods of other points to include also half-open partial\nauxiliary edges.\n\nAs we have seen two times before, if we construct a TST in @xmath , then\nits inner edge points do not induce a TST of @xmath , e.g. in a @xmath\nthe sole non-singleton @xmath -class of @xmath (which consists of all\nultrafilter tangles and the two vertices of infinite degree; also recall\n@xmath ) is totally disconnected in @xmath . But in @xmath that @xmath\n-class minus the ultrafilter tangles plus the auxiliary edge between its\ntwo vertices is arc-connected. As it turns out, between every two\ndistinct points @xmath and @xmath of @xmath there exists an auxiliary\narc from @xmath to @xmath if and only if @xmath , where an auxiliary arc\nsimply is an arc in the closure of the set of all auxiliary edges (see\nSections 6.3 and 6.4 ). Interestingly, this holds without any\ncardinality bounds imposed on the graph considered. Hence, if we wish to\nprove a statement about the existence of certain structures in @xmath ,\nthen the following two step procedure might be worth a try: First, prove\nit for @xmath using @xmath . Second, \u2018lift\u2019 the obtained structures to\n@xmath by expanding the non-trivial @xmath -classes to something\nauxiliary arc-connected. For the rest of the section, we carry out this\nprocedure to prove a generalisation of tree-packing (with the usual\ncircle and TST definitions) for countable graphs, demonstrating the\nsynergy of the two spaces @xmath and @xmath .\n\nFor finite graphs, the so-called \u2018tree packing\u2019 is a fundamental theorem\nthat was proved by Nash-Williams and Tutte independently in 1961:\n\n###### Theorem 6.1.1 ([13, Theorem 2.4.1]).\n\nThe following are equivalent for all finite multigraphs @xmath and\n@xmath :\n\n1.  @xmath contains @xmath edge-disjoint spanning trees.\n\n2.  @xmath has at least @xmath edges across any finite vertex partition\n    @xmath .\n\nFor infinite graphs, however, the naive generalisation fails. Indeed,\nlet @xmath be a @xmath whose vertices of infinite degree we denote by\n@xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, we enumerate the other vertices of\n@xmath as @xmath . Now we show that @xmath satisfies (ii) for @xmath .\nFor this, let @xmath be any finite vertex partition of @xmath . If\n@xmath and @xmath are contained in different partition classes, with\n@xmath say, then infinitely many edges leave @xmath since there are\ninfinitely many disjoint paths from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath , so (ii)\nholds. Otherwise @xmath and @xmath are contained in the same partition\nclass @xmath , say. If there are infinitely many of the @xmath not\ncontained in @xmath , then again infinitely many edges leave @xmath ,\nwitnessing (ii). Hence we may assume that @xmath contains all but\nfinitely many of the @xmath . Then for every @xmath the partition class\n@xmath is a finite subset of @xmath , and every edge leaving @xmath is\nincident with precisely one of @xmath and @xmath . Thus exactly @xmath\nmany edges leave @xmath . By choice of @xmath the partition @xmath has\nprecisely\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nmany cross-edges, so again (ii) holds. This completes the verification\nof (ii) for @xmath . But obviously, every spanning tree of @xmath has\ndegree 2 at some @xmath . In particular, every two spanning trees of\n@xmath share an edge, so (i) fails as claimed.\n\nThe TSTs of known topologies on @xmath (not relying on\nvertex-identification) face the same problem, but @xmath does not:\n\nOf course the two TSTs of @xmath depicted in Fig. 11 share an edge, but\nthis is not an edge of @xmath , and clearly this is best possible for\n@xmath . Furthermore, the shared auxiliary edge indicates that its\nendvertices are in the same (infinitely edge-connected) @xmath -class,\nso both TSTs share an artificial edge which represents infinite\nedge-connectivity.\n\n#### 6.2 The space @xmath\n\nIn this section, we formally define the topological space @xmath which\nmakes use of auxiliary edges.\n\nFor this, we let\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nand we let @xmath be the multigraph on @xmath with edge set @xmath where\nevery @xmath has endvertices @xmath and @xmath . The elements of @xmath\nare referred to as auxiliary edges . Unless stated otherwise, our\nstandard notation such as @xmath , @xmath and @xmath still depends on\n@xmath , not on @xmath . Next, we obtain a topological space @xmath with\nground set the 1-complex of @xmath by declaring as (basic) open the\nfollowing sets:\n\nFor inner edge points of @xmath we take the usual basic open\nneighbourhoods. For every vertex @xmath of @xmath and every @xmath we\ndeclare as open the star @xmath of half-open intervals. Finally, for\nevery @xmath , for each @xmath and for all @xmath take\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n(Informally, if @xmath is of the form @xmath for some end @xmath of\n@xmath , then we may think of @xmath as @xmath plus (possibly half-open\npartial) auxiliary edges.) Using Corollary 3.3.6 it is easy to check\nthat this really yields a topology. Similar to @xmath and @xmath , for\nevery @xmath and @xmath we write\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\n###### Observation 6.2.1.\n\n@xmath is Hausdorff.\n\n###### Lemma 6.2.2.\n\nThe finite cuts of @xmath are finite cuts of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThis follows from Theorem 3.3.5 and the fact that no finite cut\nseparates an end from any of its dominating vertices. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 6.2.3.\n\nLet @xmath be given together with a bipartition @xmath of @xmath .\nFurthermore suppose that @xmath is a connected subset of @xmath meeting\nboth @xmath and @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nOtherwise @xmath induces an open bipartition of @xmath which is\nimpossible. \u220e\n\nThe following Lemma basically restates the first part of the Jumping Arc\nLemma [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.3 (i)] for @xmath . Hence, with Lemma 6.2.2 the\nproof is analogue:\n\n###### Lemma 6.2.4 (@xmath).\n\nLet @xmath be a finite cut of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath . Then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand no connected subset of @xmath meets both @xmath and @xmath .\u220e\n\nAn arc @xmath is called an auxiliary arc if @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 6.2.5 (@xmath).\n\n@xmath is dense in @xmath for every arc @xmath in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nFirst choose a homeomorphism @xmath . We claim that @xmath . Assume not\nfor a contradiction. Then @xmath since @xmath is closed. Pick some\n@xmath together with some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in\n@xmath which avoids @xmath . It is impossible to find such a\nneighbourhood for vertices of @xmath or inner edge points of @xmath , so\n@xmath must be an end of @xmath . Let @xmath be some basic open subset\nof @xmath which @xmath maps to @xmath . Then @xmath holds by the\nprevious argument. Hence it suffices to show that there is no arc living\nentirely in @xmath to yield a contradiction:\n\nAssume for a contradiction that there is an arc @xmath starting in\n@xmath and ending in @xmath , say. Pick some @xmath witnessing @xmath .\nThen @xmath avoids @xmath , contradicting Observation 6.2.3 . \u220e\n\nIf @xmath is a subgraph of @xmath , then we write @xmath for its closure\nin @xmath . If a subspace @xmath of @xmath is of the form @xmath and\nevery @xmath is incident with an auxiliary edge from @xmath , then we\ncall @xmath a standard subspace of @xmath and write @xmath . By Lemma\n6.2.5 we have @xmath if @xmath is arc-connected. An @xmath TST of @xmath\nis a uniquely arc-connected standard subspace of @xmath including @xmath\n. If @xmath is an auxiliary arc-component of @xmath and @xmath is a\nuniquely arc-connected standard subspace with @xmath , then @xmath is\ncalled an @xmath TST of @xmath . If @xmath is an @xmath TST of @xmath or\nof an auxiliary arc-component of @xmath and @xmath is any edge in @xmath\n, then @xmath has precisely two arc-components @xmath and @xmath and we\nwrite @xmath for the fundamental cut of @xmath (with respect to @xmath )\nwhich consists precisely of those edges of @xmath with one endvertex in\n@xmath and the other in @xmath . A circle of @xmath is the image of a\nhomeomorphic embedding of @xmath into @xmath . By Lemma 6.2.5 every\ncircle of @xmath is a standard subspace of @xmath . If @xmath is a\ncircle of @xmath , then @xmath is a circuit .\n\n###### Observation 6.2.6.\n\nIf @xmath is an NST of @xmath and @xmath is the closure of @xmath in\n@xmath , then @xmath naturally extends to an ordering @xmath of @xmath .\nFurthermore, by Theorem 3.3.5 , all the sets @xmath and @xmath (where\n@xmath and @xmath ) form chains in @xmath . Hence if @xmath is an edge\nof @xmath with @xmath , then all edges of @xmath (in particular those of\n@xmath ) are incident with @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 6.2.7 (@xmath).\n\nLet @xmath be a any graph and let @xmath be an NST of @xmath . Then the\nclosure of @xmath in @xmath is a TST of @xmath with respect to @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath denote the closure of @xmath in @xmath . Using normal rays it\nis straightforward to show that @xmath is arc-connected, so assume for a\ncontradiction that there is some circle @xmath . By Lemma 6.2.5 we may\npick some edge @xmath of @xmath which @xmath traverses. Without loss of\ngenerality we have @xmath since @xmath is an edge of the graph @xmath by\nchoice of @xmath . Now consider the arc @xmath . Since @xmath is an NST\nwe know that @xmath where @xmath and @xmath . But then\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\ninduces an open bipartition of @xmath since @xmath . \u220e\n\n#### 6.3 Construction of auxiliary arcs\n\nThe aim of this section is to construct an auxiliary arc between any two\ndistinct vertices of @xmath which are not finitely separable. In order\nto do this, we will approximate a topological path in @xmath between the\ntwo vertices via a countable linear ordering on some special set of\nvertices. Then we \u2018fill in the gaps\u2019 of that linear ordering with inner\nedge points of auxiliary edges and ends of @xmath , yielding a\ntopological path between the two vertices in @xmath . Finally, since we\ncannot guarantee injectivity at the ends of @xmath , we involve general\ntopology to obtain the desired auxiliary arc.\n\nSuppose that @xmath and @xmath are two distinct vertices of @xmath with\n@xmath and denote by @xmath the set of all @xmath - @xmath paths in\n@xmath . Every path @xmath naturally induces a linear ordering @xmath on\nits vertex set with @xmath , and for each @xmath we denote by @xmath the\nlinear ordering on @xmath induced by @xmath . Furthermore, for every\n@xmath we define a map @xmath with domain @xmath by letting\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor each @xmath . In addition, for every @xmath we set up a function\n@xmath by letting\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor every @xmath . Hence @xmath is an inverse system and the diagram\n\n[]\n\nis easily seen to commute.\n\nSince @xmath holds, we inductively find some countably infinite subset\n@xmath of @xmath consisting of edge-disjoint @xmath - @xmath paths. For\nevery @xmath we let @xmath be the set of all @xmath with @xmath\ninfinite, i.e. @xmath is in @xmath if and only if @xmath sends some\ninfinitely many paths of @xmath to @xmath . Then it is easy to check\nthat @xmath is an inverse system. Clearly, every @xmath is finite, and\nso is every @xmath . Hence all @xmath are non-empty by pigeon-hole\nprinciple, so the Generalized Infinity Lemma\u00a0( 2.2.4 ) yields some\n\n  -- -------- -- ------\n     @xmath      (15)\n  -- -------- -- ------\n\n###### Theorem 6.3.1.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath and @xmath be two distinct\nvertices of @xmath . Then @xmath if and only if there is some auxiliary\narc from @xmath to @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe backward direction is immediate from Lemma 6.2.4 .\n\nFor the forward direction suppose that @xmath holds and consider the\nfamily from\u00a0( 15 ) constructed above. Write @xmath for every @xmath and\nput @xmath . By standard inverse limit arguments it is straightforward\nto check that @xmath is a linear ordering on @xmath with least element\n@xmath and greatest element @xmath . Since @xmath is a subset of @xmath\nand @xmath is countable, we know that @xmath is countable.\n\nIf @xmath is finite, then @xmath holds: Otherwise Corollary 3.2.5 yields\nsome @xmath disjoint from @xmath such that @xmath separates @xmath and\n@xmath in @xmath . Set @xmath . Then we have @xmath since @xmath avoids\n@xmath . Pick some @xmath edge-disjoint from the finite set @xmath with\n@xmath . Then @xmath is an @xmath \u2013 @xmath path which avoids both @xmath\nand @xmath , which is impossible since @xmath separates @xmath and\n@xmath in @xmath . Hence @xmath holds, so by Theorem 3.3.5 there exists\na path from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath using only auxiliary edges. In\nparticular, we find an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath .\n\nTherefore, we may assume that @xmath is infinite. Now consider the set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand let @xmath be the linear ordering on @xmath induced by the\nlexicographic ordering on @xmath , where @xmath is linearly ordered by\n@xmath and @xmath inherits its ordering from @xmath . Since @xmath is\ncountable we find some order preserving injection @xmath with @xmath and\n@xmath . Note that @xmath is discrete \u00b3\u2074 \u00b3\u2074 34 i.e. every point in\n@xmath is isolated in @xmath . Next define @xmath by letting @xmath for\nevery @xmath . Then the linear ordering on @xmath inherited from @xmath\nvia @xmath coincides with @xmath . Furthermore, the image of @xmath is\ndiscrete in @xmath , so for every @xmath we may pick some @xmath such\nthat @xmath meets the image of @xmath precisely in @xmath .\n\nAn @xmath - blank (where @xmath is some function into @xmath ) is a\nnon-empty open interval @xmath with @xmath . Clearly, any two @xmath\n-blanks are disjoint. Since every @xmath -blank contains a rational\nnumber, there are only countably many @xmath -blanks, so we may consider\nsome enumeration @xmath of all @xmath -blanks where @xmath . Also note\nthat every @xmath -blank avoids @xmath for every @xmath . In order to\nget rid of the @xmath -blanks, define @xmath as follows: let @xmath and\nfor every other @xmath pick\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\nThen the image of @xmath is again discrete by choice of @xmath .\nFurthermore @xmath is injective and the ordering on @xmath inherited\nfrom @xmath via @xmath coincides with @xmath . By construction, there\nare no @xmath -blanks. For ease of notation we that @xmath holds. As\nbefore, for every @xmath we pick some @xmath such that @xmath meets the\nimage of @xmath precisely in @xmath , e.g. set @xmath . Let @xmath which\nis the set of all accumulation points of the discrete image of @xmath in\n@xmath . In order to obtain a topological @xmath \u2013 @xmath path in @xmath\nwe need some more information about @xmath first:\n\n###### Claim 1.\n\nLet @xmath be given and suppose that there is some @xmath such that\n@xmath and @xmath . Then there is some @xmath with @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nAssume not for a contradiction. Then by Lemma 3.2.4 we find some @xmath\nwith @xmath such that @xmath separates @xmath and @xmath in @xmath . Put\n@xmath and pick some @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . Then @xmath meets\n@xmath in some vertex @xmath . Hence @xmath implies @xmath , but then\n@xmath witnesses @xmath and thus @xmath , a contradiction. \u220e\n\n###### Claim 2.\n\nLet @xmath be given together with a sequence @xmath in @xmath such that\n@xmath for @xmath . Then @xmath has a subsequence which converges to\nsome @xmath in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may assume that our sequence satisfies\n@xmath for all @xmath . Inductively we define @xmath and @xmath by\nletting\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand picking some @xmath with @xmath , for every @xmath . Then @xmath\navoids all @xmath with @xmath since otherwise @xmath would witness\n@xmath for some @xmath , which is impossible. Consider the connected\ninfinite subgraph @xmath of @xmath . We claim that @xmath is even\nlocally finite:\n\nAssume not for a contradiction, witnessed by some vertex @xmath of\n@xmath of infinite degree. This vertex is none of the @xmath since each\n@xmath avoids all @xmath with @xmath . Let @xmath be the infinite set of\nall @xmath with @xmath , and let @xmath . Then @xmath is in @xmath for\nall @xmath . Pick some @xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath contains @xmath\nwhile @xmath and @xmath hold, so @xmath witnesses @xmath . But then for\nevery @xmath with @xmath we know that @xmath implies @xmath , which is\nimpossible since @xmath is infinite. Hence @xmath is locally finite.\n\nTherefore, since @xmath is connected, infinite and locally finite,\napplying the Star-Comb Lemma ( [ 13 , Lemma 8.2.2] ) yields a comb with\nall teeth in @xmath . Let @xmath be its spine, and let @xmath be the end\nof @xmath containing @xmath . Since every basic open neighbourhood of\n@xmath in @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath , only finitely\nmany teeth of the comb can lie outside of this neighbourhood. Therefore,\nthe teeth of the comb form a subsequence of @xmath which converges to\n@xmath in @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Claim 3.\n\nIn the context of Claim 2 , suppose that there is some @xmath with\n@xmath and @xmath . Then @xmath dominates @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nAssume not for a contradiction, witnessed by some @xmath . Without loss\nof generality the whole sequence @xmath converges to @xmath in @xmath .\nPick @xmath such that @xmath holds for all @xmath . For every @xmath let\n@xmath and pick some @xmath with @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath in\nsome @xmath , so @xmath and @xmath follow. By pigeon-hole principle we\nfind some infinite @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath . Then @xmath holds\nfor all @xmath . Since @xmath is infinite, this implies @xmath , a\ncontradiction. Therefore, @xmath dominates @xmath . \u220e\n\nDefine @xmath as follows: On the image of @xmath we let @xmath for every\n@xmath , so the diagram\n\n[]\n\ncommutes. Next we write the set @xmath as disjoint union @xmath of\nmaximal non-empty intervals @xmath over some index set @xmath . Let\n@xmath and @xmath for all @xmath . We distinguish several cases (see\nFig. 12 for an illustration):\n\n1.  @xmath , i.e. @xmath\n\n2.  @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath\n\n3.  @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath\n\n4.  @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , i.e. @xmath\n\nThere is no case (iv) covering \u2018 @xmath with @xmath and @xmath , i.e.\n@xmath \u2019 since there are no @xmath -blanks. Now given @xmath , we define\n@xmath as follows:\n\nFirst we consider case (i) , i.e. @xmath is a singleton. Let @xmath take\non the role of @xmath in Claim 2 and pick an arbitrary sequence @xmath\nin @xmath witnessing @xmath , so Claim 2 yields some @xmath . Then we\nset @xmath .\n\nNext we consider case (iia) , i.e. @xmath with @xmath and @xmath . We\npick an arbitrary sequence @xmath in @xmath witnessing @xmath , so Claim\n2 yields some @xmath . Letting @xmath take on the role of @xmath in\nClaim 3 yields @xmath . Hence we let @xmath be a homeomorphism onto the\nedge @xmath with @xmath . We treat Case (iib) analogously using the\nsymmetric analogue of Claim 3 .\n\nFinally we consider case (iii) , i.e. @xmath with @xmath and @xmath .\nLetting @xmath and @xmath take on the roles of @xmath and @xmath from\nClaim 1 , respectively, yields some @xmath with @xmath . If @xmath is an\nend of @xmath , then we write @xmath and note @xmath . Hence we pick\nsome @xmath and let @xmath and @xmath be homeomorphisms onto the edges\n@xmath and @xmath , respectively, such that @xmath holds. Otherwise\n@xmath is an ultrafilter tangle and we let @xmath be a homeomorphism\nonto some auxiliary edge between @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath and\n@xmath (such an auxiliary edge exists by Theorem 3.3.5 ). This completes\nthe definition of @xmath .\n\nNote that @xmath holds by construction. Due to the Claims used for the\ndefinition of @xmath , proving that @xmath is well defined amounts to\nverifying that @xmath is continuous, and we will need the continuity of\n@xmath in order to obtain an auxiliary arc from @xmath . Hence, we\nverify that @xmath is continuous:\n\n###### Claim 4.\n\n@xmath is continuous.\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nGiven @xmath (without loss of generality @xmath ) and @xmath some basic\nopen neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath , we have to find some basic open\nneighbourhood @xmath of @xmath which @xmath maps to @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath is a vertex @xmath of @xmath , then we find a suitable\nneighbourhood of @xmath included in @xmath . Else if @xmath is an inner\nedge point we are done, so finally suppose that @xmath . Thus @xmath is\nof the form @xmath for some @xmath and @xmath . If @xmath is not in\n@xmath , then @xmath was defined in case (iii) for some @xmath , and we\nfind some suitable open neighbourhood of @xmath included in @xmath .\nHence we may assume that @xmath is in @xmath . The rest of the proof is\ndedicated to this case.\n\nAssume for a contradiction that for every @xmath there is some @xmath\nwith @xmath . First, we obtain a sequence @xmath from @xmath with @xmath\nfor all @xmath and @xmath , as follows: Let any @xmath be given.\n\nIf @xmath is a vertex of @xmath , then we let @xmath .\n\nElse if @xmath is an inner edge point of some auxiliary edge @xmath ,\nthen we pick @xmath such that @xmath is an endvertex of @xmath outside\nof @xmath . For later use, we let @xmath denote the length of the closed\ninterval @xmath containing @xmath for which @xmath is a homeomorphism\nonto the auxiliary edge @xmath .\n\nFinally suppose that @xmath . We check two subcases: For the first\nsubcase suppose that @xmath is not in @xmath , so @xmath was defined in\ncase (iii) for some @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath implies that @xmath\navoids @xmath . Let @xmath and @xmath . Then neither of @xmath and\n@xmath is in @xmath , since otherwise @xmath would separate one of\n@xmath and @xmath from @xmath , contradicting @xmath . In particular,\n@xmath is not in @xmath . If @xmath we let @xmath , and @xmath\notherwise. For the second subcase suppose that @xmath is in @xmath .\nThen by definition of @xmath there is some sequence @xmath in @xmath\nsuch that @xmath in @xmath and @xmath in @xmath for @xmath . Since\n@xmath is Hausdorff and @xmath holds due to @xmath , we find some @xmath\nsuch that @xmath and @xmath (which is possible due to @xmath ). Thus we\nlet @xmath . This completes the subcase and the definition of the @xmath\n.\n\nWe still have to verify that @xmath holds. For this, let @xmath be the\nset of all @xmath for which @xmath is an inner edge point of @xmath .\nClearly, @xmath was defined in one of the cases (i), (iia) and (iib) for\nsome @xmath . If @xmath was defined in case (i), i.e. with @xmath , then\nfor every @xmath both intervals @xmath and @xmath meet @xmath and one\neasily checks that @xmath holds for @xmath and @xmath . Therefore,\n@xmath for @xmath follows from the choice of the @xmath . Thus @xmath\nholds for @xmath . Else if @xmath was defined in case (iia), i.e. with\n@xmath and @xmath , then for every @xmath the interval @xmath meets\n@xmath , but the interval @xmath does not. By construction, @xmath maps\n@xmath to the interior of the auxiliary-edge @xmath . Hence @xmath\ntogether with @xmath implies that @xmath must hold for all but finitely\nmany @xmath , without loss of generality for all @xmath . But then one\neasily checks as before that @xmath holds, and thus @xmath . Otherwise\n@xmath was defined in case (iib), which follows from (iia) via symmetry,\ncompleting the proof of @xmath .\n\nTherefore, @xmath is a sequence in @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath and\n@xmath for @xmath . Applying Claim 2 to @xmath and @xmath yields a\nconvergent subsequence @xmath with limit @xmath . Since @xmath is\nHausdorff, the fact that no @xmath is in @xmath implies @xmath . Write\n@xmath for all @xmath and note that @xmath holds for @xmath due to\n@xmath and @xmath . Recall that Claim 2 was used in order to define\n@xmath , so there is a sequence @xmath in @xmath with @xmath in @xmath\nand @xmath in @xmath . \u00b3\u2075 \u00b3\u2075 35 This is the convergent subsequence\nmentioned in the conclusion of Claim 2 , not the sequence of the same\nname mentioned in the premise of that claim. Pick some @xmath witnessing\n@xmath , and choose some @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath hold for all\n@xmath . For every @xmath let @xmath and pick some @xmath with @xmath .\nThen @xmath meets @xmath in some @xmath between @xmath and @xmath (i.e.\n@xmath if @xmath and @xmath otherwise) which yields @xmath , and\nfurthermore\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nSince @xmath is finite, by pigeon-hole principle we find some infinite\n@xmath with @xmath for all @xmath . But then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nholds for all @xmath , yielding @xmath since @xmath is infinite and\n@xmath holds as well as @xmath . Thus @xmath contradicts @xmath as\ndesired. Therefore, @xmath is continuous at @xmath . \u220e\n\nSince @xmath is Hausdorff, so is @xmath , and in particular @xmath is\nalso path-connected. Hence @xmath is arc-connected by Lemma 2.4.3 , so\nwe may let @xmath be an arc in @xmath from @xmath to @xmath . Since\n@xmath only traverses auxiliary edges, Lemma 6.2.5 implies @xmath , so\n@xmath is an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath . \u220e\n\nWe involve Lemma 2.4.3 at the end of the proof since @xmath may fail to\nbe injective at ends. Indeed, consider the one-ended grid on @xmath ,\nand for each @xmath let @xmath denote the ray with vertex set @xmath .\nThen let @xmath be obtained from this grid by replacing every edge of\nevery @xmath and the egde @xmath with a copy of a @xmath (with the two\nvertices of infinite degree being identified with the endvertices of the\noriginal egde).\n\nThen @xmath admits two topological @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths in @xmath (see\nFig. 13 ), and only one of them is an auxiliary arc, while the other can\nbe obtained as @xmath for certain choices of @xmath .\n\n#### 6.4 Basic properties of auxiliary arcs\n\n###### Lemma 6.4.1.\n\nLet @xmath be a any graph, let @xmath be a vertex of @xmath and @xmath a\nsequence of vertices of @xmath with @xmath in @xmath for some end @xmath\nof @xmath . Suppose that for every @xmath we have an auxiliary arc\n@xmath from @xmath to @xmath . Then one of the following holds:\n\n1.   There is some @xmath such that @xmath contains a vertex of @xmath\n    which is the centre of an infinite star of auxiliary arcs included\n    in the union of the @xmath with leaves in @xmath . In particular,\n    that vertex dominates @xmath .\n\n2.   There is an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath included in @xmath\n    .\n\nIn either case there exists an auxiliary arc @xmath from @xmath to\n@xmath . Moreover, if all of the @xmath are tame, then so is @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe proof basically mimics two proofs from the lecture course while\ntaking care of new special cases. First, we prove the statement of the\nLemma minus the \u2018Moreover\u2019-part.\n\nInductively we define a function @xmath together with an ascending\nsequence @xmath of closed subsets of @xmath as follows: Let @xmath and\nsuppose that we are at step @xmath of the construction. Pick some @xmath\nwitnessing that @xmath is an @xmath \u2013 @xmath auxiliary arc, with @xmath\nand @xmath , and let @xmath be maximal with @xmath . Such a @xmath\nexists since @xmath is closed in @xmath and @xmath meets @xmath . Write\n@xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath be minimal with @xmath and\nlet @xmath . This completes the definition of the @xmath .\n\nIf there is some @xmath with @xmath we are done, so suppose @xmath and\nconsider the tree @xmath . We check two main cases:\n\nFor the first main case, suppose that @xmath is not locally finite,\nwitnessed by some vertex @xmath of infinite degree. Let @xmath denote\nthe @xmath -sequence of all @xmath which @xmath sends to @xmath . Since\n@xmath is an arc, and hence sequentially compact, the sequence @xmath\nhas a convergent subsequence (without loss of generality the whole\nsequence) with limit point @xmath . Clearly, @xmath is not an inner edge\npoint.\n\nFirst suppose that @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and consider any basic\nopen neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath . Without loss of\ngenerality every @xmath is contained in this neighbourhood. Since @xmath\nis the union of two half open partial edges at @xmath and every @xmath\nmeets @xmath precisely in @xmath , the only possibility for each @xmath\nis @xmath . Hence for every @xmath we have @xmath . Then @xmath must\ndominate @xmath : Assume not for a contradiction, so we find a witness\n@xmath of @xmath . Pick @xmath such that @xmath holds for all @xmath .\nThen all @xmath with @xmath meet @xmath by Lemma 6.2.3 , so by\npigeon-hole principle some two of them meet the same vertex of @xmath ,\na contradiction. Therefore, @xmath must dominate @xmath , so (i) holds.\nIn particular, @xmath admits an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath .\n\nSecond suppose that @xmath is an end @xmath of @xmath and let @xmath\nwitness @xmath . Furthermore let @xmath be big enough that @xmath holds\nfor all @xmath . Then every @xmath with @xmath meets @xmath by Lemma\n6.2.3 , so by pigeon-hole principle some two of them meet the same\nvertex of @xmath , which is impossible. Hence @xmath cannot be an end.\nThis completes the first main case.\n\nFor the second main case suppose that @xmath is locally finite. Then by\n[ 13 , Proposition 8.2.1] there is some ray @xmath in @xmath . Clearly,\nwe can see to it that @xmath . For every @xmath let @xmath . Define\n@xmath by letting @xmath traverse @xmath from @xmath to @xmath , and set\n@xmath . Then @xmath is continuous: It suffices to show continuity at 1,\nso consider some basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath and\npick @xmath such that @xmath holds for all @xmath . Since @xmath is\nfinite, Lemma 6.2.3 implies that only finitely many @xmath with @xmath\nhave points outside of @xmath . Picking @xmath bigger than these\nfinitely many @xmath ensures that @xmath maps @xmath to @xmath . Hence\n@xmath defines a topological path from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath .\nSince @xmath is compact, @xmath is Hausdorff and @xmath is a continuous\ninjection, it follows from general topology that @xmath is an arc (in\nparticular: an auxiliary arc). Thus (ii) holds and the second main case\nis complete.\n\nFor the \u2018Moreover\u2019-part, it remains to show that if all of the @xmath\nare tame, then so is @xmath . Since this is clear for (i) we may assume\nthat (ii) holds. Assume for a contradiction that @xmath is wild,\nwitnessed by some infinite @xmath on which @xmath induces the ordering\nof the rationals. If there is some @xmath such that @xmath meets @xmath\nin two distinct vertices, then @xmath is wild, which is impossible.\nHence every @xmath meets @xmath in at most one point. But then 1 is the\nonly accumulation point of @xmath in @xmath , a contradiction.\nTherefore, @xmath is tame as claimed. \u220e\n\n###### Theorem 6.4.2.\n\nLet @xmath be any graph, and let @xmath and @xmath be two distinct\npoints of @xmath . Then @xmath if and only if there exists an auxiliary\narc in from @xmath to @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe backward direction holds by Lemma 6.2.4 . For the forward direction\nwe check several cases:\n\nIf both @xmath and @xmath are vertices of @xmath we are done by Theorem\n6.3.1 , so suppose first that @xmath and @xmath . If there is some\n@xmath , then @xmath implies @xmath . Hence we find an auxiliary arc\nfrom @xmath to @xmath which we may extend to @xmath by adding the\nauxiliary edge @xmath .\n\nOtherwise @xmath is empty, so by Lemma 2.3.5 we find a sequence @xmath\nof non-empty elements of @xmath such that for all @xmath the component\n@xmath includes both @xmath and @xmath . In particular, the collection\nof all @xmath forms a countable neighbourhood basis of @xmath in @xmath\n. Since @xmath does not dominate @xmath we find some @xmath with @xmath\n, and we may choose @xmath big enough that @xmath .\n\nNow for every @xmath we wish to find some vertex @xmath in @xmath with\n@xmath . Hence consider an arbitrary @xmath and suppose for a\ncontradiction that there is some finite set of edges @xmath which\nseparates @xmath from @xmath in @xmath . Then @xmath is included in some\ncomponent of @xmath which does not contain @xmath , so @xmath is a\ncontradiction. Therefore, no finite set of edges separates @xmath from\n@xmath in @xmath . Proceeding inductively we find some infinitely many\nedge-disjoint @xmath \u2013 @xmath paths in @xmath . By pigeon-hole\nprinciple, some infinitely many of these paths agree on their endvertex\nin @xmath in the same vertex, which we choose to be @xmath . In\nparticular, @xmath holds.\n\nThen for all @xmath by Theorem 6.3.1 we find some auxiliary arc @xmath\nfrom @xmath to @xmath . Furthermore, the choice of the basic open\nneighbourhoods @xmath implies @xmath in @xmath . Applying Lemma 6.4.1\nyields some auxiliary arc @xmath from @xmath to @xmath .\n\nFinally suppose that both @xmath and @xmath are ends of @xmath , and\nwrite @xmath as well as @xmath . By Lemma 3.4.6 there is some vertex\n@xmath of @xmath in @xmath . Then @xmath together with the previous case\nyields two auxiliary arcs, one from @xmath to @xmath and one from @xmath\nto @xmath , whose union yields an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath as\ndesired. \u220e\n\n#### 6.5 External @xmathTSTs: Technical preliminaries\n\nAn @xmath TST @xmath of @xmath is external if for every auxiliary\narc-component @xmath of @xmath the space @xmath is arc-connected (i.e.\n@xmath is an @xmath TST of @xmath ). The idea behind this definition is\nthat, if we want to obtain an @xmath TST from a TST of @xmath by blowing\nup its non-trivial points in @xmath to @xmath TSTs of their respective\nauxiliary arc-components of @xmath , then we hope for the result to be\nan @xmath TST, and if it is then of course it is an external one.\n\n###### Corollary 6.5.1.\n\nLet @xmath be a graph such that every end of @xmath has a countable\nneighbourhood basis in @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath and let @xmath\nbe an auxiliary arc-component of @xmath . Then @xmath is closed.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume for a contradiction that there is some @xmath (with the closure\ntaken in @xmath ). In order to yield a contradiction, we will find an\nauxiliary arc from @xmath to a point of @xmath . Clearly, @xmath must be\nan end of @xmath , so we write @xmath . Let @xmath be an arbitrary point\nof @xmath . Using that @xmath has a countable neighbourhood basis in\n@xmath we find a sequence @xmath of points of @xmath such that @xmath\nholds in @xmath . For every @xmath we pick an arc @xmath from @xmath to\n@xmath in @xmath . In particular, the @xmath are auxiliary arcs. Hence\nLemma 6.4.1 yields an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath , a\ncontradiction. \u220e\n\nFor every @xmath and @xmath we write\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nand furthermore if @xmath is an end of @xmath we write\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Lemma 6.5.2.\n\nFor every @xmath and @xmath the set @xmath is an open subset of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nSince @xmath is finite and @xmath is Hausdorff, by Lemma 2.4.1 the set\n@xmath is a closed subset of @xmath . Thus @xmath is an open subset of\n@xmath . By Corollary 3.4.7 it is closed under @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 6.5.3.\n\nLet @xmath be a connected subset of @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath and\n@xmath be given such that @xmath meets both @xmath and @xmath . Then\n@xmath meets @xmath .\u220e\n\n###### Lemma 6.5.4.\n\nLet @xmath be an arc in @xmath , witnessed by @xmath . Suppose that\n@xmath is an accumulation point of @xmath . Then there is some unique\n@xmath with @xmath converging to @xmath in that for every @xmath there\nis some @xmath such that\n\n  -- -------- -- ------\n     @xmath      (16)\n  -- -------- -- ------\n\n###### Proof.\n\nWe start by choosing a candidate for @xmath . For this, we claim that\n\n###### Claim 1.\n\nFor every @xmath there is some @xmath and some @xmath such that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume not for a contradiction, witnessed by some @xmath . Choose @xmath\nsmall enough that @xmath avoids the finite set @xmath . Then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nholds by Lemmas 3.4.6 and 6.5.2 . By assumption, @xmath meets at least\ntwo sets of the union on the right hand side, say for @xmath . But then\nby Corollary 6.5.3 we know that @xmath meets @xmath , a contradiction. \u220e\n\nMapping every @xmath to the unique @xmath from the claim above yields a\ndirection of @xmath , and hence an end @xmath of @xmath . In particular,\nfor every @xmath there is some @xmath such that @xmath satisfies ( 16 ).\nMoreover, @xmath is unique in @xmath with this property. It remains to\nshow @xmath , so assume not for a contradiction and pick some finite cut\n@xmath of @xmath witnessing this. Since this @xmath induces an open\nneighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath there is some @xmath such that @xmath\nis included in this neighbourhood. For @xmath this contradicts ( 16 ). \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 6.5.5 (Arc Lifting).\n\nLet @xmath be a countable connected graph. Suppose that for every\nnon-singleton auxiliary arc-component @xmath of @xmath there is some\n@xmath TST @xmath of @xmath , and let @xmath be an arc in @xmath\nwitnessed by @xmath . Furthermore let @xmath and @xmath be given. Then\nthere exists an arc @xmath in @xmath from @xmath to @xmath such that\n@xmath and for every non-singleton auxiliary arc-component @xmath of\n@xmath exactly one of the following holds:\n\n1.  @xmath ;\n\n2.  @xmath is an arc in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nWe do not use Theorem 2.2.9 here since this would require us to \u2018mix\u2019\nthe spaces @xmath and @xmath .\n\nLet @xmath be the set of all non-singleton auxiliary arc-components of\n@xmath meeting @xmath . By Lemma 3.4.6 this set is countable since\n@xmath is countable. Let @xmath be the function with domain @xmath which\nsends every @xmath to @xmath . Denote by @xmath the set of all @xmath\nwhich @xmath sends to a subset of some element of @xmath . For every\n@xmath we let @xmath be the unique point of @xmath with @xmath . Then\n@xmath is a countable set. Conversely, for each @xmath we denote by\n@xmath the unique @xmath with @xmath . Write @xmath for the set of all\n@xmath which are accumulation points of @xmath , and @xmath for the set\nof all @xmath which are accumulation points of @xmath . For every @xmath\nwe define points @xmath and @xmath in @xmath as follows: If @xmath then\nwe let @xmath be the end of @xmath given by Lemma 6.5.4 . Else if @xmath\nwe set @xmath . Otherwise there is some edge @xmath of @xmath and some\n@xmath such that @xmath , and we let @xmath be the endvertex of @xmath\nin @xmath . Similarly, we define @xmath (with the case \u2018 @xmath \u2019\nreplaced by \u2018 @xmath \u2019). Let @xmath and choose some @xmath with @xmath .\nFor every @xmath we let @xmath be the unique arc in @xmath from @xmath\nto @xmath and we let @xmath be a parametrisation of @xmath . Let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand recall that for every @xmath there is some @xmath with @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nby Lemma 2.4.18 . Now we are ready to define a mapping @xmath whose\nimage we will take as @xmath . For this, let @xmath be given, and\nsuppose for the first main case that there is some @xmath with @xmath .\nIf @xmath is an inner edge point, we put @xmath . Else if @xmath sends\n@xmath to a singleton subset @xmath of @xmath , we set @xmath (note that\nwe have @xmath by definition of @xmath ). Otherwise @xmath is contained\nin @xmath and we set @xmath . This completes the first main case.\n\nFor the second main case suppose that @xmath is not in @xmath . Thus\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand we put\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ncompleting the second main case and thus the definition of @xmath .\nClearly, @xmath is injective, and for every @xmath the restriction\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nparametrises @xmath .\n\nPut @xmath . In order to verify that @xmath is the desired arc, it\nsuffices to show that @xmath is a continuous injection since @xmath is\ncompact and @xmath is Hausdorff. For this, let an arbitrary @xmath be\ngiven. Clearly, we may assume that @xmath is an end of @xmath , so we\nwrite @xmath . Consider any basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in\n@xmath . We have to find an open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath which\n@xmath maps to @xmath .\n\nIf we have @xmath for some @xmath we are done by the continuity of\n@xmath .\n\nElse if @xmath for some @xmath , say @xmath , then by choice of @xmath\nthere is some @xmath such that ( 16 ) holds, and hence @xmath maps\n@xmath to @xmath . Using the continuity of @xmath yields some @xmath\nsuch that @xmath sends the open interval @xmath to @xmath as desired.\n\nElse if @xmath for some @xmath there is some @xmath such that ( 16 )\nsymmetrically holds for both sides, and hence @xmath sends @xmath to\n@xmath .\n\nFinally if @xmath is a singleton auxiliary arc-component of @xmath\nmeeting @xmath , then let @xmath be the point of @xmath which @xmath\nmaps to @xmath (Theorem 6.4.2 and Lemma 3.4.6 yield @xmath ). Now we use\nthe continuity of @xmath to find some @xmath such that @xmath sends\n@xmath to @xmath . Then @xmath sends @xmath to @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 6.5.6.\n\nLet @xmath be an auxiliary arc-component of @xmath and let @xmath be an\nenumeration of @xmath . For every @xmath write @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nLet some @xmath be given, and let @xmath be an @xmath -sequence of\narc-components @xmath of @xmath with @xmath for all @xmath . Then there\nexists an end @xmath of @xmath such that @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe set @xmath trivially has the finite intersection property. For every\n@xmath set @xmath and let @xmath be the closure of @xmath in @xmath .\nSince the set @xmath also has the finite intersection property, so does\n@xmath . Using that @xmath is compact hence yields some @xmath .\n\nFirst we show @xmath . Clearly, @xmath avoids @xmath , so suppose for a\ncontradiction that there is some @xmath in @xmath . If @xmath meets\n@xmath , then @xmath and we may let @xmath be big enough that @xmath .\nThen due to Lemma 6.2.3 there is some component @xmath of @xmath with\n@xmath , and hence @xmath . Therefore, @xmath is an open neighbourhood\nof @xmath avoiding @xmath , yielding @xmath , a contradiction. Else if\n@xmath avoids @xmath , then by Theorem 6.4.2 there is a finite cut\n@xmath of @xmath with sides @xmath and @xmath separating @xmath from\n@xmath . Put @xmath and let @xmath be a bipartition of @xmath respecting\nthe sides of @xmath , i.e. with @xmath and @xmath . Without loss of\ngenerality we have @xmath . Then @xmath , since otherwise @xmath is\nbasic open neighbourhood of @xmath which sends no edges to @xmath ,\ncontradicting Lemma 3.2.1 . Hence @xmath is an open neighbourhood of\n@xmath avoiding @xmath , resulting in @xmath , a contradiction. Hence\n@xmath holds as claimed.\n\nFinally, we show that @xmath is a singleton: Assume not for a\ncontradiction, so we find two distinct ends @xmath and @xmath of @xmath\nin @xmath . Let @xmath be a witness of @xmath and let @xmath be big\nenough that @xmath . Then due to Lemma 6.2.3 the ends @xmath and @xmath\nare contained in distinct auxiliary arc components of @xmath ,\ncontradicting @xmath . Hence @xmath is a singleton subset of @xmath . \u220e\n\n#### 6.6 @xmathTSTs of auxiliary arc-components\n\n###### Theorem 6.6.1.\n\nIf @xmath is a countable graph, then every auxiliary arc-component of\n@xmath has an @xmath TST .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThe proof starts with the essential idea of a proof from the lecture\ncourse.\n\nLet @xmath be any non-singleton auxiliary arc-component of @xmath . If\n@xmath is finite, then any spanning tree of @xmath will do, so we may\nassume that @xmath is infinite. Pick an enumeration @xmath of @xmath and\nwrite @xmath for every @xmath . Furthermore, for every @xmath we write\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand we let the set @xmath consist of all singleton subsets of @xmath and\nall arc-components of @xmath . Then we let @xmath be the multigraph on\n@xmath whose edges are the cross-edges of @xmath with respect to @xmath\n. For each @xmath we denote by @xmath the arc-component of @xmath\ncontaining @xmath (which is in @xmath by definition). Hence @xmath can\nbe obtained from @xmath by discarding @xmath and adding @xmath as well\nas the arc-components of\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nNext, we inductively construct spanning trees @xmath of the @xmath ,\nstarting with the spanning tree @xmath of @xmath . For the induction\nstep, informally we obtain @xmath from @xmath by expanding the vertex\n@xmath of @xmath to a star in @xmath with centre @xmath and leaves the\narc-components of @xmath . Formally, we proceed as follows: Let @xmath\nbe the subgraph of @xmath whose 1-complex coincides with @xmath where\nthe closure is taken in the 1-complex of @xmath (i.e. @xmath is the\nsubgraph of @xmath induced by the inner edge points of @xmath ). Then we\nlet @xmath be the union of @xmath and an arbitrary spanning star of\n@xmath (recall that @xmath is the set consisting of @xmath and the\narc-components of @xmath ). It is easy to see that @xmath is a spanning\ntree of @xmath . Note that, by construction, for every @xmath we have\nthat every @xmath sends to each arc-component of @xmath at most one edge\nof @xmath . As a consequence, every arc-component of @xmath has finite\ndegree in @xmath .\n\nFinally, we let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich will turn out to be our desired @xmath TST of @xmath . The rest of\nthe proof is dedicated to a formal verification. By definition, @xmath\nis a standard subspace of @xmath . First, we show that @xmath is\n\u2018spanning\u2019:\n\n###### Claim 1.\n\nIf @xmath is an auxiliary arc component of @xmath for some @xmath then\neither @xmath meets @xmath or @xmath for some @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nIf @xmath avoids @xmath then @xmath also avoids @xmath , so @xmath .\nThen @xmath must be a singleton: Otherwise there is some @xmath . Pick a\nwitness @xmath of @xmath . Then @xmath meets @xmath by Lemma 6.2.3 , a\ncontradiction. \u220e\n\n###### Claim 2.\n\n@xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nBy construction we have @xmath . Let any @xmath be given; we have to\nshow @xmath .\n\nIf for every @xmath the auxiliary arc-component @xmath of @xmath\ncontaining @xmath meets @xmath we have @xmath : Indeed, consider any\nbasic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath and pick @xmath big\nenough such that @xmath . Then @xmath by Lemma 6.2.3 . Due to our\nassumption we know that @xmath meets @xmath . Hence @xmath holds. Since\n@xmath is closed and @xmath we also have @xmath .\n\nOtherwise there is some @xmath which avoids @xmath and hence @xmath . By\nClaim 1 we have @xmath , so @xmath includes the interior of an\nauxiliary-edge @xmath from @xmath to @xmath and @xmath witnesses @xmath\n. \u220e\n\nThus @xmath is \u2018spanning\u2019. Next, we show that @xmath is arc-connected:\n\n###### Claim 3.\n\nFor every @xmath there exists an arc from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nFor every @xmath there exists a unique path @xmath from @xmath to @xmath\n. Let @xmath be an arc traversing @xmath (i.e. formally @xmath is the\n1-complex of the graph @xmath ). For every @xmath we define @xmath as\nfollows: If @xmath is a point of @xmath which is also a point of @xmath\nwe put @xmath . Else if @xmath is not a point of @xmath , then @xmath\nformally is one of the following:\n\n1.  the singleton @xmath ;\n\n2.  an inner edge point of an auxiliary edge from @xmath to an\n    arc-component of @xmath ;\n\n3.  an arc-component of @xmath .\n\nIn either case we let @xmath map @xmath to @xmath , which formally is a\npoint of @xmath . Note that @xmath is a connected subset of (the\n1-complex of) @xmath and @xmath is a continuous surjection. The arcs\n@xmath together with the maps @xmath form an inverse sequence @xmath\nwhose inverse limit @xmath is an arc by Theorem 2.2.9 . We have to\ntranslate this arc into an auxiliary arc.\n\nFor this, we define @xmath as follows: Let any @xmath be given. If there\nis some @xmath such that @xmath is an inner edge point, then we put\n@xmath . Else if there are some naturals @xmath and @xmath such that\n@xmath , then we put @xmath . Both cases are well defined by definition\nof the @xmath . For the final case suppose that @xmath is an auxiliary\narc-component of @xmath for every @xmath . Then @xmath holds for all\n@xmath by definition of the bonding maps and we set @xmath for the end\n@xmath of @xmath with @xmath which exists by Lemma 6.5.6 . This\ncompletes the definition of @xmath .\n\nLet @xmath witness that @xmath is an arc. In order to show that @xmath\nis an arc it suffices to show that @xmath is a continuous injection\nsince @xmath is compact and @xmath is Hausdorff. Clearly, @xmath is\ninjective. Since @xmath is continuous, it suffices to show that @xmath\nis continuous. For this, let @xmath be any point of @xmath and let\n@xmath be any basic open neighbourhood of @xmath in @xmath .\n\nIf there exists some @xmath such that @xmath is not an arc-component of\n@xmath , then @xmath easily translates into an open neighbourhood @xmath\nof @xmath in @xmath . Letting @xmath for all @xmath with @xmath and\n@xmath results in the desired open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath .\n\nOtherwise for every @xmath the point @xmath is an arc-component of\n@xmath , and @xmath is an end @xmath of @xmath by construction. In\nparticular, @xmath is of the form @xmath for some @xmath . Let @xmath be\nbig enough that @xmath . Then Lemma 6.2.3 implies @xmath . Recall that\n@xmath is a vertex of the path @xmath . Due to @xmath there exist two\ndistinct auxiliary edges @xmath and @xmath such that @xmath is a\nhomeomorphic copy of @xmath in @xmath . Clearly, this set includes an\nopen neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath such that @xmath holds. In\nparticular, letting @xmath for all @xmath with @xmath and @xmath results\nin an open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath which @xmath sends to @xmath .\n\u220e\n\n###### Claim 4.\n\nIf @xmath is an arc in @xmath which meets two distinct auxiliary\narc-components of @xmath , then @xmath meets @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nIf not, then @xmath also avoids @xmath . Hence there exists a unique\narc-component of @xmath including @xmath , a contradiction. \u220e\n\n###### Claim 5.\n\nFor every @xmath and every arc-component @xmath of @xmath : if @xmath is\nan arc in @xmath meeting @xmath and @xmath , then @xmath meets @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nLet @xmath be a parametrisation of @xmath , without loss of generality\nwith @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath is a closed subset of @xmath by\nLemma 6.5.1 there is a maximal @xmath with @xmath . By Claim 4 we know\nthat @xmath meets @xmath , so since @xmath is finite there is some\nminimal @xmath with @xmath . Again by Claim 4 and by choice of both\n@xmath and @xmath we know that @xmath avoids @xmath . Hence @xmath is a\nconnected subset of @xmath . In particular, there is an auxiliary edge\n@xmath in @xmath with @xmath , so @xmath follows. Write @xmath with\n@xmath and @xmath . Due to @xmath , the only possibility for @xmath and\n@xmath is @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, we have @xmath as desired. \u220e\n\n###### Claim 6.\n\nFor every end @xmath of @xmath in @xmath there exists an arc from @xmath\nto @xmath in @xmath .\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nWe check two main cases.\n\nFor the first main case suppose that for every @xmath the auxiliary\narc-component @xmath of @xmath containing @xmath meets @xmath in some\n@xmath . Then we use Claim 3 to find an auxiliary arc @xmath from @xmath\nto @xmath in @xmath for every @xmath . We have @xmath in @xmath :\nConsider any basic open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath and let\n@xmath be big enough that @xmath . Then Lemma 6.2.3 yields @xmath which\nimplies @xmath for all @xmath . If Lemma 6.4.1 yields an auxiliary arc\nfrom @xmath to @xmath included in @xmath then we are done. Otherwise\nLemma 6.4.1 yields some @xmath and a vertex @xmath on @xmath which is\nthe centre of an infinite star of auxiliary arcs included in @xmath and\nwith leaves in @xmath . But then Claim 5 applied to the infinitely many\narcs from @xmath to the @xmath in that fan implies that @xmath is a\nvertex of @xmath with infinite degree in @xmath , which is impossible\n(as argued at the end of the construction of the trees @xmath ).\n\nFor the second main case suppose that there is some @xmath such that\n@xmath avoids @xmath . Then @xmath holds by Claim 1 , so @xmath includes\nthe interior of some auxiliary edge from some @xmath to @xmath . If\n@xmath we are done. Otherwise, by Claim 3 there is an auxiliary arc from\n@xmath to @xmath in @xmath , which @xmath extends to an auxiliary arc\nfrom @xmath to @xmath in @xmath . \u220e\n\nThus, @xmath is arc-connected.\n\n###### Claim 7.\n\n@xmath is acirclic.\n\n###### Proof of the Claim.\n\nSuppose for a contradiction that @xmath contains a circle @xmath . By\nLemma 6.2.5 we know that @xmath traverses an auxiliary-edge, so in\nparticular @xmath contains a vertex of @xmath . Let @xmath be minimal\nwith @xmath . Then @xmath avoids @xmath . Let @xmath be an auxiliary\nedge at @xmath which @xmath traverses, and let @xmath be the auxiliary\narc-component of @xmath containing the other endvertex of @xmath (which\nexists by choice of @xmath ). Now consider the arc @xmath . Since @xmath\nmeets both @xmath and @xmath , Claim 5 together with the choice of\n@xmath yields that @xmath traverses some @xmath . But then we have\n@xmath , i.e. @xmath has two parallel edges, contradicting the fact that\n@xmath is a spanning tree of @xmath . \u220e\n\nThis completes the proof that @xmath is an @xmath TST of @xmath . \u220e\n\n#### 6.7 Tree-packing\n\nA circle in @xmath is a homeomorphic copy of the unit circle. If @xmath\nis a subgraph of @xmath , then the closure of @xmath in @xmath where\n@xmath is the equivalence class used to obtain @xmath from @xmath (cf.\nSection 2.5 ) is said to be a standard subspace of @xmath . Clearly,\nevery circle in @xmath is a standard subspace. A standard subspace of\n@xmath is said to be spanning if it includes @xmath . A topological\nspanning tree (TST) of @xmath is a uniquely arc-connected spanning\nstandard subspace of @xmath . These definitions are equivalent to those\nof Miraftab [ 22 , Chapter 5] . \u00b3\u2076 \u00b3\u2076 36 Note that Miraftab writes\n@xmath for @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 6.7.1 ([22, Lemma 22]).\n\nSuppose that @xmath is a countable connected graph. A standard subspace\n@xmath of @xmath is arc-connected if and only if @xmath contains an edge\nfrom every finite cut of @xmath of which it meets both sides (taken in\n@xmath ).\n\n###### Lemma 6.7.2.\n\nSuppose that @xmath is a countable connected graph. If for every finite\npartition of @xmath , into @xmath sets say, @xmath has at least @xmath\ncross-edges, then @xmath has @xmath edge-disjoint arc-connected spanning\nstandard subspaces.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nThis easily follows from mimicking the proof of [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.8]\nwhere we replace\n\n1.  the @xmath by the @xmath from the inverse system @xmath ,\n\n2.  [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.5] by Lemma 6.7.1 ,\n\n3.  [ 13 , Lemma 8.1.2] by Lemma 2.2.4 ,\n\nand finally use Lemma 3.4.11 for @xmath . \u220e\n\nThe following Lemma can be proved analogously to [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.9]\n(with [ 13 , Lemma 8.5.5] replaced by Lemma 6.7.1 in the proof):\n\n###### Lemma 6.7.3 (@xmath).\n\nSuppose that @xmath is a countable connected graph. Then every connected\nspanning standard subspace of @xmath includes a TST of @xmath .\u220e\n\n###### Theorem 6.7.4.\n\nLet @xmath be a countable connected graph. \u00b3\u2077 \u00b3\u2077 37 Multigraph should\nnot be a problem. Then the following are equivalent for all @xmath :\n\n1.  @xmath has @xmath external @xmath TST s which are edge-disjoint on\n    @xmath .\n\n2.  @xmath has at least @xmath edges across any finite vertex partition\n    @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\n(i) @xmath (ii). Using Lemma 6.2.4 this holds by the same argumentation\nas in the proof of [ 13 , Theorem 8.5.7] .\n\n(ii) @xmath (i). For this proof we treat @xmath as @xmath (recall\nTheorem 3.4.14 ). Applying Lemmas 6.7.2 and 6.7.3 yields @xmath\nedge-disjoint TSTs @xmath of @xmath . Let @xmath be the set of all\nnon-singleton auxiliary arc-components of @xmath . For every @xmath we\napply Theorem 6.6.1 to find an @xmath TST @xmath of @xmath , and for\neach @xmath we set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen every @xmath is acirclic: Assume not for a contradiction, witnessed\nby some circle @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath avoids all finite cuts of @xmath , then @xmath being connected\ntogether with Lemma 6.2.4 yields @xmath for some @xmath , which is\nimpossible.\n\nOtherwise @xmath meets some finite cut @xmath of @xmath in some edge\n@xmath . Then @xmath is an arc in @xmath . By Lemma 6.2.4 we know that\n@xmath satisfies the premise of Lemma 6.7.1 , so @xmath is still\nconnected which is impossible. Thus @xmath is acirclic.\n\nFurthermore, every @xmath is arc-connected: For this, let any two\ndistinct points @xmath and @xmath of @xmath be given (without loss of\ngenerality none of @xmath and @xmath is in @xmath ). If @xmath , then by\nTheorem 6.4.2 there is some @xmath containing @xmath and @xmath , so we\nfind an arc from @xmath to @xmath in @xmath and hence in @xmath .\nOtherwise @xmath holds, and we let @xmath be an arc in @xmath from\n@xmath to @xmath . Then Lemma 6.5.5 lifts @xmath to an arc from @xmath\nto @xmath in @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 6.7.5.\n\nEvery countable connected graph has an @xmath TST .\u220e\n\n#### 6.8 Outlook: limit thin sums\n\nWhile we managed to construct auxiliary arcs without imposing any\ncardinality bounds on @xmath , we proved tree-packing only for countable\nconnected @xmath . On the one hand, this is needed for the Arc Lifting\nLemma\u00a0( 6.5.5 ) to work. But on the other hand we used it to obtain\n@xmath TSTs of auxiliary arc-components of @xmath , and we would like to\nknow whether these exist for arbitrary @xmath , too. Also, we would like\nto know whether there is a connection to dendrites.\n\nThere exist various obstructions to naive generalisations of thins sums\nof circles. For example, if @xmath is just a dominated ray embedded into\nthe plane, and if our thin family consists of all the (inner) facial\ncycles of @xmath , then their sum should yield the ray plus the sole\nauxiliary edge since the ray itself is an NST and hence induces an\n@xmath TST. Hence we could modify the definition of a thin sum in that\nwe also add certain auxiliary edges. For example, if @xmath has no\nultrafilter tangles, and if @xmath is a thin family of circuits, then a\ncandidate for such a thin sum could be\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\nOn the other hand, investigation of @xmath from the next section should\nbe prioritised.\n\n## Part II Partial results\n\n### 7 A tangle Hausdorff compactification\n\nThe introduction of Chapter 6 motivated the auxiliary space @xmath after\nmotivating the Hausdorff compactification @xmath . Hence in this\nchapter, we immediately begin with the formal construction of @xmath .\n\n#### 7.1 Construction\n\nRecall section 4 . For every @xmath and @xmath put\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand for each @xmath put\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFurthermore, for every @xmath we denote by @xmath the finite partition\nof @xmath induced by @xmath and the singleton subsets of @xmath . Let\n@xmath be the graph on @xmath with edge set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe edges in @xmath are the limit edges . For every @xmath we let @xmath\nbe the multigraph on @xmath whose edges are precisely the cross-edges of\n@xmath with respect to @xmath . Vertices of @xmath that are singleton\nsubsets @xmath of @xmath we consider to be vertices of @xmath and refer\nto them as @xmath ; the other vertices of @xmath are its dummy vertices\n. Now we let @xmath be the topological space obtained from the ground\nset of the 1-complex of @xmath by endowing it with the topology\ngenerated by the following basis:\n\nFor every @xmath and @xmath we choose @xmath . For every inner edge\npoint of an edge that is an edge of @xmath we choose the usual open\nneighbourhoods. For every dummy vertex @xmath of @xmath and every @xmath\nwe choose as open the set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIf @xmath is an inner edge point of an edge @xmath with @xmath , i.e.\nthere is some @xmath and some @xmath with @xmath , then for every @xmath\nwith @xmath and every finite @xmath we declare as open the set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nalso see Fig. 14 .\n\n###### Lemma 7.1.1.\n\n@xmath is a compact Hausdorff topological space for every @xmath .\n\nFor every @xmath we define a bonding map @xmath which sends the vertices\nof @xmath to the vertices of @xmath including them; which is the\nidentity on the edges of @xmath that are also edges of @xmath ; and\nwhich sends any other edge of @xmath to the dummy vertex of @xmath that\ncontains both its endvertices in @xmath .\n\n###### Lemma 7.1.2.\n\nThe @xmath are continuous.\n\nBy Lemmas 7.1.1 and 2.2.3 the inverse limit\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis compact Hausdorff.\n\n#### 7.2 Outlook\n\nCall a continuum @xmath TST-like if for every two distinct points @xmath\nand @xmath of @xmath the set @xmath endowed with the subspace topology\nis a subcontinuum of @xmath . Recall that, by Theorem 2.4.8 the space\n@xmath is linearly ordered by its separation ordering, and by Theorem\n2.4.9 the subspace topology on @xmath coincides with its order topology.\nIf @xmath is a subgraph of @xmath where each @xmath is incident with a\nlimit edge in @xmath , then we write @xmath for its closure in @xmath\nand call this closure a standard subspace . If @xmath is any graph and\n@xmath is a standard subspace of @xmath with @xmath , then we say that\n@xmath is spanning . A TST of @xmath is a spanning standard subspace of\n@xmath that is also a TST-like subcontinuum of @xmath . A circle @xmath\nof @xmath is a subcontinuum of @xmath such that @xmath is disconnected\nfor every two distinct points @xmath and @xmath of @xmath . \u00b3\u2078 \u00b3\u2078 38 We\nshould not need the additional requirement that @xmath be connected: an\narc minus its two endpoints is still connected, and hence not a circle.\nAlso see the claim of [ 28 , Theorem 28.14] .\n\n###### Conjecture 7.2.1.\n\nIf @xmath is any graph, then @xmath admits a TST.\n\n###### Idea.\n\nBy transfinite usage of Theorem 2.4.6 we can find a subcontinuum @xmath\nof @xmath such that\n\n1.  @xmath .\n\n2.  For every edge @xmath of @xmath the space @xmath is disconnected.\n\nFinally, use Theorem 2.4.7 to find a subcontinuum @xmath of @xmath which\nis irreducible about @xmath . It remains to show that @xmath is a\nTST-like standard subspace of @xmath . (If @xmath is not standard, a\ntransfinite approach should work instead of Theorem 2.4.7 , but here we\nhave to remove open neighbourhoods of inner edge points of limit edges\nwith @xmath and @xmath .) \u220e\n\n### 8 ETop and the maximal Hausdorff quotient\n\n#### 8.1 Introduction\n\nSince for connected graphs @xmath the quotient @xmath is a Hausdorff\nquotient of @xmath with @xmath by Theorem 3.4.14 , one might ask whether\nit is the maximal Hausdorff quotient of @xmath . In this chapter, we\nstudy for which graphs @xmath the space @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff\nquotient of the tangle compactification. In order to keep things to the\npoint, we introduce some notation first: Recall that the relation @xmath\nis defined on @xmath by letting @xmath whenever there exist no two\ndisjoint open neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath in @xmath , and @xmath\ndenotes the transitive closure of @xmath . Since @xmath is an\nequivalence relation, we write @xmath for the quotient space @xmath .\nThe equivalence relation @xmath on @xmath satisfying @xmath is given by\nTheorem 2.4.16 . Due to Corollary 3.4.4 , the minimality of @xmath and\nthe definition of @xmath we have\n\n###### Lemma 8.1.1.\n\n@xmath holds for every graph @xmath .\u220e\n\nNow we are ready to start: Of course, the first question that comes to\nmind, is whether there even exist graphs for which @xmath is not the\nmaximal Hausdorff quotient, i.e. for which @xmath is a proper subset of\n@xmath . Surprisingly, a long known example graph positively answers\nthis question:\n\nThe graph @xmath from [ 8 , Fig. 6] , also pictured in Fig. 15 here,\noriginally served as an example of a non-finitely separable graph on\nwhich the relation used to obtain ITop as a quotient of VTop is an\nequivalence relation (i.e. for which ITop is well-defined even though\n@xmath is not finitely separable) and which has no topological spanning\ntree with respect to ITop . Even more strikingly, in ITop this graph\nadmits an edgeless Hamilton circle (which witnesses the absence of\ntopological spanning trees, see [ 8 , Proposition 3.4 and Corollary 3.5]\nfor details). In this graph, @xmath identifies every two points of\n@xmath , whereas ITop identified every vertex with the two ends it\ndominates. Unsurprisingly, @xmath identifies the same points as ITop\ndid:\n\nClearly, it suffices to show that this graph has no ultrafilter tangles.\nFor this, consider any @xmath . Then @xmath is finite: Indeed, let\n@xmath be the union of @xmath and the first @xmath levels of the\nunderlying binary tree of @xmath , where @xmath is big enough that\n@xmath is included in @xmath . Now @xmath is easily seen to be finite,\nand so @xmath must be finite. Hence every @xmath is finite, so @xmath\nhas no ultrafilter tangles as claimed.\n\nBy arguments similar to an exercise from the lectures, it follows that\n@xmath is Hausdorff (we shifted the proof to the end of the\nintroduction):\n\n###### Lemma 8.1.2 (@xmath).\n\nThere is a connected graph with @xmath .\n\nFurthermore, the edgeless Hamilton circle from ITop also is one in\n@xmath , so @xmath has no TST either. All in all, this graph shows a\nsufficiently rich structure of finite vertex separators branching in a\nbinary tree like way (the separators of the form @xmath with @xmath a\nvertex of the NST @xmath of @xmath given by the underlying binary tree\nplus the edge @xmath ) can force @xmath even though the graph does not\nhave a single finite cut.\n\nSo @xmath and @xmath in general do not coincide. As a @xmath shows,\n@xmath in general is not transitive, but maybe @xmath coincides with\n@xmath for every graph? An easy example shows that this is not the case:\n\nIf @xmath is an undominated end of an arbitrary graph, then clearly\n@xmath holds. The graph @xmath pictured above shows that @xmath is\npossible: Indeed, @xmath holds while @xmath and @xmath agree on the\nvertex set of @xmath . Thus @xmath turns this graph into hawaiian\nearrings and @xmath does the same except for @xmath which does not get\nidentified with any other point. Taking a closer look reveals that\n@xmath is not closed in @xmath , witnessed by @xmath , so @xmath is not\neven T @xmath by Lemma 2.4.1 . Meanwhile, @xmath and @xmath coincide.\n\nSo if the @xmath -classes in general are not closed, then perhaps taking\ntheir closures might suffice? If (by abuse of notation) we define @xmath\nto be the relation on @xmath with @xmath whenever there is some @xmath\n-class whose closure in @xmath contains both @xmath and @xmath , then\nthe following example shows that neither of @xmath and its transitive\nclosure do suffice:\n\nIndeed, if @xmath is the graph pictured in Fig. 17 , then the @xmath is\nnot an equivalence relation: For every double ray of heavy edges, its\nvertices of infinite degree (in @xmath ) form a @xmath -class, and these\nare the only non-trivial @xmath -classes, so every end @xmath with\n@xmath lies in the closure of two distinct @xmath -classes. Thus, the\nonly non-trivial equivalence class of the transitive closure of @xmath\nconsist of all vertices of @xmath of infinite degree together with all\nends @xmath ( @xmath ). Since the end @xmath is excluded from this\nclass, the quotient @xmath fails to be T @xmath .\n\nAs described in the preliminaries of Theorem 2.4.17 , it is possible to\nobtain @xmath from @xmath via a transfinite construction. The graph from\nFig. 17 can also be used to show that there exists no ordinal @xmath\nsuch that @xmath holds for every graph @xmath (where @xmath is defined\nin Section 2.4 ). Indeed, assume for a contradiction that there is such\nan @xmath , and let @xmath be the graph pictured in Fig. 17 . Put @xmath\n. For every @xmath there is a subgraph @xmath corresponding to @xmath\njust like the red subgraph of @xmath corresponds to @xmath . To obtain\nthe graph @xmath from @xmath we replace the red subgraph @xmath of\n@xmath with a copy of @xmath where the vertices @xmath and @xmath of the\ncopy take over the roles of @xmath and @xmath of the original @xmath ,\nrespectively, and we do the same for every other @xmath . Next we obtain\n@xmath from @xmath by replacing the @xmath of each copy of @xmath that\nwas added in the previous construction step in the same way. Proceeding\ninductively, we arrive at a graph @xmath for which @xmath is not\nHausdorff, contradicting our assumption.\n\nNow that all straightforward attempts starting \u2018from below\u2019 with @xmath\nfailed and the graph from Fig. 17 showed that a sufficiently rich\nstructure can result in @xmath , we will try a different approach.\nReaders who attended a talk by Diestel about the discovery of\ntopological infinite graph theory already noticed that every example\ngraph from this introduction is based on a graph which occurred in his\ntalks. In these talk, the examples led to the definition of a circle and\nthe usage of arcs instead of (graph-)paths. So, perhaps some sort of\nspecial arcs might describe the @xmath -classes?\n\nFor the example graphs from Fig. 18 this does not work: If @xmath is the\nleft graph, then every arc (in @xmath ) from the sole end of @xmath to\nits dominating vertex must visit some vertex of finite degree.\nSimilarly, every arc between the two vertices of infinite degree of the\nright graph must visit some vertex of finite degree. Furthermore,\narc-constructions in graphs that are not locally finite face various\nproblems. But, what if we enrich @xmath with some auxiliary structure\nreflecting our intuition? Let us have a second look at the example\ngraphs discussed so far, but this time we draw in auxiliary arcs (using\ngrey):\n\nFor the simple examples things look fine, and after choosing a more\nconvenient drawing, the edgeless Hamilton circle from Fig. 15 can be\nvisualised by an auxiliary Hamilton circle:\n\nWe have already seen that for the graph @xmath from Figures 15 and 22\nthe quotient @xmath is not the maximal Hausdorff quotient of @xmath . In\nfact, we shall see later that auxiliary arc components describe\nprecisely the @xmath -classes. But not all is lost: The auxiliary\nHamilton circle failing to describe the @xmath -classes is wild, while\nthe auxiliary arcs from our other examples are all tame. \u00b3\u2079 \u00b3\u2079 39 Recall\nthat an arc is called wild if it induces on some subset of its vertices\nthe ordering of the rationals, and tame otherwise. So perhaps we can use\nthis in order to characterise the graphs with @xmath ?\n\nI did not succeed in finding a combinatorial characterisation of the\ngraphs @xmath satisfying @xmath . However, as our main contribution we\nat least present sufficient combinatorial conditions. In Section 8.5 we\nwill discuss the main difficulty prohibiting me from giving a\ncombinatorial characterisation. Basically, the difficulty lies in\ndescribing a limit property (here: wild and tame), which excludes naive\ninverse limit approaches right from the start.\n\nBefore we continue, we give a proof of a fact we used earlier:\n\n###### Proof of Lemma\u00a08.1.2.\n\nLet @xmath be the graph from Fig. 15 , and consider @xmath for\nsimplicity. Furthermore, let @xmath be the underlying binary tree of\n@xmath , and note that it is an NST of @xmath (with root @xmath ). It\nsuffices to verify that @xmath is Hausdorff. Therefore, let @xmath be\ngiven. We have to find disjoint open neighbourhoods of @xmath and @xmath\nin @xmath which are @xmath -closed. Since the only non-trivial @xmath\n-classes are of the form @xmath with @xmath a vertex of @xmath , without\nloss of generality we may assume that @xmath and @xmath are vertices of\n@xmath . Let @xmath map each 0-1 sequence (finite or infinite) to its\nnaturally corresponding value in @xmath , and let @xmath map every end\n@xmath to the image of the binary sequence induced by @xmath under the\nmap @xmath . We check two cases:\n\nFirst suppose that @xmath and @xmath are incomparable with respect to\n@xmath . Then we define an open neighbourhood @xmath of @xmath in @xmath\nby taking the union of @xmath with the following choices of sets: for\nevery @xmath choose\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n              @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nSimilarly, we define @xmath . These clearly are disjoint and @xmath\n-closed.\n\nNow suppose that @xmath and @xmath are comparable with respect to @xmath\nwith @xmath , say. Without loss of generality suppose that the first\ndigit of the 0-1 sequence @xmath after @xmath is 1 (the other case\nfollows by symmetry). Next, we pick some @xmath and let @xmath be some\nnormal ray in @xmath whose end in @xmath corresponds to @xmath . In\nparticular there are some @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath . For every\n@xmath we define @xmath as follows: If @xmath we let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand @xmath otherwise. Similarly, for every @xmath we define @xmath as\nfollows: If @xmath we let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand @xmath otherwise. Furthermore, for every @xmath we let @xmath denote\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand similarly for every @xmath we let @xmath denote\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFinally let\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor @xmath . Clearly, @xmath and @xmath are open and disjoint. We show\nthat @xmath is @xmath -closed (then @xmath will be @xmath -closed by an\nanalogue argument).\n\nFor this, we first show that if @xmath is an end in @xmath dominated by\na vertex @xmath then @xmath is also in @xmath . If @xmath is in some\n@xmath , then clearly @xmath holds. Otherwise @xmath is an end in some\n@xmath . If @xmath then we are done, so suppose not. Due to @xmath the\nnormal ray @xmath of @xmath starts with @xmath and @xmath is in @xmath\nsince @xmath is normal. Pick @xmath with @xmath . By @xmath we have\n@xmath . The only two possibilities for @xmath are @xmath and @xmath ,\nbut the first case is impossible due to @xmath and choice of @xmath , so\nwe have @xmath . Since the sequence @xmath is an initial segment of\n@xmath this yields @xmath as desired. Thus we have @xmath as claimed.\n\nSecond, we show that if @xmath is a vertex in @xmath dominating an end\n@xmath then @xmath is also in @xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath represent\nthe same rational and by the construction of @xmath , it suffices to\nshow that the ends in @xmath correspond to @xmath , i.e. that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nSince \u201c @xmath \u201d is clear we show \u201c @xmath \u201d. Given any @xmath pick\n@xmath with @xmath and let @xmath be maximal with @xmath . Then @xmath\nimplies @xmath . If @xmath then @xmath for some @xmath due to @xmath .\nOtherwise @xmath and @xmath holds.\n\nSince the only non-trivial @xmath -classes are of the form @xmath it\nfollows from the two claims above that @xmath is @xmath -closed. \u220e\n\n#### 8.2 A first sufficient combinatorial condition\n\nCall a graph @xmath simply-branching if @xmath and @xmath agree on\n@xmath . This is a combinatorial definition since Corollary 3.2.5\ncombinatorially describes @xmath on @xmath .\n\n###### Example 8.2.1.\n\nThe graph pictured in Fig. 16 is simply-branching, while the graphs from\nFigs. 17 and 15 are not.\n\n###### Proposition 8.2.2.\n\nLet @xmath be a simply-branching graph with finitely many components.\nThen @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nWe show @xmath . Recall that @xmath is Hausdorff by Corollary 3.4.4 , so\n@xmath holds by minimality of @xmath . Assume for a contradiction that\n@xmath holds, and pick any two distinct points @xmath witnessing this,\ni.e. with @xmath and @xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath agree on @xmath ,\neither @xmath meets @xmath and @xmath , or both @xmath and @xmath are in\n@xmath . We thus check two main cases:\n\nFor the first main case suppose @xmath and @xmath , say. Write @xmath\nand @xmath . We check two subcases:\n\nFirst suppose @xmath and pick any @xmath which exists since @xmath has\nonly finitely many components. Thus @xmath holds by Lemma 3.2.1 , and\nfurthermore @xmath implies @xmath . In particular @xmath , so @xmath is\na contradiction.\n\nFor the second subcase suppose @xmath and write @xmath . If @xmath is\ndominated by any vertex @xmath then clearly @xmath as well as @xmath ,\nyielding @xmath , a contradiction. So we may assume that @xmath is\nundominated. By Lemma 2.4.1 it suffices to show that @xmath lies in the\nclosure of @xmath in @xmath to yield @xmath . Applying Lemma 2.3.5 to\nthe undominated end @xmath of @xmath yields a sequence @xmath of\nnon-empty elements of @xmath such that for all @xmath the component\n@xmath includes both @xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, the collection\n@xmath is a countable neighbourhood basis of @xmath in @xmath . Since\n@xmath is undominated, we may assume that @xmath is not in @xmath . By\nLemma 3.4.7 we know that every @xmath meets @xmath in some vertex @xmath\n, so in particular every @xmath meets @xmath since @xmath implies @xmath\nby assumption. Thus every @xmath meets @xmath as desired, resulting in\n@xmath , a contradiction. This completes the second subcase and the\nfirst main case.\n\nNow suppose both @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath and write @xmath . We\nwill check two subcases:\n\nFirst suppose @xmath and @xmath , say. As before, pick @xmath and note\n@xmath as well as @xmath . Hence @xmath , since otherwise @xmath is a\ncontradiction. But then we derive a contradiction for @xmath and @xmath\nfrom the second subcase of the first main case.\n\nFor the second subcase suppose both @xmath are in @xmath . Since @xmath\nthere is some vertex @xmath by Lemma 3.4.6 . Then @xmath by the second\nsubcase of the first main case, a contradiction. \u220e\n\n#### 8.3 Auxiliary arcs and the maximal Hausdorff quotient\n\nAn arc is called wild if it induces on some subset of @xmath the\nordering of the rationals, and tame otherwise. Let @xmath be a function\nwith domain @xmath that is the identity on @xmath and which assigns some\nelement of @xmath to @xmath for every @xmath . We define the equivalence\nrelation @xmath on @xmath by letting @xmath whenever there is some tame\nauxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath or @xmath . \u2074\u2070 \u2074\u2070 40 One special\ncase which led to this definition is the following: If @xmath is such\nthat @xmath then our definition must ensure @xmath . By Theorem 3.3.5\nthe equivalence relation @xmath is well defined.\n\nNext, we introduce a definition which helps us in that it describes\n\u2018good\u2019 open subsets of @xmath . Suppose that @xmath is an equivalence\nrelation on @xmath . An open subset @xmath of @xmath which is closed\nunder @xmath is called @xmath - standard if it satisfies the following\nthree conditions for every edge @xmath of @xmath :\n\n1.  If @xmath contains both endvertices of @xmath , then also @xmath .\n\n2.  If @xmath contains exactly one endvertex of @xmath , say @xmath ,\n    then @xmath .\n\n3.  If @xmath avoids both endvertices of @xmath , then @xmath also\n    avoids @xmath .\n\nEvery open subset @xmath of @xmath which is @xmath -closed induces an\n@xmath -standard subset @xmath of @xmath , where @xmath is the union of\nthe following choice of sets:\n\nFor every @xmath choose @xmath .\n\nFor every @xmath let @xmath be a basic open neighbourhood included in\n@xmath , and choose @xmath .\n\nFor every edge @xmath of @xmath we check three cases: If both\nendvertices of @xmath are in @xmath , then we choose @xmath . Else if\nprecisely one endvertex of @xmath is in @xmath , say @xmath , then we\nchoose @xmath . Otherwise no endvertex of @xmath is in @xmath and we\nchoose the empty set.\n\nFor every auxiliary edge @xmath with one endvertex in @xmath we know\nthat both endvertices must be in @xmath , and hence we choose @xmath .\n\nThis completes the definition of @xmath .\n\n###### Observation 8.3.1.\n\nIf @xmath is an open subset of @xmath which is @xmath -closed, then\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIf @xmath and @xmath are two disjoint open subsets of @xmath which are\n@xmath -closed, then @xmath and @xmath are disjoint.\n\n###### Lemma 8.3.2.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be two vertices of @xmath with @xmath and let\n@xmath be an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath . Then there is a\nvertex @xmath distinct from @xmath and @xmath with @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nPut @xmath . By Observation 8.3.1 we find two disjoint @xmath -standard\nneighbourhoods @xmath of @xmath and @xmath of @xmath in @xmath . Since\n@xmath is connected there is some point @xmath . In particular, @xmath\nholds.\n\nIf @xmath is a vertex of @xmath we are done.\n\nElse if @xmath is an inner edge point of some edge @xmath of @xmath ,\nthen @xmath must be an auxiliary edge with endvertices @xmath and @xmath\n, say. In particular, one of @xmath and @xmath is a vertex of @xmath ,\nsay @xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath are @xmath -standard, @xmath\nimplies that all of @xmath avoids @xmath , so we are done with @xmath .\n\nFinally assume that @xmath is an end of @xmath and write @xmath . Next,\nlet @xmath be the complete graph on @xmath . For every edge @xmath of\n@xmath we use Observation 8.3.1 to yield two disjoint @xmath -standard\nneighbourhoods @xmath of @xmath and @xmath of @xmath in @xmath . Then we\nlet @xmath be the intersection over all sets @xmath where @xmath is an\nedge of @xmath at @xmath . By Lemma 6.2.5 we find some auxiliary edge\n@xmath of @xmath together with some @xmath . Then @xmath is in both\n@xmath and @xmath by choice of @xmath . Since both of these are @xmath\n-standard, both contain the endvertices of @xmath , and so does @xmath .\nThen one of the endvertices of @xmath is a vertex of @xmath in @xmath ,\nand this vertex can take on the role of @xmath by choice of @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Corollary 8.3.3.\n\nLet @xmath and @xmath be two distinct vertices of a graph @xmath with\n@xmath . Then every auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath is wild.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy Lemma 8.3.2 between every two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of\n@xmath on @xmath with @xmath there is a vertex @xmath of @xmath on\n@xmath with @xmath . Iterating this lemma, starting with @xmath and\n@xmath , yields a subset of @xmath on which @xmath induces the ordering\nof the rationals. \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 8.3.4.\n\nFor every graph @xmath we have @xmath on @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nAssume not for a contradiction, witnessed by two distinct vertices\n@xmath and @xmath , i.e. with @xmath and @xmath . Pick a tame auxiliary\narc @xmath from @xmath to @xmath witnessing @xmath . Then the existence\nof @xmath contradicts Corollary 8.3.3 . \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 8.3.5.\n\nIf @xmath is a graph such that every auxiliary arc is tame, then @xmath\nholds on @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nSuppose that two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath of @xmath are given\nwith @xmath . Then @xmath holds by Lemma 8.1.1 . Using Theorem 6.3.1 we\nfind an auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath , which is tame by\nassumption, so we have @xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Lemma 8.3.6.\n\nLet @xmath be a graph with finitely many components such that every\nauxiliary arc is tame. Then @xmath holds.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy Lemmas 8.3.4 & 8.3.5 together with Theorem 6.3.1 we know that\n\n1.   The three equivalence relations @xmath , @xmath and @xmath agree on\n    @xmath .\n\nWe show \u201c @xmath \u201d.\n\n\u201c @xmath \u201d. This follows from Corollary 3.4.4 and minimality of @xmath .\n\n\u201c @xmath \u201d. Let @xmath be given with @xmath . We check several cases:\n\nIf both @xmath and @xmath are in @xmath , then we are done by Theorem\n6.4.2 combined with the assumption that all auxiliary arcs are tame.\n\nNext, suppose that @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and @xmath is an\nultrafilter tangle, and write @xmath and @xmath . Then we pick some\n@xmath . Recall that @xmath holds by Lemma 3.2.1 , so \u201c @xmath \u201d implies\n@xmath . In particular, @xmath holds, which implies @xmath , and hence\n@xmath by @xmath . By definition of @xmath , this yields @xmath .\n\nNow suppose that @xmath is an ultrafilter tangle and @xmath is an end of\n@xmath , and write @xmath and @xmath . Pick @xmath and note that @xmath\nholds as before. Furthermore, @xmath implies @xmath . Hence @xmath\nfollows by a previous case. Together with @xmath this yields @xmath .\n\nFinally suppose both @xmath and @xmath are ends of @xmath and write\n@xmath and @xmath . By Lemma 3.4.6 there is some vertex @xmath of @xmath\nin @xmath . Then @xmath implies @xmath by a previous case, and therefore\n@xmath .\n\n\u201c @xmath \u201d. Let @xmath be given with @xmath and let @xmath be some tame\nauxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath . By @xmath , not both @xmath and\n@xmath are vertices of @xmath . We check several cases:\n\nFirst, suppose that @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and @xmath is an\nultrafilter tangle, and write @xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, write\n@xmath and recall that @xmath is a vertex in @xmath . In particular, we\nhave @xmath , which implies @xmath by @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath holds\nby Lemma 3.2.1 . Together with @xmath , this yields @xmath .\n\nNext, suppose that @xmath is a vertex of @xmath and @xmath is an end of\n@xmath , and write @xmath and @xmath . Assume for a contradiction that\n@xmath holds, witnessed by some disjoint open neighbourhoods @xmath of\n@xmath and @xmath of @xmath in @xmath , respectively, which are both\n@xmath -closed. By Lemma 6.2.5 there is some auxiliary edge @xmath whose\ninterior meets @xmath and which @xmath traverses. In particular, since\n@xmath is @xmath -standard, we know that the whole edge @xmath is\nincluded in @xmath . Let @xmath be an endvertex of @xmath which is also\na vertex of @xmath . Then @xmath holds, but also @xmath witnessed by a\ntame auxiliary arc @xmath . This contradicts @xmath , so @xmath must\nhold as desired.\n\nNow suppose that @xmath is an ultrafilter tangle of @xmath and @xmath is\nan end of @xmath , and write @xmath and @xmath . Pick @xmath and note\n@xmath as well as @xmath due to @xmath . Hence @xmath holds by the\nprevious case. Together with @xmath this yields @xmath .\n\nFinally, suppose that both @xmath and @xmath are ends of @xmath , and\nwrite @xmath and @xmath . Pick some @xmath witnessing @xmath . Then\n@xmath meets @xmath in some vertex @xmath of @xmath due to Observation\n6.2.3 . Then @xmath implies @xmath by an earlier case, and hence @xmath\nfollows. \u220e\n\n#### 8.4 A second sufficient combinatorial condition\n\n###### Lemma 8.4.1.\n\nIf @xmath is a connected graph such that for every @xmath the graph\n@xmath has a normal spanning tree @xmath whose subtree @xmath contains\nno subdivision of the (infinite) binary tree, then all auxiliary arcs\n(in @xmath ) are tame.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath be any auxiliary arc, and assume for a contradiction that it\nis wild, witnessed by some infinite set @xmath of vertices of @xmath on\nwhich it induces the ordering of the rationals. By Lemma 6.2.4 we know\nthat there is some unique @xmath with @xmath . For every @xmath write\n@xmath and put @xmath , taking as root for @xmath the root of @xmath .\nBy [ 13 , Proposition 8.6.1] the rooted tree @xmath is recursively\nprunable, so we may assume that every vertex of @xmath receives an\nordinal label by some fixed recursive pruning of @xmath . For every\n@xmath let @xmath be the minimal ordinal label of the vertices of @xmath\n.\n\n###### Claim 1.\n\nIf @xmath receives label @xmath , then @xmath holds.\n\n###### Proof.\n\nEvery vertex @xmath of @xmath receives label @xmath by minimality of\n@xmath , so @xmath holds. Since @xmath would contradict the fact that\n@xmath is a chain in @xmath , equality must hold as claimed. \u220e\n\nNow choose some homeomorphism @xmath and write @xmath . Next, pick two\npoints @xmath in @xmath and let @xmath denote the set of all\naccumulation points of @xmath in the open interval @xmath . Since @xmath\nis discrete in @xmath we know that @xmath avoids @xmath and @xmath maps\n@xmath into the end space of @xmath .\n\n###### Claim 2.\n\nEvery point of @xmath is an accumulation point of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nGiven any @xmath pick a sequence @xmath in @xmath with @xmath , and\nwithout loss of generality suppose that @xmath holds for all @xmath .\nGiven an arbitrary @xmath pick @xmath big enough that @xmath and @xmath\nhold for all @xmath . Using that @xmath induces the ordering of the\nrationals on @xmath (and hence on @xmath ) it is easy to find some\n@xmath . By choice of @xmath we have @xmath . \u220e\n\nIn order to yield a contradiction, we inductively construct a sequence\n@xmath (where the @xmath are ends, not ordinals) in @xmath together with\na sequence @xmath of vertices of @xmath such that for all @xmath we have\n\n1.  @xmath is a vertex of @xmath ,\n\n2.  @xmath receives label @xmath ,\n\n3.  @xmath .\n\nThis suffices, since then by (iii) we have a strictly decreasing\nsequence @xmath of ordinals, which is impossible.\n\nWe start the construction by picking an arbitrary @xmath together with\nsome vertex @xmath of @xmath receiving label @xmath . Now suppose that\nwe are at step @xmath of the construction, and @xmath and @xmath got\nconstructed for @xmath . Using Claim 2 we find some @xmath in @xmath\nother than @xmath . Let @xmath be the maximal vertex of @xmath with\nrespect to the natural ordering @xmath on @xmath induced by its root.\nSince @xmath is an NST and @xmath holds, we know that @xmath witnesses\n@xmath . By (i) we have @xmath , so @xmath holds since otherwise @xmath\ncontradicts @xmath . By Claim 1 , we find some vertex @xmath of @xmath\nwith @xmath such that @xmath receives label @xmath . In particular,\n@xmath implies @xmath . Also recall that @xmath receives label @xmath by\n(ii). Together with @xmath and Claim 1 applied to @xmath and @xmath ,\nthe only possibility for @xmath is @xmath . Thus (i)\u2013(iii) hold for\n@xmath . \u220e\n\n###### Proposition 8.4.2.\n\nIf @xmath is a connected graph such that for every @xmath the graph\n@xmath has an NST @xmath whose subtree @xmath contains no subdivision of\nthe (infinite) binary tree, then @xmath is the maximal Hausdorff\nquotient of @xmath .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nBy Lemma 8.4.1 all auxiliary arcs (in @xmath ) are tame, so @xmath and\n@xmath coincide by Lemma 8.3.6 . Furthermore, @xmath holds by Theorem\n3.4.14 . \u220e\n\nProposition 8.4.2 is not best possible:\n\n###### Lemma 8.4.3.\n\nThere exists a connected graph @xmath all whose auxiliary arcs are tame\nand which has an NST, but which does not satisfy the premise of Theorem\n8.4.2 .\n\n###### Proof.\n\nLet @xmath be obtained from the infinite binary tree with root @xmath by\nadding an edge from @xmath to every other vertex. Then @xmath is empty\nby the same argument we used on the graph from Fig. 15 , and @xmath only\nidentifies all ends of @xmath with @xmath (since @xmath is the only\nvertex of infinite degree). Hence @xmath implies @xmath by Lemma 8.1.1 .\nNow Lemma 6.2.5 together with the fact that the auxiliary edges form a\nstar in @xmath (with center @xmath and the ends of @xmath as leaves)\nyields that every auxiliary arc traverses the closure of either one or\ntwo auxiliary edges, and hence must be tame. \u220e\n\n#### 8.5 Outlook\n\nOf course, we would like to know whether @xmath and @xmath coincide for\nall @xmath . Furthermore, if @xmath and @xmath are two vertices of\n@xmath and every auxiliary arc between them is wild, then the question\narises whether there exists structures of the graph witnessing that. One\ndifficulty are the auxiliary edges between vertices and ends which allow\nthe auxiliary arcs to \u2018jump\u2019 in an NST.\n\nLet @xmath map each sequence to its naturally corresponding value in\n@xmath .\n\n###### Conjecture 8.5.1.\n\nFor every graph @xmath and every two distinct vertices @xmath and @xmath\nof @xmath the following are equivalent:\n\n1.  @xmath and every auxiliary arc from @xmath to @xmath is wild.\n\n2.   There exists a countable subset @xmath of @xmath such that the\n    following hold:\n\n    1.   Every @xmath satisfies @xmath and @xmath .\n\n    2.   The partial ordering @xmath of @xmath induces the ordering of\n        the rationals on @xmath .\n\n    3.   There exists a bijection @xmath satisfying @xmath if and only\n        if @xmath . Let @xmath map each vertex of the @xmath to the\n        vertex separator of @xmath . For every @xmath let @xmath be the\n        level of the @xmath containing @xmath , and let @xmath be the\n        set of all vertices of the first @xmath levels of the @xmath\n        minus @xmath . Then for every @xmath and every auxiliary arc\n        @xmath from @xmath to @xmath , the set @xmath meets @xmath .\n\n3.  @xmath .\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nI am grateful to my family for all the years of support, and I am\ngrateful to Prof. Dr. Reinhard Diestel for his inspiring lecture courses\nwhich led me here. During the development of this work I received\ninvaluable assistance from Dr. Max Pitz: He motivated me to investigate\ntwo questions of Prof. Dr. Reinhard Diestel which resulted in Chapter 5\n, and he pointed out to me an abstract minimality proof. When I thought\nabout auxiliary edges, unsure about their usefulness, he showed me\nparallels to certain Stone-\u010cech compactifications.

{"input":"## Chapter 1 Introduction\n\nEver since its discovery by Maldacena in 1998, the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence has intrigued researchers in quantum gravity. The\ncorrespondence entails a duality between theories with and without\ngravity, and recently, Mark van Raamsdonk and collaborators [ 1 , 2 , 3\n, 4 ] have proposed that entanglement here plays a crucial role. The\nsuggestion relies on a single entry from the AdS\/CFT dictionary; the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula [ 5 ] and its covariant generalization [ 6 ] .\nThis formula relates entanglement entropy on the CFT side to areas of\nextremal co-dimension two surfaces on the AdS side, thereby relating an\nintrinsically quantum mechanical phenomena on the CFT side to the\ngeometry of the bulk in the spacetime dual. This result, van Raamsdonk\nconjectures, proves an intimate relation between entanglement on the CFT\nside with spacetime itself on the AdS side. He argues \u201cthat the\nintrinsically quantum phenomenon of entanglement appears to be crucial\nfor the emergence of classical spacetime geometry\u201d [ 1 , pp. 4\u20135] .\n\nA qualitative justification for this claim employs the example of a\nthermofield double state and its dual description as a maximally\nextended AdS-Schwarzschild black hole (the eternal black hole). In this\ncase, the spacetime connectivity between the two exterior regions of the\neternal black hole changes when the amount of entanglement between the\ntwo double states is changed. While this result may be established\nemploying a holographic interpretation of the well known\nBekenstein-Hawking formula, it may be generalized using the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula to all quantum states with a classical spacetime\ndual. Thus, for such pairs this qualitative argument indicates that\nthere is an intimate relation between entanglement in a CFT state and\nspacetime in the dual spacetime. The details of this qualitative\nargument will be the topic of chapter 7 of this thesis.\n\nChapter 8 will be dedicated to more rigorous and quantitative support\nfor a relation between entanglement on the CFT side and gravity on the\nAdS side. More precisely, it will be demonstrated how the first law of\nentanglement entropy on the CFT side is equivalent to imposing the\nlinearized Einstein equations without matter on the AdS side.\n\nThe linearized Einstein equations without matter are the @xmath limit of\nthe Einstein equations, where @xmath is Newton\u2019s constant. Going to the\nfirst subleading order in the @xmath expansion, bulk matter fields will\nhave to be taken into account. Since these, when promoted to quantum\nfields, give rise to entanglement in the bulk, a correction to the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula is required [ 7 ] . Chapter 9 will explore this\ncorrection and argue that the same entanglement constraint on the CFT\nside with this correction is equivalent to linearized Einstein equations\nincluding a source term.\n\nThus in summary, it is reviewed in this thesis how the Ryu-Takayanagi\nformula alone entails that the linearized Einstein equations both with\nand without matter are satisfied in a spacetime if the first law of\nentanglement entropy is satisfied in a dual CFT state. Before proceeding\nto this, however, chapters two through six will introduce relevant\naspects of anti-de Sitter spacetime (chapter 2 ), entanglement and\nentanglement entropy (chapter 3 ), the AdS\/CFT correspondence (chapter 4\n), the Ryu-Takayanagi formula (chapter 5 ), and linearized gravity\n(chapter 6 ).\n\n### 1.1 Notation and conventions\n\nThroughout this thesis, we will work in units where Planck\u2019s constant,\n@xmath , Boltzmann\u2019s constant, @xmath , and the speed of light, @xmath\nto unity \u2013 @xmath \u2013 we will, however, keep the dependence on Newton\u2019s\nconstant, @xmath , explicit since this will be instructive for later\npurposes. Adopting Einstein notation, we will assume an implicit sum\nover repeated indices. When ambiguities may occur, we will indicate the\nnumber of dimensions in which constants are defined by raised numbers in\nparenthesis. For instance, the notation @xmath signifies that this is\nNewton\u2019s constant in 26-dimensional spacetime. Greek lower case indices\nstarting with @xmath \u2013 @xmath \u2013 will be used for Minkowski spacetime\ncoordinates, latin lower case indices starting from @xmath \u2013 @xmath \u2013\nwill be used for Minkowski space coordinates. Latin lower case indices\nstarting from @xmath \u2013 @xmath \u2013 will be used for Poincar\u00e9 coordinates of\nAdS spacetime and occasionally for coordinate independent relations. To\navoid confusing in the numerical ordering of the Poincar\u00e9 coordinates,\nwe will use @xmath for the time component of tensors (for instance\n@xmath ) and @xmath for the AdS scaling coordinates component of tensors\n(for instance @xmath ). Thus, raised and lowered @xmath and @xmath are\nnot indices but tensor components. Most often, we will consider @xmath\n-dimensional AdS spacetime. Here @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath . We will\nuse @xmath to denote the dimensionality of a spacetime. Thus, we will\noften find that @xmath . Finally, we will use capital indices starting\nwith @xmath \u2013 @xmath \u2013 for target space coordinates and greek lower case\nindices starting with @xmath \u2013 @xmath \u2013 for world sheet coordinates.\n\nThroughout, @xmath will denote the background metric, and a metric\ninduced by @xmath on a surface (including the world sheet metric) will\nbe denoted by @xmath . Unless stated otherwise, metrics will have\nLorentzian signature and we adopt the sign convention @xmath .\n\n## Chapter 2 Anti-de Sitter Spacetime\n\nThroughout this thesis, we will be interested in so-called anti-de\nSitter (AdS) spacetime: It is one of the cornerstones in gauge\/gravity\nduality, it will serve as the background in which we will consider\nlinearized gravity, and one of the central examples will deal with\nasymptotically AdS black holes. Consequently, we will subsequently spend\nsome time introducing AdS spacetime and briefly asymptotically AdS black\nholes. To connect with the subsequent chapters, we introduce AdS in\n@xmath dimensions. The material in this section is based on chapter 2 of\n[ 8 ] and chapter 5 of [ 9 ] .\n\n### 2.1 Global AdS\n\nAccording to the theory of general relativity, spacetimes must satisfy\nthe Einstein equations\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath , @xmath is the energy momentum tensor and @xmath is the\nEinstein tensor \\nomenclature @xmath The number of spatial dimensions.\n\\nomenclature @xmath Newton\u2019s constant. \\nomenclature @xmath The\nenergy-momentum tensor. \\nomenclature @xmath The Einstein tensor.\n\\nomenclature @xmath The metric tensor of the spacetime.\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere @xmath is the cosmological constant, @xmath is the Ricci tensor and\n@xmath is the Ricci scalar defined in terms of the Riemann tensor as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nMinkowski spacetime is arguably the most well known solution to the\nvacuum Einstein equations without cosmological constant, i.e. Einstein\nequations for which @xmath and @xmath . The causal structure of this and\nother spacetimes can be depicted in a Penrose diagram, where the\npossibly infinite spacetime is brought into finite size nice by choosing\nan appropriate conformal factor. Null curves are always @xmath with\nvertical such that timelike directions are those directions bounded by\nthe null curves. The Penrose diagram of Minkowski spacetime is depicted\nin figure 2.1 .\n\nA characteristic feature of Minkowski spacetime is that it is a\nmaximally symmetric spacetime in the sense that is has the maximal\nnumber of spacetime symmetries as given by Killing vector fields, @xmath\n, that satisfy the equation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere @xmath is the covariant derivative, which is given in terms of the\npartial derivative, @xmath , and the Christoffel connection, @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath may be expressed in terms of the metric as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n\\nomenclature\n\n@xmath The covariant derivative. One finds that the maximal number of\nsymmetries and therefore Killing vector fields is @xmath where @xmath is\nthe number of spacetime dimensions of the manifold ( @xmath ).\n\\nomenclature @xmath The number of spacetime dimension of a manifold.\nThus, any manifold with this many symmetries\/Killing vector fields is\nmaximally symmetric. In a maximally symmetric spacetime, the curvature\nmust be the same everywhere; something that is trivially obeyed by\nMinkowski spacetime.\n\nThat curvature is the same everywhere entails that the Riemann tensor\nmay be expressed in terms of the Ricci scalar, @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor Minkowski spacetime, where @xmath everywhere, this entails that the\nRiemann tensor vanishes everywhere. However, the relation indicates that\nwe may consider two other maximally symmetric solutions to the Einstein\nequations in vacuum: One where @xmath and one where @xmath . The latter\ntype of spacetimes \u2013 the maximally symmetric spacetimes with @xmath \u2013\nwill be our primary interest in the following. Such spacetimes are known\nas anti-de Sitter spacetimes and solve the Einstein equations with\nnegative cosmological constant as may be seen from\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nfrom which it follows @xmath . Thus, @xmath .\n\nFor convenience, we will consider anti-de Sitter spacetimes in (d+1)\ndimensions. This may be embedded in a (d+2) dimensional Minkowski\nspacetime, @xmath , with the metric\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand given by the hypersurface subject to the restriction\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis hypersurface may also be parametrized by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath , @xmath , and @xmath parametrizes a @xmath -dimensional\nsphere, @xmath , such that it satisfies @xmath . These coordinates are\nknown as global coordinates of @xmath . In these global coordinates, the\nmetric takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the standard metric on @xmath . The vector field @xmath\nis a Killing vector field on the entire manifold and @xmath may\ntherefore serve as a global time coordinate. It is worth noting that\n@xmath and therefore time is periodic in @xmath . Usually, we will mean\nby global anti-de Sitter spacetime, the universal covering of anti-de\nSitter spacetime in global coordinates, where @xmath is unwrapped such\nthat @xmath .\n\nFor purposes below, we will be interested in the conformal boundary of\nanti-de Sitter spacetime. This is more easily studied if we replace\n@xmath by @xmath such that @xmath which entails @xmath . In these\ncoordinates, the metric takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince we are interested in a conformal boundary, the overall scaling\nfactor @xmath may be ignored and we see that for @xmath , we obtain\n@xmath , where @xmath denotes the conformal boundary of (the universal\ncovering of) global anti-de Sitter spacetime.\n\nFigure 2.2 depicts the Penrose diagram for the universal covering of\nglobal anti-de Sitter spacetime; still suppressing the @xmath part of\nthe metric. To include this, regard the Penrose diagram in figure 2.2 as\na radial slice of a hypercylinder whose angular part is given by @xmath\n. Thus, @xmath is the center of the cylinder and @xmath is the boundary.\nContrary to Minkowski spacetime, there is no spatial infinity since a\nlight signal may travel to boundary, @xmath , and back again in finite\ntime. To see this, consider the metric ( 2.13 ) for a light ray (null\ncurve) for which @xmath . Disregarding the factor @xmath and the scaled\nsphere @xmath , we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfrom which we see that light may travel to the boundary in finite time.\n\n### 2.2 Poincar\u00e9 patch of AdS\n\nAnother parametrization of ( 2.10 ) that will be used repeatedly below\nis given in terms of the coordinates @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . The\nparametrization then reads\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese are only local coordinates since the restriction @xmath entails\nthat we only cover half of @xmath . This is the so-called Poincar\u00e9 patch\nand the coordinates therefore are known as Poincar\u00e9 coordinates. The\nmetric of this Poincar\u00e9 patch of @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn subsequent chapters, we will most often take it to be implicit that\n@xmath is the Poincar\u00e9 patch of @xmath .\n\nWe will also be interested in the conformal boundary of the Poincar\u00e9\npatch of @xmath . This can be shown to be d-dimensional Minkowski\nspacetime i.e. @xmath , which obtains for @xmath . This is more readily\nseen, if we replace @xmath by defining @xmath such that the metric\nbecomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere the conformal boundary is found at @xmath and ignoring the\npre-factor we exactly get d-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. \u00b9 \u00b9 1 More\nprecisely stated, the metric @xmath has the boundary @xmath at @xmath\nand @xmath is conformally equivalent to @xmath . Thus, for any slice of\nthe Poincar\u00e9 patch with @xmath , the metric is that of Minkowski\nspacetime. The coordinate @xmath takes the form of a warpfactor.\n\nFor this reason, the Penrose diagram for the Poincar\u00e9 path of @xmath is\nthe same as that for @xmath -dimensional Minkowski spacetime (figure 2.1\n). This may seem odd. Minkowski spacetime is after all very different\nfrom anti-de Sitter spacetime. The reason that the Poincar\u00e9 patch can\nhave the same Penrose diagram as Minkowski spacetime is that the\nPoincar\u00e9 patch \u2013 as the name indicates \u2013 only covers a patch of AdS.\nThis patch, it turns out, has the same causal structure as Minkowski\nspacetime in agreement with the claim the the Poincar\u00e9 patch is\nconformally equivalent to Minkowski spacetime.\n\n### 2.3 Schwarzschild black holes\n\nAnother interesting class of solutions to the Einstein equations are\nblack hole solutions that feature event horizons. The so-called\nmaximally extended asymptotically AdS-Schwarzschild black hole in global\ncoordinates will be of particular interest since it will play a crucial\nrole in developing the qualitative argument in favour of a relation\nbetween entanglement and spacetime.\n\nHowever, we will begin with the well known Schwarzschild black hole.\nThis is a spherically symmetric solution to the Einstein equations for\n@xmath . The metric may be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the usual metric for @xmath , @xmath is a radial\ncoordinate and @xmath . The constant, @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsuch that in 4 dimensions @xmath from which we obtain the well known\nexpression for the Schwarzschild black hole in 4 dimensions\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (2.20)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nSince our primary interest is in the causal structure of black holes and\nthis is the same in any number of dimensions, we will for convenience\nwork in 4 dimensions in the following. Also, we will suppress the last\npart of the metric @xmath , since this part of the metric merely\ncontributes with a @xmath -dimensional sphere in all points in the\nconformal diagram of the spacetime and may be reinserted thus.\n\nThe metric of interest \u2013 the @xmath subspace \u2013 therefore takes the form\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (2.21)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nTwo points stand out. One is @xmath , which is a curvature singularity\nand the other is @xmath , which turns out to be a coordinate\nsingularity. In general dimensions, the curvature singularity is still\nsituated at @xmath and the coordinate singularity (the black hole\nhorizon) is situated at @xmath .\n\nTo investigate the causal structure, we want to consider the behaviour\nof light-cones and one finds that the slope of these \u2013 defined as @xmath\n\u2013 are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsince the light-cone is spanned by the radial null curves @xmath . For\n@xmath , we see that @xmath ; the light-cone closes up as we approach\nthe event horizon. This, however, is merely a feature of these\nparticular coordinates. A better choice of coordinates will resolve this\nand allow us to study the causal structure as we pass the event horizon.\nThe problem that the light-cone closes up may be resolved, if we can\nfind a coordinate, @xmath , such that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis coordinate, known as the tortoise coordinate, must satisfy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand integrating on both sides, one obtains\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that the event horizon at @xmath is located, in the tortoise\ncoordinate, at @xmath . This also entails that @xmath is only defined\nfor @xmath . In the tortoise coordinates, the metric takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn these coordinates, the metric is no longer singular at @xmath ,\nhowever, it is at the price that the event horizon is pushed to @xmath .\nThis may be resolved by replacing the time coordinate with either one of\nthe light-cone tortoise coordinates:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the infalling radial null geodesics have @xmath and outgoing\nradial null geodesics have @xmath . The causal structure of infalling\nobjects may then be investigated with the coordinates @xmath , where the\nmetric takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe radial null curves, @xmath , satisfies\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfrom which we see that the outgoing radial null curve simply tilts over\nas the object approaches and passes @xmath such that all future directed\npaths for @xmath goes in the direction of decreasing @xmath ; there is\nno way out of the black hole once in.\n\nHowever, we could also choose to consider the radial null curves in the\ncoordinates @xmath , where the metric takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this case, the radial null curves satisfies\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we again see that the light-cone tilts when @xmath is approached\nand passed. In these coordinates, however, the situation is reversed.\nThe horizon may be passed by following past directed curves such that\nfor @xmath all such paths go in the direction of decreasing @xmath .\nThis is a white hole; once you are out, there is no way back in.\n\nIn order to find coordinates that includes the inside of both the black\nand the white hole, one could propose to use @xmath . This gives the\nmetric\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is related to @xmath and @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that the horizon at @xmath has once again been pushed to infinity\nand is found at either @xmath or @xmath . To bring the horizon to a\nfinite value in @xmath and @xmath , we define\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand see that the horizon is now found at either @xmath or @xmath and\nthat @xmath , @xmath . Since @xmath and @xmath are null coordinates so\nare @xmath and @xmath . To express the metric in terms of one timelike\ncoordinate and the rest spacetime, we introduce the coordinates known as\nKruskal-Szekeres coordinates,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsuch that @xmath and @xmath . The metric becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the horizon in these coordinates is found at @xmath for @xmath and\nat @xmath for @xmath . We can approach and pass the horizon following\nnull curves given by @xmath . Thus, these coordinates include both the\ninside and the outside of the white and black holes. The coordinates,\nhowever, may be analytically extended even further. In these\ncoordinates, we can extend the range of @xmath from @xmath to @xmath .\nThe region where @xmath mirrors the region @xmath and therefore includes\na second region exterior to the black and white holes. As it turns out,\nno choice of coordinates can extend this spacetime further and we\ntherefore denote the metric ( 2.36 ) with coordinate range @xmath and\n@xmath as the maximally extended Schwarzscild black hole.\n\nThe causal structure of the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole\nmay be depicted in a Penrose diagram (see figure 2.3 ) where we use\n@xmath and @xmath to bring the coordinates into finite range. Still, we\nhave suppressed the @xmath -dimensional sphere, i.e. we consider the\n@xmath subspace. The full spacetime may be obtained merely by including\na @xmath -dimensional sphere scaling as @xmath in each point in the\ndiagram. As seen on figure 2.3 , the Penrose diagram for the maximally\nextended Schwarzschild black hole shares with Minkowski space the same\nfuture null infinity, @xmath , past null infinity, @xmath , and\nspacelike infinity, @xmath , which verifies that the maximally extended\nSchwarzschild black hole is indeed asymptotically Minkowski. One\nsubtlety about the diagram is that future timelike infinity, @xmath ,\nand past timelike infinity, @xmath , are distinct from the singularity\nat @xmath despite the appearance to the contrary. There are many\ntimelike paths that do not end on the singularity, but go to other\nvalues of @xmath . From the diagram we see that no future directed\ntimelike path goes from one of the exterior region to the other; these\ntwo regions are causally disconnected.\n\n### 2.4 Asymptotically AdS black holes\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, what we are really\ninterested in is the maximally extended AdS-Schwarzscild black hole.\nThis is similar to the maximally extended Schwarzscild black hole\ndeveloped above but differs in that it is asymptotically AdS rather than\nasymptotically flat. This entails that the function @xmath in ( 2.18 )\ntakes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nCompared to the maximally extended Schwarzschild black hole, the causal\nstructure therefore remains the same with the exception that the\nspacetime is asymptotically AdS. The Penrose diagram for the maximally\nextended AdS-Schwarzscild black hole is therefore similar to figure 2.3\nwith the exception that the future null infinity, the past null infinity\nand the spacelike infinity must be identical to that of the universal\ncovering of global AdS spacetime. The Penrose diagram is seen in figure\n2.4 . Compared to figure 2.3 , the asymptotic boundaries of regions I\nand III are now the universal covering of global AdS spacetime. Due to\nthe nature of this asymptotic boundary, light signals may reach and\nreturn from the boundary in finite time as shown above. This has\npeculiar consequences for the maximally extended AdS-Schwarzscild black\nhole where @xmath . If @xmath , we may neglect the term @xmath , and the\nmaximally extended AdS-Schwarzscild black hole will have properties\nsimilar to that of the asymptotically flat maximally extended\nSchwarzscild black hole. Particularly, both will evaporate due to the\nemission of Hawking radiation. For @xmath , however, the maximally\nextended AdS-Schwarzscild black hole may be in an equilibrium with its\nHawking radiation since the radiation can reach the asymptotic AdS\nboundary and return in finite time. Thus, if emission and reabsorption\nrates are equal then the maximally extended AdS-Schwarzscild black hole\nwill not evaporate. For this reason, we denote such black holes as\neternal black holes.\n\nFor the eternal black hole we find \u2013 as we did for the maximally\nextended Schwarzschild black hole \u2013 two causally disconnected regions, I\nand III. No signal can travel from one to the other. Still, we will\ndescribe the eternal black hole as a connected spacetime since a signal\nfrom the region I can intersect a signal from region III. The signals,\nhowever, can only intersect inside the black hole thereby precluding any\ncausal connection between the two exterior regions I and III. The\npicture emerging is that of a wormhole so long as it is remembered that\nthe wormhole is simply a two sided black hole, i.e. a black hole with\ntwo distinct exterior regions. That we may conceive of the eternal black\nhole as a wormhole is further signified by the depiction in figure 2.4 b\nof @xmath and a constant positive @xmath slice of the spacetime.\n\nThese depiction more explicitly demonstrates features of the eternal\nblack hole; most explicitly the scaling of the sphere @xmath with @xmath\n. Also, these depictions will prove useful in a qualitative assessment\nof the behavior of the spacetime when the area of the black hole horizon\nis decreased.\n\n## Chapter 3 Entanglement and Entropy\n\nEntanglement is an inherently quantum mechanical phenomena. To see the\npeculiarity of this phenomena let us consider two discernible particles,\n1 and 2, and two positions, A and B. Both particles behave in such a way\nthat when measured it is found at site A half of the times and at site B\nthe other half of the times. However, the two particles are never found\nat the same site simultaneously. Thus, when we measure and find particle\n1 at site A, then a similar measurement at site B will find particle 2\nthere. Similarly, if particle 2 is found at site A, we can be sure to\nfind particle 1 at site B.\n\nWe may initially attempt to ascribe a probability wave to each particle\nto account for the behaviour. Each particle is described by a wave with\ntwo sharp peaks at A and B and with an amplitude of @xmath at each site,\ni.e. they are ascribed a probability of @xmath for being at site A and\n@xmath for being at site B. However, describing the particles with an\nindividual probability wave cannot account for their behaviour never to\nbe found at the same site. Generally, there is no way to describe the\nbehaviour with a function only ranging over the sites A and B (usually\nthis will be a three dimensional position space). This will inevitably\nleave out some information about the relation between the two particles.\nThis is the information about their entanglement.\n\nTo account for their entanglement, i.e. for the effect that the\nparticles are never found at the same site, we must instead describe the\nparticles as living in configuration space. In configuration space there\nare four possible configurations; not sites since the states are no\nlonger in position space. These may be denoted @xmath , @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath where the first letter denotes the position of the first\nparticle and the second letter denotes the position of the second\nparticle. Associating probability to each of these configurations, it\nfollows from the example that only @xmath and @xmath have a non-zero\nprobability to be occupied. More precise, the probability is @xmath for\neach. The lesson to learn is that it is necessary to describe the\nobserved correlation of these particles in configuration space. It is\nnot possible to describe it in position space as we are used to from\nclassical physics.\n\nFor convenience we will subsequently use correlation between the spin\nstate of two particles rather than a correlation between positions. We\nwill assume that the particles are fermions and therefore have spin-\n@xmath . Thus, each particle is either found to have spin up, @xmath ,\nor spin down, @xmath . Calling the system composed of first particle,\n@xmath , and the system composed of the second particle, @xmath , their\nstate-spaces is spanned by the states @xmath and @xmath , respectively.\nThe full system, therefore, is spanned by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nNow, the state of the full system, @xmath , is such that if one particle\nis found to have spin up, then the other particle will be found to have\nspin down and vice versa. Again, we cannot account for this correlation\nif we describe each particle individually. While we can get the\nstatistics right by assigning probability @xmath to each state for each\nparticle, this does not account for the correlation. We cannot describe\nthe full state as a product of @xmath and @xmath states.\n\nThe two systems (the two particles) are correlated, and @xmath therefore\nbecomes:\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (3.2)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nthis is what is known as a Bell pair. This is the maximally entangled\nstate consisting of two qubits.\n\n### 3.1 The density matrix\n\nThe example demonstrates that two entangled particles cannot be\ndescribed as two separable subsystems, but must be regarded as one\nwhole. To introduce this notion of entanglement more formally, we will\nconsider a quantum state in some Hilbert space, @xmath that can be\ndecomposed into at least two spatially separated subsystems. \u00b9 \u00b9 1\n@xmath is a pure state of @xmath This implies that @xmath can be\nexpressed as the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of each subsystem.\nDecomposing @xmath into two subsystems, we have\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the Hilbert spaces of the two subsystems\n(denoted @xmath and @xmath respectively).\n\nGiven this decomposition of the Hilbert space, we may write a quantum\nstate \u2013 a vector @xmath \u2013 in terms of basis states in the subsystem\nHilbert spaces, @xmath and @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath .\n\nGenerally this is not a product state, i.e. a product of two pure\nstates. Decomposing a system into two or more subsystems, it is\ngenerally not the case that we may express the full quantum state as a\ndirect product of the states of the subsystems\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\neven though the Hamiltonian of either subsystem \u2013 due to locality \u2013 is\nindependent of each other. When this equality does not hold, we will say\nthat systems @xmath and @xmath are entangled.\n\nThis formal exposition sits well with the above account of the Bell\npair. Here it was claimed that the spin of the particles were entangled,\nwhen we could not describe the state of the full system in terms of the\nstates of two particles as spanned by @xmath . Particularly, the outcome\nof measurements could not be accounted for by such a product state.\n\nGenerally, if @xmath is not a product state of @xmath and @xmath , it\nfollows that a pure state, @xmath , cannot give the same outcome as\n@xmath for a measurement on subsystem @xmath . However, the outcome of\nsuch measurements can be reproduced by some ensemble of orthogonal\nstates in @xmath , where each of these states, @xmath , are associated\nwith a (classical) probability, @xmath , of finding the system in that\nstate when making the measurement on @xmath .\n\nThus, the expectation value for the measurement on state @xmath agrees\nwith the ensemble average of that measurement on this ensemble.\nExpressing this in terms of an operator, @xmath , acting on subsystem\n@xmath , this implies:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTo prove that there is such a class, @xmath , of orthogonal states,\nconsider the expectation value of @xmath when the full state is @xmath\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (3.7)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nwhere the last line is obtained by defining the operator\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand by the definition of the trace\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAs seen, the operator @xmath also only acts on subsystem @xmath and it\nis known as the reduced density matrix. It may be obtained from the\ndensity matrix of the full system, @xmath , by tracing out the degrees\nof freedom outside of the subsystem. In the case where the full system\nis divided into two subsystems @xmath and @xmath this is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is equal to ( 3.8 ) above.\n\nThe density matrix is an hermitian operator, i.e. @xmath , and therefore\nit has real eigenvalues. Furthermore, the eigenvalues of the density\nmatrix, @xmath , can be shown to be non-negative. Thus\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe eigenvalues, @xmath , are also sometimes known as the entanglement\nspectrum of the density matrix for a state @xmath .\n\nUsing the associated eigenvectors we can express the reduced density\nmatrix as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath are the eigenvectors of @xmath .\n\nInserting this into the expression for the expectation value of the\noperator @xmath , we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have used that the trace is the same in any orthonormal basis.\nThis proves the claim that for the full system in a state @xmath there\nis an ensemble of orthogonal states in @xmath , @xmath that reproduces\nthe expectation value of an operator, @xmath , that only acts on\nsubsystem @xmath .\n\nFrom the last line of ( 3.7 ), we notice that the reduced density matrix\nfor subsystem @xmath , @xmath , contains all information about the\nstate, @xmath , in subsystem @xmath . Concerning our current interest \u2013\nentanglement \u2013 it is interesting to see how @xmath includes information\nabout the entanglement between subsystem @xmath and the full system.\nParticularly, we find that if @xmath only has one non-zero eigenvalue\nthen the subsystem @xmath is in a pure state and thereby not entangled\nwith the rest of the system.\n\nTo see this, let us assume that only the eigenvalue @xmath of @xmath is\nnon-zero. We then have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis implies that there is a single state of the Hilbert space for the\nsubsystem \u2013 in this case @xmath \u2013 that includes all the information of\nfull state in that subsystem; there is no classical uncertainty about\nthe state of the subsystem. If the full system consists of two\nsubsystems @xmath and @xmath and @xmath is a pure state \u2013 in this case\n@xmath \u2013 then it follows that @xmath is a pure state. Assuming that this\npure state of @xmath is @xmath , we can thereby express the full state,\n@xmath , as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is recognized as a product state, and the two subsystems is\ntherefore not entangled. In summary, if the reduced density matrix for\nsome subsystem has only one non-zero eigenvalue, then the subsystem is\nnot entangled with the rest of the full system. The reduced density\nmatrix contains the information about the entanglement between the\nsubsystem and the rest of the full system.\n\n### 3.2 Entanglement entropy\n\nThese properties makes it natural to use the reduced density matrix to\nquantify the entanglement between a subsystem and the rest of the\nsystem. For this purpose, we will define the entanglement entropy,\n@xmath , as the the von Neumann entropy associated with a density matrix\n@xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nA number of properties makes the von Neumann entropy a good choice when\nquantifying entanglement. First, we observe that @xmath which sits well\nwith the fact that the notion of \u201canti-entanglement\u201d is\nincomprehensible. To see that @xmath , remember that @xmath must be\ndiagonalized in the basis of its eigenvectors with diagonal elements\nequal to its eigenvalues, @xmath . Since @xmath , it follows that @xmath\n. Therefore, @xmath which implies that @xmath .\n\nAnother nice property is that the von Neumann entropy vanishes for a\npure state. Thus, if there is no entanglement between a subsystem under\nconsideration and the full system, then the entanglement entropy of that\nsystem is zero. This follows, since it holds for the density matrix of a\npure state that @xmath . Thus\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe definiti\n\nThe von Neumann entropy also nicely reproduces the usual entropy\nformulas of well known ensembles. Taking the example of the\nmicrocanonical ensemble given by the combination of states and\nprobabilities\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath is the number of energy eigenstates in this\ninterval. The entropy for the microcanonical ensemble is given as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last equality is obtained by the identity\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich implies thinking of the total entropy as getting a contribution,\n@xmath , from each state, @xmath , in the ensemble.\n\nNow using the equality @xmath and that @xmath , we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last line follows since since @xmath are the eigenvalues of\n@xmath such that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nsuch that that taking the trace equals a sum over @xmath .\n\nThis is exactly the von Neumann entropy. However, it is worth noticing\nat this point that contrary to thermodynamic entropy which only is\ndefined for equilibrium states, entanglement entropy is defined for any\nstate and we can therefore also consider dynamical changes in\nentanglement entropy. Something that will become relevant later on.\n\nThe von Neumann entropy also quantifies entanglement in agreement with\nour immediate expectations. To see this, consider the previous example\nof a bell pair system, but now with variable entanglement\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the spin state of subsystem @xmath and @xmath due to\nnormalisation.\n\nTo compute the entanglement entropy, i.e. the von Neumann entropy, for\none of the subsystem @xmath , one first has to find the reduced density\nmatrix\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHaving found the reduced density matrix, we can find an expression for\nthe entanglement entropy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last line in obtained from the constraint @xmath .\n\nAs seen from figure 3.1 the entanglement entropy is maximal for @xmath .\nThe entanglement entropy vanishes for @xmath and @xmath which\ncorresponds to pure states of the subsystem @xmath . This is exactly\nwhat is expected for a Bell pair state.\n\nIn general we find that if @xmath then @xmath is a pure state. If @xmath\nthen @xmath is in a mixed state; the degrees of freedom in @xmath are\nentangled with the degrees of freedom in in the rest of the full system.\n\n### 3.3 Entanglement in CFTs\n\nGoing to quantum field theories, some subtleties arise. A quantum field\ntheory is defined on a @xmath -dimensional Lorentzian spacetime, @xmath\n, thus to define a state of the system one must first choose a Cauchy\n(spacelike) slice, @xmath , of the spacetime that defines a moment of\nsimultaneity. \u00b2 \u00b2 2 The notation @xmath and @xmath is chosen for comply\nwith later notation. With respect to @xmath we may define the Hilbert\nspace of states @xmath . For any state of the system, @xmath , we have\n@xmath .\n\nWe may conceive of @xmath as a tensor product of the Hilbert spaces\nassociated with each point and therefore as comprising of all the local\ndegrees freedom in the quantum field theory. This construction is\nperhaps better understood as the continuum limit of a lattice system on\n@xmath with some lattice spacing @xmath . The degrees of freedom are\nlocated at the lattice sites and associated with the Hilbert space\n@xmath , where @xmath is some numbering of the lattice sites. The full\nHilbert space is then given as a tensor product of the Hilbert space at\neach lattice site\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe continuum limit is then obtained by sending @xmath and we can\nconceive of @xmath as constructed in this way.\n\nWe want to interrogate about the entanglement entropy of some subregion\n@xmath , i.e. about some quantitative measure of the entanglement\nbetween @xmath and its compliment @xmath . Here, the compliment of\n@xmath is defined to satisfy @xmath . The entangling surface separating\n@xmath and @xmath , we denote @xmath . Since a CFT is a local quantum\nfield theory, there are specific degrees of freedom associated with\nspecific spatial regions; again the analogy to a continuum limit of a\nlattice system is helpful. We can therefore regard the full quantum\nsystem as composed of two subsystems, @xmath and @xmath , associated\nwith two spatially separated regions @xmath and @xmath . As a\nconsequence we can decompose the Hilbert space of states of the full\nsystem as we did in the section above. \u00b3 \u00b3 3 Some complications are\ninvolved in making such a decomposition in a gauge invariant way, but\nthese will not be considered here.\n\nHaving made this construction, one may obtain an expression for the\ndensity matrix operator @xmath . To evaluate the entanglement entropy\none also needs to obtain an expression for the operator @xmath .\nHowever, taking the logarithm of a continuum operator \u2013 such as @xmath\nin the context of a quantum field theory \u2013 proves to be technically\ncomplicated. In fact, it proves to be more tractable to evaluate the\nR\u00e9nyi entropy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand then take the limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe R\u00e9nyi entropy may be evaluated using the so-called replica trick. It\nis beyond the scope of the current project to go into details of this\nprocedure. The procedure is reviewed in [ 10 ] , where it is also\nemployed to obtain the entanglement entropy for 2-dimensional conformal\nfield theories. These prove to be a special case, since they possess a\nVirasoro algebra with central charge @xmath . This simplifies the\nevaluation of entanglement entropy using the replica trick. Indeed, the\nevaluation of entanglement entropy proves to be impossible in all but\nthe simplest higher dimensional cases.\n\nIn 2-dimensional conformal field theories, any spatial slice takes the\nform of a line. Define @xmath to be the interval @xmath centred around\nthe origin on. As shown in [ 10 ] , the entanglement entropy for such a\nsingle interval is found to diverge, however, this is as expected since\nwe, in a continuum CFT, will have unregulated short distance\nentanglement over the entangling surface @xmath . To regulate this, we\nintroduce the cutoff @xmath . With this cutoff, the entanglement entropy\nof a single interval centred around the origin is found to be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe simple expression for the entanglement entropy is a consequence of\nthe Virasoro algebra, which is not realized in higher dimensional CFTs.\nIn chapter 5 , we will compare this result to an expression for the\nentanglement entropy of a single interval in a 2-dimensional conformal\nfield theories as obtained by bulk-calculation, i.e. to an expression\nfor @xmath obtained via the AdS side of the AdS\/CFT correspondence. It\nis this correspondence \u2013 also known as the gauge\/gravity duality \u2013 that\nwe now turn to.\n\n## Chapter 4 A Brief Introduction to Gauge\/Gravity Duality\n\nEver since its conception two decades ago [ 11 ] , the gauge\/gravity\nduality has intrigued researchers in many branches of physics. The\nconjecture is a that certain local field theories on a fixed spacetime\nbackground \u2013 i.e. without gravity \u2013 are dynamically equivalent to\ncertain theories that include a gravitational interaction; they describe\nthe same physics.\n\nThe most well known example of this duality is the one between conformal\nfield theories \u00b9 \u00b9 1 Conformal field theories are quantum field theories\nthat are conformally invariant i.e. invariant under dillations, @xmath\nwhere @xmath is a constant , and special conformal transformation,\n@xmath . in @xmath dimensions ( @xmath ) and anti-de Sitter spacetimes\nin @xmath dimensions ( @xmath ), where the @xmath is defined on a fixed\nspacetime that is identical to the @xmath -dimensional asymptotic\nboundary of @xmath . For this reason, the gauge\/gravity duality is also\nknown as the AdS\/CFT correspondence.\n\nInitially, the duality may seem unlikely since one would generally\nexpect the number of degrees of freedom in @xmath dimensions to be\nlarger than the number of degrees of freedom in @xmath dimensions. Thus,\nif the duality obtains, it suggests that the degrees of freedom in\ntheories of gravity behave differently from those in local quantum field\ntheories.\n\nThe first piece of evidence suggesting this to be the case is the\nholographic principle known from black hole thermodynamics. From\nstatitical mechanics we know that entropy can be regarded as a measure\nfor the degrees of freedom of a system. As shown in [ 12 ] , for general\nrelativity to be consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, the entropy\nof a black hole has to scale with the area of its event horizon, @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIndeed, this can be shown to be the upper bound of the entropy in @xmath\ndimensional Einstein gravity (the Bekenstein Bound) for a spatial volume\nbounded by the spatial surface with area @xmath . Thus, in general\nrelativity the entropy @xmath for the d-dimensional spatial slice @xmath\nof the manifold @xmath scales as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the @xmath dimensional boundary of @xmath . Thus,\ngravity realises the holographic principle that the degrees of freedom\nin a volume scales with the surface area of that volume.\n\nFor a @xmath -dimensional local quantum field theory, the entropy of the\n@xmath dimensional spatial slice of a system scales with the volume of\nthat spatial slice. Following the duality, a CFT state with the\nspacetime dual @xmath is defined on a spacetime identical to the\nasymptotic boundary of @xmath , @xmath . Thus, the entropy, @xmath\nscales as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is a spacelike co-dimension two surface. This is in\nagreement with the result obtained for a gravitational theory under the\nassumption of the holographic principle. This, of course, is no proof of\nthe conjectured duality between @xmath and @xmath , however, it suggests\nthat it is not absurd that a local quantum field theory in @xmath\ndimensions can have the same number of degrees of freedom as a\ngravitational theory in @xmath dimensions.\n\n### 4.1 @xmath Super Yang-Mills theory and type IIB string theory on\n@xmath\n\nOriginally, the gauge\/gravity duality was conceived by comparing an open\nstring and a closed string perspective of a stack of @xmath D3-branes [\n11 ] . This lead to the conjecture that @xmath Super Yang-Mills theory\n(SYM) in four dimensional Minkowski spacetime is dual to type IIB string\ntheory on the poincar\u00e9 patch of the spacetime @xmath . \u00b2 \u00b2 2 For global\nAdS, the CFT dual is defined on @xmath . @xmath SYM is a conformally\ninvariant quantum field theory with gauge group @xmath and is\ncharacterised by the two free parameters @xmath \u2013 the rank of the gauge\ngroup \u2013 and Yang-Mills coupling constant, @xmath . This is referred to\nas the \u2018CFT side\u2019 of the duality. The string theory on @xmath is\nreferred to as the \u2018AdS side\u2019 and is characterised by the string length\n@xmath , the string coupling constant @xmath , and the curvature radius\nof @xmath , @xmath , which is also the curvature radius of @xmath . As a\nfree parameter, the latter two only occur as the ratio @xmath and are\nrelated \u2013 according to the AdS\/CFT correspondence \u2013 to the free\nparameters on the CFT side in the following way\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is known as the \u2019t Hooft coupling. The string coupling,\n@xmath , and the Yang-Mills coupling, @xmath , are related by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThus stated, the conjectured duality is one between a four and a ten\ndimensional theory. The holographic principle asserts that the number of\ndegrees of freedom in a @xmath dimensional gravity theory may be the\nsame as the number of degrees of freedom in a @xmath dimensional gauge\ntheory. This, however, still leaves five dimensions unaccounted for in\nthe duality between four dimensional @xmath SYM and type IIB string\ntheory on @xmath . To explain how the number of degrees of freedom can\nmatch serves as a crude consistency check of the duality.\n\nThe details of the duality is such that the @xmath is defined on a\nspacetime identical to the asymptotic boundary of the dual spacetime; in\nthis case the flat asymptotic boundary of the Poincar\u00e9 patch of @xmath .\nTherefore, the five dimensional version of the AdS side can be obtained\nby a Kaluza-Klein [ 13 ] reduction of the string theory on @xmath . More\nprecisely, @xmath can be expanded in a complete set of spherical\nharmonics such that any field on @xmath can be reduced to a tower of\nmassive fields on @xmath , where the masses are due to the origin of\nthese fields in the expansion in spherical harmonics of @xmath . If the\nholographic principle holds for this reduced theory in five dimensions,\nthen it is consistent with it having the same number of degrees of\nfreedom as a four dimensional gauge theory like @xmath Super Yang-Mills\ntheory.\n\nAgain, this is no proof of the duality. Indeed, it turns out to be very\nhard to prove the duality for generic @xmath and @xmath (and thereby\ngeneric @xmath and @xmath ). A proof would require a full\nnon-perturbative definition of quantized type IIB string theory on\ncurved backgrounds, which we currently lack. This restricts most\nexplicit calculations on the AdS side to the regime where string\nperturbation theory can be employed; the regime where @xmath . If @xmath\nis kept fixed, this reduces the AdS side to classical string theory in\nthe sense that only tree level are taken into account, while the higher\nstring genus expansions are disregarded. On the CFT side, this is\nequivalent to the limit where @xmath while @xmath is kept fixed. Thus,\n@xmath . This is the well known \u2019t Hooft limit, where only planar\ndiagrams in the gauge theory contribute to leading order in @xmath .\nGenerally, for fixed @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThus, an expansion in @xmath on the CFT side is equivalent to the string\ntheory genus expansion in @xmath .\n\nIf @xmath , the AdS side further simplifies. In this limit, the string\nlength, @xmath , is much smaller than the curvature radius, @xmath and\ntherefore the strings may be approximated by point particles in the form\nof type IIB supergravity. This supergravity is defined on a weakly\ncurved @xmath (since @xmath ) and is dual to @xmath SYM in its strong\ncoupling limit, i.e. @xmath . This limit is referred to as the weak form\nof the duality as opposed to the strong form, where @xmath and therefore\n@xmath are kept fixed.\n\nEven though a proof of the duality is not currently possible, a number\nof non-trivial tests and checks have been carried out. These have their\noutset in either the weak or the strong form of the duality and\nevaluates the same quantities on both sides; hitherto with perfect\nagreement. For instance, the symmetries of @xmath SYM form the\nsupergroup @xmath and so does the type IIB string theory on @xmath .\nAlso, scattering amplitudes which are protected by supersymmetry as one\ngoes from weak to strong coupling can be compared between the two sides\nand shown to be equal.\n\nAssuming the weak form of the duality, tests are complicated by it being\na weak\/strong duality. This entails that one of the sides must be\nevaluated at strong coupling, which cannot be done at full generality on\neither side. However, observables independent of the coupling may still\nbe compared and can be shown to be equal. Particularly, the classical\nfields of type IIB supergravity on @xmath maps to a subset of the\noperators in @xmath SYM. \u00b3 \u00b3 3 See [ 14 ] for a complete summary of the\nfield content of @xmath supergravity in 10 dimensions.\n\nGenerally, there should be a one-to-one map between operators on the CFT\nside and fields on the AdS side which entails that the duality may be\nformulated as a correspondence between the generating functional for\n@xmath SYM and partition function of type IIB string theory. The\ngenerating functional for correlation functions of gauge theory\noperators, @xmath , is obtained by perturbing the Lagrangian, @xmath ,\nby a source field, @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe generating functional in Euclidean signature on the CFT side, @xmath\n, thereby takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is some normalization. Assume that @xmath is the boundary\nvalue of the fluctuating bulk field @xmath such that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the dimension of @xmath . \u2074 \u2074 4 Observe that @xmath .\nGenerally, @xmath is divergent. One then finds that\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (4.10)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the classical string theory partition function in\nEuclidean signature that takes the path integral over all field\nconfigurations for @xmath which takes the value @xmath at the asymptotic\nboundary of AdS.\n\nOne complication is that @xmath is not explicitly known. Therefore, it\nis often necessary to consider only the limit where the string length is\nmuch smaller than the curvature radius, i.e. the weak form introduced\nabove as opposed to the strong form in ( 4.10 ). In this limit, the\nleading contribution to @xmath comes from the field @xmath that solves\nthe supergravity equations of motion subject to the condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nOne thereby obtains the relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the (renormalized) supergravity action.\n\nIf the source field of an operator in the CFT is known, then the\nrelation ( 4.10 ) tells how operators (and their correlators) on the CFT\nside relate to fields (and field correlators) on the AdS side.\n\n### 4.2 Gauge\/gravity duality: The weak form\n\nAs the subsequent chapters will deal with the weak form of the\ngauge\/gravity duality, we will develop that in more detail here. To\nobtain the weak form, two limits were taken on the AdS side: @xmath and\n@xmath . On the CFT side, this corresponded to the limit @xmath and\nlarge @xmath , where @xmath is the rank of the gauge group of the theory\nand @xmath is the t\u2019Hooft coupling. These limits were taken to avoid\nhaving quantum gravity and stringy corrections on the AdS side. This\nallows the approximation of the AdS side with the Einstein Hilbert\naction in AdS spacetime\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the cosmological constant in AdS spacetime and @xmath\nare matter terms. With this approximation, the gauge\/gravity duality can\nserve to relate general relativity in @xmath dimensions to a @xmath\n-dimensional conformal field theory. To motivate the approximation of\nthe AdS side by general relativity, we will first argue how supergravity\nobtains as an approximation on the AdS side and then show how the\nEinstein Hilbert action is a special case of supergravity action.\n\nSupergravity is an effective low-energy limit of superstring theory\nwhere only tree level interactions are included. Since energy \u2013 in units\n@xmath \u2013 scales like inverse length, this is the limit where the energy\nis much smaller than the inverse of characteristic length scale of the\ntheory, which in the case of string theory is the string length, @xmath\n. Thus, the low energy limit is equivalent to the limit where @xmath .\nIn supergravity, therefore, strings are approximated by point particles;\nstringy correction are ignored. This entails that only the massless\nclosed string particles are included in the mode content of\nsupergravity. To see this, remember that the mass spectrum of the\nparticles in the closed string theory in Minkowski background is given\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath and @xmath are the annihilation and creation\noperators, respectively, of the closed string mode expansion. Thus, for\nMinkowski background, the massless modes \u2013 for which @xmath \u2013 are\nindependent of the string length, @xmath , whereas the massive modes\nscale as @xmath . When @xmath the massive modes decouple such that only\nthe massless modes contribute. Consequently, the low energy limit, and\ntherefore supergravity on Minkowski background, only contains the\nmassless modes of the closed superstring. The argument generalizes to\nclosed string theory of @xmath background (for more details, see [ 15 ]\n).\n\nAmong the field content of the closed string is a graviton, which we\nwith some foresight will denote @xmath , \u2075 \u2075 5 The @xmath representation\nof @xmath and a dilaton, @xmath . \u2076 \u2076 6 The @xmath representation of\n@xmath . Here, @xmath is the embedding function from the string world\nsheet to the target space. The graviton of course is interesting since\nit perturbs the background spacetime in which the string moves, and\nshould therefore relate to the gravitational dynamics. However, also the\nfluctuations of the dilaton, it turns out, contribute to the metric\nperturbation as seen from the point of view of general relativity. To\nindicate how this obtains as well as how to derive the supergravity\naction, it is instructive to consider the graviton and dilaton parts of\nthe string action. For convenience, we will work with the action for the\nclosed bosonic string, \u2077 \u2077 7 More presicely, the bosonic string action\nthat only includes the dilaton and the graviton may be regarded as the\nlow energy limit of the bosonic string (including only the massless\nfields) where the last massless field, the Kalb-Ramond field @xmath , is\nassumed to be zero. however, the procedure generalizes to the full\nclosed superstring action.\n\nWe will take @xmath to be worldsheet indexes and @xmath to be target\nspace indexes, where @xmath is the dimension of the target space. We\nwill further assume that the metric induced on the worldsheet by the\nbackground metric is @xmath , i.e. the background is not necessarily\nflat. \u2078 \u2078 8 Since spacetime curvature in string theory originates from\nthe closed string graviton, a curved background should be conceived off\nas consisting by a large enough number of closed strings such that\nspacetime curves even in the classical limit. The world sheet can be\nparametrized by the timelike coordinate @xmath and spacelike coordinate\n@xmath . Since we will work in Euclidean signature, it is convenient to\ndefine the coordinate @xmath such that @xmath is the Wick rotation of\nthe worldsheet time parameter. As usual, @xmath is the parameter for\nstring extension; for the closed string @xmath . The Euclidean, bosonic\nstring action on the world sheet for the graviton and dilaton then takes\nthe form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the 2-dimensional Ricci scalar on the world sheet.\n\nThe dilaton field may be decomposed into a constant part, @xmath (the\nvacuum expectation value of the dilation field) and fluctuations, @xmath\n, around @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe then find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath such that @xmath is identical to the Euler characteristic\nof the world sheet. As a consequence, it only depends on the topology of\nthe world sheet\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the genus of the world sheet. One finds that @xmath for\na sphere ( @xmath ), @xmath for a torus ( @xmath ) and that @xmath is\nnegative for higher genus, @xmath , surfaces. Separating the constant\nand fluctuating parts of the dilaton field, the action thereby takes the\nform\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last term only depends on the world sheet topology.\n\nThe Euclidean generating functional associated with @xmath takes the\nform as a path integral over world sheet metrics, @xmath , of manifolds,\n@xmath , and embedding functions, @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince @xmath only depends on the topology, one may rewrite the\ngenerating functional as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath ; the constant part of the dilaton field serves as the\nstring coupling constant. For @xmath , the first term in the sum\ndominates. In this limit, therefore, one only has to consider the path\nintegral over world sheets that are topological spheres. This gives rise\nto the tree level diagrams known as Witten diagrams. In subsequent\nchapters, we will suppose this approximation to be valid. \u2079 \u2079 9 In fact\nthe effective coupling is @xmath which means that it must be small for\nall @xmath in order for perturbation theory to be valid.\n\nIt proves to be convenient initially to keep @xmath and only later\ndecompose it in @xmath and @xmath . An effective Lagrangian obtained\nfrom perturbation theory in @xmath will take the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere terms @xmath are denoted as tree level, and higher order terms are\nstring loop corrections. \u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u2070 10 These should not be confused with loop\ncorrections due to an expansion in the string length, @xmath .\n\nFor general backgrounds, an observable calculated using @xmath will\ndiverge even at tree level. To regulate this divergence, we must\nintroduce a cut-off, @xmath , and the background fields will generally\ndepend on this cut-off. To keep track of this dependence we introduce\nthe functionals\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAn obvious problem with the background fields being dependent on the\ncut-off is that this threatens to break conformal invariance. Just like\ngauge invariance is a defining symmetry of Yang-Mills theory as a\nquantum theory, so is conformal invariance in string theory.\n\nA good indicator as to whether conformal invariance is broken is to look\nat the expectation value of the trace of the energy momentum tensor,\n@xmath , that must vanish. At each order of the expansion in @xmath ,\nthe trace may be expressed in terms of the beta-functions. Not going\ninto the details, one finds for the regulated action at tree level \u00b9\u00b9 \u00b9\u00b9\n11 For higher order string loop corrections see [ 16 ] .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor this trace to vanish, we see that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\ni.e. neither of the background fields can depend on the regulator,\n@xmath . This proves to impose strict constraints on these background\nfields.\n\nEven if string loop corrections are disregarded, @xmath is a non-linear\ntwo-dimensional quantum field theory action, it can generally only be\nstudied in perturbation theory. The true dimensionless coupling for the\naction is @xmath , where @xmath is the characteristic length of the\nbackground field @xmath ; for instance the AdS curvature radius in\n@xmath background. As seen, only the dimensionfull coupling, @xmath ,\noccurs explicitly in the action, while @xmath is hidden in @xmath . We\nmay therefore expand @xmath in powers of @xmath just remembering that\nperturbation theory is only valid for @xmath and not just @xmath .\n\nUsing this expansion, one finds\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we note that we are now considering the @xmath -dimensional Ricci\nscalar and tensor. For @xmath the terms @xmath and for @xmath the string\nloop order corrections vanish. Imposing the constraint @xmath ( 4.27 ),\none finds in this limit (for @xmath ) the following constraints in the\nbackground fields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNotably, for constant @xmath this reduces to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus as desired, in the limit @xmath (corresponding to the low energy\nlimit) which we consider here one obtains the Einstein equations without\nmatter ( 4.28 ), when all other fields vanish (expect the dilaton field\nthat can be a non-zero constant).\n\nWhile the beta functions was obtained as the renormalization group flow\nfor the regulated world sheet action, they can also be regarded as\nequations of motion for the background fields that the string propagates\nthrough. We may therefore change the perspective and search instead for\na target space (and therefore 26-dimensional) action that has ( 4.27 )\nas its equations of motion. Without going into the details, this action\nis\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is some constant. As expected from according to ( 4.22 ),\nwe see an overall factor @xmath which is consistent with the fact that\nwe only included leading order in @xmath in the beta-functions, i.e. no\nstring loop corrections.\n\n@xmath is the low-energy effective action for the target space in the\npresence of a closed bosonic string. It is the low-energy action since (\n4.27 ) is valid only for in the limit @xmath where higher order\ncorrections vanishes. Loop corrections to this tree level action will be\nadditional terms @xmath .\n\nComparing @xmath to the Einstein Hilbert action there are some\nsimilarities, but also two important differences. First is the presence\nof the factor @xmath and second is the positive sign of the kinetic term\n@xmath . These, however, can be accommodated by combining the metric\nfield, @xmath with the fluctuating part of the dilaton field, @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAssociating this new metric with Ricci scalar, @xmath and taking @xmath\nwe can then rewrite the metric as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis gives the same form as the Einstein Hilbert action in the presence\nof a field with kinetic term @xmath . Expressing the action like this is\nknown as the Einstein perspective as opposed to the string perspective\nin @xmath . The constant factor can then be determined by comparison to\nthe Einstein Hilbert action\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is Newton\u2019s constant in 26 dimensions. Identifying, as\nabove, @xmath , one obtains\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath . Interestingly, @xmath , which is the parameter of the\ngenus expansion of the generating functional for the closed string,\n@xmath . Defining the reduced Planck length in 26 dimensions @xmath and\nobserving from dimensional analysis that @xmath , we find, for the weak\ncoupling regime, that @xmath . This support the previous assertion that\nthe regime @xmath is the regime of classical gravity, if we assume that\neffects from quantum gravity only become significant when the length\nscale of the system approaches the Planck length.\n\nStarting instead from the 10 dimensional type IIB string action, we can\nanalogously obtain 10 dimensional type IIB supergravity as the low\nenergy effective action if all string loop corrections are ignored.\nSince it is tree level in string loop corrections it involves an overall\nfactor @xmath and includes the same terms derived above \u2013 the Ricci\nscalar and a kinetic term for the dilaton \u2013 as well as additional fields\ndue to the additional field content of the type IIB superstring action;\namong them a self dual four form field. None of these, however, lead to\nterms in the action identifiable as a cosmological constant. Remarkably,\nthe equations of motion for 10 dimensional supergravity still permits\nsolutions where the non-compact spacetime is an anti-de Sitter; a\nspacetime with constant negative cosmological constant. This obtains, if\nthe metric is @xmath and the field strength for the four form field\nadequately relates to the AdS curvature radius. Also, the dilaton field\nhas to be constant, while the dynamics of the remaining supergravity\nfields decouple.\n\nAs asserted above, a Kaluza-Klein reduction of @xmath leads to a tower\nof massive modes in the 5 dimensional compactified theory on @xmath .\nThus, AdS spacetime can appear as a solution for higher dimensional\nsupergravity after a Kaluza-Klein reduction of a compact internal space\neven if the higher dimensional supergravity contains no cosmological\nconstant. A Kaluza-Klein reduction may therefore reduce this higher\ndimensional supergravity theory to a lower dimensional gravity theory\nwith a cosmological constant. Indeed, supergravity on @xmath may be\ncompactified by a Kaluza-Klein reduction of @xmath to some gauged, 5\ndimensional supergravity theory [ 13 ] . \u00b9\u00b2 \u00b9\u00b2 12 In gauged\nsupergravity, the gravitinos couple to a gauge field with the\nconsequence that the transformation law for the gravitinos includes a\nconstant term. For the action to remain invariant under this\ntransformation, a constant term \u2013 the cosmological constant \u2013 must be\nadded to the action. Such gauged supergravity theories does contain a\ncosmological constant and has @xmath spacetime as its (supersymmetric)\nvacuum [ 17 ] .\n\nThe implications of this for the AdS\/CFT correspondence is that in the\nlow energy limit we may approximate the AdS side by the @xmath\n-dimensional Einstein Hilbert action \u2013 and therefore the Einstein\nequations \u2013 with cosmological constant @xmath , though we should note\nthat this disregards contributions from the field strength of the four\nform field that, as argued above, does not decouple. Supposing the\nvalidity of this approximation, we can then finally provide holographic\npicture that will be the outset of the remainder of the thesis.\n\n### 4.3 @xmath and @xmath\n\nThe overall assumption is that Einstein gravity on @xmath is dual to\nsome large @xmath , large @xmath CFT in d dimensions, where @xmath .\n\nWe will consider a one parameter family of CFT states, @xmath where\n@xmath represents the CFT vacuum. We assume that @xmath lives in a\n@xmath -dimensional Minkowski spacetime, @xmath , such that @xmath is\ndual to the @xmath -dimensional, Poincar\u00e9 patch of pure Anti-de Sitter\nspacetime with metric\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a length scale that controls the negative curvature of\nbulk spacetime. The spacetime has a Minkowski boundary for @xmath which\nis in accordance with the general result of the AdS\/CFT correspondence\nthat the quantum state @xmath with a spacetime dual @xmath is defined on\nthe boundary of the dual spacetime, @xmath . Often, we will be\ninterested in arbitrary Cauchy surfaces @xmath .\n\nGenerally, the spacetime dual of excited states @xmath can be\nrepresented by the metric\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a parameter that controls the perturbation, i.e. how\nmuch the spacetime deviates from pure AdS. As seen, pure AdS corresponds\nto a spacetime where @xmath . Thus, @xmath for @xmath whereas @xmath\nwhen @xmath .\n\nFor small enough @xmath , one finds that @xmath and we may therefore\nexpress the metric as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is known as the Fefferman-Graham coordinates. The metric can be\nused when the gravitational excitations are near the asymptotic\nboundary, @xmath . On the CFT side, this corresponds to the small\nexcitations, i.e. to states @xmath with sufficiently small @xmath .\nThese states are small perturbations of the CFT vacuum and the spacetime\ndual, @xmath , can be represented as perturbations of pure AdS spacetime\nand will take the form of asymptotically AdS spacetimes described by (\n4.36 ).\n\nHigher excited states will on the other hand be dual to AdS spacetimes\nwith very different geometry that may even have different topology. For\nsuch spacetimes, we cannot asumme that @xmath which entails that the\nEinstein Hilbert action is no longer a valid description of the AdS\nside, but needs corrections of order @xmath and higher. This, therefore,\ntakes us beyond the regime of classical (super)gravity. Intuitively,\nthis follows since one has to take into account the effects of the\nmassive string modes in high energy states.\n\nAn example of an excited CFT state with a non-trivial dual classical\nspacetime is the thermal state of a CFT on @xmath -dimensional Minkowski\nspacetime that is dual to the planar Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in\n@xmath dimensions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath . CFT states dual to black hole spacetimes will play an\nimportant role in chapter 7 , however, our interest will be in the\neternal black hole in @xmath introduced in section 2.4 . The eternal\nblack hole is conjectured to be dual to a thermal double state of two\nCFTs defined on @xmath [ 18 ] . \u00b9\u00b3 \u00b9\u00b3 13 A number of authors have\nrecently questioned this conjectured duality (see [ 19 , 20 , 21 ] ).\nThus, in the assessment of the conclusions drawn from this duality, it\nis therefore worth keeping in mind that the duality remains disputed.\nThe general claims about the relation between entanglement and spacetime\nis not directly disproved if this duality turns out to be false, the\nintuitive appeal of the qualitative argument will be somewhat damaged.\n\nThe two identical regions I and III of the eternal black hole (see\nfigure 2.4 ) have asymptotic boundaries \u2013 denoted @xmath and @xmath in\nfigure 2.4 \u2013 with spacetime @xmath . \u00b9\u2074 \u00b9\u2074 14 This follows since the\neternal black hole spacetime is asymptotically pure global AdS. These\nare also causally disconnected. In accord with the general result of the\nAdS\/CFT correspondence, the CFT dual to the eternal black hole is\ndefined on a spacetime identical to this asymptotic boundary of the AdS\nspacetime, @xmath . \u00b9\u2075 \u00b9\u2075 15 Note that for the eternal black hole this\nis not a contiguous spacetime, but instead a spacetime that consists of\ntwo disjoint copies of the same spacetime. Thus, the full quantum system\nis comprised of two identical quantum subsystems, @xmath and @xmath ,\nthat covers the local degrees of freedom of the CFTs living on the\nspacetimes identical to @xmath and @xmath respectively. Locality of the\nCFT requires that @xmath and @xmath cannot interact, i.e. their\nHamiltonians must be uncoupled. However, they can still be correlated\nvia entanglement.\n\nMore precisely, the two subsystems @xmath and @xmath can be associated\nwith two identical Hilbert spaces of states, @xmath and @xmath , that\nmay be spanned by an orthogonal basis consisting of (again identical)\nenergy eigenstates @xmath and @xmath . The thermofield double state,\n@xmath , that is the CFT state dual to the eternal black hole can then\nbe expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the inverse temperature of one of the subsystems \u00b9\u2076 \u00b9\u2076\n16 Since they are identical, the inverse temperature is the same in both\nsubsystems. and @xmath . Notably, the expression of the thermofield\ndouble state, ( 4.38 ), in terms of energy eigenstates explicitly\nunveils the local degrees of freedom of the two subsystems, @xmath and\n@xmath , to be entangled through the weighted sum over states @xmath .\nThis will be of interest later.\n\n## Chapter 5 The Ryu-Takayanagi Formula\n\nSo far, we have only provided very superficial remarks about the\nquantitative relation between @xmath -dimensional CFT and the @xmath\n-dimensional AdS spacetime. The reason for this is that the subsequent\nstudy solely relies on a single entry from the AdS\/CFT dictionary; the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula [ 5 ] and its covariant generalization [ 6 ] .\nThis formula relates entanglement entropy on the CFT side to areas of\nextremal co-dimension two surfaces on the AdS side, thereby relating an\nintrinsically quantum mechanical phenomena on the CFT side to the\ngeometry of the bulk in the spacetime dual. Using this relation alone,\nit can be shown that if the first law of entanglement entropy is\nsatisfied in a CFT, then Einstein equations to linear order are\nsatisfied in the spacetime dual.\n\n### 5.1 Relation to holography\n\nAbove, we already mentioned the remarkable result from black hole\nthermodynamics due to Bekenstein and Hawking that relates the entropy of\na black hole to its horizon area\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis gave rise to the holographic principle, which we used as a\nconsistency check for the gauge\/gravity duality. This entails a\nparticular way of conceiving of the Bekenstein Hawking formula as a\nrelation between some entropy of a CFT subsystem and the area of the\nblack hole horizon; that is the area of a particular co-dimension two\nsurface in the spacetime dual to that CFT. Thus, rather than being a\nstatement about black hole thermodynamics, this holographic\ninterpretation of the Bekenstein Hawking formula regards it as a piece\nof the AdS\/CFT dictionary. As a consequence, it is natural to speculate\nwhether the Bekenstein Hawking formula signifies a more general relation\nbetween entropies of CFT subsystems and co-dimension two surfaces in the\nbulk of the spacetime dual of that CFT.\n\nAs it turns out, such a generalization does indeed exist. For spacetimes\ndescribed by Einstein gravity with a dual CFT state, Ryu and Takayanagi\nconjectured that the entanglement entropy (defined as in ( 3.16 )) of\nsome spatial region on the CFT side is proportional to the area of the\nco-dimension two surface in the bulk of the spacetime dual that\nminimizes the area functional under certain conditions.\n\nTo put this more precisely, let us again consider quantum state, @xmath\n, with the dual spacetime, @xmath . In accordance with the gauge\/gravity\nduality, @xmath is defined in the asymptotic boundary of @xmath , @xmath\n. Let @xmath be a Cauchy surface of @xmath and let @xmath be a subregion\nof the Cauchy slice such that @xmath , where @xmath is the compliment of\n@xmath . The entanglement entropy, @xmath , of the quantum system living\non @xmath is the entropy associated with entanglement between the\nquantum systems @xmath and @xmath over entangling surface that coincides\nwith the boundary of @xmath , @xmath , i.e. the von Neumann entropy of\nthe reduced density matrix\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the degrees of freedom in @xmath are traced out of the full\ndensity matrix. Ryu and Takayangi\u2019s conjecture is that @xmath is\nproportional to the area of the co-dimension two surface, @xmath , whose\nboundary is @xmath and which extremizes the area functional\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the metric of @xmath induced on the surface @xmath . If\nmore surfaces extremizes ( 5.3 ), then the further requirement is\nimposed that @xmath must be the surface of least area that is homologous\nto @xmath . Thus, @xmath must be the surface smoothly retractable to\n@xmath that minimizes the area functional. The Ryu-Takayanagi formula\ncan then be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIt is worth noting that the area of @xmath generally will be divergent.\nThis is due to the infinite proper distance from any point in AdS\nspacetime to the boundary. This, however, is not a problem. As remarked\nin section 3.3 , short distance entanglement over the entangling surface\nin continuum quantum field theories renders the entanglement entropy for\nany quantum subsystem divergent. A regulation of this short distance\nentanglement on the CFT side exactly corresponds to introducing a\nboundary cutoff, @xmath , such that @xmath . This cutoff then serves to\nregulate the area as given by ( 5.3 ).\n\nComparing the Ryu-Takayanagi formula with the Bekenstein-Hawking\nformula, the similarity is striking. This is as expected if the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula is a generalization of the Bekenstein-Hawking\nformula in its holographic interpretation. Thus, to establish the\nBekenstein-Hawking formula as a special case can serve as a first test\nof the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. If the entropy, @xmath , in the\nBekenstein Hawking formula is interpreted as an entanglement entropy,\n@xmath , over some entangling surface, @xmath , then the black hole\nhorizon must be interpreted as a co-dimension two surface, @xmath , that\nminimizes the area functional which has @xmath and which is homologous\nto @xmath . The problem, therefore, consists in checking whether black\nhole horizons in general are extremal co-dimension two surfaces that are\nhomologous to a region on the asymptotic boundary of the black hole\nspacetime.\n\nFor spacetimes with black holes situated in the bulk, the black hole\nhorizon cannot coincide with a surface that ends on the boundary, since\n@xmath . Thus, if such bulk black hole horizons are to be identified\nwith the extremal surfaces from the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, it must be\nfor the special case where @xmath . This is the limit where @xmath\ncovers the full spacetime boundary, i.e. @xmath . Given these\nconditions, it is tempting to suppose that @xmath is the empty set as\nwell, however, since a black hole spacetime is not simply connected \u2013 it\ncontains a singularity \u2013 the empty set is not homologous with @xmath .\nInstead, @xmath must be a surface that enclose the singularity.\nConsidering all such surfaces, the one with minimal area is the black\nhole horizon. Obviously, this immediately entails that the dual quantum\nstate to a bulk black hole must be a thermal state. If @xmath is such\nthat its compliment, @xmath , is empty, then the quantum state on @xmath\nmust be thermal in order for it to have non-zero entropy and thereby for\nit to have a black hole spacetime dual with non-zero horizon area. Thus,\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking formula in its holographic interpretation may be\nviewed be a special case of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula.\n\nClaiming this, however, it is necessary to make a qualifying remark\nabout the type of entropy involved. If the full system is in a thermal\nstate, it has an entropy and is therefore not a pure state. But knowing\nonly this, the entropy cannot be designated as entanglement entropy; one\nsimply does not know the origin of the entropy. For this reason, the\ntype of entropy was left unqualified above. However for the eternal\nblack hole, the thermal properties explicitly originate from\nentanglement effects and the entropy, therefore, is entanglement\nentropy. As stated in section 4.3 , the eternal black hole is dual to a\nthermofield double state\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis is a pure state, i.e. the von Neumann entropy of the state @xmath\nis zero, but expressed as an entangled state of two subsystems. Tracing\nout the degrees of freedom of one of the subsystems, the other subsystem\nis in a thermal state. Knowing the full state, we can identify the\nthermal entropy of one of the subsystems with the entanglement entropy\nbetween the two subsystems. Either subsystem simply is in a thermal\nstate, and consequently the extremal bulk co-dimension two surface whose\narea is proportional to this entanglement entropy must be identical with\nthe black hole horizon following the argument above. Thus, when we\nconsider the entropy of one of the subsystems in the eternal black hole\nand notes its origin, then this entropy can be identified as\nentanglement entropy. Therefore, the Bekenstein-Hawking formula applies\nto the eternal black hole as a special case of the Ryu-Takayangi\nformula.\n\n### 5.2 Uses of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula\n\nAs a practical tool, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula allows us to evaluate\nentanglement entropies in strongly coupled field theories by evaluating\nthe area of @xmath in the weakly coupled dual gravity theory. However,\nwe could also work the other way around. Knowing the entanglement\nentropy, we can determine the area of the co-dimension two surface,\n@xmath . In itself, this area is not of much interest. It would be\ninteresting, if one could reconstruct the entire dual spacetime from the\nentanglement entropy of the field theory. Knowing a single area of a\nco-dimension two surface in the bulk of this spacetime will not get us\nvery far; many spacetimes will be compatible with this particular area.\nHowever, subdividing the Cauchy surface, @xmath , into different\nsubsystems will give other entanglement entropies that can be related to\ndifferent bulk surface areas.\n\nIn fact, the problem is highly overconstrained ensuring that a single\nspacetime at most \u2013 the spacetime dual of that CFT state \u2013 is compatible\nwith all the areas in the bulk that corresponds to entanglement\nentropies on the CFT side. Thus, according to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula\nit is in principle possible to find the spacetime dual of any CFT simply\nby calculating entanglement entropies. It is worth noting that the\nentanglement entropies overconstrain the dual spacetime such that there,\nfor a general CFT, will be no spacetime that is compatible with all the\nentropies. Consequently, only a smaller subset of CFTs are expected to\nhave dual descriptions as geometric spacetime theories.\n\nHowever, finding the spacetime dual even for these CFTs faces severe\ntechnical difficulties both due to problems associated with the\nevaluation of entanglement entropies on the CFT side, and due to\nproblems in solving the overconstrained problem on the gravity side.\nAlso, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula is limitated to first order in the\nbulk, and therfore correction will occur from quantum gravity if we go\ndeeper into the bulk.\n\nHowever, setting aside these technical difficulties and considering only\nfirst order pertubations in the bulk where the gravitational theory is\nwell-described by classical Einstein gravity coupled to matter (without\ncurvature couplings), the Ryu-Takayanagi formula suggests an intimate\nrelation between entanglement in @xmath dimensions \u2013 an inherently\nquantum mechanical phenomena \u2013 and then the entire bulk spacetime in\n@xmath dimensions in the (rare) cases where gauge\/gravity duality\nobtains.\n\nIt is exactly this relation that will be explored subsequently. However,\nprior to this some evidence for the Ryu-Takayanagi formula will be\nprovided.\n\n### 5.3 Evidence for the Ryu-Takayanagi formula\n\nAt its conception, the evidence of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula consisted\nin the a number of successful tests, where the extremal surface approach\nwas employed to reproduce known results for entanglement entropies of\nCFT states. These quantitative comparisons are not very numerous due to\nthe strong coupling of the CFT for @xmath . Thus, most of these\ncomparisons are between @xmath and @xmath .\n\nOne such example is the matching of the entanglement entropy for a\nsingle interval in a @xmath on @xmath . As we did in section 3.3 , we\nwill consider an interval with length @xmath centred around the origin\non the spacelike slice, @xmath , such that @xmath and @xmath . For a\n@xmath on @xmath , the spacetime dual is the Poincar\u00e9 patch of pure\n@xmath . Since the background is Poincar\u00e9-AdS, the metric induced on the\nspatial slice, @xmath , is @xmath . Following the prescription of the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula, the entaglement entropy of @xmath is equal to\nthe area of a co-dimension two bulk surface, @xmath , in the @xmath\nplane parametrized by coordinates @xmath and @xmath ; see the metric (\n2.16 ). @xmath must be a curve that has @xmath , i.e. a curve whose\nendpoints at @xmath are @xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, it must\nminimize the area functional ( 5.3 ).\n\nWe will choose the parametrize @xmath in terms of the boundary\ncoordinate @xmath . The metric induced on @xmath \u2013 with the single\ncomponent @xmath \u2013 may then be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nSince induced metric has only one component, we have @xmath . The area\nfunctional therefore takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nDefining @xmath , we may then find the extremum of the area functional\nusing the Euler-Lagrange equation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe solution is @xmath \u2013 a semi-circle around the origin in the @xmath\nplace \u2013 as may be verified by inserting back into the numerator of\nEuler-Lagrange equation:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere we have used @xmath . Thus, the co-dimension two surface, @xmath ,\nmust satisfy @xmath .\n\nInserting this into the expression for the area, we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAs expected, this integration diverges. To regulate it, we require that\n@xmath for some small @xmath . The integration then yields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nInserting this into the Ryu-Takayanagi we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIf we identify @xmath in accord with the @xmath dictionary, we get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe same result as obtained by direct calculation in section 3.3 .\n\nBesides direct agreement between the entanglement entropies in cases\nwhere the calculations are tractable on both the AdS and the CFT side,\nthe Ryu-Takayanagi formula has also been shown to satisfy various known\nproperties of entanglement entropy such as strong subadditivity. A\npartial derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for general spherical\nentangling surfaces was proposed in [ 22 ] and based on this a full\nderivation from the AdS\/CFT dictionary was developed in [ 23 ] . Both\nderivations are beyond the scope of the current project. However,\nelements of [ 22 ] will be explored in later chapters since a number of\naspects from this partial derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula will\nprove useful for other purposes.\n\n## Chapter 6 Linearized Gravity in AdS Background\n\nIn this section we introduce linearized gravity gravity first in a\ngeneric background and then in the specific case of an anti-de Sitter\nbackground.\n\n### 6.1 Perturbing spacetime\n\nLinearized gravity is a type of approximation scheme for Einstein\ngravity where the spacetime is characterized by some background metric,\n@xmath , plus a weak perturbation, @xmath , that generates only small\ncorrections to the background field such that the full metric field,\n@xmath , is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is assumed to be small compared to @xmath . Linearized\ngravity is then obtained by expanding Einsteins field equations to\nlinear order in @xmath . Since the perturbation, @xmath , is small, we\nwill assume that we can use the background metric to raise and lower\nindices.\n\nFor convenience, we will consider a one paramater family of metrics,\n@xmath , such that for each value of @xmath , @xmath solves the Einstein\nequations and @xmath . Thus, the first order correction to the\nbackground metric \u2013 the perturbation @xmath \u2013 is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe linearized Einstein equations can then similarly be obtained as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThese equations imposes constraints on @xmath . To find them, we must\nestablish what change is induced to linear order on the Einstein tensor\nby the linear order perturbation @xmath . For convenience, we will\nintroduce the notation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand may thereby rephrase the above as the task of finding an expression\nfor @xmath in terms of @xmath .\n\nThe Einstein tensor with cosmological constant is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the Ricci tensor, @xmath is the Ricci scalar and @xmath\nis the cosmological constant. Thus,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere we have defined @xmath from which it follows that @xmath . \u00b9 \u00b9 1\nTo see this, consider\n\n@xmath (6.7)\n\nTo find an expression for @xmath , one must therefore first find an\nexpression for the perturbation of the Ricci tensor @xmath . The Ricci\ntensor is given as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the Riemann tensor. The Riemann tensor, in turn, depends\non the metric connections:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe linear order change in the Riemann tensor induced by the linear\norder perturbation, @xmath may be expanded as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have used that the partial derivative is independent of @xmath\n. The last line follows since\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere we have used that the metric connection is torsion free: @xmath .\n\nWhat remains is to find perturbation of the metric connection. To find\nan expression for this, consider initially the derivative with respect\nto @xmath of the vanishing covariant derivative of the metric\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nReorganizing this, we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAnother constraint follows, since the metric connection must be torsion\nfree in the first two indices. Thus,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, using first ( 6.13 ) and then that the metric connection must be\ntorsion free, we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nApplying this two more times, we get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe metric perturbation now occurs both on the left and on the right\nhand side above. Collecting these, dividing by two and raising the last\nindex, we finally get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAs seen, this expression only depends on metric perturbation and\ncovariant derivatives taken with respect to the background metric.\n\nInserting this expression, the perturbation of the Ricci tensor becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last line follows from the identity\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing the analogous identity\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwe can substitute for the last term above and act with @xmath on all\nterms\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (6.21)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere we have used @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , and also @xmath .\n\n### 6.2 Perturbing the Poincar\u00e9 patch\n\nThe expression in terms of the Riemann and Ricci tensor is convenient\nsince we will be interested in the special case where the background is\nthe Poincar\u00e9 patch of anti-de Sitter spacetime; a solution to Einsteins\nequations with negative cosmological constant\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is a maximally symmetric spacetime and the Riemann tensor may\ntherefore be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the Ricci tensor takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing the Poincar\u00e9 coordinates, the metric tensor is diagonal, such that\n@xmath and @xmath vanishes for @xmath . Consequently, the Riemann tensor\ncontracted with the metric perturbation becomes:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the Ricci tensor contracted with the metric perturbation becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSubsequently, we will primarily be interested in @xmath .

From this, we readily see that\nthe Fefferman-Graham coordinates presumes radial gauge for the\nperturbation @xmath . \u00b2 \u00b2 2 This gauge freedom follows since there are\n@xmath coordinates. One can therefore gauge fix @xmath parameters of\n@xmath : @xmath has @xmath components and @xmath is another, which gives\n@xmath gauge fixed components in total.

Thus, it serves as a probe of the relation\nbetween entanglement on the CFT side and some spacetime surface on the\nAdS side. While this special case may be studied employing a holographic\ninterpretation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, general, holographic,\nclassical spacetimes may similarly be studied using the Ryu-Takayanagi\nformula. Below, the special case of the thermofield double state\/eternal\nblack hole will be examined first, and we will then subsequently\nconsider the generalization to arbitrary quantum states with a classical\nspacetime dual.\n\n### 7.1 Entanglement and the eternal black hole\n\nThe thermofield double state is a particular state, @xmath , in which we\ncan find the quantum system comprised of the subsystems @xmath and\n@xmath . Interestingly, the expression of the thermofield double state,\n( 4.38 ), in terms of energy eigenstates explicitly unveils how the\ndegrees of freedom of the two subsystems are entangled through the\nweighted sum over states @xmath . More explicitly, we find that the\ndensity matrix for one of the subsystems is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nfrom which it follows that\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (7.2)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nwhere we have used @xmath . This will generally be non-zero except for\nthe limit where @xmath , i.e. the limit where the temperature goes to\nzero. It is evident from this, how the inverse temperature @xmath\ncontrols the entanglement entropy and therefore the amount of\nentanglement between the degrees of freedom in the two subsystems.\n\nFrom the reduced density matrix, @xmath , we see that in the limit\n@xmath only the ground state of the subsystem, @xmath , is occupied.\nThis follows since all the energy eigenvalues other than the vacuum\nstate, @xmath , are non-zero and therefore vanish in the limit @xmath as\na consequence of the factor @xmath . Due to the symmetry of the\nthermofield double state, the same holds for the subsystem, @xmath .\nThus, in the limit @xmath the full system is the product of these two\nground states\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\ni.e. @xmath .\n\nManifestly, @xmath is a product state and does not, as expected from the\nexpression for @xmath , contain entanglement between the degrees of\nfreedom in @xmath and @xmath . In this state, therefore, the two systems\nare completely uncorrelated. What is argued in [ 1 ] is that a first\nindication of the relation between entanglement and spacetime may be\nobtained from the differences between the spacetime dual of a product\nstate like @xmath and an entangled state like @xmath .\n\nThe state @xmath where there is no entanglement between @xmath and\n@xmath consists of the tensor product of two identical pure states; more\nspecifically a product of the identical vacuum states of these\nsubsystems, @xmath . If we suppose that a pure state is dual to some\nspacetime, then the product of two pure states is dual to the product of\ntwo such spacetimes. Thus, the full spacetime consists of the product of\ntwo completely uncorrelated spacetimes. It seems, therefore, reasonable\nto suppose that these two spacetimes are disconnected, i.e. no light\nsignal travelling from one spacetime can intersect a light signal\ntravelling from the other. From the conjectured duality between the\nthermofield double state and the eternal black hole, it follows that the\nspacetime dual of the thermofield double state, where @xmath and @xmath\nare entangled, is a connected spacetime, i.e. in the eternal black hole\na light signal travelling from @xmath can intersect a light signal\ntravelling from @xmath . The comparison between @xmath and @xmath in the\ncontext of the thermofield double states suggests that entanglement\nbetween @xmath and @xmath is a necessary condition for connectivity\nbetween @xmath and @xmath in the dual eternal black hole.\n\nThis conclusion sits well with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula that\nrelates the entropy of a black hole, @xmath , with its horizon area,\n@xmath [ 12 ] .\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe duality between the eternal black hole and the thermofield double\nstate entails that the black hole entropy \u2013 regardless of its origin on\nthe AdS side \u2013 is equal to the entanglement entropy of one of the\nsubsystems in the thermofield double state [ 24 ] . Employing this\nrelation, it is possible to monitor the horizon area as seen from either\nside of the eternal black hole, when entanglement between @xmath and\n@xmath is removed in the dual thermofield double state. Since the\nhorizon area, @xmath , and entanglement entropy, @xmath , is\nproportional, it follows that when entanglement is removed between\n@xmath and @xmath , then the black hole horizon area decreases. Since\nthe entanglement entropy is controlled by @xmath , it follows that the\nblack hole horizon area decreases when @xmath increases. Apparently, in\nthe limit where all entanglement is removed between @xmath and @xmath\n(i.e. where @xmath ), the entanglement entropy goes to zero and so does\nthe horizon area. This limit is depicted in figure 7.1 for spatial\nslices @xmath and @xmath equal to a positive constant, where @xmath is\nthe timelike Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate.\n\nThe depiction suggests that the spacetime pinches such that it is only\ncontiguous at @xmath . Thus, in the limit where @xmath in the\nthermofield double state, the spacetime dual is connected by a single\npoint. This does not exactly reproduce the initial assumption that the\nproduct of two pure states, such as @xmath , are dual to two completely\ndisconnected spacetimes. A singularity remains, whose interpretation is\nuncertain. This, however, should perhaps not worry us too much. Due to\nthe critical minimum temperature for AdS-Schwarzschild black holes below\nwhich they cannot exist, it is unclear whether the above account of the\nlimit @xmath is correct. When @xmath , the temperature of the thermal\nstate of @xmath and @xmath goes to zero, i.e. below the critical\ntemperature. We should therefore be careful when taking the limit @xmath\n. Despite this complication, it is clear how removing (some)\nentanglement between the two subsystems of the thermofield double state,\n@xmath and @xmath , decreases the connectivity in the dual eternal black\nhole spacetime. From this latter observation, van Raamsdonk \u2013 not\nconsidering the complication related the minimum temperature \u2013\nconcludes: \u201cIn this example, classical connectivity arises by entangling\nthe degrees of freedom in the two components \u201d [ 1 , 2325, emphasis in\noriginal] . Entanglement between @xmath and @xmath is a necessary\ncondition for spacetime connectivity between regions A and B in the\neternal black hole.\n\n### 7.2 Beyond the eternal black hole\n\nWhile conceived in the context of the duality between the eternal black\nhole and the thermofield doublestate, the relation between entanglement\nand spacetime connectivity generalises to any quantum state with a\nclassical spacetime dual.\n\nSuppose again that @xmath is a generic quantum state with a classical\nspacetime dual @xmath with boundary @xmath and @xmath is a state in the\nHilbert space, @xmath , for a CFT defined on (a spatial slice of) @xmath\n. Now, divide the boundary @xmath into two regions @xmath and @xmath ,\nsuch that @xmath (see figure 5.1 ). Since a CFT is a local quantum field\ntheory, there are specific degrees of freedom associated with specific\nspatial regions. We can therefore regard the full quantum system as\ncomposed of two subsystems, @xmath and @xmath , associated with two\nspatially separated regions @xmath and @xmath . As a consequence, we can\ndecompose the Hilbert space of states of the full system as a tensor\nproduct of the Hilbert spaces of states of @xmath and @xmath : \u00b9 \u00b9 1\nSome complications are involved in making such a decomposition in a\ngauge invariant way, but these will not be considered here.\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n@xmath can therefore be expressed as a sum over products of states\n@xmath and @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis will generally not be a product state, i.e. a product of a state in\n@xmath and @xmath . Thus, the local degrees of freedom in @xmath and\n@xmath will generally be entangled.\n\nAgain, assume that the spacetime dual of a product state\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nis dual to two disconnected spacetimes. One then obtains the result that\nentanglement between @xmath and @xmath in @xmath is a necessary\ncondition for the dual spacetime @xmath to be a connected spacetime. The\nduality between the thermofield double state and the eternal black hole\nis just a particular example of this.\n\nWe may monitor this more closely using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAgain, it follows that changing the entanglement between @xmath and\n@xmath changes the connectivity between the two corresponding regions in\nthe spacetime dual.\n\nWhen @xmath , the state of the full quantum system becomes a product of\ntwo pure states such that there is no entanglement between the local\ndegrees of freedom in @xmath and @xmath . Thus, in this limit the\nentanglement entropy, @xmath , goes to zero and so does the area of\n@xmath according to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. More explicitly stated,\nin this limit the bulk metric changes such that the minimal area\ndividing the two asymptotic regions @xmath and @xmath in the spacetime\ngoes to zero; the spacetime dual of the quantum state pinches when\n@xmath . For the spatial surface @xmath , figure 7.2 depicts the limit\nwhere all entanglement is removed between @xmath and @xmath .\n\nAgain, the limit where all entanglement is removed between the quantum\nsubsystems does not exactly reproduce the expectation that the tensor\nproduct of two pure states is dual to a disconnected spacetime. The two\nregions @xmath and @xmath remain connected by a single singular point\nthat has no clear interpretation. Nevertheless, it evident how\nentanglement between @xmath and @xmath is related to the connectivity\nbetween @xmath and @xmath in the spacetime dual. Further support for\nthis is found in an argument from the mutual information \u00b2 \u00b2 2\nSchematically, the mutual information, @xmath , can be defined as @xmath\nwhere @xmath is the entanglement entropy between a region @xmath and the\nrest of the system [ 1 ] . between a point in @xmath and one in @xmath\nto the effect that the proper distance in the dual spacetime between any\ntwo such points goes to infinity when the entanglement between @xmath\nand @xmath goes to zero [ 25 ] . As summarised by van Raamsdonk, \u201cthe\ntwo regions of spacetime pull apart and pinch off from each other\u201d [ 1 ,\n2327] . In other words, the conclusion from section 7.1 extends even to\nspacetimes with a contiguous boundary.\n\nIf the AdS side and the CFT side in the AdS\/CFT correspondence are\nregarded as two different ways to encode the same information about a\nphysical system, then the above qualitative investigation of the\nrelation between spacetime and entanglement in the AdS\/CFT\ncorrespondence offers an indication of how some of this information is\nencoded in the two different descriptions. The aspect of the physical\nsystem described on the AdS side as spacetime geometry is encoded on the\nCFT side as entanglement structure. It is, however, important to notice\nthat the argument merely demonstrates how entanglement on the CFT side\nis a necessary condition for spacetime connectivity on the AdS side.\nIndeed, bulk entanglement corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula\nentails that entanglement is not sufficient for spacetime connectivity.\n\n## Chapter 8 Linearized Gravity from Entanglement\n\nIf the entanglement structure indeed can represent the same physics as\nbulk spacetime, there must be constraints on entanglement that\ncorresponds to Einstein\u2019s field equations. Finding such correspondences\nwould provide more quantitative justification for the claim that the\nsame physical phenomena can indeed be encoded either as entanglement\nstructure on the CFT side or as bulk spacetime.\n\nIn the following, it will be shown that if perturbations of the CFT\nvacuum state satisfies a particular constraint on entanglement entropy\nthen the spacetime dual of the perturbed state satisfies Einstein\u2019s\nfield equations expanded to linear order around pure AdS. Thus, there is\na general constraint on entanglement entropy in the CFT state that\ncorresponds to imposing Einstein\u2019s field equations in the bulk of the\nspacetime dual.\n\nThe constraint imposed on the CFT side is the following:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the entanglement entropy of a region in a CFT and @xmath\nis some energy associated with that region.\n\n( 8.1 ) is similar to the first law of thermodynamics and a derivation\nof Einstein equations from this relation sits well with previous\nattempts to derive these equations from thermodynamics [ 26 ] . However,\ncontrary to the first law of thermodynamics ( 8.1 ) holds for arbitrary\nperturbations of the vacuum state and not only for thermal\/equilibrium\nstates as it is the case for the first law of thermodynamics.\n\nTo derive Einstein equation from ( 8.1 ), one must establish a\ntranslation between this relation in the holographic CFT to quantities\nin the spacetime dual. For the entanglement entropy (LHS of ( 8.1 )),\nthis translation is obtained by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe change in energy (RHS of ( 8.1 )) can be translated as an energy\nassociated with the asymptotic behavior of the metric. This, together\nwith the Ryu-Takayanagi formula allows the translation of ( 8.1 )\nholding in the CFT into a relation that must hold in the spacetime dual,\nwhich turn out to be the linearized Einstein equations in vacuum.\n\nThe material of this chapter is based on [ 3 , 4 , 27 ] . No new results\nare derived here, however, a number of details are filled in which are\nnot explicit elsewhere in the literature.\n\nAs in section 4.3 , we will consider a one parameter family of CFT\nstates, @xmath and assume that @xmath lives in a @xmath -dimensional\nMinkowski spacetime, @xmath , such that @xmath has as its spacetime dual\nthe @xmath -dimensional pure Poincar\u00e8 patch of Anti-de-Sitter spacetime.\nThe metric of the dual spacetime therefore takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAgain, the dual spacetime of the quantum state @xmath will be doneted\n@xmath . Its boundary will be denoted @xmath and arbitrary Cauchy\nsurfaces on this boundary will be denoted @xmath .\n\nWithin this framework, we first want to demonstrate that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nholds for all small perturbations of the CFT vacuum state i.e. for all\n@xmath with small @xmath . Here, @xmath is the entanglement entropy of\n@xmath for a ball shaped region @xmath and @xmath is the variation of\nthis entropy compared to @xmath . @xmath is the so-called hyperbolic\nenergy of the region @xmath and @xmath is the variation of this energy\nwith respect to @xmath .\n\nSecondly, we want to demonstrate that if ( 8.4 ) holds for a quantum\nstate then linearized Einstein equations hold in the spacetime dual of\nthis quantum state. To do this, we will provide a holographic\ninterpretation of @xmath and @xmath which both translate as integrations\nover (parts of) @xmath in terms of the metric perturbation @xmath .\nRequiring an equality to first order between the holographic expressions\nof @xmath and @xmath will then be shown to be equivalent to imposing\nEinstein\u2019s equations to first order on @xmath .\n\nIn the following, it will be assumed that all states, @xmath , are small\nperturbation of @xmath and that their spacetime duals, @xmath ,\nconsequently are small perturbations of @xmath , i.e. of the Poincar\u00e8\npatch of pure AdS.\n\n### 8.1 Entropy and the modular hamiltonian\n\nThe entanglement entropy of a spatial region in a CFT is defined via the\nreduced density matrix. Again, we define for some CFT state @xmath the\nreduced density matrix associated with an arbitrary spatial region\n@xmath as:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the compliment of @xmath . The von Neumann entropy is\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nNow, consider the perturbed state @xmath such that @xmath is the\nentanglement entropy in the region @xmath . Varying this with respect to\n@xmath , we find (to any order in @xmath )\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere last line follows since the trace of density matrix must be unity.\n\u00b9 \u00b9 1 It has fixed normalization and therefore @xmath . Defining the\nmodular Hamiltonian of the region @xmath : @xmath we get\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere @xmath is independent of @xmath and therefore we can take the\nderivative outside the trace\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the equality follows from the definition of the expectation value\n@xmath .\n\nThereby, we obtain the general relation that holds for an arbitrary\nregion @xmath and for any perturbation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nGenerally, the modular Hamiltonian, @xmath , is not a local operator.\nThus, it cannot in general be evaluated from the local fields of a\nquantum field theory. However, there are certain exception where @xmath\nis a local operator. One example is the special case where @xmath is a\nball shaped region with radius @xmath . \u00b2 \u00b2 2 I.e. a particular spatial,\nco-dimension two surface of @xmath . The domain of dependence for this\nregion is defined as usual as consisting of those points for which all\ncausal curves that passes through the point and also passes through\n@xmath .\n\nAs shown by [ 22 ] , there is a conformal mapping of this domain of\ndependence for a ball shaped region in Minkowski spacetime to a Rindler\nwedge of Minkowski spacetime. This is the part of Minkowski spacetime\nthat is accessible for a uniformly boosted observer. Identifying @xmath\nand @xmath , the Rindler wedge has the metric\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath .\n\nGenerally, it holds that the density matrix for a half space (like the\nRindler wedge) is thermal for the vacuum state of a Lorentz-invariant\nquantum field theory. \u00b3 \u00b3 3 Unruh radiation is a well known effect of\nthis. To see this, consider first the Wick rotated (Euclidean) statement\nof the path integral for a quantum field theory where @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are respectively final and initial field\nconfigurations. This may be identified as density matrix of a thermal\nstate @xmath under the assumption @xmath and @xmath and @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe partition function, i.e the trace of the density matrix @xmath , can\nbe expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is equivalent to a path integral over all periodic paths with\nperiod @xmath which we express as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe can obtain the reduced density matrix for a region @xmath by tracing\nout the degrees of freedom in the compliment of @xmath , @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, note that for some state @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the vacuum state. This follows since all energy\neigenstates other than the vacuum state are suppressed by a factor\n@xmath . This entails that\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (8.18)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere we have suppressed the integral over the degrees of freedom in\n@xmath . From this, we can obtain an expression for the vacuum density\nmatrix\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (8.19)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhich follows since\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (8.20)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nConsider the special case where we are interested in the density matrix\nfor the Rindler wedge of the Minkowski vacuum, i.e. a half-space of a\nparticular QFT vacuum state. First, define the region @xmath of\nMinkowski spacetime by @xmath . Thus @xmath is a half-space. We then\nhave\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is still the wick rotated time coordinate. Change the\ncoordinates to polar coordinates, @xmath and @xmath such that the metric\nmay be expressed as @xmath (where we have suppressed the remaining\ndirection @xmath ). We then have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nComparing to ( 8.16 ), we identify this as a density matrix over @xmath\nwith @xmath and Hamiltonian, @xmath , that generates evolution in the\nvariable @xmath , i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the coordinates, @xmath , the metric takes the form @xmath which we\nrecognize as the metric of the Rindler wedge in Minkowski spacetime.\n@xmath , therefore, is the generator of Rindler time (the boost\ngenerator of Minkowski spacetime) and @xmath is a thermal density matrix\nof the Rindler wedge. Thus, combining the results ( 8.22 ) and ( 8.23 ),\nwe find that reduced vacuum density matrix for the half space @xmath is\nequal to the thermal density matrix defined in terms of the boost\ngenerator with @xmath , i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the Rindler wedge, @xmath is the time coordinate and classical time\ntranslations are generated by the vector field\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn Minkowski space, time translations are simply generated by the vector\nfield @xmath and the Hamiltonian, therefore, can be obtained from the\nenergy density operator for Minkowski spacetime, @xmath , by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nBy the same procedure, one can obtain the Hamiltonian for the Rindler\nwedge, @xmath , however, its expression as a sum of vector fields\ncomplicates things. The complication can be avoided by noting that the\nHamiltonian must be the same for any Cauchy surface of the spacetime, we\ncan therefore choose @xmath such that the second term in ( 8.25 ) is\nzero. Thereby, @xmath can be expressed in terms of the full Minkowski\nspacetime energy density operator @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is required to ensure that we only include the right\nRindler wedge. With this, we can obtain an expression for the density\nmatrix for the ball shaped region using the inverse mapping from the\nRindler wedge to the domain of dependence for @xmath . Since we are\nconsidering a CFT state, the energy eigenstates, including the vacuum\nstate, are invariant under this conformal mapping. Associating with this\nmapping the transformation @xmath , on finds\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last equality follows from ( 8.24 ). Now define @xmath such\nthat @xmath . From this it immediately follows that @xmath and we may\ntherefore identity @xmath as the modular Hamiltonian and observe that (\n8.28 ) yields a direct expression for the modular Hamiltonian of a ball\nshaped region in terms of the known Hamiltonian for the Rindler wedge,\n@xmath and the transformation @xmath from the Rindler wedge to the\ndomain of dependence for a ball shaped region.\n\nUsing this, one finds\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere, @xmath is the energy density operator for the CFT and @xmath\nserves as a squared radial coordinate centred in the center of the ball.\nFor further details, see [ 4 , 22 ] .\n\nWe can then obtain the sought expression for the first order variation\nin @xmath away from vacuum of the expectation value of modular\nHamiltonian\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFinally, making an identification between the expectation value of the\nmodular Hamiltonian and the hyperbolic energy, @xmath , the relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis obtained by substitution into ( 8.10 ).\n\n### 8.2 Holographic interpretation of @xmath\n\nTo see what corresponds to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nin the spacetime dual, we must find an interpretation of @xmath and\n@xmath on the AdS side.\n\nA holographic interpretation of entanglement entropy is already provided\nby the Ryu-Takayanagi formula ( 8.2 ). This involves the evaluation of\nthe area of a minimal co-dimension two surface in the spacetime bulk\nthat divides the boundary region @xmath and its compliment.\n\nGenerally, one can parametrize a co-dimension two surface as @xmath\nwhere @xmath is an embedding function. The area functional, @xmath , for\nsuch surfaces can then be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the determinant of the metric induced on this surface by\nthe embedding function @xmath such that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe will use the notation @xmath for the extremal of the area functional,\nwhere @xmath is the embedding function which extremizes the area.\n\nNow, consider a small perturbation of the metric @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthat will entail a small variation of the spacetime. In the original\nspacetime the area, @xmath , was extremized by @xmath but with the\nvariation in spacetime due to the variation in @xmath another surface\nwith embedding function, @xmath , will extremize @xmath .\n\nThe variation in extremal surface area is then\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that @xmath extremizes the functional @xmath . This entails that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\ni.e. the first order variations of the unperturbed extremal surface with\nrespect to variation in the embedding function vanishes. \u2074 \u2074 4 For an\nextremum, the first order variation always vanishes. The second term in\n( 8.36 ) can therefore be rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe then observe that @xmath is of order @xmath from which it follows\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe therefore find that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus, to linear order in @xmath , the variation in @xmath depends on the\nvariation in @xmath while the embedding function, @xmath , is held\nfixed.\n\nThe variation of @xmath is controlled by the variation in the induced\nmetric. To first order in @xmath , the variation in the induced metric\nis proportional to the variation in the metric since the first order\nvariation of the embedding function vanishes. Thus, reintroducing the\nperturbation parameter @xmath , we can express the perturbation of the\ninduced metric as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have suppressed the tensor notation and the dependence of\n@xmath on @xmath .\n\nThe variation to first order in @xmath (i.e. to first order in @xmath )\nof the square-root of the induced metric, @xmath , entering in the area\nfunctional ( 8.33 ) may then be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have used the identity @xmath . The derivative becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.43)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last line reintroduces the tensor notation and replaces the\ntrace with a sum over repeated indices. Thus we find the following\nexpression for the variation of the square root\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe can then insert this into the area functional, and get an explicit\nexpression of the variation of the extremum of the area functional due\nto a first order variation in the metric\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, we want again to consider the particular example where the\nperturbed metric @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe embedding function @xmath of interest is the mapping from the\nco-dimension two surface, @xmath , to the spacetime with metric @xmath ,\nwhich extremizes the area of @xmath , whose boundery at @xmath is a ball\nshaped region, @xmath , with radius @xmath and which is defined on the\nconstant time slice @xmath . In pure AdS, the bulk surface that\nextremizes the area of @xmath for a ball shaped boundary is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath are the spatial Minkowski coordinates, i.e. the coordinates\non the boundary @xmath .\n\nParametrizing this extremal surface using these boundary coordinates,\nsuch that @xmath , one finds the embedding function\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince we have chosen a constant time slice, we may disregard the time\ncoordinate and consider only the spatial coordinates, @xmath . The\nunperturbed induced metric, @xmath , then takes the form\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (8.49)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere the last equality follows since @xmath and @xmath and therefore is\ndiagonal with Lorentzian signature and elements @xmath . Now\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.51)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nso we find that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.52)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.53)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis can be verified using the relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.54)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the identity @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe square root of the determinant of the induced metric, @xmath ,\nbecomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last equality follows from ( 8.54 ). The first order variation\nof the induced metric, @xmath , is then given as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.57)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have used the assumption (radial gauge) @xmath and that the\nembedding function, @xmath , is invariant under the first order\nvariation of the the metric.\n\nAll of this can then be combined to obtain an expression for the first\norder variation around pure AdS in the area of the extremal surface with\na ball shaped boundary\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last line assumes that the center of the ball shaped region is\n@xmath . Using the Ryu-Takayanagi formula ( 5.4 ) we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.59)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus, for CFT state @xmath that has pure AdS as its spacetime dual, a\nsmall variation in the entanglement entropy, @xmath , of a ball shaped\nregion @xmath is proportional to the change in area of the extremal\nsurface @xmath , @xmath , due to the corresponding perturbation of the\nAdS metric.\n\n### 8.3 Holographic interpretation of @xmath\n\nFrom\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.61)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwe see that a holographic interpretation of the hyperbolic energy,\n@xmath , merely requires an interpretation of the energy density\noperator, @xmath , for the CFT.\n\nTo find this holographic interpretation, consider first an infinitesimal\nball shaped region, @xmath , on the boundary @xmath centred at @xmath .\nFor such a infinitesimal ball, the expectation value of the energy\ndensity operator can be assumed to be the same throughout the ball. To\nleading order, we can therefore replace the function @xmath with its\ncentral value @xmath , where @xmath is the center. The variation in\nhyperbolic energy for such an infinitesimal ball, @xmath , is given by (\n8.30 ) when taking the limit @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.62)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the area of the unit ball of dimension @xmath (surface\narea of the unit sphere in dimension @xmath ). From ( 8.4 ) it then\nfollows that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.63)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nInserting the holographic interpretation for @xmath into ( 8.59 ) we\nfind\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.64)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo investigate the limit @xmath , it is convenient to define coordinates\nthat are constant in this limit\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.65)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWith these coordinates we find the expression\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.66)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.67)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince we consider the limit @xmath , we assume that the metric\nperturbation is the same throughout the region enclosed by @xmath , i.e.\n@xmath . The integrals are over symmetric intervals and therefore all\nterms where @xmath will not contribute since\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.68)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe therefore have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.69)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince there is nothing particular about the numbering of the coordinates\n@xmath , the @xmath integrals above must be equal\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.70)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nOne thereby finds \u2075 \u2075 5 This is a rather remarkable result in its own\nright. Assuming only the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, we have derived the\nknown relation [ 28 , 29 ] between the first order variation of the\nexpectation value of the CFT stress energy tensor and the bulk metric\nperturbation @xmath .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.71)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow nothing was assumed for the point @xmath , so this holds for all\n@xmath . We can therefore substitute the first order variation of energy\ndensity, @xmath , in the CFT state with the metric perturbation at the\nboundary, @xmath times some constant\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.72)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis, thereby, provides a holographic interpretation of the hyperbolic\nenergy for a ball shaped region on @xmath . Below, we will define\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.73)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n### 8.4 Combining the holographic results\n\nIn the two previous section we found holographic interpretations (and\nexpressions) for @xmath and @xmath . The relation @xmath holds for any\nCFT quantum state. It will turn out that if and only if this equality\nholds for all disks in all Lorentz frames then the bulk metric satisfies\nthe Einstein\u2019s field equations to linear order in @xmath .\n\nThe two holographic interpretations are\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.74)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.75)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have introduced the shorthand @xmath and @xmath for the\nholographic interpretation of @xmath and @xmath , respectively.\nCombining these and using the relation @xmath , we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.76)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\na relation between the metric perturbation on the boundary and in the\nperturbation in the bulk. This bulk constraint was first shown to be\nequivalent to linearized Einstein equation in vacuum in [ 3 ] , however,\na more elegant derivation was developed in [ 4 ] inspired by the\nIyer-Wald formalism [ 30 ] . Only the details of the latter derivation\nwill be recounted here.\n\nIn [ 4 ] , they show that the non-local constraint ( 8.76 ) is equal to\nthe linearized Einstein equations in vacuum if there is a form, @xmath ,\nsuch that (off shell)\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.77)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.78)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, is the exterior derivative, @xmath are linearized Einstein\nequations, @xmath is the Killing vector\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.79)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe see that all but the time component vanishes at time, @xmath .\nFurther, on the extremal surface @xmath that satisfies @xmath and @xmath\nalso the time component, @xmath , vanishes. Thus, @xmath is a\nbifurcation surface of the killing vector @xmath . Finally, @xmath is\nthe volume form of co-dimension one surfaces in the bulk\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.80)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the antisymmetric tensor in @xmath dimensions, for which\nwe define @xmath . For a surface of constant time, we have @xmath and\nall component but @xmath vanishes. This follows since all terms of\n@xmath either include the antisymmetric tensor with repeated indices or\nwedge products that involve @xmath .\n\nDefining the volume @xmath as the volume bounded by @xmath , where\n@xmath and @xmath as above are spacelike surfaces at @xmath . From that\nit follows\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.81)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFurthermore, we require that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.82)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the boundary of AdS which entails that @xmath since\n@xmath .\n\nAssuming there is such a form, @xmath , it can then be shown that if the\nnon-local constraint @xmath is satisfied in the bulk, then Einstein\u2019s\nfield equations to linear order are satisfied in the bulk, i.e. the\nconstraint implies that @xmath . First, relation @xmath implies that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.83)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last equality follows from Stokes theorem. Next, we multiply\nby @xmath , take the derivative with respect to @xmath and expand using\nLeibniz\u2019 integration rule for forms [ 31 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.84)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the interior product and @xmath is a vector orthogonal\nto @xmath , such that @xmath , where @xmath is a unit vector in the\nradial direction. It is an axiom of exterior derivatives that @xmath for\nany differential form @xmath of a smooth function @xmath . Therefore,\nthe first term in the expansion vanishes. Thus, inserting the expression\n( 8.78 ) for @xmath and using ( 8.81 ), we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.85)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe first term vanishes, which can be seen by splitting the surface\nintegral over @xmath into an integral over @xmath and one over @xmath\n(valid since @xmath ). The integral over @xmath vanishes due the\nrequirement @xmath . The integral over @xmath vanishes since @xmath is a\nbifurcation surface of @xmath ( @xmath ). Thus, only the second term\nabove is non-vanishing. The derivative, restricted to the volume @xmath\nfor which @xmath , can be evaluated by inserting the time component of\n@xmath as given in ( 8.79 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.86)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe then finally get\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.87)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is satisfied only if @xmath .\n\nTo see that this implies @xmath , observe that ( 8.87 ) is of the form\n@xmath . Then take the derivative of this with respect to @xmath and use\nStokes theorem:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.88)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the area element on @xmath . Expanding this integral, we\nfind\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.89)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last equality follows from ( 8.82 ). Now, we identify @xmath\nas the average moment of the function @xmath on @xmath and find that\nthis vanishes. Next, consider the derivative of @xmath with respect to\n@xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.90)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last equality follows since @xmath only contributes with a\nconstant factor. Again, we used Stokes theorem. We identify this as the\nfirst moment of @xmath on @xmath in the @xmath direction for vanishing\naverage moment. As seen, this also vanishes.\n\nSince the first order moment vanishes, it holds that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.91)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAgain, taking the derivative with respect to @xmath gives\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.92)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis, we recognize as the second moment of @xmath on @xmath in the\n@xmath direction for vanishing average moment. Also this vanishes. We\ncan continue this procedure and show that all moments of @xmath on\n@xmath vanishes if @xmath . Thus, @xmath .\n\nGoing to our particular example @xmath with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.93)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nit follows that @xmath , since @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are non-zero.\n\nThe argument so far has been carried assuming that the @xmath was a\nsubset of a surface of constant time. Thus, we have assumed a frame of\nreference with four velocity, @xmath . Going to a general frame of\nreference, one finds that the condition @xmath entails\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.94)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAs a crude test, we see immediately that this reproduces the result\nabove for the four velocity @xmath . If we assume that ( 8.94 ) holds\nfor arbitrary four velocities @xmath then it follows that @xmath . Thus,\nthe linearized Einstein equations are satisfied for the boundary\ncoordinate directions. What remains is to show that @xmath and @xmath .\nFirst note that @xmath and @xmath for @xmath which follows from ( 8.82\n). These are analogous to initial value constraints that must be\nsatisfied by @xmath . Consider the general result of the initial value\nformulation of general relativity that if the spatial components of the\nEinstein equations are satisfied everywhere, then the initial value\nconstraints given on some spatial slice of the spacetime are satisfied\neverywhere. This result follows from the Bianchi identity @xmath [ 32 ,\n252-267] . However, this result may as well be applied to constraints at\nthe surface @xmath . If the remaining components, @xmath , of the\nEinstein equations are satisfied in all of spacetime as well as the\nconstraints at the surface @xmath then these constraints are satisfied\nin all of spacetime. This entails that if @xmath and @xmath and @xmath\nfor @xmath then @xmath and @xmath for all @xmath . Thus, if @xmath is\nsatisfied in the bulk and there is a form @xmath that satisfies the\nstated constraints then it follows that linearized Einstein equations\nare satisfied in the bulk.\n\n### 8.5 The form @xmath\n\nWhat remains is to show that there is a form @xmath for which ( 8.77 ),\n( 8.95 ), ( 8.78 ), and ( 8.82 ) holds. Let us make the ansatz\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.95)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.96)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis entails @xmath since the covariant derivative of the Levi-Civita\ntensor vanishes. We may therefore expand the variation of @xmath with\nrespect to the metric as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.97)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have defined @xmath and used\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.98)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAlso, we have used the expression for the variation of the covariant\nderivative ( 6.17 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.99)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n( 8.97 ) may be reinserted into the expression for @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.100)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe will consider @xmath restricted to the constant time surface @xmath ,\nwhere all but the time component of @xmath vanishes. Thus, @xmath which\nfollows from the expression ( 8.79 ). This entails that @xmath and\n@xmath . One must also use that @xmath and that @xmath . The latter can\nbe verified by requiring that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.101)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.102)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nFor small perturbation, the term @xmath vanishes from which it follows\nthat @xmath . We therefore have\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.103)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere @xmath assuming radial gauge. Using these, we may evaluate @xmath\non the surface @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.104)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nAgain, we will consider the case where the metric is approximated by the\nFefferman-Graham metric such that @xmath . Using this expression for the\nmetric perturbation and that @xmath , we find the final expression for\n@xmath :\n\n  -- -- -- ---------\n           (8.105)\n  -- -- -- ---------\n\nwhere we, in the last equality, have ensured that the indices on @xmath\nis lowered such that we can use definition ( 8.96 ). Note that the index\non partial derivatives are still raised and lowered by the\nKronecker-Delta, @xmath .\n\nWith this expression we can now verify that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.106)\n     @xmath      (8.107)\n     @xmath      (8.108)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nFirst, consider the integration over @xmath . Here, @xmath since @xmath\non @xmath which follows since @xmath on @xmath . Define\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.109)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nand observe that the integral of the @xmath form @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.110)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nInserting this and the expression for @xmath into ( 8.110 ), we find\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.111)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere the last equality follows since @xmath on @xmath and @xmath .\nInserting the expression for @xmath at @xmath gives\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.112)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nNext, consider the integration over @xmath . Since @xmath is a\nbifurcation surface of the killing vector @xmath , it follows that\n@xmath on @xmath . Both @xmath and @xmath are non-vanishing, so we have\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.113)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nHere we define the function @xmath as above but now restricted to the\nsurface @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.114)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere the last equality follows since @xmath on @xmath . We also define\nin addition\n\n  -- -- -- ---------\n           (8.115)\n  -- -- -- ---------\n\nAgain, we have\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.116)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere the integration now is over the surface @xmath . For the\nintegration over the @xmath -part, we have\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.117)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere we have used the chain rule to replace @xmath by @xmath and @xmath\n.\n\nFor convenience, we will evaluate the integration over @xmath and @xmath\nseparately:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.118)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.119)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nPutting these elements back together and using @xmath , we finally\nobtain\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.120)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nFinally, consider the external derivative, @xmath . Writing @xmath and\nusing that @xmath , we can express the external derivative as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.121)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere we have defined @xmath . The minus sign arises since @xmath must\nbe the first rather than the second index of the Levi-Civita symbol\ninside @xmath , and the Levi-Civity is anti-symmetric. Using @xmath and\nthe expressions for @xmath and @xmath , we can evaluate the two partial\nderivatives:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.122)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere we have used that @xmath . The derivative @xmath becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.123)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere we have used that @xmath and @xmath .\n\nCollecting the terms, we get\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.124)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nTo put the exterior derivative on the form @xmath , we have to raise the\nindex of @xmath and replace it by @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.125)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nInserting this, we get\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.126)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (8.127)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nin agreement with the result found for the linearized Einstein equations\nin AdS in section 6.2 . Thus, we see that the linearized Einstein\nequations in vacuum follows from the holographic interpretation of the\nfirst law of entanglement entropy.\n\n## Chapter 9 Beyond Linearized Gravity\n\nSo far, we have on the AdS side considered the limit @xmath of general\nrelativity. In this limit, the source term appearing in the Einstein\nequations, @xmath , is suppressed since it is of order @xmath . Thus, to\ngo beyond vacuum solutions we must include also the first subleading\norder in @xmath in the expansion of the Einstein equations. The limit\n@xmath is \u2013 following the identification ( 4.33 ) \u2013 equivalent to the\nlimit @xmath . According to the AdS\/CFT dictionary, @xmath ( 4.6 ) and\ntherefore the first subleading order in @xmath corresponds to an\nexpansion on the CFT side that includes the first subleading order in\n@xmath . In the previous chapter, the CFT side relation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwas derived in full generality, i.e. to any order in @xmath . This\nrelation therefore holds also to subleading orders in @xmath .\n\nOur interest here will be to see what this first law of entanglement\nentropy corresponds to on the AdS side, if we include the first\nsubleading order in @xmath . We will find that this gives rise to a\nsource term in linearized Einstein gravity exactly corresponding to the\nsource term, @xmath , in the Einstein Equations. This result was first\nobtained in [ 33 ] which the present chapter is based on.\n\n### 9.1 @xmath corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula\n\nAs already indicated, once we include subleading orders in @xmath on the\nCFT side, we will have to consider matter fields on the AdS side. To\nfirst subleading order in @xmath , we can approximate the AdS side as a\nsemi-classical gravity, i.e. by a classical spacetime @xmath and a\nquantum matter field living on that spacetime, @xmath such that the dual\nof some quantum state @xmath is the pair @xmath . The approximation\nremains semi-classical since we assume that the spacetime @xmath is a\nclassical spacetime, i.e. it cannot be a superposition of spacetimes,\nwhich supposedly would be allowed in a full theory of quantum gravity.\n\nGoing to subleading order in @xmath or equivalently @xmath induces\ncorrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. More precisely, it is\nconjectured in [ 7 ] that subleading order corrections to the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula is due to bulk entanglement over the surface\n@xmath , that is the entanglement between the degrees of freedom in the\nregion @xmath \u2013 the region bounded by @xmath \u2013 and the rest of the\nsystem. The correction takes the form of the entanglement entropy of the\nquantum field on @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere we have signified that the CFT entanglement entropy, @xmath , is a\nfunction of the CFT state @xmath and that he bulk entanglement entropy,\n@xmath , is a function of the state of the bulk field, @xmath . Just as\nwe motivated the Ryu-Takayangi formula as a generalization of the\nBekenstein-Hawking formula, we can motivate this correction to the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula by continuing the analogy to the case of black\nholes where corrections are also supposed to arise due to entanglement\nover the black hole horizon. It is essentially this result that has been\ngeneralized in [ 7 ] to arbitrary surfaces that minimizes the area\nfunctional.\n\nSubsequently, we will simply assume that this corrected Ryu-Takayanagi\nformula is sound for quantum states with a semi-classical spacetime\ndual. With this formula, we can \u2013 in analogy to the previous chapter \u2013\nobtain holographic interpretations of @xmath and @xmath . Again, a\nholographic interpretation of @xmath is immediately provided now by the\ncorrected Ryu-Takayanagi formula. The variation @xmath therefore\nconsists of the already derived variation of the area of the surface\n@xmath ( 8.59 ) and the variation of the bulk entanglement entropy over\nthe surface @xmath . The variation of the latter, @xmath , in principle\noriginates in two sources: variation of the surface @xmath and variation\nof the bulk field @xmath . The former, however, vanishes to first order.\nThis follows since entanglement entropy \u2013 just like the area of the\nminimal surface @xmath \u2013 is extremized by the embedding function @xmath\nand the first order variation always vanishes for such an extremum. What\nremains, therefore, is to find an expression for the variation of @xmath\ndue to the variation of the bulk field @xmath .\n\n### 9.2 A holographic interpretation of @xmath and @xmath\n\nIn analogy to the entanglement entropy of a quantum subsystem on the CFT\nside, the bulk entanglement entropy, @xmath , is given in terms of the\nreduced density matrix, @xmath , for the region @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nDepending only on the variation, @xmath , we may express the variation\nof the bulk entanglement entropy in terms of the variation of the @xmath\nby an argument parallel to that of ( 8.7 )\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere we have again used that the trace of the density matrix must be\nunity. Defining the bulk modular Hamiltonian\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwe find\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the last equality follows since @xmath is independent of the\nvariation and from the definition of the expectation value.\n\nSimilarly to the modular Hamiltonian on the CFT side, the bulk modular\nHamiltonian cannot in general be expressed in terms of local operators.\nHowever, for the particular case where the full spacetime is AdS\nspacetime and we are interested in the modular Hamiltonian of the region\n@xmath , the modular Hamiltonian can be expressed as an integral over\nthe bulk energy momentum tensor\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are given as in ( 8.79 ) and ( 8.96 ). The\nderivation of this expression is analogous to the derivation in section\n8.1 . Further details can be found in [ 33 ] . With this expression for\n@xmath we find that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor the hyperbolic energy, we found in section 8.3 the first order\nholographic interpretation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis was obtained by considering an infinitesimal ball on the boundary;\nsubleading corrections to @xmath should therefore be related to the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the bulk region associated with this\ninfinitesimal boundary ball. Thus, if we assume that the expectation\nvalue of bulk energy-momentum tensor, @xmath , vanishes on the boundary,\nit follows that the correction to @xmath vanishes to first subleading\norder in @xmath .\n\n### 9.3 Linearized gravity coupled to matter\n\nIn the previous chapter, we found ( 8.83 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath . Including the correction to @xmath , we have the\nfollowing relation to first subleading order in @xmath in the bulk\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, imposing as a constraint the holographic interpretation of the\nfirst law of entanglement entropy @xmath , we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAn argument analogous to that in section ( 8.4 ) implies that this\nconstraint is satisfied only if @xmath , i.e. if the linearized Einstein\nequations with source term @xmath are satisfied in the bulk.\n\nThis, therefore, demonstrates that imposing the constraint @xmath to\nsubleading order in @xmath on a quantum state with a semi-classical\nasymptotically AdS spacetime dual is equivalent to imposing the Einstein\nequations on that spacetime to subleading order in @xmath in the bulk,\ni.e. the spacetime satisfies the equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe constraint, @xmath , we argued holds to any order in @xmath . This\nmay trigger the consideration whether it is equivalent to the Einstein\nequations to all orders. In order for @xmath to occur in ( 9.13 ), it\nmust be the case that @xmath is present in the general spacetime\nconstraint equivalent the general CFT constraint @xmath . Prima facie ,\none could think that there were other operators, @xmath , in this\ngeneral spacetime constraint. The idea would be that the source term\ncould be of the form @xmath . As argued in [ 33 ] , a rather simple\nobservation renders such a construction unlikely. From this general\nsource term, we must obtain @xmath to subleading order in @xmath , i.e.\n@xmath must vanish to this order. This would obtain if the operator\n@xmath was such that it annihilated the bulk vacuum state. However, any\nexpansion in terms of creation and annihilation operators of a local\nquantum field theory operator will include terms without annihilation\noperators \u2013 in other words, only with creation operators \u2013 and\ntherefore, the operator @xmath cannot be a local quantum field theory\noperator since @xmath . There may be more subtle ways to make this\nconstruction, however, the argument indicates that the full\nsemi-classical Einstein equations,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nare the general constraints on the spacetime equivalent to CFT\nconstraint @xmath .\n\nA more indirect argument to this effect is the observation that\nentanglement may occur between all types of degrees of freedom. All\ndegrees of freedom in a subsystem contribute to the entanglement entropy\nand are therefore taken into account when the entanglement entropy for\nthe subsystem is evaluated. In this way, entanglement is universal. As\nis well known, the Einstein equations signifies that all stress energy\nare sources of gravity. Regardless of the origin of the stress energy it\nsources the gravitational field. As they write in [ 33 ] : \u201cwe can say\nthat the universality of the gravitational interaction comes directly\nfrom the universality of entanglement \u201d. This, we may argue, is why the\nfull semi-classical Einstein equations should be equivalent to some\nconstraint on entanglement in the dual quantum state.\n\nIt is worth remarking that even if we can obtain the full semi-classical\nEinstein equations from @xmath , there still is an important restriction\nto the domain of application of this result essentially due to the fact\nthat the spacetime is still classical. This is explicitly seen from the\nfact that the Einstein tensor (with cosmological constant) @xmath , on\nthe LHS of ( 9.14 ), is not a quantum operator. Thus, ( 9.14 ) as a\nwhole is not an operator relation; which can be regarded as the reason\nwhy we have to take the expectation value of @xmath . A more subtle\npoint leading to the same conclusion is that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula\nis ill-defined if the geometry under consideration is a superposition of\nspacetimes. Since the whole machinery above is founded on the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula, it follows that we can at most obtain\nsemi-classical gravity using it as our holographic dictionary. Thus,\nunless further correction are made to the Ryu-Takayanago formula, we\ncannot go beyond this domain of validity.\n\n## Chapter 10 Conclusion\n\nAs demonstrated in chapter 8 and 9 , the linearized Einstein equations\nboth with and without matter in a @xmath -dimensional AdS background can\nbe derived from the first law of entanglement entropy in a @xmath\n-dimensional CFT. Furthermore, it was speculated that the full\nsemi-classical Einstein gravity follows from imposing to first law of\nentanglement to all order in @xmath .\n\nThe result is quite remarkable. Gravity in @xmath dimensions may be\nencoded in an intrinsically quantum mechanical structure \u2013 entanglement\nstructure \u2013 in a @xmath -dimensional CFT. The dynamics described by the\nEinstein\u2019s field equations can be reinterpreted as a first law like\ndynamical constraint on entanglement. But however remarkable this may\nbe, the import of the result is initially less significant. The\nholographic relation between gravity and entanglement does not in the\nform developed here offer new insights the overarching problem of\ncontemporary theoretical physics: Quantum gravity. By offering the\nalternative interpretation of semi-classical gravity as entanglement\nstructure, we are offered an alternative description of a theory that we\nalready know well and which arguably is less than full theory of quantum\ngravity. \u00b9 \u00b9 1 It should be noted that there are those who argue for the\npossibility of semi-classical gravity on the fundamental level. See for\ninstance [ 34 ] for a recent discussion. For this and other reasons,\nthere are continued research on the holographic relation between\nentanglement and gravity. It is beyond the scope of the present project\nto account for this research in detail, however, we will here just\nmention a few of the recent developments.\n\nIn [ 35 ] , the holographic relation between entanglement and gravity is\nrigorously extended to non-linear gravity by showing that the second\norder perturbation of Einstein\u2019s field equations follows from the first\nlaw of entanglement entropy. Again, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula is\nemployed as the only ingredient of the AdS\/CFT dictionary. This may\nprove relevant, since a holographic relation between entanglement\nentropy and an emergent spacetime structure similar to the\nRyu-Takayanagi formula has recently been recovered in the context of\nloop quantum gravity [ 36 ] . This may suggest an independence from the\nAdS\/CFT correspondence (and therefore from string theory) for a\nholographic prescription like the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Obtaining the\nRyu-Takayanagi in loop quantum gravity is driven by the relation between\nloop quantum gravity and tensor networks. Interesting, recent research\nhas also explored the links from the relation between entanglement and\ngravity studied here to (random) tensor networks [ 37 , 38 ] .\n\nIn the chapters above, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula played a crucial role\nin the derivation of the holographic relation between gravity and\nentanglement. In [ 39 ] it is argued that one can obtain the same result\nusing only the Bekenstein-Hawking formula under the assumption that the\nentanglement entropy is maximized for small fixed volume balls.\n\nA research program relevant for classical general relativity is the\nconjectured relation between the Fisher information defined in terms of\nrelative entropy for CFT subsystems and canonical energy in a dual AdS\nspacetime. It has been shown in [ 40 ] that the Fisher information is\npositive definite which entails that the corresponding canonical energy\nis positive definite as well. This in turn suggests a new positive\nenergy theorem in general relativity.\n\nThere are also work that explores other constraints on entanglement in\nCFTs and how these translate holographically as constraints in the bulk.\nFor instance, mutual entanglement information is considered in [ 41 ]\nand strong subadditivity (as well as mutual information) is considered\nin [ 42 ] .\n\n#### Acknowledgements\n\nThis project is the result of many insightful discussion with more\npeople than I can list here.

The effects of\natmospheric turbulence are described and key mathematical notations set\nout. After defining basic terminology, the corrective techniques of\nadaptive optics and lucky imaging are introduced. Finally, I state my\nthesis proposition and summarise the following chapters.\n\n### 1.1 Atmospheric turbulence and light propagation\n\nLooking up at the night sky, it is easy to observe the distorting\neffects of the atmosphere, even on a cloudless night \u2014 the stars\ntwinkle. This phenomenon of varying intensity in the stellar light,\nscintillation, is one of a wider range of atmospheric optical effects\nknown generally as \u201cseeing.\u201d Since seeing and the atmospheric turbulence\nthat causes it play a key role in the techniques discussed here I will\ngive a brief introduction to the models used in its description. Many of\nthe intricacies are omitted for brevity; the reader is referred to, for\nexample, Roddier ( 1981 ) for a concise review of the relevant\nderivations.\n\n#### 1.1.1 Basic turbulence modelling\n\nThe seeing effects of turbulent flow within the atmosphere are indirect.\nOptical distortions are not due to the turbulent motion of the\natmosphere itself, but rather due to variations in refractive index\ncaused by temperature differences. There is an ever changing temperature\ngradient in the atmosphere, and seeing occurs when small pockets of air\nbecome mixed into a layer with a different temperature, causing a\nsignificant change in refractive index on small spatial scales. The\ntemperature of a small volume of air equalises with its surroundings\nslowly compared to the mixing timescale, so we can think of the\ntemperature as a \u2018passive advective scalar\u2019 carried by the turbulent\nvelocity field in much the same way as dye can be seen to follow a\nturbulent liquid flow (buoyancy effects being negligible).\n\nTo characterise this process mathematically we first invoke the\nKolmogorov (1941) scaling law for homogeneous three dimensional\nturbulence. The basic assumption is that energy only enters the\nturbulent system at the largest scales and only dissipates at the\nsmallest due to viscosity; for example in a teacup the largest or\n\u2018outer\u2019 scale might be the stroke length of a stirring spoon. We further\nassume that between these large and small scales, in what is known as\nthe \u2018inertial range,\u2019 kinetic energy is conserved. \u00b9 \u00b9 1 Note that the\nassumptions of Kolmogorov\u2019s 1941 theory do not account for energy stored\nas or converted into pressure fluctuations, which are sometimes\nsignificant. The energy propagates down to the inner scale through a\nseries of subdividing vortices in what is known as a Richardson cascade\n(after the fluid dynamicist Lewis Fry Richardson). This allows a swift\ndimensional analysis arriving at the power law for the spectral energy\ndensity in three dimensions:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the spectral energy density, and @xmath is the\nwavenumber corresponding to a spatial scale @xmath , with the relation\n@xmath . This is the ubiquitous \u2018Kolmogorov power spectrum,\u2019 which has\nbeen verified for the velocity field in a wide range of turbulent\nfluids, at scales in the inertial range (Figure 1.1 illustrates the drop\noff at the inner and outer scales). Kolmogorov also introduced the use\nof the structure function as a tool for studying turbulence. Random\nvariables such as velocity are often not stationary, that is to say the\nunderlying mean value of the random process may be slowly varying. We\nuse the structure function, denoted @xmath and defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\ni.e. the mean square difference between two locations, to look at the\nvariations on different scales. The Kolmogorov structure function for\nthe velocity field in three dimensional homogeneous turbulence is\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is a parameter depending on the energy of the turbulence.\n\nObukhov ( 1949 ) and Corrsin ( 1951 ) independently suggested that a\npassive advective scalar should have the same structure function and\npower spectrum as the velocity field. This assumption is somewhat flawed\n(see Section 6.1.1 ), but the structure function largely satisfies the\nstandard Kolmogorov power spectrum, and this has proven to be an\nadequate hypothesis for much modelling of astronomical seeing.\n\n#### 1.1.2 Image propagation\n\nThe next step is to consider the interaction of the star light with this\nturbulence. Taking the classical view of light as oscillations in a\ncomplex scalar field we can consider incident monochromatic light with\nrepresentation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhich experiences perturbations due to the varying refractive index of\nthe turbulence and emerges as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nfor any instantaneous observation. Here @xmath is the fractional change\nin the amplitude, A, due to atmosphere, and @xmath is the wavefront\nperturbation, which evolve as the turbulent atmospheric temperature\nstructure changes.\n\nSince we are considering \u2018clear air turbulence\u2019 \u00b2 \u00b2 2 i.e. without\nclouds partially absorbing the light, or any other change in atmospheric\ntransmission. the varying refractive index of the atmosphere only\ndirectly affects the phase of the light; amplitude variations are a\nsecondary effect caused by the diffraction of light as it propagates\nbetween the turbulent layer and the observer. For the purposes of\nmodelling a good astronomical site at longer wavelengths it is usually\nappropriate to neglect diffraction and scintillation effects. This is\ncalled the geometric propagation model, as it effectively models bundles\nof rays \u00b3 \u00b3 3 Vectors representing paths of light propagation. whose\nwavefronts are advanced or retarded by the turbulent phase perturbations\ncollectively referred to as the \u2018phase screen.\u2019\n\nTatarski ( 1961 ) showed that for an atmospheric refractive index @xmath\n, which has turbulence induced variations with structure function\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nthe structure of the atmospheric phase screen @xmath takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the structure function parameter, varying with height\n@xmath in accordance with different intensities of turbulent variation\nin refractive index. This integral can be rewritten in terms of a single\nparameter; the Fried coherence length @xmath (Fried 1965 ) :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhich describes how the mean square phase difference between two points\nscales with the distance between them. The Fried coherence length\nrepresents the diameter of a telescope which will be almost unaffected\nby the seeing \u2074 \u2074 4 Specifically, the Fried coherence length defines the\naperture of a telescope with the same optical transfer function as the\natmospheric effects. See Roddier ( 1981 ) for more detail. , and varies\nwith the wavelength of observation as @xmath . As the ratio between\ntelescope diameter and Fried length increases the point spread function\nthat would ideally be an Airy disc splits up into multiple bright spots\nknown as speckles, created by interference between light from regions\nacross the telescope aperture within which the phase differs by around 1\nradian, sometimes referred to as \u2018coherent cells.\u2019 This ratio, @xmath ,\nis a useful dimensionless number when comparing the severity of\natmospheric turbulence for different telescope sizes, observing\nwavelengths, and prevailing atmospheric conditions. This phase\ndisturbance scaling law has been verified by observation over a range of\nscales, with deviations as the outer scale of the turbulence is\napproached. This characterisation of the phase screens can be used as a\nmodel to simulate the effects of atmospheric turbulence upon\nastronomical telescopes, as covered in chapter 6 .\n\n### 1.2 Characterising wavefront aberrations and image quality\n\nSince terms describing wavefront perturbations and image quality are\noften of use when discussing astronomy in the presence of atmospheric\nturbulence, it is worth introducing them for the unfamiliar reader\nbefore proceeding.\n\n##### Zernike modes\n\nIn the same way that sine and cosine functions can be used to represent\na signal composed of many different frequencies via a Fourier transform,\na surface representing the phase of a non-planar wavefront entering a\ntelescope pupil can be broken down into orthogonal components. A\nsuitable set of functions for performing such a deconstruction are the\nZernike modes (Noll 1976 ) . The low order Zernike modes correspond to\nthe lowest frequency changes across the wavefront, and due to the\nKolmogorov power spectrum these large scale changes always have the\ngreatest amplitude (on average). Therefore when performing modal\ncorrection \u2014 i.e. trying to correct for each Zernike mode in turn \u2014 the\nlargest improvements come from correcting the low-order terms first.\nHence the terms \u2018low order\u2019 and \u2018high order\u2019 adaptive optics. The first\nZernike term is piston, important for comparing phase across two\ninterferometry apertures but irrelevant for a single aperture. The next\ntwo terms are tip-tilt, which together create an overall slope of the\nwavefront - this slope causes the point spread function (PSF) to move\nabout in the focal plane. Higher order terms cause all manner of\ndistortions, well known to manufacturers of optics and telescopes.\nFigure 1.2 illustrates the wavefront shape for the astigmatism and\ndefocus modes.\n\n##### Point Spread Function\n\nWhen describing the image quality of an optical system, the point spread\nfunction is usually the main focus of discussion. This is the light\nintensity distribution as measured in the focal plane, for an unresolved\nsource (i.e one well approximated by an infinitesimal \u2018point\u2019 source of\nlight). Note that there are subtleties in describing the PSF, for\nexample one may choose to include or neglect the effects of pixellation\nand sampling. These distinctions are covered briefly in chapter 4 .\n\n##### Strehl ratio and full width at half maximum\n\nWhile Zernike modes describe phase perturbations directly, they do not\ndescribe the effect of atmospheric perturbations upon the image quality,\nand indeed the PSF. There are two ubiquitous measures for these effects.\n\nThe first is the Strehl ratio, defined as the ratio between the peak\nintensity of the observed PSF, and that which would be measured if no\nphase perturbations were present and the optical system were performing\nperfectly. To determine this ratio we require the total source flux, in\norder to estimate the ideal peak intensity. Accurate measurements of\nStrehl ratio therefore require both accurate photometry and a well\nsampled image so that the peak intensity may be accurately estimated.\nThe ideal peak intensity is often well approximated by using an Airy\ndisc model for the ideal image, although this may not be the case if\nsignificant support structures are present or a segmented primary mirror\nwith large inter-segment spacing is used.\n\nThe second is full width at half maximum (FWHM). As the name suggests,\nthis enumerates the angular width of the PSF at half the peak intensity.\nThe implicit assumption is that the PSF is axisymmetric; while often not\nexactly true this is usually a reasonable approximation to the half\nmaximum radius.\n\nMany other measures such as full width at half enclosed flux (FWHEF) and\nencircled energy (EE) at a given radius exist, but Strehl ratio and FWHM\nare the most commonly used.\n\n##### Seeing width\n\nAnother commonplace term in ground based astronomy is seeing width. This\nis simply the FWHM of a long exposure image obtained via conventional\nimaging at a large telescope. The atmospheric effects upon the PSF make\nthis effectively independent of the telescope aperture for @xmath of,\nsay, 10 or greater. The seeing width @xmath is dependent upon observing\nwavelength through the relation (Tokovinin 2002 ) :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor use as a general metric of seeing conditions @xmath is usually\nquoted for a reference wavelength of 500nm.\n\n##### Wavelength dependence\n\nIt is worth mentioning that metrics of image quality which refer to\ncharacteristics of the PSF, such as Strehl ratio, FWHM, seeing width,\nand isoplanatic angle (see below) are all strongly dependent upon the\nobservation wavelength. This is due to two factors. Firstly, propagation\npath differences caused by atmospheric turbulence or imperfect optics\nequate to different fractions of different wavelengths. For example, a\n250nm optical path difference may be quite detrimental at 400nm (blue\nlight) but will have little effect at 2200nm (\u2018K band\u2019 infrared).\nSecondly, the ideal PSF also varies accordingly, such that longer\nwavelengths will have a wider, shallower ideal PSF. The resulting\ncombined effect is usually a much improved Strehl ratio when observing\nat longer wavelengths.\n\nA corollary is the fact that since @xmath , the seeing width actually\ndecreases as the observation wavelength is shifted to longer wavelengths\naccording to the equation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfor a given severity of atmospheric turbulence, when in the seeing\nlimited regime (i.e. @xmath ).\n\n### 1.3 Adaptive optics\n\nThe most widespread method of attempting to overcome atmospheric\nturbulence effects in astronomy is adaptive optics. A brief recap of\nsome key concepts and issues in this significant subfield of optical\nengineering is appropriate here, as it lends context to the discussion\nof lucky imaging to come.\n\nA full introduction to adaptive optics (AO) is beyond the scope of this\ndocument, and the reader is referred to the excellent books of Tyson (\n2000 ) for an overview and Hardy ( 1998 ) for a full review. Figure 1.3\nserves as an illustration of the general premise. In short, a portion of\nthe incoming light is directed via a beamsplitter to some form of\nwavefront sensor. From the sensor, data is passed to a control system\nwhich estimates the perturbations to the wavefront. The control system\nthen calculates appropriate commands to send to the corrective\ncomponent, a deformable mirror. By using the deformable mirror to alter\nthe path lengths for different sections of the wavefront a correction to\nthe phase perturbations can be applied. The deformable mirror is placed\nbefore the beamsplitter in the optical train, creating a closed loop of\nfeedback and correction. The aim is to perfectly counteract the ever\nchanging atmospheric phase perturbations, resulting in a planar\nwavefront and thus achieving the full resolution and light concentration\npotential of the telescope.\n\nNote that the wavefront sensor requires a bright source in order to\nsense the phase perturbations with good signal to noise ratio, in a time\nspan shorter than the typical evolutionary timescale of the atmospheric\nturbulence. The easiest way to achieve this is to observe a single\nbright star, termed the \u201cguide star.\u201d In practice, sensing and\ncorrecting the atmospheric phase perturbations with the required\naccuracy and speed is a challenging feat of engineering, and even with\nidealised systems there are fundamental limits to the performance.\n\n#### 1.3.1 Field of view and isoplanatic angle\n\nSince the phase perturbations of star light are accrued during\npropagation through the atmosphere, they depend on exactly which section\nof atmosphere the light wave passed through. As a result, correcting for\nphase perturbations for one source will generally only provide partial\ncorrection for sources separated by a significant angular width. For\nwidely separated sources the phase perturbations may even be near\nindependent, such that applying corrections for one increases the phase\nvariance of the other.\n\nIn order to quantify this effect with a single number we use the\nisoplanatic angle. This is defined as the angular separation between the\nguide star and a secondary source at which Strehl ratio is decreased by\na factor of @xmath . As with Strehl ratio, the isoplanatic angle is\nstrongly dependent upon the wavelength of observation. At shorter\nwavelengths, the path differences observed in light from sources of a\ngiven angular separation becomes apparent at much smaller angles. Hence\nobservations at shorter wavelengths entail a smaller isoplanatic angle.\n\nTypically the isoplanatic angle of a standard AO system is small\ncompared with the field of view \u2014 for example, measurements at the\nParanal observatory range from around 2.5 \u2013 4 arcseconds (Sarazin et\u00a0al.\n2002 ) at 500nm. Even supposing total sky coverage (see below) this is a\nserious limitation, particularly for surveys or large extended objects.\nThere are two developments of adaptive optics which seek to enlarge the\nisoplanatic patch, multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) and\nmulti-object adaptive optics (MOAO). Both techniques use multiple guide\nstars to probe the atmosphere in different directions and so\ntomographically reconstruct a 3D model of the turbulence structure.\nMulti-conjugate systems then use 2 or more deformable mirrors conjugated\nto the optical heights of the turbulent layers, to correct for each\nlayer in turn. In this way the phase correction is arranged to be\ndifferent for different parts of the focal plane \u2014 so each target within\nthe corrected field of view has the phase disturbance of its own\npropagation path corrected for, enlarging the effective isoplanatic\npatch.\n\nThere is currently one MCAO demonstrator on sky, with the acronym MAD,\nat the ESO Very Large Telescope facility (VLT). Gullieuszik et\u00a0al. (\n2008 ) report J band imaging with a mean FWHM of 0.15 arcseconds across\na 45 by 45 arcsecond region, when the estimated seeing FWHM at J band\nwas 0.52 arcseconds. This is an impressive accomplishment, and suggests\nthat imaging of a Hubble space telescope resolution and field of view is\nnow becoming available from the ground in the J and K bands. However,\nthe sky coverage issues described below still apply. Target acquisition\nis also quite slow, with a typical loop closing period of 20-40 minutes\non MAD. The system relies on favourable turbulence conditions for best\nperformance, where most of the @xmath profile is confined to only 2\nlayers, one at ground level and the other at 8.5km. Future MCAO systems\ncould have more conjugated mirrors and variable conjugation heights, but\nthis reduces light throughput and increases complexity.\n\nMulti-object adaptive optics is a proposed technique mainly applicable\nto integral field unit spectroscopy (see for example Ass\u00e9mat et\u00a0al. 2007\n) . The idea is to use laser tomography and many deformable mirrors to\ncorrect the phase disturbances separately for each spectrography target\nin the field. Since it is impractical to perform wavefront sensing for\nall the targets this requires open loop wavefront correction. Open loop\ncorrection presents a significant technical challenge, because it\nrequires phase corrections to be made accurately without any direct\nmeasurements of the current state of the deformable mirrors \u2014 so their\npositioning must be correct first time. However it is not so reliant as\nMCAO on the turbulence being highly confined to few layers.\n\nThe widest field of view likely to be achieved is with ground layer\nadaptive optics (GLAO). This attempts to correct only for the layer of\nturbulence closest to the telescope, which may often contribute half or\nmore of the integrated @xmath profile depth. This gives a wide\nisoplanatic angle because the propagation paths for different targets\nare close at this height. GLAO is mainly aimed at survey and\nspectrography programs, as simulations suggest that typical FWHM\nimprovement is a comparatively modest 0.1 arcsecond better than seeing\nwidth, but applies over a field of up to 49 by 49 arcminutes (For a low\norder AO system on an 8m telescope, Andersen et\u00a0al. 2006 ) . As the\nnumber of guide stars increases the potential improvement under bad\nseeing conditions becomes larger. Such a system has been proposed for\nthe Gemini observatory.\n\n#### 1.3.2 Sky coverage\n\nOne of the major obstacles to widespread use of adaptive optics has been\nsky coverage. The requirement for a bright enough guide star in the\nvicinity of the target to be observed significantly limits the regions\nof sky to which the technique can be applied. This has led to the\ndevelopment of artificially generated \u201claser guide stars\u201d (LGS). For\neasy differentiation, a bright star used for guiding is generally\nreferred to as a \u201cnatural guide star\u201d (NGS).\n\nThe current generation of adaptive optics systems have limiting natural\nguide star magnitudes in the R band varying from 4th to 14th magnitude,\nwith curvature wavefront sensors providing lower order wavefront\ninformation but working with sources up to 4 magnitudes fainter than\nShack-Hartmann sensors (Racine 2006 ) . A generous isoplanatic patch\nsize of 40 arcseconds (in K band, say) then implies sky coverage of\nabout 5%.\n\nThe AO community has sought to overcome this severe target constraint by\ndeveloping laser guide stars that can be pointed anywhere in the sky;\nthese come in two varieties, Rayleigh scattering and Sodium excitation\nlasers. Rayleigh back scattering laser guide stars are a maturing\ntechnology in terms of reliability and cost, to the level that a\nlow-cost robotic LGS-AO system is being developed for 1.5m class\ntelescopes Law ( 2008 ) . However, there are several problems associated\nwith Rayleigh guide stars, as reviewed in Devaney ( 2007 ) :\n\n-   No tip-tilt determination: Tip-tilt information cannot be recovered\n    from an LGS because the refraction of the beam on the way out\n    cancels with the refraction on the way back. The usual solution is\n    to observe an NGS simultaneously. Since the NGS is only being used\n    to recover lowest order information it has less severe requirements\n    than a full AO guide star \u2014 for example at the VLT this tip-tilt\n    star must be brighter than 17th magnitude in V band and within about\n    60 arcseconds of the target (Davies et\u00a0al. 2008 ) . This requires an\n    additional beamsplitter in the optics, and is an intrinsic problem\n    with all laser guide stars.\n\n-   Focal anisoplanatism or cone effect: The typical Rayleigh scattering\n    height of 8-12 km presents problems for high order AO. The less than\n    infinite propagation height means that the laser wavefronts are\n    slightly curved, introducing focal anisoplanatism, and the highest\n    layers of atmospheric turbulence are not probed (see Figure 1.4 ).\n    This problem increases in magnitude with telescope size.\n\n-   Spot elongation: Away from the axis of propagation the elongation of\n    the laser scatter column can be seen, and this extension of the\n    source makes it harder to use with a wavefront sensor. Again this\n    problem gets worse as telescope size increases.\n\n-   No fly zone: High power laser guide stars are required to employ\n    aircraft spotters and switch off the beam if there is any chance of\n    an encounter.\n\nDue to the cone effect and spot elongation it becomes impractical to use\na Rayleigh scattering laser guide star as telescope size increases.\nSodium lasers excite the layer of atmospheric sodium at around 95km, and\nso ameliorate the cone effect and to a lesser extent the spot\nelongation. However, they come with their own problems --- sodium\nfrequencies are currently only widely available through use of dye\nlasers, which are inefficient and unreliable compared to solid state.\nFor example, operation of the Keck system requires an extra observing\nassistant and a laser technician. Solid state sodium lasers are in\ndevelopment however, so wider application may not be many years away.\nThe larger size of sodium lasers usually prohibits them from being\nplaced on-axis of the main telescope, and so the beams have to be piped\nby fibre optics, introducing another technical challenge. Finally, even\nif the equipment works as intended the sodium layer varies in height and\ndensity, \u2075 \u2075 5 The sodium layer owes its existence to meteor showers,\nresulting from the sodium atoms released as they burn up in the\natmosphere. Hence the abundance varies according to the seasonal meteor\ndensity. so that if conditions are bad it may only produce a faint\nfluorescence. In conclusion, sodium lasers are certainly an improvement,\nbut not a panacea.\n\n#### 1.3.3 Observation wavelengths\n\nThe current generation of adaptive optics only work well at longer\nwavelengths where the atmospheric phase perturbations are a smaller\nfraction of the observing wavelength, or equivalently, @xmath ratios are\nlower. Typically observations are made in the infra-red J,H and K bands,\nwith Strehl ratios ranging from @xmath 0.4\u20130.7 in K and @xmath 0.2\u20130.3\nin the shorter J band (Racine 2006 ) . As a result, 10 metre class AO\nassisted telescopes such as Keck and the VLT typically achieve imaging\nresolution with a FWHM of order @xmath 0.1 arcseconds \u2014 on a par with,\nbut not exceeding, the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope (of\ncourse this data is complementary, since it provides information from a\ndifferent wavelength regime). It is worth noting that tests of next\ngeneration adaptive optics systems are promising (e.g. Esposito et\u00a0al.\n2010 ) and the situation may improve once the new systems come online,\nbut certainly these figures are likely to remain valid for most\nobservatories in the near future.\n\nTo summarise, adaptive optics is now a relatively successful tool for\nhigh resolution ground based observing with infra-red wavelengths, but\nunder significantly restricted conditions. The engineering complexities\npresented mean that AO systems are expensive, and require highly skilled\npersonnel in order to operate and maintain them. This will remain the\ncase as the systems evolve and increase in complexity in order to\novercome some of the limitations of more basic systems.\n\n### 1.4 Lucky imaging\n\n#### 1.4.1 A very brief history\n\nThe origin of lucky imaging is credited to Fried ( 1978 ) , who gave one\nof the first quantitative analyses of the subject in his paper\n\u201cProbability of getting a lucky short-exposure image through turbulence\u201d\n\u2014 giving rise to the technique\u2019s name. It is of historical interest to\nnote the earlier work of R.E. Hufnagel (whom Fried cites in his own\nwork). Hufnagel proposed similar methods and derived the result that\nlucky imaging achieves the best results when the ratio @xmath (Hufnagel\n1966 ) , but was not widely published. \u2076 \u2076 6 More information on\nHufnagel\u2019s work may be found at:\nhttp:\/\/www.ast.cam.ac.uk\/research\/instrumentation.surveys.and.projects\/lucky.imaging\/references\nHowever, the technique was not feasible with the detectors available at\nthe time, and so its development into an observing tool has taken over\n20 years.\n\nThe basic concept of lucky imaging is simple. The atmospheric seeing is\nrandom; as such there are moments in time when the seeing is\nsignificantly better or worse than average. The coherence time\nassociated with the seeing is on the order of tens of milliseconds, so\nto pick out the very best moments requires a camera that can record\nframes on a similar timescale.\n\nWith the continued development of CCDs throughout the 1980s and 1990s\nthe technical challenges started to become tractable; although detectors\nwere still either sensitive, but too slow to freeze the atmospheric\nchanges (e.g. Nieto et\u00a0al. 1987 ) , or fast but noisy \u2014 a good example\nof this is Dantowitz et\u00a0al. ( 2000 ) , in which the authors produced\nhigh resolution images of Mercury (a very bright source, often brighter\nthan 0th magnitude) on the Palomar 60 inch telescope at 60 frames per\nsecond with digital video equipment. Baldwin et\u00a0al. ( 2001 ) used a\nspecialised CCD at frame rates of up to 185 frames per second to prove\nthe concept of lucky imaging with stellar sources on the 2.5m Nordic\noptical telescope, but were still limited to 6th magnitude stars by\nreadout noise. Development of the electron multiplying CCD cameras\ndescribed in chapter 2 finally combined the desired properties of fast\nframe rates and low read noise, enabling application of lucky imaging to\na wide range of targets.\n\nAnother technological advance key to lucky imaging is the ever\nincreasing performance of computer systems, both in terms of processing\npower and data throughput, since lucky imaging involves a fairly\nsizeable amount of data processing. After data acquisition, each frame\nis cleaned of detector artefacts and analysed in order to assess the\nseverity of the atmospheric turbulence at that moment (detailed in\nchapter 4 ). The best frames are then aligned to correct the effects of\natmospheric tip-tilt shifting the image in the focal plane, and co-added\nvia a Drizzle algorithm (Fruchter and Hook 2002 ) . As more frames are\ncombined, signal to noise ratios slowly improve and faint stars become\nvisible above the background noise.\n\n#### 1.4.2 Pros and cons\n\nThe key limitation of lucky imaging is that the the technique is only\nfeasible when telescope aperture size and atmospheric observing\nconditions result in @xmath ratios of around 7 or less, as detailed in\ntable 1.1 . For higher ratios the chance of obtaining good frames\ndiminishes rapidly, following the formula (Fried 1978 ) :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe observation wavelengths are restricted by the availability of\nsensitive high speed detectors, the sensitivity of current electron\nmultiplying CCDs declining as the wavelength moves from the visible into\nthe infra red. For typical seeing at good astronomical sites this limits\nthe technique to application on telescopes of 3m diameter at most,\nresulting in images with FWHM of order @xmath 0.1 arcseconds. However,\nlucky imaging fills the niche of high resolution imaging in the visible\nwavelengths where adaptive optics is ineffective, the only other option\nbeing to obtain space based observations.\n\nFuture developments in Mercury-Cadmium-Tellurium infrared detectors\n(Rogalski 2005 , Rothman et\u00a0al. 2009 ) may change this situation,\nenabling lucky imaging in the infrared as a cheap alternative to\nadaptive optics on medium sized telescopes. However, a proper\nfeasibility study considering current technology is beyond the scope of\nthis thesis.\n\nCompared to adaptive optics, lucky imaging is a relatively low cost tool\nfor high resolution imaging. While an EMCCD camera may cost a few tens\nof thousands of dollars, the price of a full adaptive optics system may\nnumber in the millions. Operation could also be made relatively simple\nand reliable, since no moving parts are involved.\n\nAnother advantage is that zero target acquisition time (after telescope\nslew) means lucky imaging can make efficient use of observing time, for\nexample several hundred binary targets were observed over a few nights\nwith a queue observing routine during a February 2008 observing run (Law\net\u00a0al. 2008 ) .\n\nFinally, isoplanatic angles appear to be larger than for adaptive\noptics, typically 30 arcseconds in average to good seeing. The faint\nguide star limit is also considerably better than for adaptive optics,\nwith previous limiting estimates of approximately 16th magnitude in SDSS\ni\u2019 band Tubbs ( 2003 ), Law et\u00a0al. ( 2006 ) (more on this in chapter 4\n). The combination of these factors results in much better sky coverage\nwhen compared to natural guide star AO.\n\n#### 1.4.3 Current status of lucky imaging techniques\n\n##### Conventional lucky imaging\n\nStandard lucky imaging is now a proven technique for providing\ndiffraction limited imaging at telescope diameter to Fried coherence\nlength ratios of up to @xmath , for example in the SDSS i\u2019 band on the\n2.5m Nordic Optical Telescope (Law et\u00a0al. 2005 , Lodieu et\u00a0al. 2009 ) .\nElectron multiplying CCDs capable of high frame rates are becoming more\nwidely available, and other teams have successfully implemented their\nown routine usage lucky imaging systems which are often employed for\nprojects surveying binarity (Hormuth et\u00a0al. 2008a , Oscoz et\u00a0al. 2008 )\n. Early EMCCD detectors were only available in small pixel formats, but\nlarger devices are now available with a format of @xmath , increasing\nthe field of view. Noise artefacts present in earlier cameras are now\nmuch less troublesome.\n\n##### Lucky imaging enhanced adaptive optics\n\nIn July 2007 the Cambridge lucky camera was tested behind the \u2018PALMAO\u2019\nadaptive optics system on the 200 inch Hale telescope at Palomar\nobservatory (Law et\u00a0al. 2008 ) . PALMAO usually operates in K band,\ngiving Strehl ratios of up to 0.5 (Troy et\u00a0al. 2000 ) . Using the lucky\ncamera, observations were made at wavelengths of 500nm, 710nm, and\n950nm. At 710nm lucky selection improved the FWHM from 75 to 40\nmilliarcseconds, and improved the Strehl ratio from 0.06 to 0.15,\ndemonstrating that lucky imaging can greatly improve the imaging\nperformance of an adaptive optics system at shorter wavelengths.\nInvestigation of the decorrelation time for the PALMAO data set suggests\nthe lucky camera may need to run at or above the operating frequency of\nthe AO system to achieve best performance. There is some discussion of\nthe future potential of such systems in chapter 5 , and methods for\nmodelling and predicting their performance are covered in chapter 6 .\n\n### 1.5 New hardware: The quad-CCD LuckyCam\n\nA large portion of this dissertation is based upon data taken with a new\ndesign of lucky imaging camera, recorded during a July 2009 observing\nrun at the Nordic Optical Telescope, at the Observatorio del Roque de\nlos Muchachos, La Palma (illustrated in Figure 1.5 ). The 8 night\nobserving run was undertaken by Craig Mackay, David King and myself,\nwith remote software support from Frank Suess.\n\nOne of the aims of the trip was to thoroughly test the new camera, which\nutilises 4 synchronised EMCCDs running in parallel. Each EMCCD is a\n@xmath pixels format, resulting in a total mosaic of @xmath pixels, with\na frame rate of @xmath Hz. The main reason for adding this complexity is\nto achieve a wider field of view whilst retaining good sampling of the\nimage, although there are secondary benefits such as improved dynamic\nrange and enabling the use of multiple filters simultaneously (by using\ndifferent readout configurations and different filters for each\ndetector, respectively). The layout of the camera for the July 2009 run\nis presented in figures 1.6 and 1.5 , while the detector properties are\ndetailed in table 2.1 . The data acquisition and analysis requirements\nfor the camera are considerable, and the software and techniques I\ndeveloped to deal with the data are covered in chapter 7 .\n\n### 1.6 Statement of thesis\n\nThe proposition of this thesis is twofold; firstly that lucky imaging\nhardware and data reduction techniques are now sufficiently mature that\nit has become a viable tool for a wide range of astronomical science\napplications that benefit from high resolution imaging at visible\nwavelengths. Secondly, coupled with adaptive optics technology it has\nthe potential for extremely high resolution imaging that will open up\nentirely new areas of investigation.\n\nLucky imaging as a generally applicable tool for astronomy is desirable,\nbecause it provides information that is difficult or impossible to\nobtain with other ground based systems (table 1.2 ), and will soon be\nunobtainable from space, too. The Hubble Space Telescope, now producing\nexcellent images with the latest set of electronics, will not receive\nany further servicing missions now the shuttle fleet has retired, and\nwill almost certainly be decommissioned in the next 5-10 years. The\nJames Webb Space Telescope, if it flies, will produce images of inferior\nresolution in the visible. Adaptive optics technology is advancing, but\ncorrection in the visible is still poor even with the very latest\ncutting-edge systems, and only works over a small field of view. Lucky\nimaging provides a cheap, viable alternative for obtaining high\nresolution images in the visible to complement the high resolution\ninfra-red imaging that is becoming more widespread.\n\nWhen I began my PhD project, lucky imaging was a proven concept, but\nlimited in scope of application. The strenuous requirements for high\nframe rates necessitated relatively small fields of view, and\nchallenging detector noise characteristics and non-uniformities made\nimaging of very faint targets difficult. As a result the technique had\nbeen successfully applied to close binaries of similar magnitude, but\nnot much else.\n\nA large portion of my research has focused upon overcoming these issues,\nand demonstrating the potential applications made possible as a result.\nThe pace of hardware development has been rapid, and the lucky imaging\ncamera deployed in 2009 ran with a mosaic field of view of approximately\n@xmath pixels, resulting in a factor of 16 increase in critically\nsampled field of view, and correspondingly in data rates, compared to\nthe @xmath pixel squared system described in Law ( 2007 ) . The larger\nfield of view greatly improves both the number of observable lucky\nimaging targets, and the efficiency as a potential survey tool. The\ncalibration and reduction algorithms have also been substantially\ndeveloped and refined, such that when coupled with reduction techniques\ndeveloped specifically for EMCCDs, imaging of very faint targets is now\na proven possibility. When coupled with adaptive optics, the\nunprecedented resolution makes possible entirely new scientific\ninvestigations.\n\n### 1.7 Chapter summaries\n\nThe rest of this thesis is structured as follows:\n\nChapter 2 details the models and calibration techniques required to get\nthe best results from electron multiplying CCDs. Chapter 3 then uses\nthose models to examine thresholding schemes to improve signal to noise\nratio at low light levels. Implementation and application of the\nthresholding schemes to real data is covered.\n\nChapter 4 reviews some basic elements of sampling and image processing\ntheory, and presents improvements to the lucky imaging frame\nregistration procedure, which enables more effective use of faint guide\nstars. An analytical model to predict the Strehl ratio in reduced lucky\nimages is proposed.\n\nChapter 5 covers the scientific applications of lucky imaging. An image\nanalysis procedure for stellar binarity surveys is presented, along with\nnew faint companion detections to planetary transit host stars, which\nsignificantly expand the range of contrast ratios in binary stars\nresolved with lucky imaging. A case is made for lucky imaging as a\ngenerally applicable high resolution imaging tool that may often provide\nan adequate substitute for Hubble Space Telescope data. Finally, a\npossible application of lucky-imaging-enhanced adaptive optics is\ndiscussed.\n\nChapter 6 reviews the theory of Monte Carlo simulations for modelling\nadaptive optics and lucky imaging systems. Preliminary performance\ninvestigations of a hybrid lucky imaging adaptive optics system are\npresented.\n\nFinally, chapter 7 describes the software and techniques I developed\nduring my PhD for dealing with the large datasets and novel data\nreduction problems that lucky imaging presents.\n\n## Chapter 2 Calibration of electron multiplying CCDs\n\n\u201cThe only uniform CCD is a dead CCD\u201d (Mackay 1986 ) . Due to\nimperfections in manufacturing causing slightly different pixel areas,\nreadout electronics varying their characteristics during a frame read,\nand so on, all CCDs have at least slight non-uniformities in their pixel\nresponse to incident light. To avoid introducing errors in scientific\ndata it is important to calibrate and correct for these. The electron\nmultiplying CCDs used in the Cambridge lucky imaging camera require some\nspecialized calibration routines. Some elements of these calibration\nprocedures were introduced in (Law 2007 ; see Section 2.3 below for\nspecifics) , however considerable effort has gone into developing more\naccurate and comprehensive methods, so I present these in some detail.\n\nAs an aside, where possible I shall adopt the same notations in this\nchapter as those of Tulloch and Dhillon ( 2011 ) , in the hopes of\nachieving some amount of uniformity across the literature.\n\n### 2.1 The physics of electron multiplying charge-coupled devices\n\nConventional charge couple devices or CCDs are widely used as detectors\nfor astronomy due to their linear response characteristics, high quantum\nefficiency, wide dynamic range, and ever increasing pixel array sizes.\nThe reader is referred to Howell ( 2000 ) and Tulloch and Dhillon ( 2011\n) for relevant reviews, but it will be useful to recall the fundamentals\nof CCD and EMCCD operation here.\n\nPhotons incident upon a pixel element of a CCD may excite electrons from\nthe silicon substrate if the photon energy is of the same order as the\nelectron excitation band gap. The freed electrons (known as\nphoto-electrons due to their origin) are then held in place by a\npotential well due to the voltage at electrodes within each pixel known\nas gates. When the exposure time has elapsed, the accumulated charge\npackets of electrons are shifted across the CCD by cycling the voltage\nvalues of neighbouring pixel gates through multiple phases \u00b9 \u00b9 1\nSpecifically, conventional CCDs use 3 voltage phases. EMCCDs use 2 or 4\nphases during parallel charge transfer, and 3 phases during serial\ntransfer through the readout register. (a process known as clocking).\nEventually all electron packets are passed through a component called\nthe \u2018charge amplifier\u2019, which converts the charge into a voltage.\nFinally the voltage is passed to an analogue-to-digital unit (ADU) for\ndigitization, and the resulting integer value is recorded.\n\nThe conversion of the photo-electrons to voltage by the charge amplifier\nintroduces additive noise (\u201creadout noise\u201d), such that the inferred\npixel values will be spread in a Gaussian distribution about the true\nvalue representing the photo-electrons captured. As a result, even at\nslow readout speeds (tens of kHz pixel rates) typically a CCD\nexperiences readout noise of RMS equivalent to a few photo-electrons.\nLucky imaging requires frame rates of 20Hz or higher, resulting in pixel\nreadout rates greater than 20MHz for a large CCD. At these rates a\nconventional CCD may experience read noise of tens or hundreds of\nelectrons (e.g. Tubbs ( 2003 ) cites readout noise of 50-60 electrons at\n5.5MHz pixel rates). This level of noise makes it impossible to perform\nlucky imaging on all but the brightest stars with any useful level of\nsignal to noise when utilizing conventional CCDs.\n\nFortunately, electron multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs, also known as\nlow-light-level or LLLCCDs) (Jerram et\u00a0al. 2001 , Mackay et\u00a0al. 2001 )\noffer a solution. In an EMCCD an additional multi-stage \u201cserial\nregister\u201d is inserted into the circuit prior to the readout components.\nThis is a series of gates similar to those used for the pixel grid of a\nconventional CCD, but with one of the three phases operating at much\nhigher voltage than would usually be applied, typically around 40v\ncompared with the 12v applied for conventional parallel transfer (Mackay\net\u00a0al. 2010 ) . The large electric fields generated accelerate the\nelectrons sufficiently to give a significant probability of impact\nionisation at each stage \u2014 effectively releasing an extra electron and\nso multiplying the charge in a stochastic manner. The probability of\nionisation at each stage is small, but using many stages in series it is\npossible to achieve a high degree of gain in the average signal level,\nalbeit in a stochastic manner. The mean gain may be altered by making\nsmall adjustments to the voltage, and is usually set to many times the\naverage readout noise variation. As a result, the previously\ninsurmountable read noise now equates to a mere tenth or twentieth of a\nphoto-electron signal, with electron multiplication factors of one or\ntwo thousand.\n\n### 2.2 Basics of CCD calibration\n\nWhen calibrating conventional CCDs it is customary to take a handful of\ncalibration frames, some with shutters closed to calibrate internal\ndetector effects (detailed below), and some \u2018flat fields\u2019 with uniform\nillumination to calibrate the detector response to light. These are then\naveraged and subtracted to infer the bias pedestal, dark current, and\nflat field (pixel light response). All these quantities may vary\nsomewhat from pixel to pixel, so they are recorded as pixel maps and\nused for data reduction as follows (Howell 2000 ) :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere the bias map records variation in the \u2018bias pedestal\u2019, an offset\nintroduced by the readout electronics which has the effect of ensuring\nall raw pixel values are positive (and hence digitizable). The dark\ncurrent map corrects for internally generated signal, usually dominated\nby thermal emissions within the CCD, which would otherwise be mistaken\nfor signal from photo-electrons. Bias and dark current maps are\ncalibrated by taking frames with different exposure lengths. The bias\ncalibration frames are recorded with short exposure times to minimize\ndark current contributions. These short exposures can be analysed in\nconjunction with dark current calibration frames of different exposure\ntimes, to estimate the pixel value contributions from bias pedestal and\ndark current.\n\nThe flat field is a normalising pixel map which corrects for different\nlevels of sensitivity to incident light - these may be due to intrinsic\nvariations in pixel sensitivity, and also extrinsic factors such as\npartial obscuration by dust in the camera lens.\n\nNote that there is some ambiguity in the nomenclature with regards to\ncalibration frames. It is common practice to take at least a handful of\neach sort of calibration frame, and then combine them (usually via their\nmedian pixel values) to create averaged frames for use in data\nreduction. However, the raw and median frames are often referred to\ninterchangeably for brevity (the median of the bias frames simply being\ncalled the \u2018bias frame,\u2019 for example). In this thesis I shall take care\nto refer to the raw exposures as e.g. \u2018bias frames,\u2019 and the final\nversion for use in data reduction as the \u2018bias map.\u2019\n\nEven for a conventional CCD, these calibrations are only valid for a\ncertain length of time. Varying operating temperatures may alter the\nbias characteristics or thermal emission levels, camera lenses get\ncleaned and then slowly accrue dust again. Typically such variations\noccur at a significant level on timescales of hours or longer.\n\nWith EMCCDs, things are a bit more complex. Not only are there extra\nvariables which must be accounted for, some of these effects alter from\nobservation to observation, and potentially even from frame to frame.\nSince the Cambridge group EMCCD camera is custom built, distinguishing\nand calibrating the various different effects is a task that must be\ncarefully undertaken with each new camera configuration.\n\nBoth spatial and temporal variations of the CCD response must be\ncorrected for as far as possible on a frame by frame basis \u2014 i.e. prior\nto any further data reduction \u2014 for several reasons. First, it enables\naccurate determination of the gain since it stabilises the bias\npedestal, resulting in a cleaner histogram from which to estimate the EM\ngain (cf. Section 2.5.2 ). Second, if pixel thresholding photon-counting\ntechniques are to be applied (cf. chapter 3 ), then the data must be\ndebiased before thresholding, otherwise a uniform threshold level will\nresult in non-uniform fractions of photon-events passing the threshold\nacross the detector. Third, the \u2018drizzle\u2019 algorithm (Figure 4.3 ) by\ndefinition combines values from different pixels, by default assigning\nthem equal weights and resulting in some loss of information and\ncorrelated noise - it is therefore desirable to ensure that the input\ndata truly are as uniform as possible before drizzling. Finally, the\nlucky imaging data has potential for analysis of high-speed variation in\nsources as explored in Section 5.2 , which obviously requires that\ndetector corrections are applied to every frame.\n\nThe rest of this section details the various phenomena which must be\nconsidered for accurate EMCCD operation, and methodology to calibrate\nand correct for any non-uniformities. Unless stated otherwise, all\nresults refer to full frame readout of the Cambridge EMCCD detector\n(1072 by 1040 pixel e2v CCD201) used in the summer 2009 observing run at\na frame rate of @xmath 21Hz, i.e. 26MHz pixel rate.\n\n### 2.3 Motivation and comparison with previous work on EMCCD\ncalibration\n\nLaw ( 2007 ) introduced some methods for calibration and reduction of\nlucky imaging data taken with EMCCDs, addressing the need for\nre-calibration of the column-to-column bias pattern with each run, and a\nmethod for estimating the electron multiplication gain by fitting a\nstraight line to the pixel histogram. While reasonably effective, the\naccuracy of the algorithms used was not investigated.\n\nFurther work in this area was needed for a number of reasons. Firstly,\nthe most recent camera uses a different model of EMCCD, with slightly\ndifferent noise and uniformity characteristics, which took some work to\ndetermine and correct. Secondly, lucky imaging observations have\npreviously been largely focused upon binary detection. Only relative\nphotometry was performed, usually in a small region of the detector. The\nlarger format EMCCDs and the multi-EMCCD mosaic camera now in use allow\napplication of lucky imaging to a wider range of targets, but require\nmore precise calibration of detector noise and non-uniformities for\naccurate relative photometry across the CCD. Furthermore, inter-CCD\nrelative photometry requires accurate determination of the EM gain for\neach CCD. Finally, for faint objects we can further increase photometric\naccuracy using pixel value thresholding techniques, but determination of\nthe optimal threshold level requires a detailed knowledge of the CCD\nnoise characteristics (see chapter 3 ).\n\nIn summary, to achieve better accuracy in the reduced images, I have:\n\n-   Refined the bias determination algorithms, and tailored them to the\n    current CCD model (Section 2.6.1 ).\n\n-   Introduced calibration steps for internally generated signal\n    (Section 2.6.3 ).\n\n-   Tested and refined the EM gain calibration algorithms, and developed\n    algorithms to further calibrate detector effects such as EM register\n    clock induced charge (sections 2.6.3 , 2.5.2 ).\n\n### 2.4 Probability distribution models for EMCCDs\n\nConventional CCDs are typically calibrated using a handful of frames. In\nthe case of the lucky imaging the stochastic signal multiplication of\nthe EMCCDs introduces an extra source of variance, and the fast frame\nrate produces many frames in a short time, so it makes sense to analyse\nmany thousands of frames. This enables us to sensibly make use not only\nof the average or median pixel values, but to go further and model the\npixel value distributions, varying model parameters to fit the full\nhistograms of pixel values obtained. First, we need a model.\n\nA simple model of the EMCCD consists of two stages, the first\nrepresenting the stochastic EM gain process.\n\nBefore proceeding, we must deal with a notation issue. Tulloch and\nDhillon ( 2011 ) introduce the notation of using @xmath to denote the\n\u201cavalanche multiplication gain\u201d or \u201cEM gain,\u201d the dimensionless average\nmultiplication factor between electrons input to the serial register,\nand electrons output. They use the subscript to distinguish this from\nthe conventional \u201c system gain,\u201d denoted @xmath , as measured with\nconventional CCDs, where system gain refers to the number of\nphotoelectrons represented by 1 ADU, and so has units of photoelectrons\n\/ ADU. They also introduce the term @xmath to denote the actual ratio\nbetween electrons at the input to the readout electronics, and ADU\noutput. The same convention is followed here.\n\nFor relatively high gain and low photon flux, a histogram of the number\nof electrons output from the serial multiplication register, x, for n\nphoto-electrons input, over many samples, is well modelled by the\nprobability distribution (PDF):\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhich has a mean of @xmath and a variance of @xmath (Matsuo et\u00a0al. 1985\n, Basden et\u00a0al. 2003 ) . At high photon flux levels the register output\nprobability distribution function is better modelled by a Gaussian of\nthe same mean and standard deviation. Figure 2.1 illustrates the\nresulting PDF curves.\n\nFor a single photo-electron input, the EM register output distribution\nsimplifies to an exponential decay curve. At low light levels where the\nchance of 2 or more photo-electrons being captured by a single pixel is\nnegligible, we may consider two distribution components, representing\npixels which have captured 0 or 1 photo-electrons. The second stage of\nthis model is simply addition of Gaussian readout noise. Under the\nassumption that no photo-electrons captured results in zero charge at\nreadout, then we may model the EMCCD output distribution as follows. If\nwe denote the serial register output probability distribution for a\nsingle photo-electron input as @xmath with:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nthen we would expect a histogram of pixel values to approximately\nconform to the following distribution where @xmath is the Gaussian\ndistribution, @xmath is the standard deviation of the readout values,\n@xmath is the bias pedestal, and @xmath represents convolution:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n\u2014that is, a sum of a Gaussian readout noise distribution representing\npixels which have captured no photo-electrons, and an exponential\ndistribution due to single photo-electron events, likewise convolved\nwith the Gaussian readout noise.\n\n#### 2.4.1 Clock induced charge\n\nA histogram obtained from real EMCCD data without incident light, but\nwith a small signal level due to internally generated signal (described\nin Section 2.6.3 ), is displayed in Figure 2.2 . For most of the pixel\nrange the data is well fitted by the model of equation 2.4 , the\nexception being around the knee of the curve where the data lies above\nthe model. This excess of low pixel values is due to an effect not\nincluded in our simple model \u2014 clock induced charge. Clock induced\ncharge (CIC) is an important source of noise, consisting of internally\ngenerated electrons released by clock transitions during the CCD readout\nprocess.\n\nWe may consider CIC in two categories. I shall refer to stray electrons\nfreed during the transfer of charge across the CCD prior to the EM\nregister (see Figure 2.3 ) as \u201ctransfer CIC.\u201d Transfer CIC events are\nindistinguishable from photo-electron events, since they originate\nbefore the EM gain register and so experience the same stochastic gain\nprocess. The signal due to transfer CIC should be calibrated using bias\nframes; and subtracted from on-sky data if a true estimate of the sky\nbackground is required. CIC generated during transfer through the EM\nregister will on average experience a lower gain, since it passes\nthrough fewer amplification stages. I shall refer to these events as\nCICIR (CIC in register). These account for the poorly fitted region of\nhistogram in Figure 2.2 . We may model the CICIR distribution by\nassuming an equal probability of a CIC event occurring at any stage in\nthe EM register. Then the distribution will be a superposition of many\ndifferent exponential decay curves, each representing single input\nelectrons passing through different numbers of amplification stages, and\ntherefore undergoing a different mean avalanche gain. The mean signal\ncontribution from one of these events will be a factor of @xmath smaller\nthan that of a photo-electron (Tulloch and Dhillon 2011 ) . Figure 2.4\nillustrates the relative contribution of the CICIR component needed to\naccurately model the EMCCD output data.\n\n### 2.5 Histogram analysis algorithms\n\n#### 2.5.1 Bias determination at low pixel counts for the purpose of\nsingle frame bias estimation\n\nWhen reducing EMCCD data, we often need a way to estimate the bias\npedestal from a fairly small pixel events sample, perhaps a thousand\nrecorded pixels. \u00b2 \u00b2 2 For example, when using a faintly illuminated\nregion of an on-sky dataset to track bias pedestal drift. We desire such\nan algorithm to be both extremely robust to noisy data, and also\ncomputationally efficient since it must be run at least once per frame\nof data to deal with bias drift (described in Section 2.6.2 ). A naive\napproach is to simply use the mode of the histogram, however when\napplied to raw data composed of integer ADU values this only estimates\nthe bias offset to the nearest integer, and is quite susceptible to\nnoise in the histogram, which may cause the bias estimate to \u201cjump\naround,\u201d varying rapidly and unrealistically. Law ( 2007 ) employed the\ntenth percentile as a metric to track bias drift which does not suffer\nfrom this noise induced variation, however not only is the sort\ncomputation required moderately time consuming, it is a biased estimator\nat best, consistently underestimating the bias pedestal with an offset\nthat varies depending on the distribution of the readout noise.\n\nAfter some experimentation with fitting routines, I settled on a\nthresholded centroid algorithm as an efficient, robust and accurate\nestimator of bias pedestal for tracking bias drift. The weighted mean of\nall histogram bin central values with bin counts above 80% of the\nmaximum count is used, and this proves very effective.\n\n#### 2.5.2 Electron multiplication gain\n\nThe Cambridge lucky imaging camera incorporates controls for on-the-fly\nadjustment of the EM serial register voltage, and hence control over the\nEM gain. This is useful as it allows the user to make adjustments based\non the current field of view, avoiding saturation of brighter sources\nwhilst maintaining the best signal to noise allowed by the dynamic range\nfor faint objects imaged on the same detector.\n\nOne key advantage of using a synchronised multi-CCD mosaic camera is\nthat the gain may be controlled independently across the CCDs. Careful\npositioning of the mosaic field of view often makes it possible to\nobserve a bright guide star on one CCD at low EM gain, while observing\nfaint sources nearby at much higher EM gain with a second CCD \u2014\neffectively giving extremely wide dynamic range.\n\nThe cost of this flexibility is that the gain becomes an extra variable\nto be carefully calibrated. If we wish to perform inter-CCD relative\nphotometry across a mosaic field of view, then the gain setting of each\nindividual CCD must be accurately measured so that we may normalise the\nimages prior to comparison.\n\nAs described in (Law 2007 ; pp. 43-46) , the EM gain is most easily\ncalibrated using a histogram of pixel events from a low flux area of a\nfield of view. The alternative method is to switch the EM gain off for\ncomparison using calibrator stars, but this is time consuming and\nlargely unnecessary. Law used a fit to the straight line region (on a\nlog plot) of the exponential decay curve of the serial register output\nhistogram for a single input photo-electron (fig. 2.1 ), with the\nfitting region determined either manually or based on goodness-of-fit.\n\nTo determine the EM gain and other detector characteristics from the\npixel histogram, I developed a two stage, fully-automated fitting\nroutine. In the first stage, the bias pedestal, EM gain, and light level\nare estimated by fitting models to the histogram sections highlighted in\nFigure 2.2 (the light level is estimated by comparing the relative\nintegrated areas under the Gaussian readout hump and the tail of\nphoto-electron events). This initial fit takes less than 0.01 seconds to\ncompute. Optionally, a fit is then made to the whole histogram using a\nfully featured distribution model with parameters corresponding to bias\npedestal, readout noise, EM gain, light level, and serial register CIC\nevent frequency. The full fit takes around 1.5 seconds to compute.\n\nI undertook some investigations into the algorithm performance, to\nverify that the estimation algorithm did not introduce any systematic\nerrors, and also determine how the accuracy improved as the histogram\nconverges to the underlying distribution with increasing number of\nrecorded pixel-events.\n\nI tested the code against simulated data generated with the Monte-Carlo\nmethods described in Section 6.2 . The results are plotted in Figure 2.5\n. While the code produced consistent results, initially a systematic\nover-estimation of the EM gain was evident, especially at higher light\nlevels. This corresponds to pixel events where 2 photo-electrons are\ncaptured, which raises the number of pixel events in the tail of the\nhistogram. Adding an extra component to the model which accounts for the\n2 photon pixel events largely corrects this error. Alternatively, if the\nhigh speed single stage fitting procedure is preferred, it appears that\nthe gain estimate can be corrected to give reasonably good accuracy\nsimply by computing the relative frequency of 1 and 2 photon pixel\nevents \u2014 for example, if the light level is 0.2 photons per pixel per\nframe, then the EM gain will be overestimated by a factor of:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe simulations suggest at least @xmath recorded pixels are required to\ngive a reasonable estimate of the gain, with larger samples giving\nbetter accuracy, though this is partially dependent on the light level.\nThis is of interest for reasonably crowded fields where much of the\nframe has light levels too high for EM gain estimation, suggesting that\nif a background region of 100 by 100 pixels may be selected, then 1000\nor more frames of data will give a reasonable estimate.\n\n### 2.6 Calibrating the Cambridge e2v CCD201\n\nWhile the previous sections describe general techniques applicable to\nEMCCD data, the rest of this chapter details the specific\ncharacteristics of the detectors used in the July 2009 observing run at\nthe Nordic Optical Telescope, and the techniques used to calibrate these\ndetectors as accurately as possible. A summary of the detector\nproperties is provided in table 2.1 .\n\n#### 2.6.1 Spatial gradient in bias pedestal\n\nConventionally, the bias pedestal in CCD images is estimated using a\nhandful of bias frames. However, due to the high sensitivity of the\nEMCCD to low levels of internally generated signal such as CIC, the bias\npedestal must instead be estimated using the histogram analysis\ntechniques described in Section 2.5.1 . Whilst the bias estimation\nalgorithm is insensitive to modest illumination levels, the best\nestimate will be made from a series of exposures taken with the camera\nshutter closed.\n\nCreating a full two dimensional bias map from a series of bias frames\nrequires recording a histogram for every pixel, for several thousand\nframes. I implemented routines to perform this analysis. Unfortunately,\nthe bias map varies from run to run, most likely varying as the EM gain\nis adjusted (Figure 2.7 ). As a result, a full 2d bias calibration can\nonly be achieved by recording bias frames for every EM gain setting to\nbe used. Alternatively, the variation across the bias map may be largely\nbroken up into horizontal and vertical components (Figure 2.6 ). While\nthe horizontal (column to column) gradient varies with EM gain setting,\nthe vertical (row to row) component appears stable. This allows us to\ngather column histograms for each on-sky observation, which in most\nfields will largely contain pixels at low light levels, meaning we can\ndetermine the horizontal bias gradient component for each observation,\nthen add it to the vertical component calibrated using a single set of\nclosed shutter bias frames. \u00b3 \u00b3 3 Note: when observing say, globular\ncluster fields, saturation of the column histograms by photon-events can\nand does become an issue. Signal from bright stars will dominate over\nbias pedestal variation, so if accurate photometry and PSF fitting is\nrequired then the observer should revert to taking closed shutter bias\nframes between observations periodically. It may be possible to use\npre-set levels of EM gain and build up a library of bias maps, if the\ncolumn to column bias pattern is not strongly dependent on other factors\nsuch as temperature.\n\n#### 2.6.2 Bias pedestal drift\n\nThe bias pedestal also varies temporally, i.e. on a frame by frame basis\n\u2014 generally this is known as bias drift. The drift range is typically of\nthe same order as the readout noise (fig. 2.8 ), and so it is desirable\nto correct for this. Fortunately the spatial gradient appears stable on\nthese timescales, with drift affecting the bias pedestal uniformly\nacross the frame. Therefore it is possible to correct for the bias drift\nby analysing pixel histograms gathered from each frame, as long as a\nfaintly illuminated region may be selected.\n\n#### 2.6.3 Internally generated signal levels\n\nWhen processing bias frames, a significant and non-uniform signal is\nevident after subtraction of the (histogram calibrated) bias map,\nillustrated in Figure 2.9 . There are several possible sources of this\nresidual signal:\n\n-   Dark current, electrons randomly generated due to thermal emissions\n\n-   Clock induced charge as described in Section 2.4.1 .\n\n-   Light leakage through the camera baffles.\n\n-   Amplifier glow as described in Tulloch ( 2004 ) .\n\nAmplifier glow seems unlikely, as the resultant signal would be\nlocalised in one corner of the detector, near to the amplifier component\nlocation. Uniform light leakage would not be expected at the levels\nobserved, leaving dark current and CIC effects.\n\nWhile CICIR levels may be estimated by histogram fitting, the only way\nto distinguish transfer CIC contributions from dark current is to obtain\nclosed shutter calibration frames with different exposure times \u2014 dark\ncurrent signal levels should increase with exposure time, while CIC\nlevels remain constant. Hence the relative contributions may be\ninferred. Closed shutter datasets of differing exposure time were not\navailable for calibrating the summer 2009 data. Interestingly, the\ninternally generated signal level increases towards the bottom of the\nframe, suggesting some common causation factor along with the rise in\nbias pedestal. At any rate, the source of the internal signal is\nunimportant with regards to general data reduction as the resulting data\nreduction process is the same whatever the source \u2014 we simply wish to\nsubtract any signal not due to photons from the sky.\n\n#### 2.6.4 Clock induced charge levels\n\nTransfer CIC is indistinguishable from photo-electron signal, and so is\ncalibrated as part of the internally generated signal (Section 2.6.3 ).\nHowever, using the multi-component model illustrated in Figure 2.4 ,\nCICIR levels can be estimated. This is important not only for\ncharacterising and fine tuning EMCCDs, but also when determining\nthresholds for low light levels (cf. chapter 3 ). Figure 2.10\nillustrates just such a fit to real data.\n\n#### 2.6.5 Flat fielding and gain uniformity\n\nCareful flat fielding of CCDs is essential for accurate photometry. Law\n( 2007 ) reported variations of up to 10% in EM gain across frames from\nthe 2005 camera. To work around this variation the recommended method\nwas to perform calibration with histograms from the same columns as any\nphotometry target objects. To determine whether photometry across many\nobjects in wide fields of view is feasible I investigated if this\nvariation was still present in the 2009 camera.\n\nInvestigation of inter-pixel gain variations is difficult, since the\nestimates of EM gain are inaccurate when using small pixel samples (see\nFigure 2.5 ). Inspection of the mean internal signal levels in closed\nshutter calibration frames after subtraction of the bias map suggested\nthere may be some horizontal (column to column) gradient in the EM gain.\nI was able to implement a per-column estimation of EM gain levels by\nanalysing the pixel histograms. Figure 2.11 shows an example plot of\nestimated EM gain across the detector. The gain appears appears uniform\nto around the 5% level over most of the detector (excepting some spikes\ndue to bad columns which are rejected in reduced images), although there\nwas greater deviation in columns 1 through 200. As a result, reasonably\naccurate photometry can only be extracted from the region right of\ncolumn 200 in the 2009 datasets. If such variation remains in future\ndetector configurations it should be possible to incorporate a\nnormalizing \u2018gain map\u2019 to correct for such effects, but calibration\nrequires long series of closed shutter (or very weakly illuminated)\ncalibration frames. Such long period calibration datasets were not\navailable for the 2009 data.\n\nFlat fielding for other non-uniformities such as relative pixel area and\nlens obscuration is a relatively simple process of taking twilight sky\nflats, as with a conventional CCD, and provision for such flat fields is\nmade in the reduction pipeline. The variations in both EM gain and pixel\nsensitivity can be disentangled in two ways. Firstly, the EM gain can be\nswitched off and the conventional readout mode utilised when taking flat\nfields, to calibrate the pixel sensitivity alone. Alternatively the EM\ngain can be estimated first from sky flats using histogram analysis\nmethods, then taken into account when estimating pixel sensitivity.\n\n#### 2.6.6 Bad pixels and pixel weighting\n\nIt is common for CCDs to exhibit a few \u2018bad pixels,\u2019 which consistently\nproduce high or low values without much response to actual light levels.\nIn the 2009 camera, each CCD contained at least a few columns of such\npixels, easily identifiable by eye (e.g. the bright column in Figure 2.9\n). The locations of such columns are stored in a configuration file for\nthe pipeline, which then zeroes the pixels in average images, and also\nzeroes their allocated weight for the drizzle algorithm (see chapter 7\n).\n\n### 2.7 Results\n\nFigure 2.12 illustrates the improvement in background uniformity due to\naccurate calibration. Bias pedestal variation typically has a range of\nlevels equivalent to a signal level of 0.1 photo-electrons, evident in\n2.12(a) . Dark current affects the bottom of the frame worst, where the\nadditional signal reaches 0.2 photo-electrons, evident in 2.12(b) . Bad\npixel columns are also noticeable (their pixel values have been zeroed).\nFigure 2.12(c) shows a fully calibrated, drizzled image. The RMS\nbackground variation over most of the image is of the order 0.005\nphoto-electrons, though some slight non-uniformities are still present\nnear the edges at the level of 0.02 photo-electrons.\n\n## Chapter 3 Lucky imaging of faint sources: Thresholding techniques\n\nThe stochastic nature of the electron multiplication gain in EMCCDs\nintroduces an extra source of variance, so that compared to the ideal\ncase of purely photon shot noise an EMCCD at high light levels will\nexperience signal variation larger by a factor of @xmath - this is\ntermed the \u201cexcess noise factor\u201d (Basden et\u00a0al. 2003 ) . At low light\nlevels (where the mean photon flux per pixel per frame is much less than\n1) we can be reasonably confident that any given pixel only receives 0\nor 1 photo-electrons per exposure. In this case we can exploit the fact\nthat, at high electron multiplication gain, most photon events result in\nADU values many times the readout noise RMS above the background, and\nreduce the excess noise factor by employing a pixel thresholding scheme.\n\nThe concepts behind this thresholding approach rely heavily upon the\nmodels developed in chapter 2 , likewise the details of implementation\nrely upon careful calibration, and so the chapters are closely linked.\nWhere the text would otherwise be unclear, I shall refer to EMCCD\nobservations which do not employ thresholding as \u2018linear mode\u2019\nobservations.\n\n### 3.1 Summary and comparison with literature\n\nBasden et\u00a0al. ( 2003 ) and Lantz et\u00a0al. ( 2008 ) have explored the\npossibility of applying thresholding schemes across a range of light\nlevels via either multiple thresholds or Bayesian estimators. However\nthere are a number of practical issues with these schemes.\n\nFirstly, the scheme of Basden et\u00a0al. does not account for CIC effects,\nwhich would need to be taken into account and thresholds changed\naccordingly if a similar scheme were to be applied. The scheme of Lantz\net\u00a0al. ( 2008 ) requires the mean light level on every pixel to be\nconstant so that an optimum Bayesian estimator can be chosen. In lucky\nimaging this is not the case as the atmospheric tip-tilt shifts the\nsources around the CCD from frame to frame. The suggested work-around is\nthresholding on frames which have already been recentred using the guide\nstar. This is not entirely infeasible but still runs into the problems\nof guide star registration error and anisoplanatic effects \u2014 so it seems\nlikely that the technique could only be practically applied close to a\nbright guide star, and would require substantial computational effort.\n\nAccordingly, I have focused upon developing and implementing photon\ncounting methods which employ a single threshold to process data at low\nlight levels. Thresholding is at any rate most needed at low light\nlevels where the detector noise would otherwise dominate over the photon\nshot and stochastic multiplication noise.\n\nPhoton counting is very simple in concept \u2014 if a pixel has a value above\na threshold it is recorded as a 1, below the threshold it is recorded as\n0 \u2014 but obtaining the best possible signal to noise and maintaining a\nlinear signal response requires some care. This first aim boils down to\nchoosing the optimum threshold level, given a set of known detector\ncharacteristics and a particular light level.\n\nThe question of optimum threshold choice for photon counting was\npartially treated in section 2 of Lantz et\u00a0al. ( 2008 ) , but in that\npaper the authors focused on optimizing the exposure time, and hence\nlight level, alongside the threshold to achieve a minimum \u201cmisfit,\u201d i.e.\nto ensure absolute photon count estimations were as close as possible to\ntheir true values.\n\nA more general approach is to assume that true photon counts can be\nestimated from the thresholded values, and focus on achieving optimum\nsignal to noise ratio (SNR) in the thresholded estimate. To do this we\nrequire a model for estimating the SNR, which is non-trivial given the\nstochastic detector behaviour.\n\nI presented a basic SNR equation for photon-counting with EMCCDS at low\nlight levels in Staley and Mackay ( 2010 ) . This result was\nindependently reproduced in Tulloch and Dhillon ( 2011 ) , but with more\ncare taken over correction for signal loss due to photon coincidence (2\nor more photons in one pixel), including calculation of the correction\nfactor required to correct for coincidence losses. In the interests of\nconsistency I shall adopt the notations of Tulloch and Dhillon herein.\n\nIn lucky imaging data there is always a range of light levels in a field\nof view, and a truly optimal thresholding scheme would require a\nvariation of threshold for each pixel, depending upon the light level of\nthat pixel. However, as previously mentioned, atmospheric effects make\nit difficult to estimate the mean light level on any given pixel a\npriori; additionally multiple thresholds would require a complex data\nreduction process. As a simple and practical alternative I explore the\neffectiveness of applying a single threshold over a range of light\nlevels.\n\nFinally I present results of applying the thresholding techniques to\nreal lucky imaging data. To my knowledge results from application of the\ntechniques to real data have not been published elsewhere (except in\nStaley and Mackay 2010 ) .\n\n### 3.2 Signal to noise ratio for conventional and electron multiplying\nCCDs\n\nGiven an ideal detector, the only noise would be the photon-shot noise\nof the Poisson distribution, and so the SNR of a single pixel in an\nideal detector is simply:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere M is the mean signal in photo-electrons per pixel from the target,\nand K is the background sky flux, in the same units.\n\nOf course, detectors are imperfect. If we take into account the various\nsources of noise described in chapter 2 , then in a conventional CCD\nwith read noise of standard deviation @xmath , dark current of mean\nsignal @xmath , transfer CIC \u00b9 \u00b9 1 See Section 2.4.1 for an explanation\nof transfer CIC and CICIR. of mean signal @xmath and CICIR of mean\nsignal @xmath \u00b2 \u00b2 2 We denote the frequency with which CICIR events\noccur as @xmath , but since they undergo a lower mean gain than\nphoto-electron events their signal contribution is @xmath . See Section\n2.4.1 for details. then the SNR equation of a conventional CCD becomes\nthe rather unwieldy:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTypically, in a conventional CCD run at slow frame rates the CIC\ncontributions are negligible compared to the other factors. With a dark\nsky and a well cooled CCD, the limiting noise contribution becomes the\nreadout noise, @xmath , which is typically of the order of a few\nphoto-electrons and will increase when run at high frame rates. From\nthis we can see that at signal levels any lower than 10 photo-electrons\nper pixel per frame the readout noise will dominate over the signal.\n\nFor an EMCCD, the output for a fixed input of @xmath photo-electrons\n(i.e. without photon-shot noise) to the electron multiplication serial\nregister obeys the distribution described in Section 2.4 , with mean\n@xmath and variance @xmath . This stochastic gain variance is added in\nquadrature to the shot noise, producing a factor of 2 in the SNR\ndenominator. If we assume the dark current @xmath is negligible (it is\nat any rate indistinguishable from transfer CIC in effect), then the SNR\nequation for EMCCD observations taken in linear mode with readout noise\n@xmath becomes, after dividing through by @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFrom this equation we can deduce a couple of points. First, at high\nlight levels the photon count dominates over the other terms and\nperformance is a factor of @xmath worse than a conventional CCD. Second,\nat low light levels the dominant noise term will depend largely on the\nrelative magnitudes of the readout noise and the CIC event frequencies.\nHowever, as is clear in Figure 2.4 , the readout, CICIR and signal\ncomponents have considerably different probability distributions, and so\nemploying a thresholding scheme helps to distinguish between them.\n\n### 3.3 Thresholded signal to noise equation\n\nSince thresholding reduces the digitized signal to a binary one, we may\nassume that the frequency with which pixel values cross the threshold is\ndetermined by a Poisson distribution, with the mean frequency determined\nby the fraction of the original pixel value distributions which lie\nabove the threshold. If we denote the CICIR event frequency @xmath and\nthe threshold \u2018pass fractions\u2019 \u2014 that is, the fraction of the component\nPDFs (c.f. Figure 2.4 ) which lie above a given threshold \u2014 as @xmath ,\n@xmath , and @xmath for the photo-electron, CICIR and readout\ndistributions respectively, then the thresholded signal to noise\nequation becomes:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nGenerally the optimum threshold is several times the readout noise\nstandard deviation, and so @xmath . Neglecting this term, we may also\naccount for the loss of signal induced by coincidence losses (Tulloch\nand Dhillon 2011 ) , which is of order @xmath ; the equation then\nbecomes:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n### 3.4 Choosing the best detector mode for an observation\n\nHaving derived SNR equations for data from conventional CCDs, linear\nmode EMCCDs, and thresholded EMCCDs, we may consider their relative\nmerits across a range of light levels. A comparative plot is shown in\nFigure 3.1 . We may summarise this comparison by dividing it into three\nregimes. At high light levels (greater than @xmath photo-electrons per\npixel per frame) the excess noise factor introduced by the stochastic\nelectron multiplication gain means that conventional mode CCD\nobservations still give best signal to noise. At light levels between\nabout 1 and 10 photo-electrons per pixel per frame, linear mode EMCCD\nobservations win out due to the effectively suppressed read noise, while\nphoton-counting is impossible due to coincidence losses. At still lower\nlight levels photon-counting using thresholding methods gives the best\nresult. In particular, at light levels of around 0.1 photo-electrons per\npixel per frame, photon-counting EMCCD observations are getting close to\nachieving the maximum theoretically possible SNR (ignoring quantum\nefficiency effects), but are currently limited by noise from clock\ninduced charge. See Tulloch and Dhillon ( 2011 ) for further detail.\n\n### 3.5 Threshold optimization\n\nConsidering equation 3.5 , it is clear that the thresholded signal to\nnoise ratio will be partially determined by the choice of threshold,\nwhich in turn determines the \u2018pass fractions\u2019 of the various\ncontributing signals. I now consider the matter of choosing an optimal\nthreshold to maximize SNR.\n\nGiven a chosen threshold level, the pass fractions for the\nphoto-electron event pixel distribution and readout noise distributions\nmay be estimated with simple analytical expressions; however, the pass\nfraction for the CICIR is calculated numerically from the rather complex\ndistribution model. In practice the photo-electron pass fraction is\nestimated numerically too, since this makes it trivial to account for\nthe contribution from pixels which receive 2 photo-electrons. Once this\nis achieved, it is simple to implement a numerical optimization routine.\n\nConceptually, the trade off is between higher noise from readout and\nCICIR at low threshold levels, and higher relative shot noise levels\nwhen the signal pass fraction is small at high threshold levels. This\ntrade off evidently depends upon the light level. However, since we\nemploy thresholding techniques to improve the light level estimate\naccuracy, we do not expect to have an accurate estimate a priori. As\nsuch, it is interesting to investigate the effect of using a fixed\nthreshold across a range of light levels.\n\nFortunately, as long as the threshold is chosen to exclude almost all\nreadout noise and the highest levels of CICIR, the SNR equation is\nfairly insensitive to further variation of the threshold. As a result, a\nfixed threshold may be used effectively across a reasonably wide range\nof illumination levels, as illustrated in Figure 3.2 . Figure 3.3\ndisplays the corresponding improvement predicted in SNR at low light\nlevels when using a fixed threshold.\n\n### 3.6 Combining thresholded and linear data\n\nTo linearise the photometry of thresholded images, and allow for direct\ncomparison with linear mode images, we must correct for the effects of\nthe thresholding process.\n\nTo calculate the correction factor for loss of multiple photo-electron\npixel events, we consider the mean number of pixels with photo-electron\ncounts of 1 or greater, @xmath , for a mean illumination level of @xmath\nphoto-electrons. From the Poisson distribution we have\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\ntherefore\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nWe must also consider the reduction in signal level due to the threshold\nlevel, and the contribution of CICIR events, which will be different for\nthresholded and linear reductions. If we consider pixel values of @xmath\nand @xmath in the reduced linear and thresholded images respectively,\nthen the signal estimates may then be calculated as:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nOnce these corrections have been applied, it is possible to combine\nlinear mode and thresholded images created from the same dataset. The\nlinear mode image may be used to estimate the light level of any given\npixel, and any pixels with light levels below a chosen threshold, e.g.\n0.25 photons per frame, are replaced with the pixel values from the\nthresholded image. Such an approach achieves high dynamic range coupled\nwith the SNR improvements of thresholding, but requires extra care when\nundertaking further analysis. Since the noise level estimates will be\ndifferent for thresholded and linear images, if they are combined a\nseparate \u201cpixel flag\u201d image must be maintained so that any analysis\nalgorithms can employ the correct noise estimator on a per pixel basis.\n\n### 3.7 Results of applying thresholding techniques to real data\n\nTo assess the impact of applying photon counting techniques to real\ndata, I undertook an analysis of a sample dataset \u2014 1 hour of short\nexposures of the radio galaxy 3C405. These data were taken under\nexcellent seeing conditions of @xmath 0.4 arcseconds seeing FWHM, during\nthe July 2009 Nordic Optical Telescope observing run detailed in\nsections 1.5 and 2.6 . The guide star is about 20 arcseconds from the\ncentre of the field of view and was imaged on a different detector in\nthe mosaic field of view to 3C405. This meant it was possible to use a\nhigh EM gain setting for observing 3C405, without it resulting in\ndetector saturation. FWHM at this radius from the guide star was\nestimated at @xmath 0.25 arcseconds. \u00b3 \u00b3 3 See Section 5.3.2 for details\nof how the FWHM varies across the field. This observation was chosen as\nit is an unusually long timespan dataset, and as a result the faint\nlimit is largely due to detector noise.\n\nThe dataset was reduced in the usual manner and final images were\nproduced using a 50 percent selection of the dataset, applying both the\nstandard linear mode reduction and photon counting thresholding\ntechnique. I then compared the SNR for both a resolved region of\nextended emission in the galaxy profile (solid line box in Figure 3.4 )\nand for 3 faint point sources (solid-line circles in the figure). For\nthe region of extended emission we estimated background level and\nvariance using a remote region which was judged to only contain sky\npixels (dashed box in the figure), while for the point sources we used\nan annulus around the photometric aperture (dashed circles denote outer\nradius, inner radius was set at photometric aperture boundary). The\nsignal to noise ratio was then estimated using the formula:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the mean value and variance of the relevant\nbackground pixels, @xmath is the sum flux of the pixels in the\nphotometric aperture, and @xmath is the number of pixels in the\nphotometric aperture.\n\nNumbering the stars 1 through 3 from left to right, the results are:\n\n  Region          Analogue SNR   Photon Counting SNR   SNR Increase\n  --------------- -------------- --------------------- --------------\n  Galaxy region   239            391                   63.5%\n  Star 1          4.55           4.28                  -6%\n  Star 2          2.44           3.46                  42%\n  Star 3          5.12           6.24                  22%\n\nThe decrease in SNR for star 1 is due to a relatively increased variance\nin the annulus used to determine the local background \u2014 while not\nimmediately apparent in the image, inspection at high contrast shows\nthat star 1 is in a region of relatively steep decline of the faint\nwings of the galaxy. As such the background variability is largely due\nto real signal variation which would need to be modelled and subtracted.\nStars 2 and 3 also suffer from this, but to a lesser extent such that it\nis not the dominant source of background variation. This is, of course,\na quick and crude comparative test - more optimal SNR ratios could be\nachieved through PSF fitting. We note that the peak pixel in the region\nof star 2 has a photon-flux per frame of only 0.005 above the sky flux\nlevel - i.e one excess photon in 200 short exposures, on average.\n\nThresholding techniques are clearly useful at these low light levels,\nand have potential to further the limits of lucky imaging, especially as\nthe detectors continue to improve and produce lower CIC levels.\n\n## Chapter 4 Optimising and predicting the image formation process\n\nIn this chapter I consider the extrinsic variation in the short\nexposures recorded for lucky imaging \u2014 variations in the point spread\nfunction (PSF) caused by the fluctuations in atmospheric seeing\nconditions due to the turbulent processes described in Section 1.1 \u2014 and\nhow we may deal with them. To place my work in a meaningful context I\nfirst recall some salient points of sampling theory, and describe the\ndrizzle algorithm used to combine multiple exposures. I then summarise\nthe characteristics of the PSF in short exposures obtained at ground\nbased telescopes. With this grounding in the image formation processes,\nthe frame analysis and registration algorithms are compared and optimal\nmethods determined. Finally, error budgets are explored with the dual\naims of predicting image quality and enabling multiple guide star\nframe-registration techniques.\n\n### 4.1 Background \u2014 Sampling theory and image combination\n\nWhen designing a camera for astronomy, pixel size is a crucial\nparameter, due to the competing requirements of wide field of view, high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, and good sampling of the PSF. The relevant pixel\nmeasurement in this discussion is subtended angular width, the width of\nthe section of sky from which light is focused upon one pixel.\n\nA pixel of large angular width gathers more photons and so has a better\nsignal level. However, the Nyquist-Shannon theory (Shannon 1998 ) tells\nus that to properly encode a signal we require a sampling rate of twice\nthe maximum frequency present. In the case of a plane wavefront entering\nperfect telescope optics, the corresponding critical pixel angular width\nis often taken to be @xmath , where @xmath is the wavelength and D the\ntelescope primary aperture diameter. However, there is a further\ncomplexity in that the Nyquist-Shannon theory refers to instantaneous or\npoint sampling, whereas a pixel integrates a signal over a finite area.\nThis is most easily analysed using the formalism of an \u201ceffective PSF\u201d\n(Anderson and King 2000 ) ; the PSF resulting from the convolution of\nthe actual light intensity distribution (called the instrumental PSF)\nwith the pixel response function. We can then apply point sampling\ntheory to this effective PSF. This formalism highlights the fact that to\nobtain the highest instrumental resolution we actually need sampling of\nthe PSF with pixels of angular width smaller than @xmath (fig. 4.1 ),\nalthough realistically this would be impractical for most cases.\n\nTo obtain a higher sampling rate of a signal, we can do one of two\nthings \u2014 sample at smaller intervals, or if the signal is stable we may\nsample multiple times at different phase offsets (fig. 4.2 ). In optical\nastronomy these correspond to pixels subtending a smaller angle on sky,\nor multiple pointings at sub-pixel angular offsets. The optimal choice\nof pixel size will depend upon many factors such as desired angular\nwidth of the field of view, readout noise and other detector\ncharacteristics, data transfer rates, dynamic range and saturation\nlevels, and so on. As a result, it is often useful to observe a field of\nview with multiple pointings.\n\nIf multiple pointings are used, then the individual exposures recorded\nare usually combined to produce an average image, in order to reduce\ndata storage requirements, ease data analysis procedures, and produce\ndatasets that are easily inspected visually. We desire an image\ncombination algorithm which minimises further convolutions with the\npixel response function and resulting loss of resolution, while at the\nsame time providing methods for bad pixel data rejection. The drizzle\nalgorithm (Fruchter and Hook 2002 ) provides parameters that may be\nvaried towards one or the other of these aims, as illustrated in Figure\n4.3 .\n\n### 4.2 Background: Speckle patterns and speckle imaging\n\nWe can calculate the theoretical (instrumental) PSF for a telescope of\ncircular or annular aperture with relative ease. It is described by the\nAiry function, known as the Airy disc, and has an angular width\nproportional to the ratio of the observed wavelength and the aperture\nsize, @xmath . However, as all astronomers know, the PSF observed using\na conventional long exposure camera behind a medium or large\nground-based telescope (of say, a metre plus aperture size) is very\ndifferent to the Airy disc. Instead of a compact, sharply peaked profile\nwe observe a wide, shallow PSF known as the seeing disc, well modelled\nusing the Moffat function (Trujillo et\u00a0al. 2001 ) .\n\nThe increased width of the seeing PSF causes loss of information. If we\nmaintain a pixel size suited to sampling of an Airy disc then the source\nflux will be spread across many pixels and so the signal-to-noise ratio\nwill be much lower, due to readout noise. If we increase the angular\npixel width then we lose resolution due to convolution with the pixel\nresponse function. Even in the ideal case of a well sampled PSF at high\nsignal level, the wider PSF blurs away much of the information present\nat high spatial frequencies. This introduces degeneracy in signal from\nmultiple close sources, so that for example a binary or triple star\nsystem may not be distinguished.\n\nThe reason for this loss of resolution is perturbations in the phase of\nthe incoming starlight, caused by the turbulent atmospheric processes\ndescribed in Section 1.1 . Due to the power law scaling of these\neffects, the phase disturbance across a small aperture is too small to\ncause significant deviation of the PSF from the Airy model. As the\ntelescope aperture size increases, for a fixed observation wavelength\nthe phase perturbations increase according to the power law until, at\nphase disturbances of around 1 radian, the PSF becomes noticeably\ndistorted. For larger apertures still, the aperture phase may be\nconsidered in terms of multiple coherent regions, within which the phase\ndifference is around 1 radian. The size of such a coherent region is\nequivalent to the Fried coherence length, denoted @xmath (Fried 1965 ) ,\nand is dependent upon the wavelength being observed according to the\nformula:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the wavenumber, @xmath is the angle of the telescope\nfrom the zenith, and @xmath is the \u201cstructure constant,\u201d denoting the\nstrength of the turbulence optical effects at each altitude (Hardy 1998\n) . It is worth noting that @xmath is dependent upon wavelength, varying\nas @xmath . This is a useful quantity, since we may discuss severity of\nturbulence for any given site and telescope in terms of the\ndimensionless ratio @xmath , where @xmath is the diameter of the\ntelescope primary aperture. At values of @xmath the multiple coherent\nphase regions typically result in an instantaneous PSF of multiple local\nmaxima, which we may consider as a superposition of distorted copies of\nthe Airy disc \u2014 these are known as \u201cspeckles\u201d or collectively as speckle\npatterns. The speckle patterns evolve as the atmospheric phase\ndisturbances change, and their long-term average light intensity\ndistribution is the seeing disc PSF observed in long exposure images\n(see Figure 4.4 for an illustration). Note that the compact nature of\nthe individual speckles represents high frequency spatial resolution,\nlost during the long exposure averaging process as the speckle patterns\nevolve and shift position in the focal plane.\n\nIt has been recognised for some time that it is possible to retrieve\nsome of the high frequency spatial information present in speckle\npatterns, through speckle interferometry methods (Labeyrie 1970 ) .\nExposures are recorded on a timescale short enough to give a reasonable\napproximation to the instantaneous PSF (or colloquially \u201cto freeze the\nseeing\u201d), and then analysed post-exposure to retrieve information\npresent at high resolution, e.g. parameters of binary star systems.\n\nLucky imaging is a different approach to analysis of similar datasets.\nBy selectively combining the short exposures we may exploit the\nstochastic nature of the turbulence (as noted in Fried 1978 ) ,\ncombining data from moments when the RMS phase disturbance across the\ntelescope aperture is smaller than average. Ideally we select short\nexposures in which the PSF closely resembles an Airy disc. However, even\nunder poorer seeing conditions, or when using all recorded short\nexposures, the resolution is improved compared to the seeing disc \u2014 the\ndata reduction process preserves some of the high frequency spatial\nresolution lost in a long exposure.\n\n### 4.3 Frame registration overview\n\nThe speed at which the atmospheric phase disturbances and corresponding\nspeckle patterns evolve can be characterised using a defined\n\u2018atmospheric coherence time\u2019 (Scaddan and Walker 1978 , Lopez 1992 ) .\nThe relevant formulation for speckle imaging, which is likely most\nrelevant to lucky imaging, is (Roddier et\u00a0al. 1982 , Aime et\u00a0al. 1986 )\n:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the mean velocity dispersion for the turbulent layers,\nand is typically of the order 10ms (Lopez and Sarazin 1993 ) . To\npreserve the high spatial resolution information present in the\ninstantaneous PSF, the length of the short exposures must be of the same\norder as this atmospheric coherence time. As a result, to gain useful\ninformation about the instantaneous PSF we must observe a reasonably\nbright source, in order that a sufficient number of photons are detected\nfrom that source within every atmospheric coherence time. The difference\nbetween a naive and an optimal analysis algorithm applied to the short\nexposure data will determine the faint limit, i.e. the faintest source\nwhich the technique may be usefully applied to, and also how close we\nget to the diffraction resolution potentially obtainable under\nfavourable observing conditions. Clearly, this is a crucial aspect of\nthe data analysis to get right.\n\nFor lucky imaging, frame registration and estimation of image quality\nmay be equated to the problem of locating and estimating the peak value\nof the short exposure PSF. By aligning the images upon the point of\nbrightest intensity (i.e. the brightest speckle), these add coherently\nto produce a narrow core, while secondary speckles add incoherently,\nconverging to an axisymmetric, wider PSF component of lower intensity,\nor \u2018halo,\u2019 over many exposures. In the seeing regime of @xmath or less,\na small but significant portion of frames are reasonably close to the\ndiffraction-limited instrumental PSF (see table 1.1 ). If signal levels\nare high enough then potentially the diffraction-limited frames may even\nbe aligned with sub-pixel precision, such that the atmospheric motion is\nexploited in the manner of multiple pointings to improve PSF sampling.\n\nSince the guide star registration is such a critical step in determining\nthe lucky imaging system performance, I decided to investigate the\nregistration algorithms to see if they could be improved further,\nparticularly with the aim of extending the guide-star faint limit.\n\n### 4.4 Registration methods\n\nThe simplest method of estimating the PSF peak is simply to use the\nbrightest pixel, but this is a flawed method \u2014 even when considering\npixellation effects in the absence of noise, it only locates the PSF\npeak to the nearest pixel, and results in underestimation of the PSF\npeak value depending on sub-pixel location. Tubbs ( 2003 ) implemented a\nFourier resampling and filtering algorithm to overcome these problems,\nbut this is computationally expensive and introduces artefacts. Law (\n2007 ) implemented a combination of bicubic resampling and a\ncross-correlation algorithm, using the core of an Airy PSF as a\nreference model. If we consider the short exposures closely resembling\nan Airy PSF, cross correlation with an Airy reference is a reasonable\napproximation to the maximum likelihood estimator of position, due to\nthe well known result that cross correlation is equivalent to the\nmaximum likelihood position estimator for a pixellated signal in the\npresence of uniform noise (see e.g. the appendix of Gratadour et\u00a0al. (\n2005 ) for a derivation).\n\nWe can do even better, by dropping the false assumption of uniform\nnoise. As detailed in chapter 3 , the largest source of signal variance\nat all but the lowest light levels is photon shot noise, increased by a\nfactor of @xmath due to the stochastic electron multiplication gain.\nHence, a more optimal reference image can be obtained by weighting using\nthis simplified noise estimate proportional to @xmath , where N is the\nmean light level in photo-electrons at each pixel \u2014 or equivalently by\nreplacing each pixel value of the reference by its square root (referred\nto hereafter as \u2018normalising the reference\u2019). Note that uniform scaling\nof the reference has no effect on the estimation of best matching\nposition.\n\nIf sub pixel accuracy is desired, then we must also perform some kind of\ninterpolation. A simple and efficient method is to calculate the\ncross-correlation at the original pixel scale, and then fit a parabola\nin the X and Y directions about the maximum correlation value to\ndetermine the correlation peak, as suggested in Poyneer ( 2003 ) .\nHowever, this method is sub-optimal for a critically-sampled or\nunder-sampled image, since the signal is only ever compared to a\nreference generated at a particular sub-pixel offset, artificially\nlowering the cross correlation value in some instances. In a high\nsignal-to-noise regime (i.e. when using a bright guide star) it\ntherefore makes sense to either attempt cross-correlation with a\nreference of varied sub-pixel shift (Gratadour et\u00a0al. 2005 ) , or to\ninterpolate the signal data prior to cross-correlation at each\ninterpolated point.\n\n#### 4.4.1 Implementation details\n\nSince lucky imaging deals with many short exposures per second, and we\nmay wish to perform frame registration using multiple stars, it is\ndesirable that any frame registration routine be implemented so as to\nachieve the best computational speed possible. To calculate the\ncross-correlation we have a choice of computational methods. We can\neither calculate the convolution at each pixel index @xmath in the\nspatial domain:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath are defined over a small range of negative and positive\noffsets about the central pixel of the reference image; or we may\nmultiply their discrete Fourier transforms (DFT) pixel-wise and then\ntransform back:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nBoth methods have pros and cons.\n\nIn computational terms, spatial convolution is very expensive for large\nreferences, scaling as @xmath where @xmath , @xmath are the pixel widths\nof the reference and signal images respectively, and so Fourier\nconvolution ( @xmath ) is favoured for \u2018scene\u2019 cross-correlation wherein\na large reference image is used (see e.g. Poyneer 2003 ) . However, for\nthe purposes of lucky imaging I favour spatial convolution, for the\nfollowing reasons:\n\n-   For a critically sampled Airy PSF the reference will always be\n    small, since beyond a radius of a few pixels the signal becomes\n    negligible compared to noise. Therefore, typically @xmath .\n\n-   It allows for calculating the cross-correlation value only at input\n    pixels above a certain threshold, e.g. 50% of the input maximum\n    pixel value. If the cross-correlation region only covers the guide\n    star and background sky without further bright sources, the number\n    of calculations is drastically reduced.\n\n-   Spatial convolution enables the masking of bad pixels, useful if the\n    guide star happens to be observed near to bad detector columns (cf.\n    Section 2.6.6 ).\n\n-   Even if the PSF is oversampled, photon and detector noise will\n    introduce signal variation at the single pixel level. Therefore, the\n    image data must be embedded in an array of twice the size before\n    performing the DFT to prevent aliasing effects due to this\n    high-frequency pixel noise, which further increases DFT\n    computational cost (Thomas et\u00a0al. 2006 ) .\n\nI implemented spatial cross-correlation routines for use in the pipeline\ndescribed in Section 7.1 . The routines accept a reference image class\nwhich keeps track of subtleties such as the nominal sub-pixel position\nof the reference central location. I also implemented subroutines to\ngenerate a reference image using any axisymmetric function defined by\nthe user. Alternatively the reference image may be externally generated\nand loaded into the pipeline program. The reference image may be\ngenerated either at the pixel scale of the original data, or at finer\npixel scales for cross-correlation with data that has been interpolated.\nI implemented a bicubic resampling algorithm via convolution with a\nsmoothing kernel (Park and Schowengerdt 1983 ) , as previously used by\nLaw ( 2007 ) , the algorithm has been implemented anew and optimized for\nhigh computational speed. The interpolation algorithm of Park and\nSchowengerdt has also been found to be effective by Diolaiti et\u00a0al. (\n2000 ) . Optionally, parabolic fitting of the cross-correlation maxima\nmay also be applied.\n\n### 4.5 Simulation methods used for testing\n\nIn order to test various frame registration methods under controlled\nconditions I used the packages of code described in chapter 6 to perform\nend-to-end Monte Carlo simulation of a lucky imaging system\nrepresentative of the system used at the Nordic Optical Telescope in\nsummer 2009, with a telescope primary aperture diameter of 2.5m and\ncentral obscuration diameter of 0.5m. The code was used to produce\ntime-evolving short exposure images, sampled at four times the Nyquist\nrate and at 0.05 second intervals. A seeing width of 0.5 arcseconds (as\nobserved at 500nm, which is the standard reference wavelength for\nmeasurements of seeing) was chosen as representative of good, but not\nexceptional, observing conditions for La Palma in the summer months. The\natmospheric turbulence layers were simulated according to the model\ndetailed in table 6.1 . An observation wavelength of 770nm was\nsimulated, representative of the central wavelength of the SDSS i\u2019 band\nfilter.\n\nThe generated focal-plane images were normalised such that the peak\npixel value of each short exposure represented the Strehl ratio of that\nframe. After using the peak pixel to obtain a precise estimate of the\nStrehl and PSF peak location in each frame (hereafter referred to as the\n\u201ctrue\u201d values), the images were rebinned to represent pixel angular\nwidths corresponding to those used in the real lucky imaging\nobservations, specifically pixel scales of @xmath and @xmath\nmilliarcseconds per pixel. These correspond to Nyquist sampling at the\nobservation wavelength, and under-sampling by a factor of 3,\nrespectively.\n\nNext, the stochastic processes of photon arrival and detector response\nwere simulated to produce realistic images. Various source photon flux\nlevels were simulated. Transfer CIC events were simulated at a signal\nlevel equivalent to 0.05 photo-electrons per pixel per frame and CICIR\nevents were simulated at an occurrence rate of 0.04 per pixel per frame,\nrepresentative of calibrated levels from the real detector (cf. Section\n2.6.3 ). The background sky flux level was assumed to be negligible in\ncomparison (equivalent to dark time observing).\n\nThe realistic datasets were then processed by the lucky imaging pipeline\ndescribed in chapter 7 . While reduction steps involving calibration\nframes are not applied to simulated data, all other aspects of the\npipeline reduction process are identical to real data.\n\n### 4.6 Testing registration algorithms\n\n#### 4.6.1 Results from comparison via simulation\n\nThe chain of simulated data generation and processing steps was\ncontrolled via scripts written in Python, to allow for feasible\nvariation, processing and analysis of many different parameters. ten\natmospheric simulations of 1800 frames each (90 seconds worth of data)\nwere generated. For each simulated detector pixel width and source light\nlevel, these datasets were processed with 5 different Monte-Carlo\nrealisations to obtain a good sampling of the photon and detector noise\nprocesses. The simulated exposures were then processed using the\npipeline, and the output image qualities estimated using the image\nanalysis libraries I developed for the pipeline described in chapter 7 .\nA typical distribution of the simulated results is plotted in figure 4.5\n. The simulated Strehl ratios for any given parameter set can be seen to\nhave reasonably small standard deviation and range compared to\ndifferences between parameter sets, and appear to cluster around a\nsingle mode. Hence error bars are suppressed in later plots for clarity.\n\nInitial investigations with simulated data tested the relative\nperformance of different cross-correlation algorithm implementations.\nExtensive investigation of the various parameter combinations were\nundertaken. The results may be summarised as follows:\n\n##### Interpolation method\n\nThe simulations indicate that, so long as one of the described\ninterpolation methods is employed \u2014 e.g. interpolate data and then\ncross-correlate at interpolated positions, or cross-correlate data and\nthen fit a parabola about the maximum \u2014 the differences between them are\nsmall (Figure 4.6 ). At high and intermediate flux levels the difference\nin resulting Strehl ratio is negligible. This null result is of some\nuse, since the interpolation process and cross-correlation at the\nresulting higher pixel resolution incur a significant penalty in\ncomputational speed. On workstations with less powerful CPUs which are\nnot performance limited by the data input\/output, switching to parabola\nfitting may result in a useful speed boost. Interestingly, at the lowest\nlight levels (source flux of 50 photo-electrons per frame) the\ninterpolation process does provide a small but non-negligible benefit\n(relative increase of 10% in Strehl ratio, although in absolute terms\nthis is only @xmath at most), presumably due to the smoothing effect of\nthe interpolation process.\n\n##### Cross-correlation reference\n\nThe most interesting results came from variation of the\ncross-correlation reference. Normalising the reference to account for a\nnon-uniform noise distribution as described in Section 4.4 significantly\nimproves performance at low light levels, as seen in Figure 4.7 .\n\n#### 4.6.2 Comparison using real data\n\nThe trends observed in simulated results were verified using real data.\nVarious fields were reduced using the standard and normalised\ncross-correlation references, and for faint guide stars use of the\nnormalised reference does indeed result in improved image quality.\nFigure 4.8 illustrates one particularly nice example, where a Strehl\nratio improvement of around 70% is observed.\n\n### 4.7 Image formation processes\n\nIn this chapter thus far, I have only considered the Strehl ratio in\nreduced images as a metric of the frame registration and image quality\nestimation process. This is often the single most useful number when\nsummarising image quality, and gives an easy point of comparison for\ndifferent frame registration algorithms. However, having settled upon an\noptimum registration algorithm, it is of interest to explore the\ndetailed error budgets applicable under different observing conditions.\nIf we can characterise and predict the errors for any particular set of\nobserving conditions then we may predict the image quality of the lucky\nimaging results, and adjust our observing strategy accordingly. If this\ncould be done reliably it would be invaluable in both designing and\nundertaking large scale lucky imaging observing campaigns.\n\nFirst however, we require a model of the image formation process. If we\nneglect the direct effects of pixellation, then the image formation\nprocess for lucky imaging can be broken down as follows. First, I\nconsider the average PSF resulting from perfect alignment of many\ninstantaneous PSF speckle patterns upon their position of maximum\nintensity (brightest speckle). The resultant Strehl ratio will simply be\nthe mean of the Strehl ratios present in each instantaneous PSF.\nFortunately, a model for the instantaneous Strehl ratio probability\ndistribution function exists. Second, I consider the Strehl\nmisestimation, since this affects our frame selection process. Finally I\nconsider the deleterious effect of frame registration positional error.\n\n#### 4.7.1 Instantaneous Strehl ratio probability distribution function\n\nThe instantaneous Strehl ratio probability distribution function (PDF)\nis equivalent (after multiplication by some constant normalisation\nfactor) to the PDF of the peak intensity in the focal plane, which has\nbeen investigated under the term \u201cspeckle statistics.\u201d Fitzgerald and\nGraham ( 2006 ) give an excellent summary of the speckle statistics PDF\noriginally derived in Goodman ( 1975 ) in the context of laser speckles,\nand later applied in the context of astronomical adaptive optics by\nCanales and Cagigal ( 1999 ) . The intensity PDF in the context of\nuncorrected or partially-corrected seeing is well modelled by a modified\nRician (MR) distribution:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the intensity, and @xmath , @xmath represent the\ncoherent and speckle wavefront amplitude components respectively. It is\npossible to derive values for the parameters of the function purely from\nknowledge of the atmospheric seeing conditions and the number of Zernike\nmodes corrected by any adaptive optics present, however this assumes\nperfect correction of the Zernike modes (Canales and Cagigal 1999 ) .\nSince correction at higher Zernike modes in particular tends to be far\nfrom perfect, the actual intensity PDF is often better described by a\nsemi-empirical distribution obtained by fitting the parameters @xmath ,\n@xmath to observed data. Fitzgerald and Graham present just such an\nexperimental verification of the model PDF for short exposures obtained\non-sky with partially corrected adaptive optics.\n\nGladysz et\u00a0al. ( 2010b ) point out that the modified Rician model is not\nvalid in the PSF core of high order, high Strehl-ratio adaptive optics\nsystems, as made evident by the fact that it has positive skew for all\nvalues of the parameters, whereas the intensity distribution in a high\nStrehl system has negative skew. However, it is an effective model of\nboth conventional lucky imaging and hybrid lucky imaging adaptive optics\nsystems \u2014 in high Strehl ratio regimes lucky imaging produces rapidly\ndiminishing returns and so is unlikely to be applied to such systems.\n\nNote that when using the modified Rician intensity PDF to estimate the\nperformance of conventional lucky imaging, it is appropriate to assume a\nphase correction of the first 3 Zernike modes (piston and tip-tilt),\nsince we are assuming perfect re-centring upon the brightest speckle.\nFigure 4.9 illustrates the Strehl ratio histogram observed in the\nsimulated data.\n\n#### 4.7.2 Strehl estimation error\n\nWith a model for the instantaneous Strehl PDF, we may begin to estimate\nthe performance of lucky imaging under favourable conditions, by\nconsidering the mean Strehl ratio attained by selecting a certain\nportion of frames with the highest Strehl ratios, e.g. the mean Strehl\nratio of the top 10% of the PDF. However, applying this in practice\nrequires a reliable estimate of the Strehl ratio in each short exposure,\nat least via a proxy measure such as the cross-correlation maxima.\nErrors in the estimation process will lower the Strehl ratio in the\nfinal image if frame selection is applied. A reliable estimator of\nStrehl ratio in short exposure images is also of interest when testing\nmodels of the atmospheric turbulence and the speckle statistics that\nresult, since we may begin to investigate the short-timescale properties\nof the models and real data.\n\nAn investigation of Strehl estimation errors in real data is deferred to\nfuture work. For the time being I present results from the simulations\ndescribed in Section 4.5 as an illustration of the typical errors that\nmight be expected. Figures 4.10 and 4.11 give some idea of the scatter\nin estimated versus true Strehl ratio, while Figure 4.12 plots the\nresultant mean Strehl ratios resulting from the 10% selection cut-offs\nbased on the cross-correlation quality estimates at various source\nphoton fluxes.\n\nWe may characterise the effect of Strehl estimation error upon the image\nformation process by defining a selection probability function, which I\nshall denote @xmath , where @xmath is the true Strehl ratio in a short\nexposure. This represents the probability that a short exposure with\ntrue Strehl ratio @xmath will be selected and drizzled to produce the\nfinal reduced image. For example, we may wish to construct a reduced\nimage using the best 10% of the short exposures \u2014 i.e. using all images\nwhere @xmath , @xmath denoting the 90th percentile short exposure Strehl\nratio. Then the ideal selection function is simply a step function:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHowever, due to Strehl estimation error the transition from a\nprobability of 0 to 1 is much broader for the selection function\nresulting from quality estimation with real data. As can be seen in\nFigure 4.13 , at very low source signal levels the frame selection is\nnot very much better than a random selection.\n\n#### 4.7.3 Frame registration positional error\n\nOnce we have determined the Strehl ratio of the short exposures which\nwill be used to produce the reduced image, all that\u2019s left to be\nmodelled is the alignment and combination process. Neglecting the direct\neffects of pixellation, we may consider the reduced image resulting from\nregistration, alignment and summing of short exposures.\n\nDesignating the focal-plane co-ordinates with the two-vector @xmath ,\nand the intensity distribution for each short exposure (speckle pattern)\nas @xmath , with peak intensity at @xmath then we may consider the sum\nimage resulting from perfect alignment of the short exposures, which I\nshall call the \u2018zero-error\u2019 sum PSF with light intensity in the focal\nplane described by the function @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe effects of pixellation, photon shot noise and detector noise will\ncause error in the frame registration process, represented by the\ntwo-vector @xmath , such that the estimated position of peak intensity\nis\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nresulting in the mean image with registration error described by the\nfunction\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nNow, if we consider the two-dimensional error probability distribution\nfunction @xmath , such that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthen over many thousands of frames, the summing of images with error\noffsets @xmath determined by the PDF @xmath is equivalent to convolution\nby the error distribution, and so we get the result:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath represents spatial convolution.\n\nIf @xmath may be reasonably approximated as a Gaussian distribution,\nthen knowledge of the standard deviation @xmath leads to an extremely\nsimple, if somewhat crude, analytical estimate of the Strehl ratio in\nthe final reduced image. We expect the core of the zero-error sum PSF to\nbe essentially an Airy disc core, of full width at half maximum (FWHM)\n@xmath . This may be approximated by a Gaussian of the same FWHM, with\nparameter @xmath . \u00b9 \u00b9 1 (2.3548 is approximately the ratio between the\nFWHM of a Gaussian and its parameter @xmath .) The PSF resulting from\nconvolution with the error distribution may then be approximated by a\nGaussian of parameter\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith corresponding reduction in Strehl ratio, which I shall denote\n@xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis obviously neglects contributions from the halo of the PSF, which\nwill mitigate the effect somewhat at low Strehl ratios.\n\nThe error distribution is complex, depending upon many parameters, not\nleast of which is the Strehl ratio of any given short exposure. Ideally\nwe require a formula to estimate the typical error without undertaking\ntime-consuming Monte-Carlo simulations. I attempted a breakdown of the\nerror variance into various contributing factors, along the lines of the\nanalyses presented in Thomas et\u00a0al. ( 2006 ) , in the hopes of producing\na useful approximation. As explained below, the assumptions used are\nsomewhat flawed and the simulations show the estimates to be poor, but I\npresent the mathematical treatment nonetheless as a starting point for\nfurther investigations.\n\nIn order to apply analytic estimates, I first estimated the flux present\nin the bright speckle against which the reference image is\ncross-correlated. Assuming that the brightest speckle is reasonably\nsimilar in shape to an Airy disc, we can make the approximation that the\nproportion of total source flux concentrated in the brightest speckle is\nproportional to the Strehl ratio of the short exposure image. Then, the\nproportion of flux within the first minima of an Airy disc is around 80%\nof the total Airy disc flux (the exact proportion depends on the\naperture obscuration ratio, i.e. the ratio between the diameters of the\ninner and outer radii of the telescope\u2019s primary aperture annulus).\nDenoting the mean flux level @xmath , we then have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the short exposure Strehl ratio. Then, for a pixel\nwidth corresponding to Nyquist sampling of the Airy disc, we may\nestimate the cross-correlation positional error variance in the\nx-direction due to shot noise after detection by the EMCCD as (Thomas\net\u00a0al. 2006 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere an additional factor of 2 has been introduced to account for the\nadditional variance due to stochastic signal multiplication in the EMCCD\nmultiplication register (cf. Section 2.4 ), which is equivalent to a\nphoton flux reduced by a factor of @xmath . (Note I have chosen the\nx-axis without loss of generality as a convenient co-ordinate system for\nrepresenting positional error along any given axis.)\n\nWe must then consider error due to light in the halo, since this will\ndominate over readout noise if the typical pixel illumination due to\nhalo flux is greater than around 0.1 photo-electrons per frame. Thomas\net\u00a0al. give an estimation of cross-correlation error variance due to a\nuniform readout noise. We may utilise this to give a crude approximation\nof error-variance due to halo flux, though I note that the approximation\nis a poor one at low light levels as the halo flux noise will of course\nbe Poissonian and not Gaussian in nature. With this in mind, we may\nderive a first order approximation to the halo intensity in the vicinity\nof the PSF core by approximating it as a Gaussian with FWHM equivalent\nto the seeing width, which I denote here as @xmath , measured in\nmultiples of pixel width. For a sum halo flux\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwe then get a halo light level per pixel per frame, @xmath , in the\nvicinity of the core of\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich we may then insert into the appendix result of Thomas et\u00a0al.\n(equation C10) to estimate the positional error variance in the\nX-direction due to background flux from the halo:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere an extra factor of 2 has been inserted again to account for added\nvariance due to stochastic multiplication, and @xmath is the FWHM of the\nreference auto-correlation \u2014 @xmath has an angular width of @xmath in\nthis case.\n\nFigure 4.15 plots the standard deviation of the error distance in the\nX-axis, against true Strehl of the short exposures, for various\nsimulated source signal levels. Figure 4.16 compares this with the\nanalytical error variance estimates derived above, which clearly\nunderestimate the simulated error. This discrepancy is to be expected if\nwe take into consideration the fact that, unlike readout noise, halo\nnoise is not in fact independent between pixels, but highly spatially\ncorrelated (hence the observed speckle patterns). Unfortunately, to the\nbest of my knowledge an analytical formula for estimation of\nregistration error in the presence of correlated background noise is not\navailable in the literature. Furthermore, even when I take into account\nan empirical estimate of the position error variance due to speckle, the\ncombined error estimate is still lower than the simulated error for much\nof the range of instantaneous Strehl ratios. It is interesting to note\nthat the disparity becomes particularly clear around the instantaneous\nStrehl ratio of 0.3, which is about the level where secondary speckles\nbecome clearly noticeable in short exposures.\n\n### 4.8 Image formation model\n\nHaving considering the processes affecting the formation of the reduced\nimage, we may now consider a model that draws them together. I propose\nthe following formalism for a model predicting Strehl ratio in reduced\nlucky images. I propose that the Strehl ratio in the final, reduced\nimage, @xmath may be estimated as:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the Strehl ratio in a short exposure, @xmath is the\nreduction in Strehl ratio due to position estimation error, @xmath is\nthe short exposure selection probability function and @xmath is the\nmodified Rician distribution of instantaneous Strehl ratios (this\nassumes the short exposure time is less than the atmospheric coherence\ntime). Validity of the model largely depends upon whether the effects of\npositional estimation error may be well approximated in this fashion.\nVerification of the model is deferred to future work.\n\n## Chapter 5 Scientific applications of lucky imaging\n\nTo date, the applications of lucky imaging have been limited in scope.\nThe choice of useful observation targets has been restricted by the\nnarrow field of view entailed by good sampling with the older @xmath\npixel EMCCD detectors, and the difficulties of accurate detector\ncalibration required to observe faint and extended sources. These\nfactors, together with the generally developmental nature of the\ntechnique, have meant that conservative choice of observing targets was\nessential in order to achieve scientific results. As such, productive\nobserving programs have largely revolved around high-resolution stellar\nbinarity surveys, typically looking at very-low-mass stellar\npopulations, for example Law et\u00a0al. ( 2005 ; 2008 ), Lodieu et\u00a0al. (\n2009 ), Bergfors et\u00a0al. ( 2010 ) . Such programs benefit from the short\ntarget acquisition time overheads associated with lucky imaging, when\ncompared to adaptive optics systems, for comparable spatial resolution.\n\nI begin this chapter with further work on stellar binarity, this time in\nthe context of planetary transit host candidates. This is a relevant\ntopic for current research, given the current plethora of transit\nsurveys. Well quantified, preferably high contrast, companion detection\nlimits are a necessity, as explained in Section 5.1.1 .\n\nI present analysis algorithms and application of a matched filter\ncompanion detection technique, which produces quantified detection\nlimits with a challenging dataset, and results in several companion\ndetections at fainter contrasts than previously achieved with lucky\nimaging.\n\nI then explore some of the possibilities for more general application of\nlucky imaging techniques, given the improvements in field of view and\ndetector calibration achieved with the summer 2009 Cambridge LuckyCam\nobserving run. The possibility of high temporal-resolution photometry\nwith EMCCDs is explored in a preliminary fashion, and recommendations\nfor further investigations made. A case is made for lucky imaging as a\nviable alternative to Hubble space telescope observations for high\nresolution imaging with an excellent faint limit. Furthermore, the\npossibilities of lucky imaging coupled with adaptive optics systems are\nconsidered, specifically in the context of probing binarity\ndistributions at previously unobtainable levels of resolution in the\ncrowded central regions of globular clusters.\n\n### 5.1 Binarity of planetary transit hosts\n\n#### 5.1.1 Planetary transit surveys and the need for follow-up\nobservations\n\nSince the discovery of the first planet around a Sun-like star in the\nmid-nineties (Marcy and Butler 1995 ) , exoplanet science has grown to\nbecome a major sub-field of astronomy, and was listed as a priority in\nthe most recent Astronomy and Astrophysics decadal survey (Committee\net\u00a0al. 2010 ) . While radial-velocity surveys have produced the majority\nof confirmed exoplanets to date, transit surveys have an important role\nto play. The a priori chance of discovering any particular exoplanet\nsystem through transit detection is much smaller than for the\nradial-velocity method, due to two reasons: first, transit surveys are\nsensitive only to those planetary systems which are by chance aligned\nsuch that their orbit crosses our line of sight (see Figure 5.1 ), and\nsecond, we must be lucky enough to observe the system during transit.\nHowever, while radial velocity surveys require large amounts of time on\nlarge telescopes to perform spectroscopic measurements of host star\ncandidates, transit surveys can monitor many thousands of stars\nsimultaneously through use of instruments with wide fields of view.\nConsequently, in recent years ground-based transit surveys have detected\nexoplanets in numbers rivalling the radial-velocity method (Winn 2010 )\n, and the Kepler space mission has detected over 2000 planetary-host\ncandidates since its launch in 2009 Borucki et\u00a0al. ( 2010 ), Batalha\net\u00a0al. ( 2012 ) . Transits also give us information that is\ncomplementary to the mass estimates obtained via radial-velocity\nmeasurements \u2014 for transiting systems we may derive the planetary\nradius, orbital inclination, and even atmospheric composition (though\nthe latter does of course require spectroscopic follow-up).\n\nUnfortunately, since identification of planetary candidates is based\nprimarily on detecting shallow transits wherein the detected flux drops\nby a few percent, we often observe similar phenomena which contaminate\nthe candidate set. The two primary contaminants are binary star systems\nwith grazing eclipses, and binary systems close to an unresolved third\nstar, both of which result in a shallow drop in the observed lightcurve\n(Charbonneau et\u00a0al. 2004 ) . As a result some ground-based surveys have\na false\/real candidate ratio of ten to one, and so candidate\nverification becomes a major problem (Winn 2010 ) . To conclusively\nconfirm or reject a planetary-host candidate found via transit surveys\nrequires spectroscopic follow up, but making the required observations\nrequires a considerable amount of allocated time on a large telescope.\nTechniques which can detect a subset of the false-positives and so\nwinnow down the remaining candidates are thus highly desirable. Lucky\nimaging can perform admirably in this role by providing a low-cost,\nhighly efficient observing tool to produce excellent constraints on the\npresence, or lack, of close secondary stellar sources in the vicinity of\nplanetary-transit candidates.\n\nAs part of the 2009 observing run, we observed a number of planetary\nhost candidates identified by transit detection programs such as WASP\n(Pollacco et\u00a0al. 2006 ) and HAT (Bakos et\u00a0al. 2004 ) with the aim of\ndetermining their binarity. Placing constraints on the possible binary\ncompanions of planetary hosts is important for verifying the\nsignificance of transit data, as an undetected secondary star may add\nvariability to a photometric signal that can be misinterpreted as a\nplanetary transit. The binary fraction is also an interesting statistic,\ngiving insight into phenomena that govern planetary system formation\nsuch as Kozai migration (Takeda et\u00a0al. 2009 ) .\n\nObservations were made during the period 18th-22nd July 2009 at the 2.56\nmetre Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma with the Cambridge LuckyCam\nvisitor instrument. Seeing ranged from @xmath to @xmath as measured by\nthe differential image motion monitor (DIMM). All observations were made\nin SDSS i\u2019 band, using a plate scale of 32.4 milliarcseconds per pixel,\nproviding good sampling of the point spread function (PSF). The camera\nframe rate was 21 frames per second using full chip readout ( @xmath\npixels ). Table 5.1 lists the observations made.\n\nThe data were reduced using the LuckyCam pipeline as described in\nSection 7.1 .\n\n#### 5.1.2 General techniques for detecting faint secondary sources\n\nThe technique most widely applied when attempting to identify faint or\ncrowded point sources in astronomical images is that of PSF fitting and\nsubtraction. A step crucial to this process is the choice and evaluation\nof PSF model, which may be derived semi-analytically, empirically, or by\nsome combined analytical model fit with empirical corrections \u2014 see\nDolphin ( 2000 ), Diolaiti et\u00a0al. ( 2000 ), Stetson ( 1987 ) for\nexamples.\n\nIdeally, for complex PSFs such as those produced by adaptive optics\nsystems, a fully empirical PSF model is created by analysing a number of\nbright, isolated calibrator star images, close to the time of\nobservation of the binary candidate to ensure similar atmospheric and\ninstrumental conditions. However, unless the field of view containing\nthe binary candidate happens to also contain suitable bright calibrator\nstars simultaneously this is very costly with regard to observing time,\nas it requires separate calibration observations for every target\nobservation. Also, it may not be practical to use separate calibration\nobservations if the system parameters are evolving on timescales similar\nto observation timespans, for example when quasi-static speckles\n(Gladysz et\u00a0al. 2008 ) are present due to imperfect correction in an\nadaptive optics system. In contrast, conventional long exposure\nobservations produce a PSF which may be expected to conform to a Moffat\nprofile (Trujillo et\u00a0al. 2001 ) . As such it is largely parametrised by\na single number, the seeing width, which is relatively easy to extract\nand use as a model parameter, although obviously the data is inherently\nlower resolution.\n\nThe case of lucky imaging is somewhere between the two described above.\nThe data contains information at higher resolution than conventional\nlong exposures, and we should be able to calibrate the PSF with relative\nease compared to the complexities of adaptive optics observations. We\nexpect the PSF in the reduced images to be axisymmetric, however the\nradial profile is non-trivial as the PSF consists of a narrow core\nsurrounded by a wide halo (see cross-section in figure 5.2 ). At any\nrate, for this dataset, a fully empirical PSF model was not an option,\ndue to small non-axisymmetric components that changed between targets,\nas can be seen from the residual images in Figure 5.3 .\n\nOne approach I considered was fitting an axisymmetric multi-component\nanalytic model representing the core and the halo components. Just such\na multi-component fitting routine is described in chapter 5 of Law (\n2007 ) , with a \u201csliding box\u201d method used for faint companion detection,\nwhereby a local estimate of noise levels is used to isolate particularly\nbright regions as candidates for PSF fitting. Unfortunately the code was\nnot available for testing and comparison. Such a model requires 4 or\nmore parameters, and preliminary work suggested that attempting to fit\nsuch a model using a single image which evidently has unmodelled\nresiduals would be unreliable. Instead, I settled on the simple and\nrobust semi-empirical method described below, which also provides a\npixel variance estimate as a function of radius from the primary star.\n\n#### 5.1.3 Primary star PSF modelling and subtraction\n\nTo create a PSF model for subtraction of the primary star flux, I wrote\na program to create an axisymmetric, semi-empirical model. For this data\nset, all the candidate exoplanet host stars are bright, and so may be\nused to calibrate the PSF model with reasonable accuracy. The PSF model\nmay then later be used for fitting companion star candidates at any\nsub-pixel position. First, the central location of the PSF was\ndetermined to sub-pixel precision by fitting a Gaussian profile to 9\npixels around the peak pixel. The pixel values around this nominal\ncentre were then collected into bins by radius (I refer to these as\n\u201cannulus bins\u201d) to get a median value and standard deviation at\napproximately one pixel width radius intervals. A continuous radial\nprofile can then be produced \u2014 the values of the Gaussian core fit are\nused at radii within 1.5 pixels, and the annulus bin median values are\ninterpolated to provide model values at larger radii.\n\nFigures 5.2 and 5.3 display results from fitting and then subtracting\nthe primary star PSF in this manner. Unfortunately the images were\naffected by some degree of aberration which was not obvious during the\nobserving run. As a result, subtraction of the axisymmetric model\nproduces much larger residuals than would be expected simply due to shot\nand detector noise. As Figure 5.3 shows the non-axisymmetric PSF\ncomponents vary from target to target, and so a full empirical\ncalibration to further remove these residuals from the raw data is not\npossible \u2014 without a stable PSF, any empirical corrections might\nattribute a faint companion source to PSF aberration effects. The source\nof the non-axisymmetric PSF components is unclear \u2014 it may have been due\nto problems with the atmospheric dispersion corrector optics, or\nimperfect focussing. Unfortunately the problems did not become apparent\nuntil the PSF analysis was undertaken, after the observing run was\ncompleted. If such problems cannot be rectified in future observing\nruns, calibrator stars may be observed to improve the PSF modelling and\nsubtraction process.\n\n#### 5.1.4 Applying a matched filter\n\nTo enable automated detection of companion stars, and ameliorate the\nvariance introduced by the non-axisymmetric PSF components, I applied a\nmatched filter to the residual images, using the cross-correlation\nroutines described in chapter 4 . This was done by using the PSF model\nto generate a small reference image for cross-correlation with the\nresiduals image. Before cross-correlation, the reference image pixel\nvalues are rescaled, such that the mean pixel value of the reference is\nzero. This has the effect that convolving the reference with a uniform\nor slowly varying background section of an image will produce pixel\nvalues that are close to zero, while copies of the PSF will produce high\npixel values (this is essentially the same algorithm employed by the\nDAOphot FIND routine (Stetson 1987 ) ). Obviously, this algorithm relies\non the assumption that the PSF of companion stars will be a good match\nto the modelled guide star PSF. The assumption is valid for this dataset\nfor the following reasons. Firstly, the search region of interest is\nwithin the typical isoplanatic patch for lucky imaging (Tubbs et\u00a0al.\n2002 ) . Secondly the guide stars are all relatively bright and\ntherefore should not suffer from the central bright pixel effect that\nbecomes an issue when guiding at low photon rates due to the frame\nregistration process locking on to pixels which are bright simply due to\nshot noise (Christou 1991 , Law 2007 ) .\n\nOne parameter to be determined is the size of the reference image to use\nin the filtering process. This partly depends on the proximity to the\nprimary star \u2014 at larger radii where the primary star residuals are\nsmall and detector noise dominates, a wider reference image is more\neffective. Close to the primary star a narrower reference image is best.\nAfter thorough experimentation I settled on a 15x15 pixel reference at\nlarge radii, and an 11x11 pixel reference for the region close to the\nprimary star. I also experimented with using different selection cut-off\nlevels for the initial lucky imaging reduction process, but it appears\nthat for the relatively short observations in this dataset the best\nsignal-to-noise is obtained from analysing images created using 100% of\nthe short exposures, despite the slight increase of FWHM and decrease in\nStrehl ratio.\n\nFigure 5.4 illustrates the results of the filtering process. The\nprocedure is effective in reducing the noise levels and partially\nsuppressing the non-axisymmetric features.\n\n#### 5.1.5 Automated companion candidate detection\n\nFinally, the filtered images were analysed for companion candidates at a\nuser specified threshold level. At a threshold of 5 sigma the companion\ncandidates are almost entirely automatically identified in agreement\nwith visual inspection, while at 4 sigma a few false candidates appear\nalong with fainter real companions. For this dataset it was practical to\nvisually confirm or reject all detections at the 4 sigma level. Close to\nthe primary star, the noise estimates are based on the standard\ndeviation in annulus bins (reanalysed using the filtered image), while\nfar from the primary a simple background standard deviation noise\nestimate is used (this is obtained by calculating the standard deviation\nof pixels in a user defined background region). The switch-over radius\nis chosen as the radius at which the standard deviation in the annulus\nbins equals the background noise estimate. Typically this is at a radius\nof around 90 pixels ( @xmath 3 arcseconds).\n\nCertain criteria must be satisfied for a pixel to be marked as a\ncompanion candidate:\n\n-   First, the pixel value must be above a user specified multiple of\n    the noise estimate (i.e., above the sigma threshold). The\n    signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is stored for reference.\n\n-   Second, the pixel must be a local maximum - to prevent small noise\n    spikes becoming candidates this is assessed by computing whether the\n    pixel has a higher value than all the pixels in a surrounding 9x9\n    pixel box.\n\n-   Third, the region about the pixel must also have non-negligible\n    signal-to-noise in the unfiltered residuals image. The flux is\n    measured in a small aperture about the candidate pixel in the\n    unfiltered image (measurement in the filtered image would\n    underestimate the flux), and the aperture SNR calculated using\n    equation 5.1 . If the unfiltered aperture SNR is below 0.5 the\n    candidate is rejected.\n\n-   Finally, an extra caveat is applied to filter out false detections\n    caused by a detector artefact \u2014 charge transfer inefficiency, which\n    causes a faint trail of raised pixel values to the right of very\n    bright pixels. All candidates that are within one row of the primary\n    star centre, and to the right, are automatically rejected as\n    companion candidates, but saved for further visual inspection.\n\n#### 5.1.6 Companion candidate analysis\n\nAfter detection in the filtered image, analysis of companions is\nperformed on the unfiltered residuals image. Each companion candidate is\nfitted with a Gaussian to determine the central location, then flux is\nmeasured in a circular aperture of diameter 6 times the primary target\nstar FWHM (this is measured from the reduced image, and is much smaller\nthan the seeing disc FWHM). The flux of the primary star is measured in\na similar manner, and the magnitude difference calculated from the\nratio. The SNR of the companion in the unfiltered image is calculated\ntaking into account background and photon shot noise using the formula:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the mean value and variance of the relevant\nbackground pixels, @xmath is the sum flux of the pixels in the\nphotometric aperture, and @xmath is the number of pixels in the\nphotometric aperture.\n\nThe algorithm was implemented in C++ using the image processing routines\ndescribed in chapter 7 . The program is run twice, once to initially\nidentify candidates, and then a second time with the confirmed or\nrejected candidates input so that any companions close to the primary\ntarget star may be masked during creation of the PSF model.\n\n#### 5.1.7 Results\n\nCompanion detections are detailed in table 5.2 . Targets were often\nobserved slightly off-centre on the CCD detector to achieve better\npositioning of the mosaic field of view, in order to visually confirm\nthe target being observed using the positions of nearby stars. The\ntarget observed closest to the CCD edge has an unbroken observation area\nof radius 6.5 arcseconds. As a result, to give a uniform dataset we only\nlist detections within 6.5 arcseconds in table 5.2 .\n\n8 new companions are detected. These detections significantly expand the\nrange of binary contrast ratios for which lucky imaging detections\nexist, as clearly shown in Figure 5.5 .\n\nDetection limits at a SNR threshold of 4 @xmath are plotted in Figure\n5.7 . As one would expect, the limits improve quite rapidly as the\nseeing improves, and also improve gradually as more exposures are\ngathered. Beyond these general trends it is difficult to draw any more\nquantitative conclusions from this relatively heterogeneous dataset \u2014 as\nthe plots show the limits are somewhat noisy, as one would expect from\nexposure times on the order of 5 minutes. However, what is clear is that\neven with slightly aberrated images good binary detection limits can be\nachieved on short timescales with lucky imaging, and excellent detection\nlimits are achievable in good seeing conditions.\n\n### 5.2 High temporal resolution photometry with EMCCDs\n\nObservations at high temporal resolution are rare in optical astronomy,\nleaving potential for a range of investigations if such data were\navailable. Notably, the \u2018Ultracam\u2019 group have undertaken a very\nsuccessful science program with a low noise, high speed camera based on\nframe transfer CCD technology (see for example Dhillon et\u00a0al. 2007 ) .\n\nLaw et\u00a0al. ( 2006 ) gave a proof of concept demonstration that lucky\nimaging EMCCD cameras could be used for observation of rapidly varying\noptical sources. Observations of the Crab pulsar were taken with a 100Hz\nframe rate, clearly displaying the 33 millisecond variation pattern. The\nlarger format cameras available for the 2009 observing run provide\nfurther opportunities to exploit the high temporal resolution of lucky\nimaging data. The CCDs can run in a 1000x200 pixel format with a frame\nrate of approximately 100Hz. The wider format now available (relative to\nthe previous detector size of @xmath pixels) gives a better capability\nfor positioning multiple bright sources in the field of view, enabling\nrelative photometry at these high frame rates. Potentially, the very low\neffective read noise levels of EMCCD cameras may improve the faint limit\nof such techniques. However, there is a trade-off at intermediate signal\nlevels due to increased noise from the stochastic multiplication\nprocess.\n\nA small number of observations were recorded during the 2009 observing\nrun with two aims. Firstly, detecting high speed optical variability in\nthe x-ray source Cygnus X-1 as has been previously detected in other\nsources (Durant et\u00a0al. 2011 ) , and secondly providing some data on the\naccuracy of the high-speed photometry achievable with LuckyCam.\n\n#### 5.2.1 Cygnus X-1\n\nCygnus X-1 is the best known example of a high-mass X-ray binary,\nconsisting of a black hole of mass @xmath in a tight orbit about a giant\nstar of mass @xmath (Orosz et\u00a0al. 2011 ) . X-ray binaries are an\nintensely studied class of objects with a rich set of phenomena arising\nfrom the interacting extremes of strong gravity and dense matter (see\ne.g. Remillard and McClintock 2006 ) . Insight into these systems has\nbeen gained primarily by studying the highly variable emission across a\nrange of wavelengths. The emission results from accreting matter in\nclumpy stellar winds releasing gravitational potential energy during\ninfall (see e.g. Oskinova et\u00a0al. 2012 ; and references therein) . Flux\nvariation from these sources can be extremely rapid \u2014 the dynamical\ntimescales resulting from accretion onto a compact object such as a\nblack hole or neutron star are on the order of milliseconds (van\u00a0der\nKlis 2000 ) , and observations of X-ray binaries have recorded\nvariations over a wide range of timescales, right down to the predicted\nmillisecond regime (Westphal et\u00a0al. 1968 , Motch et\u00a0al. 1982 , Meekins\net\u00a0al. 1984 ) . However, while rapid variation has been detected in both\nX-ray and optical, simultaneous observations in both bands with\nhigh-temporal resolution are rare (Durant et\u00a0al. 2011 ) . The July 2009\nobserving run gave us a chance to test LuckyCam to see if it would be\nsuitable for performing such observations.\n\nAs part of the 2009 observing run, observations of Cygnus X-1 were\nrecorded in the 1024x200 pixel frame-size mode. Around 700 000 short\nexposures were recorded over two observations, over a total observing\ntime of around 2 hours. The lens resulting in a pixel size of 95\nmilliarcseconds was employed, since high angular resolution is not a\npriority here, and larger pixel widths result in better signal levels.\nFigure 5.8 depicts the field of view observed for the CCD containing the\ntarget.\n\n#### 5.2.2 Estimating a lower bound to signal variance\n\nWhen considering the likely accuracy of high temporal resolution\nphotometry, we may derive a first estimate of the expected signal\nvariance due to photon shot noise and detector noise. Obviously this\nneglects variance in the photometry due to PSF variations induced by\natmospheric turbulence, and thus forms a lower bound. Recalling equation\n3.3 , we may first consider what are likely to be dominant sources of\nvariance for this bright target. Total signal from Cygnus X-1 was around\n4000 photo-electrons per frame. Seeing width was estimated at around 15\npixels (1.42 arcseconds). While every short exposure will of course have\na different PSF, we may proceed to analyse the per pixel signal-to-noise\nratio equation by simply assuming a uniform illumination within an\naperture of the same diameter as the seeing FWHM, such that the mean\nsignal per pixel is\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTo avoid detector saturation, Cygnus X-1 was observed at an EM gain\n(c.f. section 2.4 ) @xmath ADU \/ photo-electron. Readout noise had an\nestimated standard deviation of 12.2 ADU, equivalent to 1.15\nphoto-electrons signal level. Background signal, including sky flux and\nCIC signal, was around 0.3 photo-electrons per pixel per frame. Clearly\nthen, for such a bright target the major contributor to signal variance\nwill be the shot noise, as might be expected. Including the additional\nvariance factor due to stochastic multiplication, the per frame SNR\nestimate is then simply\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nor equivalently, for the Cygnus X-1 data we expect a minimum standard\ndeviation in the per-frame source signal of around 0.02 times the mean\nsource signal, due to photon-shot noise and detector effects alone.\n\nOf course, the real signal variance will unavoidably be larger.\nAtmospheric effects cause variation in the PSF so that some of the\nsource flux may fall outside the photometric aperture, the aperture may\nbe misplaced due to a position estimation error, and there may be\nintrinsic variation in atmospheric transparency. Minimising this\nadditional variation requires judicious choice and application of data\nreduction techniques.\n\nIn hindsight, the observations of Cygnus X-1 would have achieved a\nsignal-to-noise ratio better by a factor of @xmath , if the detectors\nhad been switched to the conventional readout, rather than utilising the\nelectron multiplication register. This is obvious when considering the\n\u2018three regimes\u2019 as outlined in Section 3.4 , but unfortunately was not\nconsidered during the observing run. \u00b9 \u00b9 1 In defence of the LuckyCam\nobserving team, the observing run was fairly intense, with 24 hours to\nassemble the camera shortly after arrival, and residual software\nglitches requiring some last minute bug fixing. Future instrumentation\nscientists pay heed and plan your observations carefully!\n\n#### 5.2.3 Fast photometry data reduction techniques\n\nI developed two methods for reducing the Cygnus X-1 dataset. The first\nwas to make some alterations to the lucky imaging pipeline described in\nSection 7.1 , to implement a simple aperture photometry algorithm.\nFirst, the user selects the target sources by selecting regions using a\nsimple average image. For each source, a circular aperture is defined\nabout the local maximum pixel. The brightest source is then utilised as\na guide star to adjust the aperture positions in each frame \u2014 a\nthresholded centroiding algorithm is used to locate the weighted centre\nof the source, and the position compared to the position measured in the\naverage frame. The apertures are then shifted accordingly. This approach\nis robust, since the centroiding algorithm is very reliable, and fast,\nas the pipeline multi-threading capabilities may be employed. A\nreasonable processing speed is useful since an hour\u2019s worth of data is\naround 150 gigabytes when uncompressed. However, simple aperture\nphotometry has disadvantages. Over the course of an hour\u2019s observation\nwe expect the PSF width to vary significantly, and as a result the\nproportion of flux within the defined aperture will vary (unless we\ndefine a very large aperture, which will give unnecessarily poor\nsignal-to-noise for most frames).\n\nWith these considerations in mind I employed the Ultracam data reduction\nprogram as described in Dhillon et\u00a0al. ( 2007 ) . This involved some\nmodification of source code to allow conversion from lucky imaging FITS\nformat to the Ultracam \u2018.ucm\u2019 format, and a somewhat laborious process\nof decompressing all the individual frames before storing to disk.\nHowever, it enabled use of the well developed Ultracam pipeline feature\nset, which includes optimal photometry (photometry using annular\napertures weighted according to SNR, see Naylor 1998 ) , and a choice of\nposition estimation and frame by frame PSF width estimation via fitting\nof a Moffat or Gaussian profile.\n\nExperimentation with the Ultracam pipeline found that for this dataset\nsimple aperture photometry, using a fixed radius aperture, was in fact\nthe method which produced least variance in the recorded photometric\nsignal, as illustrated by the histograms in Figure 5.9 . With a bright\nsource such as Cygnus X-1 the benefits of sophisticated photometric\ntechniques are outweighed by the variation introduced by aperture\nadjustment with a varying PSF, and a fixed, large aperture size is more\nreliable. Indeed, some of the frames were assigned error codes by the\nUltracam pipeline and rejected, since no fit could be made to the PSF to\ndetermine position. These generally occur when the PSF clearly has\nmultiple bright speckles, as depicted in Figure 5.10 , which presumably\ncause the fitting routine to not converge. \u00b2 \u00b2 2 From conversations with\nVik Dhillon, I have since learned this is usually preventable with\nappropriate adjustment of the Ultracam pipeline centroiding settings.\n\n#### 5.2.4 Results\n\nRegarding optical variability in Cygnus X-1, a preliminary analysis of\nthe extracted photometric time series was undertaken by Poshak Gandi\n(who has some experience in this area, see Durant et\u00a0al. 2011 ) . Power\nspectrum analysis revealed no indication of an intrinsic signal. Some\ncoherent variations at slightly longer timescales was present in the\ndata due to the atmospheric variability, which was considerable \u2014 drops\nin photometry of up to 30% were encountered, as illustrated in Figure\n5.11 . Regarding the general feasibility of high temporal resolution\nwith EMCCDs, the poor atmospheric conditions again rather limit any\nconclusions that may be drawn from the data. However, I did consider the\nvariation in the data during intervals shorter than the full observing\nperiod, since we expect at least short periods of relative atmospheric\nstability. Figure 5.12 depicts the histograms of standard deviations in\nsub-samples of the data, created by simply binning the full dataset into\nsections of 2000 frames, corresponding to around 20 seconds of\nobservations per sample. Normalised aperture counts derived by dividing\nthe raw counts by the median aperture count were used for the analysis.\nNote that the histogram peaks at a standard deviation in the normalised\ncounts of around 0.02, which is the value predicted by the simple\nestimate of variance due to photon shot noise and detector noise in\nequation 5.3 . Similarly, the number of sample standard deviations for\nthe second aperture peak at around 0.04 \u2014 this doubling of standard\ndeviation is to be expected if photon shot noise is the dominant factor,\nsince the source of aperture 2 has a flux level around 1\/4 of Cygnus\nX-1. This gives some supporting evidence that when atmospheric\nconditions are stable, the noise levels in high temporal resolution\nphotometry performed with EMCCDs conform to the noise level predicted\nusing simple signal-to-noise considerations \u2014 at least in the context of\nbright sources.\n\nOf course, there will always be some degree of atmospheric variation,\nwhich is why we hope to employ relative photometry. Figure 5.12(c)\ndisplays a similar histogram of sample standard deviations, created\nusing a time-series of the ratio between the normalised photometric\ncounts for apertures 1 and 2. Much of the large range variation due to\natmospheric effects is removed as a result.\n\n#### 5.2.5 Future work\n\nThis preliminary study gives some evidence that EMCCDs are a viable\ndetector for high temporal-resolution photometry, but perhaps more\nimportantly it has raised a number of issues for further consideration\nwhen attempting future observations.\n\nFirst and foremost is the matter of observation timing. When collating\nmulti-wavelength data from multiple observatories, an accurate time\nstamp to accompany the data is crucial. For the summer 2009 LuckyCam\nset-up, absolute time-stamping of short exposures was a secondary\nconsideration, since the primary concern was to ensure that the multiple\nEMCCDs in the camera mosaic were simply synchronised. As such, absolute\ntimings relied upon an uncalibrated PC clock stamp, with an undetermined\nerror due to delay in the data acquisition pipeline. As such, an\nabsolute timing accuracy of around 0.5 seconds is probably the best that\ncould be expected. If future observing campaigns are to focus on high\ntemporal resolution work, then an added time-stamping facility, possibly\nalong the lines of the GPS module described in Hormuth ( 2008 ) , will\nbe a key consideration.\n\nSecond is the consideration of data reduction software. If large numbers\nof observations are to be recorded it may be worthwhile to implement the\nper-frame photometric algorithms using the multi-threaded lucky imaging\npipeline as a basis, or to adapt the Ultracam pipeline to a\nmulti-threaded form.\n\nFinally, care must be taken to ensure observations are made with the\ndetector in the appropriate mode (conventional or\nelectron-multiplication readout), depending upon which of the \u2018three\nregimes\u2019 the observation falls under (sec. 3.4 ). On a more interesting\nnote we may also consider faint targets, where a bright companion may be\nused for photometric comparison and guiding of the photometric aperture\nposition, while photon-thresholding techniques are employed to enhance\nthe signal-to-noise ratio of the faint variable source. The mosaic\nnature of the camera will enable this sort of observation, since a high\nEM gain may be set on one EMCCD and conventional readout employed on\nanother, so that both the bright and faint sources are observed with an\noptimal detector set-up. If the investigator were so inclined, a\nnumerical study of signal-to-noise ratio in such observations could be\nundertaken using the simulation tools I describe in chapter 6 .\n\n### 5.3 General high resolution imaging in the visible\n\nWith a wide field of view and a sensitive detector, lucky imaging\ntechniques should now be applicable to many more targets, allowing a\nwide variety of science applications. In this section I give some\nsupporting evidence for the claims that lucky imaging can be applied as\na general observing tool.\n\n#### 5.3.1 Faint limits\n\nThe faint limit of lucky imaging observations has not previously been\nexplored. If the detector readout noise can be controlled to\nsufficiently low levels, then lucky imaging should have very good faint\nlimits, compared to other ground-based optical astronomy techniques. The\nnarrower PSF and associated increase in encircled energy at small radii\ngive the technique a significant advantage when considering the case\nwhere sky background flux is the dominant noise source. Since the\nobservations are at visible wavelengths, thermal background is less of a\nproblem compared to adaptive optics observations in the infrared. A\nmosaic field with independently variable electron multiplication gain\ngives practically unlimited dynamic range, since a bright guide star can\nbe observed on one CCD at low or zero gain without saturation, while a\nfaint target is observed on a nearby sub-field at very high gain. When\nthresholding techniques are employed the detector noise can be lowered\neven further.\n\nThe best example of faint source detection is the observation of 3C405\ndiscussed in Section 3.7 . A source of estimated magnitude @xmath was\nobserved with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 6 in approximately 1 hour\nof observation. For comparison, I generated some SNR estimates using the\nsignal-to-noise calculator \u00b3 \u00b3 3\nhttp:\/\/www.not.iac.es\/observing\/forms\/signal\/v2.2\/index.php for ALFOSC,\nthe Andalucia Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera, which is a permanent\ninstrument on the NOT. Modelling a set of twelve 5 minute exposures with\nseeing width of 0.4 arcseconds (matched to our observed seeing) under\ndark time observing conditions, the SNR for 1 hour of observing time on\na 22.5 magnitude source in the I band is estimated at around 50. Note\nthat this represents a pixel sampling of 0.19 arcseconds per pixel,\nrather than the 0.032 arcseconds sampling used for the lucky imaging\nobservations. Since our observation is largely limited by detector\nnoise, increasing the pixel scale to match could result in a 34 fold\nreduction in our noise levels. Observing with a pixel size of 0.1\narcseconds would have likewise reduced detector noise levels by around a\nfactor of 9, giving SNR of around 50 while still benefiting from\nsignificant resolution improvements over seeing- limited observations\n(considering a reduction process involving 100% selection of the short\nexposures, though this is effectively tip-tilt correction rather than\nlucky imaging). The CCD configuration used for our observation\nexperienced a significant level of noise due to clock induced charge\n(c.f. Section 2.4.1 ) and it seems very likely that further tuning of\nthe camera electronics will reduce noise levels significantly.\n\n#### 5.3.2 High resolution across a wide field of view\n\nPrevious work has suggested that lucky imaging observations have a wide\nisoplanatic angle, typically in the region of 15\u201330 arcseconds (Tubbs\n2003 , Law 2007 ) . The availability of a wide, well sampled field of\nview offers the opportunity to verify this estimate and extend\ninvestigations to wider angles.\n\nHowever, accurate measurements of Strehl ratio across a wide field of\nview are hard to determine. Ideally a crowded field should be utilised,\nto give a good number of sources, but accurate photometry in such fields\nis difficult \u2014 since the lucky imaging PSF varies slightly across the\nfield, conventional PSF fitting routines will give poor estimates of\nphotometry, and hence poor Strehl ratio estimates. However, globular\ncluster data does allow for measurement of the full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) across a wide angle, since this does not rely on accurate\ncharacterisation of the faint halo away from the PSF core. To my\nknowledge investigation of this particular pair of variables (FWHM vs.\naxis offset) has not been previously published; instead only plots of\nStrehl vs. axis offset are available in the literature (Tubbs 2003 , Law\n2007 ) .\n\nFigure 5.13 displays a pair of drizzled images from different CCDs,\nproduced using a 10% selection drawn from 6000 short exposures (around 5\nminutes total observing time) of the M13 globular cluster. Pixel angular\nwidth was 32.5 milliarcseconds, resulting in good sampling of the PSF.\nSeeing width was estimated at 0.49 arcseconds at the observation\nwavelength, which was SDSS i\u2019 band. The boxes overlaid in the image mark\nmanually-selected stars chosen for FWHM analysis. The criteria were that\nthe star should be the brightest source in the local region of the\nimage, without nearby companions of comparable brightness that would\nsignificantly affect FWHM measurements.\n\nFigure 5.14 plots the FWHM measurements resulting from analysis of\nstellar PSFs over 2 CCDs of the full mosaic, for images resulting from\ndrizzling 10% and 100% frame selections. The FWHM measurements were\nobtained using custom analysis routines written using the lucky imaging\nlibraries (chapter 7 ). The plots clearly display an improvement in FWHM\nby more than a factor of 2 even beyond radii of 30 arcseconds, when a\n10% frame selection is employed.\n\n### 5.4 Science with lucky imaging-enhanced adaptive optics: Probing the\nbinary star distribution in globular clusters\n\nAs discussed in chapter 6 , lucky imaging techniques may be employed\nbehind adaptive optics systems, enabling high-Strehl imaging at shorter\nwavelengths, and hence at higher resolutions, than previously\nachievable. This has already been tried using the (soon to be upgraded)\nadaptive optics system on the 5 metre Hale telescope at the Mount\nPalomar observatory (Law et\u00a0al. 2009 ) , resulting in the highest\nresolution images obtained using direct imaging, as illustrated in\nFigure 5.15 . Figure 5.16 shows a footprint of the fields of view for\nthe camera used in the tests at Mount Palomar, overlaid on an image from\nthe Hubble Space Telescope for comparison of field sizes. Use of the\ntechnique with the latest multi-EMCCD mosaic camera opens up the\nintriguing possibility of very high resolution imaging across a field of\nview several arcminutes across, as opposed to tens of arcseconds.\n\nFor a Nyquist sampled PSF in i\u2019 band on the Hale telescope, the current\nconfiguration would correspond to a field angular width of around @xmath\narcseconds, although a redesign is in development for a @xmath arcsecond\nmosaic configuration. One set of attractive targets for such an\ninstrument would be globular clusters, since they provide a multitude of\nbright sources which may be used for guiding, and present fields of view\nwith stellar densities impossible to resolve with current imaging\ntechniques.\n\n#### 5.4.1 Globular clusters\n\nGlobular clusters are some of the oldest surviving structures in the\nuniverse (Krauss and Chaboyer 2003 ) , providing a rich source of\ninformation about the early galactic conditions under which they first\nformed, and the evolutionary processes that have determined their\nbehaviour since. Their densely populated inner regions give rise to\nrelatively large numbers of exotic stellar objects such as blue\nstragglers (Bailyn 1995 , Knigge et\u00a0al. 2009 ) , millisecond pulsars\n(Davies and Hansen 1998 , Ivanova et\u00a0al. 2005 ) , and X-ray binaries\n(Hut et\u00a0al. 1991 ) . Imaging at greatly increased resolution might allow\nmore accurate observations of many targets in these dense regions, and\none could imagine very-high resolution multi-colour photometry surveys\nas an extremely interesting project. On a wider scale, we might gain\ninsight into the dynamical history of the globular cluster as a whole by\nexamining the binary fraction, and it is this avenue of investigation we\nconsider in detail here.\n\nIn the central, densely populated regions of globular clusters, the\nbinary fraction is key to the dynamical evolution and lifetime of the\nglobular cluster (Hut et\u00a0al. 1992 ) . In a process analogous to a single\nstar burning nuclear fuel to support the core, globular clusters undergo\na continual process of kinetic energy transfer to delay the onset of\ncore collapse. Binary systems provide the fuel, transferring energy to\nthe globular system through close proximity gravitational interactions.\nThese interactions result in dissolution of wide binaries and tighter\nbinary coupling of close pairs. By probing the binary distribution in\nthese regions we gain an insight into these dynamical processes, which\nproduce many interesting objects such as blue stragglers and cataclysmic\nvariables.\n\nIn contrast, beyond the half mass radius the binary fraction is thought\nto remain fairly stable throughout the lifetime of the globular cluster\n(Hurley et\u00a0al. 2007 ) . Determining this primordial binary distribution\ngives a probe of the earliest star formation processes.\n\nPresently, a number of globular cluster populations have been\ninvestigated for evidence of the binary fraction. The traditional method\nof testing for binarity is to take spectroscopic observations and look\nfor radial velocity perturbations, but taking such an approach for a\nglobular cluster would be infeasible due to the observing time required.\nAnother technique is undertake monitoring observations which look for\nsource dimming due to binary transits, but these will only observe\nbinaries whose orbit is viewed edge on, and again requires a large\namount of observing time. The investigative method of choice for\nglobular clusters is photometric colour measurement. On a colour\nmagnitude diagram, a binary system of equal mass components appears\ntwice as bright as a single star of the same spectral type, and so\nbinary fraction can be inferred. However, this technique is inherently\ninsensitive to binaries of unequal mass. Also, with current facilities\nit is only applicable to the closest globular clusters, and open\nclusters, where typical angular separation between sources is sufficient\nsuch that crowding does not prevent individual photometric measurements.\nThe resulting estimates of binary frequency vary considerably.\n\nThe high spatial resolution provided by hybrid lucky imaging adaptive\noptics systems at visible wavelengths makes it possible to begin probing\nthe binary distribution of close globular clusters through direct binary\ndetection, i.e. resolving the separate components of some binaries which\nwould otherwise remain unresolved. We should be able to make binarity\nestimates based on single epoch data using the spatial distributions of\nsources. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations of individual clusters are now\navailable (e.g. Heggie and Giersz ( 2008 ), Giersz and Heggie ( 2009 ) )\nwhich provide precise observational hypotheses which may be explored\nwith such data. For example, it should be possible to probe the globular\ncluster Messier 4, at a distance of 1.72kpc (Richer et\u00a0al. 2004 ) , down\nto a spatial resolution of around 60 astronomical units (AU), assuming a\nPSF FWHM of 35 milliarcseconds as obtainable on a 5m class telescope.\nObservations in i\u2019 band on the VLT could reduce the resolvable distance\nto around 40AU. At these scales we should be able to place observational\nconstraints upon the binary populations predicted by simulation (see\nFigure 5.17 ). I performed a preliminary investigation to assess the\nfeasibility of such a study.\n\n#### 5.4.2 Metric: star separations detected vs. random positioning\nmodel\n\nIdeally, high resolution globular cluster observations should be tested\nagainst full Monte-Carlo simulations, but this requires simulating and\nrecording parameters which have not been focused upon in the past, such\nas typical \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 distances and other clustering metrics,\nfor a projection of the star positions onto a plane representing an\nobservational image. For this preliminary investigation I resorted to\nusing a simple random positioning model as a point of comparison to the\nobservational data. By comparing the spatial distribution of the\ndetected sources to distribution expected from random positioning, we\nshould be able to look for over-densities at typical binary separation\ndistances.\n\nIn order to analyse the data I first wrote a simple Monte-Carlo\nsimulation to estimate the spatial distributions, assuming random\npositioning. \u2074 \u2074 4 While globular clusters are clearly denser in their\ncentral regions, and so a random positioning simulation would obviously\nnot be comparable, the field of view analysed covers only a small\nsub-region of the globular cluster. Given a detected number of sources\nand a particular detector layout, the simulation produces many thousands\nof source position datasets, so that an average distribution of, for\nexample, nearest neighbour distances may be built up for comparison with\nthe real data. To account for the fact that real data has a minimum\ndistance between resolvable sources, any sources randomly positioned\nwithin this radius of a pre-existing simulated source are rejected, and\nthe random positioning algorithm runs again to determine a new location.\n\nI then needed some metrics for comparing the simulated datasets with the\nobservations. The first of these was a set of simple algorithms for\nproducing \u201cNth nearest neighbour\u201d distances, given a set of co-ordinates\nrepresenting source detections. Written in C++, these run quickly for a\nfew hundred sources. Histograms of neighbour distances can then be\ncompared. I also experimented with algorithms for estimating local\nover-densities, but quickly came to the conclusion that the datasets\nanalysed are too small for such tests to have much significance, with\nlocal estimates being easily influenced by artificial elements such as a\nbright saturated star.\n\n#### 5.4.3 Probing the binary distribution of M13 with LAMP\n\nOnly one pre-existing dataset of lucky adaptive optics observations was\navailable for analysis, the \u2018Lucky at Mount Palomar\u2019 (LAMP) run from\n2007 (Law et\u00a0al. 2009 ) . Figure 5.18 gives an illustration of the\nsource extraction and analysis. Many of the nearest globular clusters\nwhich would offer the smallest resolvable spatial scales have\ndeclinations well below the equator (Harris 1996 ; 2010 ) , and so were\nnot viable targets for this observing run. However, observations were\nmade of NGC6205 \/ M13, which has an estimated distance of 30.4 kpc from\nthe sun. The smallest angular scale we can hope to resolve with the LAMP\ndata corresponds to around 1000AU, and so if the binary distribution is\ndominated by close pairs we would expect few if any resolved binary\ndetections. Despite this, analysis of the data is useful since it\nprovides a practical test of applying source extraction techniques to\ncrowded fields observed in this manner.\n\nThe M13 observations were analysed using Starfinder (Diolaiti et\u00a0al.\n2000 ) . Of the currently available source extraction packages this is\nprobably the best suited to lucky+AO observations, since it uses a\nnumber of user-identified sources to build a fully empirical model of\nthe PSF.\n\nFigure 5.16 shows the fields of view observed with LAMP at 2 pixel\nscales. The best source extraction was achieved with the smallest pixel\nscale, however the @xmath pixel squared detector size does not allow for\nmuch sky coverage at this resolution. As a result, the number of\ndetected sources is relatively small, around 250. Figure 5.19 shows the\nhistograms resulting from analysis of this dataset. The observed data\nseem to conform fairly well to a random distribution, as expected at the\nlarge separation distances resolved here. There is an intriguing excess\nin the observed data for the number of sources detected at closest\nseparations, but with small number statistics this may be a simple\nstatistical anomaly. Sources were de-blended right down to separations\nof 3 pixels, which proves the data can provide source separation right\ndown to the resolving limit.\n\n## Chapter 6 Modelling of lucky imaging systems\n\nWhether fine tuning data reduction techniques or designing an entirely\nnew instrument, models and simulated data are often a useful tool.\nProvided that the real phenomena are adequately modelled, simulated data\ncan be used to verify that reduction algorithms give accurate results,\nprovide a range of datasets with carefully controlled parameters to\ninvestigate the interplay of external factors, and offer insight into\npotential performance under entirely new instrumental configurations.\n\nBoth lucky imaging and electron multiplying CCD observations are\nrelatively new techniques in astronomy, and as such there are no\nstandard simulation packages. During my PhD I developed a body of\nsoftware which may be used to simulate many aspects of lucky imaging.\nSpecifically, I developed two packages; one aimed at simulating\natmospheric effects and optical propagation, and one focusing upon\nsimulating the stochastic processes of photon arrival and detector\neffects, as detailed below.\n\nA large portion of this chapter is spent giving a brief review of the\nmodels, data generation techniques and parameter choices required for\nsuch simulations. A good understanding of all of the above is vital if\none wishes to produce computationally efficient, accurate simulations,\nand to my knowledge no review materials of this particular niche area\nexist in the literature ( Roddier ( 1981 ) and Hardy ( 1998 ) provide\nexcellent reviews of the models and subject matter, but do not give any\ninformation on simulation techniques). I also highlight recent advances\nboth in modelling and sensing atmospheric turbulence, which make\npossible more comprehensive and better informed simulations, tailored to\nspecific observing sites.\n\nOnce developed, the simulations were used for verification and\nimprovement of various aspects of the data reduction process, as\ndetailed in chapters 2 and 4 . I also began developing simulations to\nlook into possible configurations of hybrid lucky imaging adaptive\noptics systems, and preliminary results are presented at the end of this\nchapter.\n\n### 6.1 End-to-end Monte Carlo simulation of atmospheric effects and\noptical systems\n\nA number of methods and tools have been developed in order to simulate\nand predict the behaviour of ground based astronomical systems, usually\naimed at adaptive optics or occasionally interferometry. These may be\ngrouped into three main categories (Le\u00a0Louarn 2010 ) :\n\n-   Error budgets and analytic estimators: For well understood and well\n    characterised sources of error or image degradation effects, there\n    is sometimes a neat formula that estimates the average effect or\n    outcome. For example, given a typical wavefront phase RMS error we\n    may use the Marechal approximation to estimate the Strehl ratio\n    (Ross 2009 ) :\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (6.1)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\n    where @xmath is the phase RMS error.\n\n    Where error sources do not have analytic estimations, simulations or\n    large empirical datasets may be used to generate an error budget\n    table, so that the effect may then be incorporated into\n    calculations. Where available, these methods often provide the\n    quickest and easiest route to an answer, but they may neglect\n    correlation between error sources, and are obviously unavailable\n    when examining poorly understood phenomena. The simplicity may also\n    be a drawback, if additional details are required that may not be\n    obtained from these methods \u2014 for example we may wish to analyse\n    some metric of the PSF other than the Strehl ratio.\n\n-   Semi-analytical Fourier space methods: If the investigator requires\n    a detailed estimate of the long exposure PSF, numerical simulations\n    may be obtained using Fourier space methods (see e.g. Jolissaint\n    et\u00a0al. 2006 ) . These methods are based upon calculations involving\n    the ensemble average power spectrum of the atmospheric turbulence.\n    By calculating the average filtering effect of any given system\n    component upon the power spectrum, a long exposure PSF may be\n    obtained. However, these methods are not well suited to examining\n    the behaviour of the system over short timescales, and some\n    phenomena such as the laser guide star \u2018cone effect\u2019 described in\n    Section 1.3.2 are hard to model in this fashion.\n\n-   End-to-end Monte Carlo methods: These produce the most accurate and\n    comprehensive simulations, but are also orders of magnitude slower\n    than the semi-analytical methods. Accurate simulation of lucky\n    imaging requires use of end-to-end Monte Carlo (or simply MC, for\n    brevity) simulations, since the method is very much dependent on\n    short term variations (although I have attempted to determine\n    approximate analytical estimators for the reduced image Strehl\n    ratio, as covered in chapter 4 ). It is these methods upon which\n    this chapter focuses.\n\n#### 6.1.1 Atmospheric phase screens\n\n##### Basic generation algorithms and application\n\nRecalling the model of optical propagation through atmospheric\nturbulence described in Section 1.1 , we can reproduce the relevant\neffects upon the wavefront by defining a \u201cphase screen.\u201d This is a\ntwo-dimensional scalar field (or equivalently, a three-dimensional\nsurface) where the value at each position in the x-y plane represents\nthe optical path difference incurred by the atmospheric variations in\nrefractive index. For a given observational wavelength this may be\nconverted into fractions of the wavelength, so that each value\nrepresents the phase perturbation in radians.\n\nWe may generate an array of values to represent discrete samples drawn\nfrom such a phase screen at regular spacings. We expect the values to\nconform to some random distribution, resulting from the chaotic\nturbulent mixing. In order to successfully model the real phenomena, we\nmust ensure this distribution of the random values conforms to the\nstructure function derived from the Kolmogorov turbulence model by\nTatarski:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nor equivalently, that the power spectrum of the random values conforms\nto the Kolmogorov @xmath power law.\n\nIn truth, generation of truly random values is a complex issue, since we\nexpect computers to behave in a deterministic manner, but we may employ\ncunning generation algorithms to generate pseudo-random numbers which\nappear random to the casual observer, and suffice for the purposes of\nsimulation.\n\nTo generate an array of pseudo-random numbers distributed according to\nthe desired power spectrum, we make use of the discrete Fourier\ntransform. If we assume a Gaussian distribution to the phase\ndisturbances, an array of complex pseudo-random numbers representing\nphase and intensity at different wavenumbers can be drawn from the\nGaussian normal distribution and then modulated by the relative\namplitude for the appropriate part of the power spectrum. Taking the\ndiscrete Fourier transform then produces a phase screen array which\nsatisfies the Tatarski structure function (for most length scales at\nleast \u2014 to ensure conformity at the largest scales extra care must be\ntaken, as described below).\n\nThe final stage is to produce an image of a star as seen through the\nturbulence. Simply applying an annular mask to the wave amplitude values\nproduces sections of the phase screen that represent the phase of light\nentering the telescope pupil. Taking the Fourier transform of this\nsubregion then simulates Fraunhofer diffraction to produce a focal plane\nimage. To model time evolution, the phase screen can be shifted past the\nmask at an appropriate speed to simulate the turbulent layer being blown\npast the telescope. This is known as the \u201cfrozen flow\u201d model, since it\nassumes that the turbulent timescales which produce intrinsic changes in\nthe turbulent layer are much slower than the \u2018crossing time\u2019, i.e. the\ntime it takes for a single point in the turbulent layer to be blown past\nthe telescope aperture. This simplifying assumption is common in\natmospheric modelling for astronomy, and there is some experimental\nevidence it is valid \u2014 see Poyneer et\u00a0al. ( 2009 ) .\n\nThe simulation as described thus far uses an over-simplified model, but\ndoes produce many of the qualitatively observed atmospheric effects such\nas speckle patterns and image motion due to tip-tilt. The biggest\nfailing point is that only one turbulent layer is simulated, directly\nabove the telescope (i.e. at ground level). Observations uniformly\nsuggest atmospheric turbulence is usually concentrated in two or more\nturbulent layers (for example, Caccia et\u00a0al. 1987 ), but in the past\nsingle layer simulations have been used for simplicity and to reduce the\nnecessary computational power. By varying the @xmath parameter a single\nstrongly turbulent layer represented by a phase screen of large phase\nperturbations can approximate two layers of weaker turbulence; but\nalthough the long term seeing PSF will be much the same, the high speed\nbehaviour of short exposure speckles is markedly different. For a single\nfrozen layer the speckles track uniformly across the focal plane in the\ndirection of the phase screen\u2019s associated wind velocity, whereas a\nsuperposition of two or more layers causes more of a \u2018random-walk\u2019\nbehaviour (cf. Roddier et\u00a0al. 1982 ) .\n\nWith the basic model set out, we may consider the further refinements\nand subtleties that are required to produce datasets of adequate\nrealism. Note that the subject of the turbulence intensity vertical\ndistribution (i.e. turbulent layer heights) is rather dependent upon\nchoice of observing site, and so discussion of this aspect is delayed\nuntil Section 6.3 .\n\n##### Outer Scales and subharmonic methods\n\nKolmogorov\u2019s @xmath power law only applies over an intermediate inertial\nrange, well removed from either the outer or inner scales. The von\nKarman spectrum shown in Figure 1.1 is the ubiquitous model used in\nastronomy to accommodate the deviations from the Kolmogorov power\nspectrum beyond the inner and outer scales.\n\nNaturally, the question arises of exactly what those inner and outer\nscales are, and when they are significant in astronomy. The inner scale\ngenerally goes unmentioned in astronomical literature. Roddier ( 1981 )\nasserts in passing that the inner scale for the velocity field, @xmath\nranges from a few millimetres near the ground to 1cm near the\ntropopause, and that the scale for the temperature fluctuations will be\nof the same order. The universal assumption is that fluctuations at or\nbelow the inner scale are generally negligible for modelling wave\npropagation since the minor random phase fluctuations tend to cancel.\n\nIn contrast, the outer scale is significant because it places an upper\nlimit on the wavefront difference across a large aperture. If the outer\nscale is larger than the aperture in question there could potentially be\na continuous underlying tilt causing a large image shift in the focal\nplane, whereas a smaller outer scale should result in decorrelation and\nhence no tilt above a certain range except in rapidly shrinking\nstatistical tails. This information allows instrumentation designers to\nestimate the maximum stroke required for adaptive optics deformable\nmirrors, interferometer fringe trackers, etc.\n\nIn the context of lucky imaging, outer scale is mainly significant when\nconsidering targets off-axis, i.e. at a significant angular separation\nfrom the guide star. While the tip-tilt motion of the guide star is\nhopefully corrected by the re-alignment part of the data reduction\nprocess, the outer scale will still determine at what angular separation\nthe atmospheric effects totally decorrelate and the tip-tilt correction\nbecomes invalid.\n\nIt seems likely that the outer scales of the atmospheric turbulence that\ncauses atmospheric seeing vary to some extent with weather, location,\nand altitude. However, there has been a sustained effort to constrain\nthe numbers, and estimates seem to have now converged upon an outer\nscale for the phase fluctuations ranging from 10\u2013 30 metres. For a\nrecent discussion of the best models for outer scale, see Maire et\u00a0al. (\n2008 ) . It is important to note that this is the relevant number for\ndesigning astronomical instruments, but there are a variety of more\ngeneral outer scales for atmospheric turbulence relating to the vertical\nand horizontal scales of boundary layers and their velocity fields, etc.\nFor the simulations of this thesis an outer scale parameter of 30 metres\nwas used.\n\nHaving chosen an outer scale, care must be taken to ensure that the\ncorresponding structure function is accurately represented by the\nsimulated data. The method described above utilises normalisation of the\nrandom data using the desired power spectrum in Fourier space, followed\nby a discrete Fourier transform to get the spatial phase screen.\nHowever, if we consider the inverse process, it is clear that a\nFourier-space representation will not accurately represent the lowest\nfrequency components at long spatial scales (see Figure 6.1 ).\nFortunately there are methods for dealing with this problem. If we wish\nto simulate a finite outer scale, we may simply ensure that the phase\nscreens generated are always significantly larger than the outer scale,\nat the cost of increasing the computational requirements (especially\nmemory). However, if we wish to test the Kolmogorov spectrum with\ninfinite outer scale, or simply avoid excessive array sizes, then an\nalternative method is available.\n\nLane et\u00a0al. ( 1992 ) proposed the \u2018subharmonics\u2019 method of phase screen\ncorrection, later refined by Johansson and Gavel ( 1994 ) . First, a\nphase screen is generated using the standard Fourier transform method\ndescribed above. Then additional random samples are generated and\nnormalised by the power spectrum positions on a subgrid in Fourier space\nrepresenting low frequencies not sampled in the standard phase screen\n(Figure 6.2 ). For each sample the corresponding waveforms in real space\nare calculated and the values added, pixel by pixel, to the standard\nphase screen. While fairly computationally intensive, this requires only\nthe memory allocated to the standard phase screen, and is still faster\nthan generating an oversized phase screen. Figures 6.3 and 6.4 display\nthe resulting improvement in phase screen statistics when employing the\ngeneralized subharmonic methods implemented in the Arroyo simulation\npackage (described in Section 6.1.2 ). The subharmonics clearly produce\na more accurate simulation of the tip-tilt Zernike modes, which result\nin image motion in the focal plane.\n\nA second consideration with regard to generating phase screens with the\ncorrect statistics is that of correctly representing the smaller scales.\nThis is simply a case of computing enough samples to give a sufficiently\nsmall spatial sampling interval. To my knowledge there is no guidance on\nthis matter in the literature, but Francois Rigaut (author of the \u2018YAO\u2019\nAO simulation package, see Section 6.1.2 ) recommends a sampling rate\nproducing at least two and preferably three sample intervals per @xmath\n. \u00b9 \u00b9 1 Source: http:\/\/frigaut.github.com\/yao\/manual.html This seems\nsensible considering that phase disturbances on scales smaller than this\nare of order 1 radian or less, and are therefore likely to have\nnegligible effect.\n\n##### Intermittency\n\nWhen performing simulations where the focus is upon phenomena at short\ntimescales, it is worth noting that verifying the statistical averages\nof the power law tells us nothing about short timescale evolution within\nthe turbulence. Long exposure images smear out the rapidly varying\nspeckle statistics. Balloon measurements should be sensitive to very\nrapid variations, but are almost universally focused on gathering large\nscale information about the structure and distribution of turbulence\n(for example Azouit and Vernin 2005 ) . One of the first major\ncriticisms of Kolmogorov\u2019s 1941 universal theory of homogeneous\nturbulence was an observation by Landau, that at the outer scale\nturbulence is often observed to be intermittent.\n\nIntermittency literally refers to an \u2018on \/ off\u2019 nature - for example a\nusually quiet signal with occasional short bouts of noise. Sometimes\nthis fleeting activity leaves the base signal unchanged, but it may be\nintegral to the nature of a function \u2014 an abstract example of this is\nthe \u2018Cantor\u2019s function\u2019 or \u2018Devil\u2019s Staircase\u2019 (Figure 6.5 ) which\nincreases from 0 to 1 over the unit interval, but is constant almost\neverywhere (except on the Cantor set, see e.g. Thomson 2008 ) . In\nphysical terms, an observable that when measured produces an\nintermittent signal usually has some kind of structure, as illustrated\nin figure 6.7 . In turbulence this is somewhat contrary to the\nhomogeneous, isotropic background to Kolmogorov\u2019s energy cascade\nhypothesis. Nonetheless, it is observed that at the outer scale the\nenergetic motion injected into a turbulent system is often intermittent.\n\nThe classic example of this is a boundary layer - particularly relevant\nsince the turbulent laminae where seeing arises can be thought of as a\nboundary layer between background fluids of different ambient\ntemperatures (Coulman et\u00a0al. 1995 ) . Patches of concentrated vorticity\ncan be seen to release from the boundary resulting in a highly\nnon-uniform velocity field. There is also some experimental evidence to\nsuggest that this intermittency persists into the inertial range, which\nis to say it is not dispersed by the turbulent mixing. However there\nhave been no conclusive results on accurately characterising this\nintermittency in the inertial range of the velocity field, and there\nseems to be uncertainty over the significance.\n\nHowever, passive scalars are now generally recognised to be less\nisotropic and homogeneous than the velocity field (Sreenivasan 1991 ) ,\nparticularly in shear layers. Intermittency produces significant\ndeviations from the standard Gaussian Kolmogorov distribution in these\nobservables, for example temperature fluctuations (Figure 6.7 ). There\nare a few models for this fine structure of passive scalar fields, but\nnone are singled out as the preferred approach. Shraiman and Siggia (\n2000 ) give a review of current work on scalar turbulence.\n\nThe extent to which intermittency effects can be observed at scales of\ninterest to astronomy has been shown in simulations to have direct\nimplications for both lucky imaging and adaptive optics, by Tubbs ( 2006\n) , who proposes an adaptable generalised model of intermittency. In\nshort, for a given mean level of seeing lucky imaging benefits from\nintermittency because it isolates the moments of good seeing and\ndiscards the poor ones. Similarly if intermittent effects are observed\nfrequently then adaptive optics systems could benefit from continuous\nmonitoring and re-optimization of the system operation rates to achieve\nbest correction at all times. If intermittency effects are extreme then\nit poses real problems for standard adaptive optics systems because the\nwavefront correction is performed in a feedback loop, with the potential\nfor sudden large changes to upset the tracking and require repetition of\nthe (often lengthy) target acquisition process known as \u201cclosing the\nloop.\u201d\n\nObservational evidence for or against intermittency effects is sparse.\nIt is well known that seeing can vary greatly on timescales of hours and\nminutes (for example, see Tokovinin et\u00a0al. 2003 ) but without high\ntemporal resolution measurements it is hard to determine whether these\nvariations are due to large scale intermittency or simply a rapid but\nprogressive change in the mean value of @xmath . Baldwin et\u00a0al. ( 2008 )\ninvestigates this distinction, with the tentative conclusion that\nintermittency may vary with atmospheric conditions \u2014 rapid step changes\nare observed in some data sets, while others are better characterised as\nGaussian fluctuations about an evolving mean. In the absence of hard\nevidence I utilised the conventional model without intermittency effects\nfor the simulations described in this thesis, but the subject merits\nfurther investigation since many expensive adaptive optics projects\ndepend upon simulated data for design and optimization.\n\n##### Rolling phase screen generation\n\nUsing the discrete Fourier transform phase-screen generation methods\ndescribed above, long period simulations require large amounts of memory\nfor allocating the phase screen arrays. This places a practical limit on\nthe maximum simulation time, and also models a fixed mean intensity of\nturbulence for the duration of the simulation (i.e. fixed @xmath ).\nHowever, algorithms and code for producing dynamically updated phase\nscreens have recently been developed, as reported in Assemat et\u00a0al. (\n2006 ) . In short, the method uses an analysis of the covariance\nfunctions corresponding to the prescribed power spectrum model, in order\nto derive special matrix operators. These matrices may then be applied\nto a phase screen array and a vector of newly generated Gaussian\npseudo-random values, to extend the phase screen along one edge.\nConsidering a phase screen being blown past an aperture, one may then\ncontinually delete values from one side of the array while appending new\nvalues to the other side, producing a simulation of any desired timespan\nwithout large memory requirements. There is an additional advantage\nsince the atmospheric parameters may be varied as the simulation\nprogresses. A high degree of numerical precision is required to prevent\ndivergent results due to round-off errors (Basden 2011 ) , but the\ntechnique has been successfully employed for some simulations, e.g.\nBasden et\u00a0al. ( 2007 ) .\n\n##### Wavefront propagation methods\n\nIf multiple atmospheric phase screens at various heights are modelled,\nthe wavefront must be propagated between them. The most commonly\nemployed model for wavefront propagation is the so called \u201cgeometric\npropagation\u201d method, where a uniform phase offset is added to the\nwavefront phase according to the distance travelled. While this is\nappropriate over relatively short distances or for wavefronts with only\nsmall phase perturbations (relative to a plane wave), if the phase\nperturbations are a significant proportion of a wavelength then\ndiffraction effects may become significant, and a more sophisticated\nmethod may be required for accurate results. Examples include detailed\nsimulations of defocused wavefronts, e.g. Guyon ( 2010 ) , or wavefronts\nfocused through small lenslets, e.g. Goodwin et\u00a0al. ( 2007 ) . For a\nfull discussion of propagation algorithms the reader is referred to\nPapalexandris and Redding ( 2000 ) .\n\n#### 6.1.2 End-to-end Monte Carlo simulation packages\n\nOf the Monte Carlo simulation packages, \u2018CAOS\u2019 (Carbillet et\u00a0al. 2005 ;\nIDL based ) , and \u2018YAO\u2019 (van Dam et\u00a0al. 2010 ; based on a free IDL-like\nlanguage called \u2018Yorick\u2019) , are notable examples which are freely\navailable. Other expansive end-to-end simulation packages exist, such as\nthe \u201cDurham extremely large telescope adaptive optics simulation\nplatform\u201d (Basden et\u00a0al. 2007 ) and the \u201cOctopus\u201d simulation code\ndeveloped within the European Southern Observatories (Montilla et\u00a0al.\n2010 ) , but these are generally utilised in-house and are not aimed at\n\u2018casual\u2019 users. Lucky imaging places some fairly strenuous requirements\non the simulations package. It must be capable of a full time-evolving\nMonte-Carlo simulation, as opposed to an analytic model, in order to\ninvestigate the effects of atmospheric coherence times, etc. It must be\nable to provide a long period atmospheric phase screen, in order to\nprevent unrealistic repetition of point spread function behaviour.\nFinally, there is ongoing work to design a curvature sensor for use with\na lucky imaging adaptive optics system. While this work is not discussed\nfurther here, the model relies upon Fresnel diffractive propagation\neffects, which are not modelled in many simulations, despite the fact\nthat including these propagation effects produces significantly\ndifferent results when compared to simple geometric propagation in some\ncontexts (see Goodwin et\u00a0al. 2007 ) .\n\nFor these reasons, and due to my familiarity with the C++ programming\nlanguage, I chose to develop simulations using an open source C++\npackage called \u2018Arroyo\u2019 (Britton 2004 ) . The package is well featured,\nbut somewhat inaccessible to new users due to paucity of documentation\nand use of some rather esoteric programming idioms. During my use of the\npackage I have made a number of alterations that I believe go some way\nto addressing these practical issues. I also modified sections of the\ncode to allow for use of very large phase screens with pixel indices\nthat may extend beyond the address capacity of a standard 32 bit integer\nvariable, which is potentially of use on machines with RAM capacity of\nover 4 gigabytes.\n\nI also checked various aspects of the Arroyo simulated data to ensure\nthat the simulated results were valid. While undertaking these tests I\ndiscovered that under certain conditions the low spatial frequencies are\ninsufficiently reproduced in one direction even when subharmonic\ntechniques are employed, due to use of long, thin \u2018ribbon\u2019 phase\nscreens. This was rectified by modifying the code to enforce a minimum\nphase screen pixel width in any direction equivalent to 50m, at the cost\nof a slight increase in computational memory requirements (Fig. 6.8 ).\n\nI note that in theory, it should be relatively simple to integrate\nrolling phase screen functionality into the Arroyo package, which would\nallow for simulations of very long timespan and dynamically evolving\natmospheric conditions. This potentially very useful enhancement is\ndeferred to future work.\n\n### 6.2 Simulating photon shot noise and the EMCCD response\n\nFor lucky imaging, the detector is crucial to the behaviour of the\nentire system. The detector characteristics not only determine the\nsignal to noise of faint objects, but also influences the guide star\nregistration process, and hence the resolution obtained. This, and the\nfact that I needed to develop and verify a range of detector analysis\nroutines, meant that careful modelling of the detector was a necessity.\nCreating tools that would allow Monte-Carlo simulations required some\nwork with pseudo-random number generation.\n\nPhoton shot noise and detector readout noise are easily modelled with\nwidely available pseudo-random number generators conforming to\nPoissonian and Gaussian distributions. For conventional CCDs these often\nsuffice. However, the electron multiplying CCD has an unusual ADU output\nprobability distribution as detailed in Section 2.4 . To generate random\nnumbers accordingly, the distribution first needs to be calculated, and\nthen random numbers drawn from it. An early version of my code used a\ncrude implementation of a \u201cdiscrete sequential search\u201d algorithm -\nessentially a random number is drawn from a uniform random number\ndistribution, and the EMCCD distribution values are iterated through\nuntil the matching cumulative probability is reached. This has painfully\nslow performance for large simulations, in practice. Further\ninvestigation suggested the UNURAN package (Hormann and Leydold 2000 ) ,\nwhich provides \u201cblack box\u201d tools for sampling pseudo-random numbers from\nany user generated distribution, and is also employed in the ROOT (Brun\nand Rademakers 1997 ) modelling package at CERN. Utilising the UNURAN\npackage provides excellent performance, and the current revision of the\ncode typically simulates @xmath 7 million pixel events per second on a\nsingle CPU core. Figure 6.9 illustrates the stages of the detector\nsimulation process.\n\n### 6.3 Modelling lucky imaging at the Nordic Optical Telescope\n\nAs astronomical observing techniques and equipment have progressed,\nmethods of characterising observing sites and observing conditions have\ndeveloped alongside. Since the late 1980\u2019s, differential image motion\nmonitors (DIMM\u2019s, Pedersen et\u00a0al. 1988 ) have enabled automatic\nmonitoring of the seeing width, allowing observers to test prospective\nobservatory sites, gain a uniform record of seeing conditions over long\nperiods and optimise observation scheduling.\n\nAs adaptive optics systems have become more widespread, more in depth\nknowledge of atmospheric conditions has become necessary in order to\npredict and optimise system behaviour. Real time correction techniques\nmust be able to keep up with the changing atmospheric conditions, and so\natmospheric coherence times have become important. More recently the\nvertical structure of atmospheric turbulence has come to the fore, since\nit is key to the performance of layer orientated adaptive optics\ntechniques such as multi-conjugate AO (Campbell et\u00a0al. 2010 ; and\nreferences therein) and ground layer AO (Tokovinin 2004 , Andersen\net\u00a0al. 2006 ) . Over the past decade a number of techniques have emerged\nto provide full vertical profiling, including \u2018multi-aperture\nscintillation sensors\u2019 (MASS, Tokovinin and Kornilov 2007 ) , \u2018slope\ndetection and ranging\u2019 (SLODAR, Wilson 2002 ) , and generalized\nscintillation detection and ranging (G-SCIDAR, Fuchs et\u00a0al. 1998 ) , but\nthe data reduction methodologies are only now maturing, and only a\nhandful of sites have been characterised using these new techniques over\na significant length of time (e.g. Avila et\u00a0al. 2006 , Egner et\u00a0al. 2007\n, Garc\u00eda-Lorenzo and Fuensalida 2011 ) . As one would expect, the long\nterm (over many nights) average turbulence profiles observed vary from\nsite to site and between seasons, although commonly detected features at\nsites of good seeing include a strong ground layer component, one or two\npeaks in the 3 to 5 km altitude region, and then another peak in the\ntroposphere region of 8-15 km altitude \u2014 see figures 6.10 , 6.11 and\n6.12 .\n\nFortunately, Garc\u00eda-Lorenzo and Fuensalida ( 2011 ) provide profiles for\nthe Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos. Their median high\nresolution turbulence profile is based largely on data taken between the\nmonths of June and August between 2004 and 2009 (i.e. under summer\nconditions). In theory, this provides an excellent match to the\nconditions under which the lucky imaging campaign of summer 2009 was\nundertaken, although the reality will of course depend upon the\nparticular turbulence profiles of those nights \u2014 indeed the observed\nseeing widths of the lucky imaging campaign range significantly about\nthe seeing width of the median profile model. With the aim of producing\nsimulated data broadly comparable to that of the observing campaign, I\nchose to use this data to inform my choice of atmospheric model.\n\nWhen experimental data on the atmospheric turbulence profile is\navailable, one must carefully interpret the data, and decide how to\nproceed in modelling the turbulence profile computationally. There is\nexperimental evidence from balloon based observations (Vernin and\nMunoz-Tunon 1994 , Azouit and Vernin 2005 ) to support the use of thin\nlayer approximations for regions of turbulence. The balloon data suggest\nthere are often a few dominant layers, with many more adding smaller\ncontributions to the total turbulence integral. When choosing how many\nlayers to include in the simulation, a trade-off must be made between\naccurately modelling a detailed profile with many contributing layers,\nand the corresponding increase in computational requirements. For\nexample, simulations of multi-conjugate adaptive optics require a large\nnumber of layers to be simulated, since too few would produce\nartificially high estimates of the image quality attainable, with phase\nperturbations from the few simulated turbulence layers all being\nperfectly corrected. Ground layer adaptive optics, which only aims to\ncorrect at one conjugation altitude, is often simulated with fewer\nlayers (Andersen et\u00a0al. 2006 ) , since the most important property is\nthe allocation of turbulent strength between low-altitude and\nhigh-altitude layers. Crucially, for short timescale techniques\nincluding lucky imaging, at least two layers should be simulated if\nthere is any evidence for significant variance in the wind velocities,\nsince the relative velocity of the wind layers along with the Fried\ncoherence length determine the atmospheric coherence time.\n\nFor my simulations, computational requirements were a limiting factor,\nsince long timespan simulations were desired. As a result I chose a 3\nlayer model providing a crude approximation to the median\nhigh-resolution atmospheric profile measured at the Observatorio del\nRoque de los Muchachos, as described in (Garc\u00eda-Lorenzo and Fuensalida\n2011 ; Figure 6.10 ) . The layer properties are listed in table 6.1 .\n\nOnce the turbulent layers to model have been chosen, a realistic wind\nvelocity profile is required. The combination of layer velocities\ndetermines the rate at which the instantaneous PSF evolves. This is\ntypically measured by monitoring the autocorrelation properties of light\nintensity variation in the focal plane, as described in Scaddan and\nWalker ( 1978 ), Fitzgerald and Graham ( 2006 ) . To the best of my\nknowledge a full vertical profile of wind velocities is not available\nfor the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, however Garc\u00eda-Lorenzo\net\u00a0al. ( 2009 ) provide a profile for the nearby El Teide observatory\n(fig. 6.11 ). The wind velocities chosen for my simulated model are\nbased upon these data.\n\n### 6.4 Modelling hybrid adaptive optics systems\n\nOne target of investigation with the simulations I developed is hybrid\nadaptive optics systems. While there has already been a proof of concept\ndemonstration (Law et\u00a0al. 2009 ) , there are plenty of questions worth\nexploring, relating to expected performance over wider fields of view,\nuse of different adaptive optics systems, and application to telescopes\nof different sizes. In this section I give a brief summary of the\nmotivations for development of future hybrid systems, in terms of system\nperformance \u2014 a science case is discussed in Section 5.4 . I then give\npreliminary results that illustrate some of the performance gains which\nmight be expected.\n\n#### 6.4.1 Strehl ratio statistics behind adaptive optics\n\nAs discussed in chapter 4 , the instantaneous Strehl ratio as recorded\nin a very short exposure varies along with fluctuations in the seeing\nstrength and (where relevant) errors in the adaptive optics corrections.\nFor systems with no correction or partial AO, the histogram of these\ninstantaneous Strehl ratios has a positive skew, i.e. a long tail of\nsamples when the Strehl ratio is significantly better than average.\nClearly by performing frame selection upon such a sample the mean Strehl\nratio of the selected subsample may be much improved compared to the\nmean Strehl ratio of the full histogram.\n\nFor high levels of adaptive optics correction, on-axis (i.e. near to the\nguide star), if a long exposure Strehl ratio of greater than say, 0.5 is\nachieved, this situation begins to change. The standard deviation of the\ninstantaneous Strehl ratios is smaller, and the distribution becomes\nnegatively skewed, as depicted in Figure 6.13 . As a result, any\nbenefits to be gained from frame selection become diminished, and may be\noutweighed by the signal to noise ratio considerations of rejecting\nframes. For this reason, use of high speed imaging behind high Strehl\nsystems for on-axis targets is only of use for specialized applications\nsuch as distinguishing faint companions from halo noise, e.g. Gladysz\net\u00a0al. ( 2008 ) .\n\nHowever, current adaptive optics systems still struggle to produce long\nexposures of moderate Strehl ratio at visible wavelengths. Since this is\nthe wavelength region where EMCCDs are most sensitive, it is an obvious\ntarget for application of lucky imaging techniques. Furthermore, for\nconventional single conjugate AO systems (as opposed to multi-conjugate\nAO, see Section 1.3.1 ), the Strehl ratio always declines as the target\nseparation from the guide star increases. Application of lucky imaging\ntechniques to off-axis targets may significantly expand the effective\nisoplanatic patch size. Finally, for laser guide star systems, lucky\nimaging may offer greatly improved sky coverage. Laser guide stars do\nnot provide tip-tilt information, and so a natural guide star, typically\nof magnitude @xmath in V band, is still required to provide this\ninformation (further details in Section 1.3.2 ). The results of lucky\nimaging with guide stars of magnitude @xmath in i\u2019 band on the 2. 5m\nNordic Optical Telescope suggest that, with large aperture telescopes\nand partial correction from the AO system, guiding with much fainter\nnatural guide stars may be possible.\n\n#### 6.4.2 Preliminary investigations through simulation\n\nAn instrument concept that has recently been proposed by the Cambridge\nlucky-imaging group is that of a hybrid lucky-imaging enhanced adaptive\noptics system for use on the 4.2 metre William Herschel Telescope, at\nthe Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos. I used the simulation tools\nto perform a preliminary analysis of what sort of performance might be\nexpected from such an instrument, given different levels of adaptive\noptics correction.\n\nFor the analysis, I generated ten independent simulations of 1000 frames\neach, simulated at 20 frames per second. The wind model of table 6.1 was\nused, with a seeing width of 0.5 arcseconds at 500nm. An observation\nwavelength of 770nm was simulated, corresponding to the SDSS i\u2019 band\nfilter. This gives a @xmath ratio of around 12, which is nearly double\nthe optimum for conventional lucky imaging \u2014 hence conventional lucky\nimaging would perform very poorly. The adaptive optics correction was\nsimulated in an idealised fashion, implemented as a simple calculation\nof Zernike polynomials from the guide-star phase screen, up to a user\nspecified number of Zernike modes. The combined Zernike polynomials were\nthen subtracted from the phase screens for simulated targets across a\nfield of view of 60 arcseconds. Three levels of correction were applied,\n0 Zernike modes (regular seeing), 10 Zernike modes (all modes up to\norder 3), and 28 Zernike modes (all modes up to order 6). Detector and\nphoton noise were not simulated, corresponding to performing the lucky\nguiding process upon bright stars of good signal to noise ratio.\n\nHistograms of the instantaneous Strehl ratios resulting from the\nsimulations are displayed in Figure 6.14 , and clearly show how the\noff-axis Strehl distribution remains negatively skewed even for when\nmoderate Strehl ratios are achieved on-axis. Figures 6.15 and 6.16 plot\nthe image quality metrics obtained across the field of view, for AO and\nlucky imaging enhanced AO. The simulations clearly suggest that, at\nleast under favourable conditions, lucky imaging techniques considerably\nenhance AO performance. The most intriguing plot is that depicting FWHM\nacross the field. Using a lucky imaging stabilization of the adaptive\noptics frames, this is very much enhanced across the field of view. It\nshould be pointed out that this result comes from simulating a local\nlucky imaging correction at each radius from the AO guide star \u2014 that\nis, assuming a bright guide star could be utilised and the data reduced\naccordingly, for each point plotted. Crucially though, the AO corrected\nspeckle patterns produce a diffraction limited PSF when re-aligned, even\nfor a 4m class telescope.\n\n#### 6.4.3 Future work\n\nA full investigation of lucky-imaging enhanced adaptive optics requires\na full simulation of adaptive optics system components such as wavefront\nsensing and deformable mirrors, with detector and photon noise. Models\nfor some of these components are implemented in Arroyo, but others\nrequire work. The simulations are also somewhat time consuming to\ncompute. I have been in touch with Alistair Basden of the Durham AO\nsimulation team, and procured a sample dataset of simulated post-AO\nshort exposures, which may then be processed with the detector\nsimulation package described above, and the standard lucky imaging\npipeline. I hope to develop a full collaborative investigation in\nfuture, although I note that continued development of Arroyo remains\nvaluable for small studies and development of novel instrument models\nand data reduction algorithms.\n\n## Chapter 7 Data reduction\n\nThis chapter describes the software I developed to reduce lucky imaging\ndata. A general overview of the data reduction process is given, and\nsome technical aspects of the software are highlighted. Finally, I\ndescribe the combinations of pre-existing astronomy software I have\nutilised to accomplish further tasks such as astrometric calibration.\n\n### 7.1 The lucky imaging pipeline\n\nThe reduction of any particular dataset is currently a 2 stage process.\nIn a first pass, calibration data is taken, the frames are cleaned of\nartefacts, cosmic rays are identified and guide star frames are\nregistered. In the second pass this information is used to create\ndrizzled ( Fruchter and Hook ( 2002 ) , also see Section 4.1 ) science\nimages at different selection levels. The drizzle implementation\nmaintains two versions of the final image in parallel \u2014 one thresholded\nimage, one treated in the normal linear manner \u2014 so both of these\nreduced outputs are produced in a single run. One C++ program deals with\neach of these stages, with frame registration data output into a\nformatted text file by the first.\n\nTo preserve disk space and prevent data loss due to human error, the\ndata is treated in an entirely read-only manner, to the extent that a\ndata drive may be mounted in read-only mode. Input and output\ndirectories are designated in configuration files, allowing for easy\nre-reduction if the user wishes to try a reduction process with\ndifferent parameters.\n\n#### 7.1.1 Observation reduction preparation tool\n\nBefore either of the main data reduction programs may be utilised,\nvarious configuration files must be written, and target regions\nselected. I created a pair of data-reduction preparation tools in order\nto ease the creation of these files, create output directory structures\nmirroring the input directories, and produce scripts which will automate\nreduction of many targets consecutively.\n\nThe run preparation tools are written in the Python programming\nlanguage. Python allows easy alterations to the source code without\nrecompilation, and enables use of many supporting packages, for example\ngiving easy access to spreadsheet data, and interactivity with the DS9\nimage display tool for use with FITS format images (Joye et\u00a0al. 2011 ) .\n\nThe first stage of preparing for data reduction is to build a simple\ndatabase containing information about where each dataset is located on\nthe input drive, which pixel scale and wavelength was used for that\nobservation, where the CCD calibration files are stored, and so on. I\nrefer to this as \u201clocalizing the observations spreadsheet.\u201d This process\nrelies upon a careful naming convention, where each dataset folder is\nprefixed with an observation number, e.g. 7010 referring to the 10th\nobservation on night 7 of an observing run (although more complex naming\nconventions could easily be encoded). The localization script takes as\nan input a spreadsheet with rows containing the id number and relevant\ninformation on filters, etc, for every observation. This may easily be\nrecorded at the time of observation using any spreadsheet package, or\ncreated afterwards from observing logs. The script scans a specified\ntop-level directory for subdirectories prefixed with observation ID\nnumbers, which are cross-referenced with the observing log spreadsheet.\nAn extended spreadsheet is then output which has columns encoding the\ndataset locations, and specifies a \u201ccamera configuration file\u201d for every\nobservation, which is determined using a simple decision tree based on\nthe filter, lens and so on.\n\nBy automating the tedious process of dataset file location and parameter\nentry, the rest of the data reduction preparation proceeds much more\neasily. The user may specify observations for reduction simply by\nlisting their observation ID numbers in a text file. Once a top level\noutput directory has been specified, a second preparation script is\nemployed for the purposes of snapshot creation and region selection.\n\nThe first run of this second preparation script simply engages a\ncut-down version of the main pipeline program to produce \u2018quick look\nsnapshots,\u2019 average frames created by cleaning and averaging the first\none hundred frames of each observation, which takes a few seconds per\nobservation.\n\nThe second run of the region selection script is more complex. For each\nobservation in turn, an instance of the image display tool DS9 is\ninitiated with the snapshot from each CCD of the camera mosaic loaded\ninto a tiled image, with a preselected colour scheme and scaling (Figure\n7.1 ). The user is prompted to enter which CCDs of the mosaic require\ndata reduction (possibly all of them). Each selected CCD snapshot is\nthen redisplayed so that the user may select a guide star region and\nbackground region, if there are suitable regions on the CCD. This\nautomation of file location, display and user prompting greatly speeds\nthe reduction preparation process. Finally, a script is output which\nwill consecutively call the main pipeline programs to reduce all the\nchosen datasets.\n\n#### 7.1.2 First pass \u2014 frame calibration and registration\n\nThe first of the two main pipeline programs performs clean-up and\nregistration of the short exposure images, and is run once for each of\nthe datasets recorded from the multiple CCDs of the camera mosaic.\n\nThe first action taken by the program is to attempt to load bias\ncalibration frames. Separate frames are stored to record the vertical\nand horizontal gradients in the bias, for the reasons covered in Section\n2.6.1 . If a horizontal gradient frame does not exist, it is generated\nby taking a column-by-column histogram of the first few thousand frames.\nAn \u201cinternally generated signal\u201d (see Section 2.6.3 ) frame is also\nloaded if one exists. Next, if a guide star is present on the CCD to be\nreduced, a cross correlation reference image is generated. The main\nreduction procedure then commences.\n\nThe various steps of the reduction process are implemented as\nindependent \u201cfilters\u201d which may be switched on or off depending upon\nreduction parameters. The filters interface with a multi-threading\nlibrary (see Section 7.2.2 ) and may be parallel (in which case multiple\ninstances proceed concurrently) or serial (in which case only one\ninstance of the filter is ever in use). The significant filters are\nordered as follows:\n\n-   Frame buffering: To ensure that data input-output speeds are\n    maximised, I implemented a buffer filter. This does nothing except\n    load the compressed data from disk into memory, leaving no \u201cdead\n    time\u201d before the next data load request. This filter is serial,\n    since the disk input speed is fastest when the data is accessed in a\n    serial fashion.\n\n-   Decompression: This filter extracts the compressed data to an array\n    of floating point numbers.\n\n-   Frame crop: Optionally, the raw data may be cropped to remove bad\n    rows and columns at the edges.\n\n-   Bias drift tracking \/ uniform de-bias: If a sky background region\n    has been defined, a histogram of every frame is taken from this\n    region and used to estimate the bias pedestal of that frame. This\n    value is stored (so it may be used again in the drizzling process),\n    and then subtracted across the frame by the \u201cuniform debits filter.\n\n-   Bias gradient correction: Uses the pre-calibrated bias gradient\n    frame to flatten the bias pedestal variations across the image.\n\n-   Frame summation. Records a sum of the debiased frames.\n\n-   Histogram recording: If a background region is designated, this\n    builds a debiased frame from that region over the entire dataset.\n    This \u201ccleaned\u201d histogram may then be used to estimate the bias\n    pedestal with increased precision, estimate the electron\n    multiplication gain level, and calibrate other detector\n    characteristics.\n\n-   Cosmic ray detection and analysis filters: These are a series of\n    filters which provide consecutively more stringent, and more time\n    consuming, tests to determine whether a bright pixel is simply due\n    to a bright stellar source, or a cosmic ray. The first filter simply\n    uses a user-defined threshold to determine cosmic ray candidates.\n    The second filter examines the candidate pixel to see if it is a\n    sharp, local maxima or part of a bright region. The third detection\n    filter compares this region of the frame to the same region in the\n    previous frame, to see if the signal has increased dramatically or\n    is roughly constant. Optionally, all candidate and confirmed cosmic\n    ray pixel events may be output to file as 20x20 pixel images about\n    the candidate pixels, which the user may visually inspect.\n\n-   Cross correlation filter: Performs the frame registration procedures\n    described in chapter 4 . This is one of the most computationally\n    intensive filters, but since it is implemented in a parallel fashion\n    plenty of processing power may be applied (on a multi-core PC).\n\nFinally, the list of recorded frame information is output as a formatted\ntext file, encoding guide star locations and cross-correlation maxima,\nbias drift levels, any confirmed cosmic ray events, and the file\nlocation of each frame. A debiased and internally generated\nsignal-subtracted average frame is also output to file.\n\n#### 7.1.3 Second pass \u2014 frame thresholding and recombination\n\nThe second main pipeline program performs frame recombination, through\nuse of the drizzle algorithm. This program needs to be able to reduce\nsynchronised frames from the multiple CCDs, in order to produce a mosaic\noutput from a single bright guide star located on any of the CCDs, which\ncomplicates matters somewhat.\n\nThe initialization procedures are similar to the registration program,\nwith the addition of a frame list collation stage. A minor bug in the\ndata acquisition program (since rectified) occasionally caused the loss\nof individual frames of data from the observation, and cosmic rays in\nthe vicinity of the guide star may cause rejection of frames, so the\nprogram must be able to handle missing data. To solve this problem an\nintersection set of the frames which are present across all CCDs is\ndetermined. This section of the program also performs a\ncross-correlation analysis of the file timestamps, to ensure that the\nframe timestamps are in fact synchronised (again, minor bugs affected a\nfew datasets from the 2009 observing run).\n\nOnce the frame lists have been collated and validated, the frames are\nranked by their cross-correlation maxima, which is used as an estimator\nof frame quality. If a background region was designated for creation of\na dataset histogram, fitting procedures covered in Section 2.5.2 are\napplied to estimate the electron multiplication gain setting. The main\nprocedure then begins. The initial steps are much the same as for the\nframe registration program, except that instead of loading all frames\nsequentially, only frames meeting the user defined selection\nrequirements are loaded. Once the frames have been debiased, the\nfollowing filters are applied:\n\n-   Normalisation: If an estimate of the electron multiplication gain is\n    available, the frames are normalised so that the pixel values are in\n    units of photo-electrons per frame.\n\n-   Thresholding: Optionally, if the frames are normalised, a\n    thresholded copy of the data is created by applying a photon\n    counting threshold across the image.\n\n-   Dark signal subtraction: The pre-calibrated, normalised internal\n    signal frame is used to subtract internally generated signal from\n    the frames.\n\n-   Drizzle: Now fully calibrated, the frames can at last be realigned\n    and combined according to the drizzle algorithm. Two output images\n    are maintained, one containing weighted sums, while the other is a\n    weight map. Pixels in the region of cosmic ray events or bad columns\n    have zero weights assigned. This is the most computationally\n    intensive filter in this stage of the pipeline. To improve\n    distribution of the processing load over multiple CPU cores, if data\n    from multiple CCDs are being reduced, then a pair of drizzle output\n    images is maintained for each CCD. The drizzle output frames are\n    carefully pre-aligned to the output mosaic pixels, so that creation\n    of the output mosaic from the final images is a simple process of\n    concatenating the images.\n\nFinally, the drizzled image pairs of weighted sums and weight maps are\nused to output reduced images representing the weighted average of the\ninput pixel values. If a thresholded image was produced, an image with\ngood signal to noise across a wide range of light levels may be created\nby combining it with the linear image as described in Section 3.6 .\n\nIf multiple frame selection cut-off levels are specified, the main\nprocedure runs repeatedly until all the desired reduced images have been\ngenerated.\n\n### 7.2 Technical aspects\n\n#### 7.2.1 Data storage considerations\n\nEMCCDs by design are well suited to imaging at high frame rates and low\nlight levels, where a conventional CCD would have a readout noise level\nfar above the signal. The increasing pixel array sizes and readout rates\nare enabling application to an ever greater range of problems. As a\nresult it is feasible and sometimes desirable to build an EMCCD imaging\nsystem with extremely high data acquisition requirements. As an example,\nthe 4 CCD camera used by the Cambridge Lucky imaging group in summer\n2009 produced @xmath megapixels of data per exposure at a frame rate of\n21 Hz, or 188 MB\/sec if the data is stored naively at 16 bits per pixel.\nAs a result, the step up in computational resources required for both\nstorage and processing from conventional imaging is a large one.\nSustained data write rates of 100MB\/sec are about the limit of what can\nbe achieved with current off-the-shelf computing hardware (circa\n2009-2011), which leaves the user with 3 choices: high-end data storage\nsolutions, real-time processing, or compression.\n\nFortunately, in the case of lucky imaging the data generally lends\nitself easily to compression, enough that data storage and offline data\nprocessing was still possible for the 2009 mosaic camera. The pixel data\noutput from our camera is represented by 14 bits per pixel, representing\ninteger values from 0 to 16384. For a typical lucky imaging astronomical\nexposure the majority of these pixels do not represent photo-electron\nevents, i.e. they have a value drawn from a Gaussian distribution as\ndescribed in Section 2.4 . With typical readout noise, all but a\nnegligible proportion of these pixels are within say, 255 data numbers\nof the mean and as such only require 8 bits to encode.\n\nLaw ( 2007 ) introduced a simple compression system whereby these \u201cdark\u201d\npixels are represented by one byte, and pixels outside the offset range\n-128 to 127 were represented by 3 bytes \u2014 1 key byte followed by 2 data\nbytes. The current version of the Cambridge lucky group\u2019s data\nacquisition software takes this concept one stage further; varying\nstorage sizes at the bit, rather than byte, level. For each exposure a\nhistogram is generated and analysed. Depending upon the value range of\nthe dark pixels, the majority of the pixels in an image will then be\nrepresented by a smaller number of bits, typically 5 or 6 bits, while\npixels with high values (usually due to a photo-electron event) are\nrepresented by a key number of the same bit length as a \u201cdark\u201d pixel,\nfollowed by the full 14 data bits.\n\nThe pixel representations are then combined into a conventional stream\nof 8-bit bytes using bitwise operations. Higher compression rates could\nbe achieved by using the Rice algorithm as implemented in the CFITSIO\nlibrary (Pence et\u00a0al. 1999 ) , but any algorithm must be low enough in\ncomplexity to keep up with the data rate while allowing sufficient\nremaining CPU time to deal with all other aspects of the data\nacquisition process. This simple algorithm is relatively easy to\nimplement and optimise, and serves well in practice, though future\nsystems may require further work on this aspect.\n\n#### 7.2.2 Notes on pipeline implementation\n\nThe particular needs of a lucky imaging data reduction pipeline \u2014 high\nperformance, custom decompression, large but fairly homogeneous data\nsets \u2014 resulted in the decision to write a pipeline from scratch, rather\nthan attempt scripting via IRAF, IDL or some other high level language.\nThe code base has been written from the ground up in C++ with the goals\nof being both object orientated and easily separable into coherent\nmodules, which allows for rapid development, testing and debugging\n(indeed each section of the library on which the pipeline is built\nincludes a full suite of \u2018unit tests\u2019 (Hamill 2004 ) , which may be\ninvoked after compilation of the code to ensure that updates do not\nbreak any functionality. The code base is now quite well featured,\nincluding reusable modules for drizzling, interpolation, convolution,\ndata calibration, PSF characterisation, etc, and will hopefully be\nuseful for further astronomical image data reduction. I have summarised\na few key features of the implementation below, but the interested\nreader is referred to further notes and the source code, available at\nthe author\u2019s homepage \u00b9 \u00b9 1 www.ast.cam.ac.uk\/ @xmath ts337 .\n\nIt became apparent early in the development that a lot of code\ncomplexity arose due to the complicated interplay of different\nco-ordinate systems and indexes used for the different purposes of pixel\nindexing, describing sub-pixel locations, describing mosaic locations,\nand for dealing with pixels at different scales (e.g. when creating an\ninterpolated or drizzled image). To alleviate confusion, different C++\nclasses \u00b2 \u00b2 2 For an introduction to C++, especially classes and\ntemplates, I recommend Koenig and Moo ( 2000 ) . are used to represent\neach type of co-ordinate system \u2014 thereby causing code to throw errors\nat compile time if the wrong co-ordinate type is used for a particular\npurpose. However, since the co-ordinate systems are all functionally the\nsame, they are actually implemented using a single, template class.\n\nThe class used to represent an image carries information on its outline\nposition and pixel scale relative to some global co-ordinate system,\nthereby allowing easy conversion between different frames of reference.\nThis works rather nicely in practice, creating code that is shorter,\neasier to read and maintain, and no less efficient if coded carefully.\nIn fact, the addition of a pixel iteration class ensures pixel values\nare always accessed in the same order they are stored in memory, to\nimprove caching and hence increase performance when writing code which\nloops over pixel arrays.\n\nThese features, together with template classes representing image arrays\nand many subroutines go some way towards creating a high performance,\ncompact, shorthand language that may be used to solve data reduction\nproblems quickly and neatly, in pure C++ with few dependencies. While\nC++ certainly has drawbacks, it does match this sort of challenge well.\nThe interested reader is referred to Heinzl ( 2007 ) for further\ndiscussion on this topic.\n\nIn terms of overall efficiency, the code has been both optimised and\nmulti-threaded. Optimisation was undertaken using the C++ profiling tool\nset Valgrind (Nethercote and Seward 2007 ) to identify bottlenecks and\nmemory cache misses (and ensure no memory leaks).\n\nThe different stages of the data reduction process have been\nmulti-threaded using the open source Intel \u201cThread Building Blocks\u201d\npackage (Reinders 2007 ) . This includes a set of features for pipeline\nfunctionality which map exceedingly well to the demands of processing\nlucky imaging data, allowing for simultaneous data access and processing\nacross multiple threads with a relatively simple interface. As a result,\non our \u2018off-the-shelf\u2019 reduction workstation (running with 2 quad core\nIntel Xeon 5530 processors) the pipeline will process data as fast as it\ncan be read from the disk, typically @xmath 80MB\/sec of compressed data\n- it is therefore capable of reducing the data nearly as fast as the\ncurrent camera can produce it.\n\nSince the data reduction process is limited by data access rates, and\nthe datasets fill a considerable amount of disk space, it makes sense to\nkeep the data in compressed form. The data is most compressible in the\noriginal raw integer format, i.e. before subtraction of floating point\nbias frame pixel values. Therefore, keeping it compressed means\nreapplying the calibration process whenever the frame is loaded, for\nexample in the second pass of the reduction process when the reduced\nimage is being created. While this requires slightly more processor\ntime, the routines are well optimized and data throughput rates are\nstill the limiting factor.\n\n### 7.3 Astrometric Calibration\n\nWith any astronomical instrument, astrometric calibration is essential\nto determine the pixel scale and sky orientation of the images recorded.\nOne simple, often used method of astrometric calibration is simply to\nobserve a \u201ccalibrator binary,\u201d a pair of well separated bright stars\nwith accurately known parameters. Calibrating a mosaic camera is more\ncomplex. If any astrometric measurements are to be made across different\nsub-fields of the mosaic, then the offset between the CCD sub-fields\nmust also be carefully measured.\n\nIn order to cross-calibrate the 4 CCDs of the Cambridge lucky imaging\ncamera, we observed several crowded fields of globular cluster regions.\nThese regions give many stars across all 4 CCDs which may be used as\ncalibration points.\n\nIn theory it is possible to calibrate the relative pixel sizes and pixel\noffsets between camera sub-fields simply by observing the same field of\nstars at different offsets \u2014 certain pairs of stars are picked out,\ntheir parameters are measured across one sub-field, then the mosaic\nfield of view is shifted and the pair parameters are measured again. One\nexample of this is the Hubble Space Telescope calibration program\ndescribed in Casertano and Wiggs ( 2001 ) . However such a task is\nchallenging, requiring many observations and careful analysis.\n\nA much simpler alternative is to use a pre-existing catalogue of star\npositions, if one of sufficient accuracy exists, that provides reference\npoints for stars across the entire field of view. Then the subfields may\nbe calibrated with respect to their on-sky properties, and the inter-CCD\noffsets can be inferred.\n\nWhen looking for a way to calibrate our globular cluster fields it\nbecame apparent that no high-resolution catalogues existed. While the\nfields are full of stars that are above, for example, the USNO-B\ncatalogue faint limit, the fields were too crowded and saturated to\nprovide source resolution in the data used to create such catalogues.\nThe 2MASS catalogue (Skrutskie et\u00a0al. 2006 ) was the only source of\nreference points available. While I was able to use 2MASS data to\nproduce approximate calibrations the density of catalogue entries is\nrelatively low compared to the number of stars visible in a lucky\nimaging observation of a globular cluster field \u2014 typically ten or so\ncatalogue entries on a field of a hundred visible stars. To make matters\nworse, it was often clear that a single entry in the 2MASS catalogue was\nreally a mid-point between 2 stars unresolved in the 2MASS data. Initial\ncalibrations suggested discrepancies between calibrations as large as\nhalf an arcsecond, which is significant when each sub field is only 30\narcseconds across.\n\n#### 7.3.1 Creating an astrometric calibration catalogue from HST\narchive data\n\nIn order to obtain a high resolution astrometric catalogue, I turned to\narchival data from the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field \/ Planetary\nCamera 2. (HST WFPC2). There is an ongoing effort to catalogue this\narchival data (Casertano et\u00a0al. 2010 ) , but the default source\nextraction parameters are not optimized for crowded fields, and it was\nnecessary to create the source catalogues myself.\n\n##### HSTphot\n\nThe specialized tool of choice for performing source extraction on HST\nWFPC2 data is HSTphot (Dolphin 2000 ) . HSTphot uses a semi-analytical\npre-determined PSF model and detailed information on the WFPC2 chipset\nto analyse raw archival data. As a result HSTphot can perform source\nextraction with excellent faint limits, good source de-blending, and\nastrometric accuracies down to around 1\/100th of a pixel. After\nextensive experimentation I was able to produce source catalogues with\nexcellent depth from the WFPC2 data. However, the program is not without\nits drawbacks, requiring a rather laborious series of data reduction\nsteps to run, and lacking routines for converting pixel locations into\nsky co-ordinates. I was able to overcome these issues somewhat by\nwriting auxiliary tools in python, but the final obstacle was that of\nsaturated sources. By default HSTphot entirely rejects sources which\nhave saturated pixels at the core. This often means that the stars which\nmay be located with best accuracy in the lucky imaging data are not\nrepresented in the HSTphot catalogue, which makes it unsuitable for\nobservations taken in poor seeing or over a short time.\n\n##### S-Extractor\n\nI eventually settled upon the well known S-Extractor (Bertin and Arnouts\n1996 ) as my tool of choice for creating WFPC2 catalogue data. Initial\ntrials suggested S-Extractor would not perform well with crowded WFPC2\ndata, but further investigation of the parameters resulted in decent\nresults. Since the algorithm used by S-Extractor does not model the PSF,\nthe catalogues produced are not as photometrically deep or\nastrometrically precise as HSTphot, but it can be used to give locations\nof sufficient bright and intermediate sources with sub-pixel accuracy\nthat the astrometric calibrations should be reasonably accurate. It is\nalso simpler to run, using pre-reduced \u2018science\u2019 images rather than the\narchival raw-data. One problem was that the \u2018science image\u2019 mosaics are\nembedded in a larger blank frame with low signal regions around the\nedges due to the drizzling process. As a result, S-Extractor often\nproduces false sources in these edge regions. I wrote a Python script to\nexamine the source catalogues produced and compare them with the\n\u2018weights\u2019 image which accompanies the science image, rejecting any\nsources that lie on a region of low weight and therefore low signal to\nnoise. Sources at low signal level in the main image region were also\nrejected. Figure 7.2 depicts catalogue positions after rejection of bad\nsources.\n\n#### 7.3.2 Calibration procedure\n\nHaving created a reference catalogue, I required a method of matching\nthe images to known positions.\n\nThe first step was to extract source locations from the images. To do\nthis I wrote a short program to look for local maxima which are above a\nuser specified threshold in order to identify bright star locations,\nthen fit a Gaussian profile to 9 pixels about each bright pixel to\ndetermine a sub-pixel position and interpolated peak pixel value.\n\nSecond, I required a fitting routine to match the image catalogues to\nthe reference catalogue. There is at least one publicly available tool\nfor this task, \u201cAstromatic\u201d (Bertin 2010 ) , but it is focused on large\nsurveys and only provides calibration against pre-existing standard\ncatalogues. I resorted to implementing my own fitting routine, which\nvaried pixel scale, central pixel sky location, and orientation. Each\nfield is first calibrated approximately by eye, then the image catalogue\npositions are repeatedly converted to sky positions and compared with\nthe reference catalogue while the parameters are varied by the fitting\nalgorithm. While undoubtedly a crude solution compared to specialized\ntools such as Astromatic, this served well enough and seems to produce\ngood fits. Figure 7.3 displays the final drizzled mosaic produced using\nthe astrometric calibrations.\n\nMultiple astrometric calibrations using observations of different\ntargets, and from different observing nights, revealed discrepancies in\nthe calibrated inter-CCD spacings of up to a quarter of an arcsecond.\nHowever, since the sample size is small and the calibration procedure is\nnot yet extensively tested, it is impossible to be sure whether the\ndiscrepancies are due to real movement in the instrument, or simply\ncalibration errors.\n\n## Chapter 8 Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the specialised hardware and software required for lucky\nimaging techniques are now sufficiently mature that it should start\nbecoming less of a specialist technique, and more of a mainstream\nobserving tool, either where \u2018better than seeing\u2019 observations are\nrequired, or under favourable conditions, for diffraction-limited\nimaging at medium class telescopes.\n\nIn this dissertation I have demonstrated that, through careful\ncalibration and use of data thresholding techniques, the faint limit\nachieved in lucky imaging is comparable to conventional imaging if a\nmoderate pixel angular width is employed (Section 5.3 ). This situation\nwill improve as development of electron multiplying CCDs continues and\nlevels of noise due to clock-induced charge get lower \u2014 since 2009 the\nCambridge group have achieved just this using updated\nclock-signal-generation electronics. The concentration of stellar light\ncompared to conventional imaging should result in much better faint\nlimits under observing conditions with high sky background levels, such\nas during a full moon. Previous estimations of high image quality over a\nlarge field of view have been reconfirmed using the mosaic CCD camera,\nwith a factor of 2 improvement in full width at half maximum\ndemonstrated even at a radius of 30 arcseconds from the guide star. More\nsophisticated data reduction techniques may widen this patch size even\nfurther.\n\nI believe we are already seeing a wider interest in lucky imaging. It is\ntelling that while I was only aware of the Cambridge lucky imaging group\nwhen I began my PhD, there are now at least 2 other active\ninstrumentation groups performing binarity surveys with lucky imaging\ntechniques (Hormuth et\u00a0al. 2008b , Oscoz et\u00a0al. 2008 ) . No doubt this\nis in part due to a growing recognition of the potential of electron\nmultiplying CCDs (Daigle et\u00a0al. 2010 , Tulloch and Dhillon 2011 ) , but\nalso there is a growing awareness and understanding of how ground based\nastronomical imaging systems behave on short timescales. The\nastronomical community is now beginning to consider how we might exploit\nthat knowledge to design adaptive optics systems employing exposure\nselection shutters controlled by wavefront sensors, or fast\ntip-tilt-mirror image stabilisation (see, e.g. Keremedjiev and\nEikenberry 2011 , Gladysz et\u00a0al. 2010a , Males et\u00a0al. 2010 ; among many\nothers) .\n\nDefinitively staking out the observational programs that will benefit\nfrom lucky imaging seems to me to be a pressing project. I hope that the\nanalytical and computational models I have developed will be of some use\nin this. With mosaic EMCCD cameras providing wide fields of view and\nexcellent faint limits, at cheap cost and without moving parts,\nautomated high resolution survey programs seem like a natural target.\nDetecting and measuring gravitational microlensing events in crowded\nfields is one example of a science driver to which the technique may be\nwell suited.\n\nWhile I have developed what are hopefully robust and reusable software\ncomponents, this is likely to be an ever evolving aspect of the lucky\nimaging technique, as it is for most of astronomy. Larger mosaic\ncameras, and more complex image reduction algorithms will likely require\njudicious use of the latest computational tools such as general purpose\ngraphical processing units, to ensure that data may be processed in a\ntimely fashion.\n\nFinally, probably the most exciting aspect of lucky imaging is the\npotential of hybrid adaptive optics systems. The experimental set-up\ndescribed in Law et\u00a0al. ( 2009 ) achieved the highest resolution\nastronomical images ever obtained with direct imaging, \u00b9 \u00b9 1 As opposed\nto aperture synthesis methods. with full width at half maximum\nmeasurements as small as 42 milliarcseconds. Application of lucky\nimaging techniques behind the latest generation of adaptive optics\nsystems will push the resolution limit even further, and should enable a\nmuch improved effective isoplanatic patch size (cf. Section 6.4.2 ).\nCombined with laser guide stars or novel curvature wavefront sensors\nwhich may utilise fainter natural guide stars (Guyon 2010 ) , the sky\ncoverage of adaptive optics systems may be greatly improved.\n\nThe Hubble space telescope revealed a wealth of new science by improving\nangular resolution in astronomy. Who knows what we will find lurking at\nthe next resolution limit.","output":["Lucky imaging is a technique for high resolution astronomical imaging at\nvisible wavelengths, utilising medium sized ground based telescopes in the\n2--4m class.

More specifically the experiments at RHIC aim\nto study the state of matter, called quark-gluon plasma , which is\nbelieved to be the state of matter shortly after the Big Bang [ 1 ] .\nAnother question, that is currently investigated in earnest by nuclear\nphysicists, is if the structure of normal nuclear matter (protons and\nneutrons) breaks down under conditions of low temperature and extreme\npressure, i.e.\u00a0whether the ground state of nuclear matter consists out\nof matter other than nuclear matter. To answer this question, nuclear\nphysicists must look further afield than laboratory experiments. In\nlaboratory experiments, where either two beams of high energy particles\nare collided or high energy particles are shot onto a target, a highly\nenergetic, but short-lived state of matter is created, which is rather\nfar removed from the ground state of matter [ 3 ] . A physical system is\nin its ground state when the system is in its lowest energy\nconfiguration. The ground state is usually achieved after the system had\nsome time to equilibrate. @xmath Fe is the nucleus with the greatest\n(negative) binding energy and therefore has the lowest ground state of\nall the nuclei. Questions have been raised whether @xmath Fe is the\nultimate ground state of matter since W. Baade and E. Zwicky proposed in\n1934 that some supernovae are driven by the binding energy of a neutron\nstar [ 4 ] , i.e. that a massive star explodes due to the release of\nenergy in forming a neutron star. On average neutron stars have a mass\nof about 1.4 times the mass of our sun [ 5 ] . The gravitational binding\nenergy of a neutron star is about 10 @xmath of its mass, while the\nnuclear binding energy of @xmath Fe is about 9 MeV\/nucleon, which is\nabout 1 @xmath of the mass of a @xmath Fe nucleus [ 4 ] . Thus the\ngravitational binding energy of a neutron star consisting of @xmath Fe\nwould be about ten times larger than the nuclear binding energy. Since\nthe star is in a stable long-lived state, one can assume that the matter\nis in a state other than that of @xmath Fe. As such nature has provided\nus with a laboratory to study cold, dense matter, which we currently\ncannot synthesise in the laboratory. (By cold is meant that the thermal\nenergy of the particles is very small compared to the fermi energy and\nthus thermal excitations are assumed not to take place [ 4 , 6 ] .)\nNeutron stars are believed to be formed in the core-collapse supernovae\nof massive stars [ 4 , 7 ] . A normal star is stabilised against\ngravitational collapse by the thermal pressure due to the energy release\nof nuclear fusion processes in the star. Fusion in the core of the star\nwould proceed the fastest due to the higher pressure at the centre of\nthe star. Once these fusion processes have reached the formation of\n@xmath Fe, the last exothermic fusion phases, it will shut down and the\ncore will start to cool and contract under its own gravity [ 4 ] . As\nthe core contracts densities where electrons become relativistic will\nquite easily be reached. The energy of the core can thus be reduced by\nthe capture of electrons by the protons (inverse beta-decay), thus\nmaking the core more neutron-rich [ 7 ] . The crushing effect of gravity\nwill be halted by the short-ranged repulsion of the strong nuclear\nforce.\nMatter falling onto the core, due to the low pressure created by the\ncontracting core, would rebound off the stiffened core, creating a\nshockwave that travels outward from the centre of the star, which stalls\nafter some hundred kilometres, due to energy losses as the wave travels\nthrough the interior of the star. This stalled shockwave creates an\naccreting front as matter from the outer parts of the star collapses\ntowards the centre of the star. Through poorly understood mechanisms the\nbinding energy of the neutron star (the core of the collapsing star)\ngets transferred to the accreting shock front, which causes the rest of\nthe star to explode in a supernova. [ 4 ]\nIn 1967 Jocelyn Bell observed a pulsating radio-source in outer space\nthat had characteristics unlike any other radio-source [ 9 ] . Initially\nthe origin of these radio-pulses was unclear (little green men were not\nruled out), but eventually the source was explained to be a rapidly\nrotating neutron star, today known as a pulsar [ 10 , 11 ] . Today more\nthan 1100 pulsars, the commonly observed state of neutron stars, are\nknown [ 4 ] .\nAs with the question regarding the ultimate ground state of matter, the\nconstituents of the interior of neutron stars are also not known. As the\naverage densities of neutron stars are comparable to that of nuclei, it\nis assumed that neutron stars consist (at least in some part) of\nbaryonic matter (such as protons and neutrons) and therefore can be\nviewed as giant nuclei, but with a mass number of @xmath [ 7 ] ! The\nmain difference between nuclei and neutron stars is that while nuclei\nare bound by the nuclear strong force, neutron stars are bound by\ngravity. The fact that gravity is attractive on all scales implies that\nthe neutron star must have some form of internal pressure to counteract\nthe effect of gravity, otherwise no stable neutron stars would exists,\nonly black holes (objects that have collapsed under their own gravity).\nBaade and Zwicky envisioned that a neutron star is supported against\ngravitational collapse by the nucleon degeneracy pressure: the pressure\nthat is due to Pauli\u2019s Exclusion Principle that states that no two\nidentical particles can occupy the same energy state. Thus the pressure\nis given by particles that all want to occupy the lowest energy state,\nbut these states are filled from the bottom and once they are full\nparticles have to occupy higher lying states [ 4 ] . Due to the central\nrole of gravity, neutron stars can only be adequately described using\nthe general theory of relativity [ 4 ] . In Chapter 2 necessary concepts\nin relativity will be introduced to formulate such a description, which\nwill be derived in Chapter 3 .\nBut that would not be the full story. To be able to have such an\nadequate, relativistic description of neutron stars information\nregarding the relation between the pressure and the energy density\n(equation of state) of matter in the interior of the neutron star is\nneeded. If we assume that the neutron star consists of baryonic matter,\nmodels of nuclear matter can be used to provide the equation of state of\nthe neutron star interior [ 4 , 6 , 7 ] . Fig. 1.1 shows a schematic\npresentation of various assumptions about the interior of neutron stars\n(and as such for the ground state of matter).\n\nThese different models for the interior of the neutron star can be\ntested by comparing calculated properties, specifically the mass-radius\nrelationship fo a neutron star, to the observed values. By this process\nsuitable models (and equations of state derived from these models) can\nbe identified for the description of cold, dense matter. In general\nthese different models of nuclei and nuclear matter are complex and\ndifficult to solve exactly and therefore these models have to be\napproximated. The focus of this work will be to derive the equation of\nstate of neutron star matter from a specific model of nuclei and nuclear\nmatter, called quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), through the application of\nrelativistic mean-field theory. This will be done by making a survey of\nsome of the available literature on this subject as well as to try to\nreproduce some of the published values of certain properties of nuclear\nmatter and neutron stars. The aim of this work is to consolidate some of\nthe current knowledge in the theoretical study of neutron stars. Since\nthese theoretical studies can only be validated through good agreement\nwith observed properties of neutron stars, close co-operation between\ntheorists and astronomers are crucial in the study of neutron stars. The\nconverse is also true: to explain observational results theoretical\nmodelling is needed to predict certain observed properties. Only through\nthis interplay between theoretical and observational science can the\nunderstanding of our universe be advanced. This work therefore also aims\nto include some of the observational results to constrain the\ntheoretical calculations.\nIt is foreseen that much more will be learned about neutron stars with\nthe commission of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The SKA will be the\nworld\u2019s biggest radio-telescope, with an effective collecting area of\none square kilometre, which will make the SKA fifty times more powerful\nthan the current most powerful radio-telescope [ 12 , 13 ] . To explain\nthe observations made by the SKA knowledge of the theoretical modelling\nof neutron stars would be crucial.\n\n### 1.1 South African perspective\n\nThis work is applicable within the South African context since South\nAfrica is currently developing the meerKAT radio-telescope, formerly\nknown as the Karoo Array Telescope (KAT), and has also been shortlisted\nto host SKA [ 13 ] . It is foreseen that the meerKAT will be the largest\nradio-telescope in the world, until the SKA is commissioned, thus South\nAfrica will have a strategic advance in, amongst others, the study of\npulsars and neutron stars.\nKAT-7, a seven-dish engineering test bed, will be commissioned towards\nthe end of 2009 and it is foreseen that the full fifty-dish array will\nbe completed by 2012 [ 13 ] .\nThe development of the meerKAT could not only be of importance to\nradio-astronomers but also to nuclear physicists studying dense matter.\nThis work can be seen as one example of how nuclear physics can be\nadvanced by using data gathered from outer space.\n\n### 1.2 Conventions and notations\n\nIn this thesis the following conventions and notations will be used.\n\n#### 1.2.1 Vectors, fields and operators\n\nThree dimensional vectors will be expressed in bold font, e.g. @xmath ,\nor using Latin indices, @xmath . Four dimensional vectors will be\ndenoted by the Lorentz (Greek) indices, e.g. @xmath . In the case of the\nposition vector, @xmath , it is given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn most instances the Lorentz index in the four-vector will be\nsuppressed, after it has been initially defined with the index.\nThe explicit dependence of a field on spacetime coordinates will be\nsuppressed, especially in later chapters, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIf the field or the vector is constant it will be defined as such and\ndenoted by a subscript, usually zero e.g. @xmath .\nDerivatives with regards to contravariant, @xmath , or covariant\nvectors, @xmath , are defined as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere the properties of the metric tensor ( 2.3 ) have been used.\nThe time-derivative is sometimes expressed as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n#### 1.2.2 Natural units\n\nIn this work the notion of \u201cnatural units\u201d, where\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwill be adopted. This will be used since some equations are very\ncumbersome if all the factors of @xmath and @xmath are included. Where\nthe inclusion of @xmath or @xmath is of specific interest or meaning\nthey will still be initially included.\nThis convention has the added benefit that it establishes a simple\nrelation between mass and length scale, through the relation\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn natural units the relativistic energy-mass relationship,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nreduces to\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand the units of mass and energy are the same. Table 1.1 contains the\nconstants and conversion factors (in natural units) used in this work,\nthat are not explicitly defined elsewhere.\n\n### 1.3 Matrices\n\nThe @xmath identity matrix will be denoted by @xmath . If the value of\n@xmath is known or specific, it will be denoted by a subscript, i.e.\u00a0for\n@xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n## Chapter 2 Relativity\n\nDue to the central role that gravity plays in binding neutron stars, any\ndescription of these objects must include the effects of gravity. In\nthis work gravitational effects will be included by using a description\nthat is consistent with the special and general theories of relativity.\n\n### 2.1 Introduction\n\nOne of Albert Einstein\u2019s phenomenal achievements was to recognise that\nmass and energy are related. As such both mass and energy are\ngravitational sources and not only mass, as is implied in Newtonian\ntheory.\nSince neutron stars are large, ultra-dense objects with large\ngravitational fields and high particle energies, relativistic effects\nneed to be considered in the description of these objects. The aim of\nthis chapter is to give a brief introduction of the concepts and the\nnecessary tools in the general and special theories of relativity that\nare applied in the description of neutron stars.\n\n### 2.2 Special theory of relativity\n\nThe principle of relativity states that the same mechanical laws apply\nin any frame of reference. This principle was already clearly formulated\nby Galileo Galilei in the 1600\u2019s for classical mechanics (i.e. mechanics\ngoverned by Newton\u2019s Laws), but Albert Einstein, in the special theory\nof relativity, extended this principle to include all physical laws. [\n14 ]\nThe special theory of relativity (commonly referred to as special\nrelativity) is grounded upon two postulates [ 15 ] :\nThe postulate of relativity: That the same physical laws apply in any\ninertial (uniformly moving) frame of reference.\nThe speed of light is universal: The speed of light in a vacuum (denoted\nby @xmath ) is the same for all inertial observers, regardless of the\nmotion of the source.\nThe line element in special relativity, known as the proper time @xmath\n, is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIt is the preserved interval that defines Minkowski space. @xmath refers\nto a spacetime point and is expressed in Cartesian coordinates as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFrom the expression of the line element ( 2.1 ), the metric tensor of\nMinkowski space is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nSpecial relativity does not include any gravitational effects and\ntherefore spacetime is flat and the metric tensor ( 2.3 ) is fixed.\nFrames of reference in which the expressions of special relativity are\nvalid are called Lorentz (inertial) frames. These frames are related by\nLorentz transformations . Due to the postulate of relativity the\nphysical expression of any observable should not differ when observed\nfrom different Lorentz frames. Because any two inertial frames of\nreference are related by a Lorentz transformation it means that the\nequations describing a physical observable must be invariant under\nLorentz transformations. This property is known as covariance and if an\nequation is expressed in a covariant manner the form of the equation\ndoes not change when transformed from one Lorentz frame to another. To\nbe able to write equations in a covariant manner tensor analyses is\nused. [ 14 ]\n\n### 2.3 General theory of relativity\n\nThe special theory of relativity gives a very accurate description of\nour world within a Lorentz frame, but neglects one of the most prominent\nforces that govern the large scale behaviour in our universe, namely\ngravity. The distinction between gravity and other forces is that\ngravity acts on all matter, regardless of their internal structure or\ncomposition: Particles with wholly different physical properties will\nfollow the same free path in a gravitational field, given only that\ntheir initial velocities are the same. The general theory of relativity\n(commonly referred to as simply general relativity) expands the locally\nvery accurate special theory of relativity to a global scale, by\nincluding gravitational effects. [ 14 ]\nSpecial relativity would unfortunately not suffice if gravitational\neffects are included since no global Lorentz frame can be constructed in\na non-uniform gravitational field [ 14 ] . This is because Euclid\u2019s\nParallel Postulate holds in Minkowski space, i.e. in Minkowski space\nparallel worldlines stay parallel if extended infinitely. In a\nnon-uniform gravitational field particles do not travel along straight\nlines, but along curved trajectories: if two particles are released from\nthe same height above the earth\u2019s surface, but some distance apart, they\nwill both fall towards the centre of the earth. Their trajectories would\nbe parallel on a local scale but overall they will follow a curved path\n[ 4 ] . The spacetime on a global scale and in the presence of\ngravitational sources is one in which Euclid\u2019s Parallel Postulate does\nnot hold, i.e. a spacetime that is flat on a local scale but overall\ncurved, as described by Riemannian geometry [ 14 ] .\nThe absence of a global Lorentz frame might spell trouble for special\nrelativity: if no Lorentz frame with regards to an event can be found,\nspecial relativity will be a very interesting but unphysical theory.\nLuckily within a free-falling frame in a non-uniform gravitational field\nthe effect of the gravitational field would not be noted. Thus a\nfree-falling frame of reference would constitute a Lorentz frame with\nregards to the event. Einstein used this fact to relate the special and\ngeneral theories of relativity through the Equivalence Principle:\nThe Equivalence Principle: Physical laws that describe how the forces of\nnature behave in a gravitational field have the same (covariant) form as\nin the special theory of relativity when these laws are expressed in a\nframe of reference, free-falling with the event, in the gravitational\nfield.\nThe Equivalence Principle is analogous to the theorem in differential\ngeometry that states that a flat space tangent to the manifold can be\nimposed on any point in a differentiable manifold. The spacetime of\ngeneral relativity constitutes such a manifold and therefore a Lorentz\nframe can be imposed at any point. [ 14 ]\nTo translate from special to general relativity the metric tensor,\n@xmath , has to be replaced by the general metric, @xmath , and normal\nderivatives by covariant derivates (see Sec. 2.4 for details of @xmath\nand covariant differentiation) [ 4 ] .\n\n### 2.4 Riemannian spaces\n\nAlbert Einstein recognised the similarities between gravitational\nphysics and Riemannian spaces and used the mathematics describing these\nspaces to describe gravitational phyics.\nIn this section the main points of Riemannian spaces will be introduced.\n\n#### 2.4.1 Geodesics\n\nA line in curved space is defined as straight (i.e. the shortest\ndistance between two points) if the tangent vector to the line is\nparallel-transported [ 14 ] . These lines are known as geodesics.\nThe metric tensor of curved space is denoted by @xmath and is defined in\nterms of the natural basis vector ( @xmath ) of the space\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is a small displacement along the coordinate curve. The\nmetric tensor is given by the dot product of two basis vectors\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn Minkowski space the metric tensor ( @xmath ) is fixed and given by (\n2.3 ). In curved space the metric tensor is not necessarily constant,\nbut dependant on the geometry of the space. [ 17 ]\nGeodesics, just as straight lines in a Euclidean space, can also be\ndefined as the extreme value of the integral of the proper time interval\n( @xmath ) between the two spacetime points. The line element, the\nproper time, in general relativity is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAs is shown by N.K. Glendenning in Ref. [ 4 ] , geodesics are thus\ndescribed by the Geodesic equation,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the affine connection. It also shown in Ref. [ 4 ] that\nthe affine connection is equal to the Christoffel symbol of the second\nkind.\n\n#### 2.4.2 Christoffel symbols\n\nThe Christoffel symbol (of the second kind), @xmath , is defined in\nterms of the relation of the derivative of the natural base vector to\nthe natural base vectors as [ 17 ] ,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAs shown in Ref. [ 16 ] , the Christoffel symbols can be expressed in\nterms of the metric tensor\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand so it can be seen that the Christoffel symbols are related to the\ncurvature of the space through the change in the metric.\nThe Christoffel symbol of the first kind, @xmath , is related to the\nChristoffel symbol of the second kind through [ 4 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are symmetric in their\ncovariant (lower) components [ 17 ] , i.e.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand so the Christoffel symbols of the first kind are symmetric in the\nlast two covariant components.\n\n#### 2.4.3 Covariant derivatives\n\nThe partial derivative of a vector @xmath , with @xmath , is:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nand the covariant derivative is defined as [ 17 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe covariant derivative transforms covariantly, i.e. the covariant\nderivative of a tensor is once again a tensor [ 16 ] .\n\n#### 2.4.4 Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor\n\nThe Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor (or just curvature tensor)\ndescribes the curvature of space. It is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe curvature tensor is derived by evaluating the parallel-transport of\na tangent vector along a small closed loop on a curved surface. The\nvector field is defined on the surface and a vector ( @xmath )\nparallel-transported along the loop. Once the starting point is reached\nagain, the vector is compared to the original vector. The difference\nbetween the two vectors is proportional to the curvature and the\ncurvature tensor [ 14 ] .\nA more intuitive explanation might be given when it is considered that\nin flat spacetime the metric tensor is constant and the order of\ncovariant differentiation does not matter. But in curved spacetime the\norder of covariant differentiation is important as two successive\ncovariant differentiations do not commute, as is shown in Ref. [ 14 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere the commutator is given by the curvature tensor. The commutator is\nanalogous to computing the change in a vector along a closed path: the\nchange in the vector is first computed in one direction and then in\nanother and the changes in the reverse order is subtracted. [ 14 ]\nThe curvature tensor is zero if and only if the space is flat [ 16 ] .\n\n#### 2.4.5 Bianchi identities\n\nFrom the properties of the curvature tensor it is shown in Ref. [ 14 ]\nthat the following equation holds in any frame:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis is known as the Bianchi identities . These identities can be used\nto determine the metric tensor if the curvature is known [ 16 ] .\n\n#### 2.4.6 Ricci tensor and scalar curvature\n\nThe Ricci tensor , @xmath , is a contraction of the curvature tensor:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe Ricci tensor can also be formed by contracting indices, other than\nthe first and the third, but the symmetry of the curvature tensor\nimplies that these contractions will either vanish or at most add a\nminus sign to the Ricci tensor. The Ricci tensor is symmetric. [ 14 ]\nThe scalar curvature , @xmath , is defined as the contraction of the\nmetric tensor and the Ricci tensor [ 4 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n#### 2.4.7 Einstein tensor\n\nIf the Bianchi identity is contracted twice [ 14 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nthen the last equation can be rewritten as:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nBy defining @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nit is clear from Eq. ( 2.11 ) that it has vanishing covariant\ndivergence, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n@xmath is known as the Einstein tensor and it plays a fundamental role\nin general relativity (see Sec. 2.6 ). From the symmetry of the Ricci\nand metric tensors it is clear that the Einstein tensor is also\nsymmetric.\n\n### 2.5 Energy-momentum tensor\n\nThe energy-momentum tensor ( @xmath ) describes the internal properties\nof an energy-mass distribution (i.e. matter) and is the source of the\ncurvature of spacetime. To be able to give an accurate, covariant\ndescription of the internal properties of matter within a relativistic\nframework, not only the energy distribution, but also the distribution\nof momentum within the matter needs to be considered.\nThe energy-momentum tensor is defined in terms of the flux of the\n4-momentum across a constant surface. The element, @xmath , can be\ndescribed as the @xmath -component of the momentum flux across the\n@xmath -surface. Thus the following components can be explicitly named:\n\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n  @xmath = energy density,\n  @xmath = energy flux across the @xmath surface,\n  @xmath = @xmath momentum density,\n  @xmath = flux of the @xmath momentum across the @xmath surface.\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf we evaluate the energy-momentum tensor in a momentarily comoving\nframe of reference all elements of the matter would be momentarily\nstatic (no spatial momentum), but that would not imply that there is no\ntransfer of energy. Energy might be transferred by heat conduction and\ntherefore the @xmath terms of the energy-momentum tensor would be\nnon-zero. The @xmath components would also be non-zero for the energy\nthat is being transferred will carry momentum. The @xmath components\nwould be equal to the @xmath components since the energy flux is the\nenergy density times the speeds at which it flows. In the relativistic\nframe, mass is equal to energy so the energy flux is equal to the mass\ndensity times the speeds at which it flows, which is the density of\nmomentum.\nThe spatial components of the energy-momentum tensor ( @xmath ) are\nsymmetric. If they were not it would be imply that the elements are\nwhirling around inside the fluid, in the momentarily comoving frame of\nreference. Thus @xmath is in general symmetric and symmetry of the\ntensor in one frame of reference would imply that it is symmetric in all\nframes of reference.\nThe spatial components of the energy-momentum tensor represent the\nforces between adjacent elements in the matter: the off-diagonal spatial\nelements represent the viscosity (or any other forces that are parallel\nto the interface between elements) and the diagonal elements, the normal\nforces (i.e. the pressure). [ 14 ]\nIn general the energy-momentum tensor for static, spherically symmetric\nperfect fluid (no viscosity or heat conduction), moving with a velocity\n@xmath is [ 4 , 21 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n-   @xmath is the energy density,\n\n-   @xmath is the pressure, and,\n\n-   @xmath is the four-velocity,\n\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.15)\n                           @xmath   @xmath   \n      -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\n    and therefore @xmath [ 4 ] .\n\nThe conservation of mass and energy is expressed in terms of the\nenergy-momentum tensor by the fact that the energy-momentum tensor has\nvanishing divergence, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn general relativity Eq. ( 2.16 ) generalises to [ 16 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n### 2.6 Einstein\u2019s field equations\n\nPhysical theories are mostly categorised by defining equations, which in\nthe case of general relativity are the Einstein field equations. The\nEinstein field equations are given by solutions of the Einstein tensor.\nFor spacetime inside a distribution of mass and energy (i.e. a star),\nEinstein\u2019s field equations are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the energy-momentum tensor and @xmath is a constant that\nis determined by comparing general relativity to Newtonian mechanics in\nthe Newtonian limit [ 4 ] . The energy-momentum tensor is a symmetric,\ndivergenceless tensor that is constructed from the mass-energy\nproperties of the medium.\nThe Einstein field equations ( 2.18 ) do not only govern spacetime\nwithin a mass-energy distribution, but also the arrangement of\nmass-energy distribution as well as its dynamics. Thus spacetime is\nacted upon by a mass-energy distribution, as these are sources of\ngravity. On the other hand, spacetime influences the mass-energy\ndistribution through the curvature of spacetime. Thus spacetime and\nmatter co-determine the universe within which we live.\n\n## Chapter 3 Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations\n\nBy using the concepts defined in Chapter 2 a relativistic description\nfor a neutron star will be derived in this chapter.\n\n### 3.1 Introduction\n\nAs a first approximation a star (such as a neutron star) is assumed to\nbe a static, spherical symmetric fluid (gas) in hydrostatic equilibrium\n[ 4 ] : the star is bound by an external pressure that compresses the\nstar (gravity) while the star is stabilised against gravitational\ncollapse by the internal pressure in the star due to some repulsive\nforce.\nIf a neutron star is assumed to be a static spherical symmetric fluid in\nhydrostatic equilibrium it would have to be described by a relativistic\nequation for hydrostatic equilibrium.\nThis problem was first studied by R. C. Tolman [ 18 ] and by J. R.\nOppenheimer and G. M. Volkoff [ 19 ] in 1939. They derived an equation\nto study hydrostatic equilibrium in a relativistic environment by\ndescribing a neutron star assuming that it consists of a neutron gas at\nhigh density [ 7 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand\n\n-   @xmath is the enclosed mass of the star,\n\n-   @xmath is the energy density, and\n\n-   @xmath is the internal pressure of the star.\n\nEq. ( 3.1 ) is known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation [\n20 ] .\nThe TOV equation expresses how the pressure decreases from the centre of\nthe star to the edge (where @xmath ) in terms of the energy density and\nthe pressure. These two quantities are related through the equation of\nstate of the matter in the interior of the star. The larger the star,\nthe higher the pressure in the centre of the star will be, since it is\ngravity that compresses the star. Since the pressure appears on the\nright-hand side of Eq. ( 3.1 ), an increase in the central pressure will\nincrease the pressure gradient [the left-hand side of Eq. ( 3.1 )]. Thus\nthe more massive the star, the smaller the radius at which @xmath ,\nsince the pressure gradient is steeper. Thus there exists a critical\nvalue for the mass of the star, above which the star will collapse under\nits own gravity [ 4 ] . This critical value is known as the maximum mass\nof the star and will differ for different equations of state of the\nmatter in the neutron star interior.\n\n### 3.2 Derivation of the TOV equation\n\nThe following derivation is taken almost entirely from Ref. [ 4 ] . (The\nderivation in Ref. [ 4 ] is more elaborate and hints to perform some of\nthe calculations are also given.)\nTo derive the TOV equations from the Einstein field equation ( 2.18 ) it\nsuffices to consider a static, isotropic star. The line element for\nstatic, isotropic spacetime can be given by:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are functions that need to be determined and\n@xmath is the spacetime point described in natural units by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFrom the expression for the line element ( 3.3 ) the components of the\nmetric tensor can be read off as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4c)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4d)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.4e)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nSince @xmath , @xmath is given by @xmath (no summation over indices).\nUsing the symmetry properties of the Christoffel symbols, the components\nof the Ricci tensor in static isotropic spacetime are:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5c)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.5d)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the primed index refers to differentiation with respect to @xmath\n.\nFor the construction of the TOV equation it is easier to work with mixed\ntensors, therefore the Einstein field equations ( 2.18 ) are written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.6)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nand thus, using the properties of the Ricci tensor ( 3.5 ), the\ncomponents of the Einstein tensor become:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7c)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.7d)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nFrom ( 2.14 ) and the equivalence principle, the energy-momentum tensor\nis\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nSince the the star is static ( @xmath ) and therefore from ( 2.15 ),\n@xmath , @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFrom the equivalence principle, a comoving Lorentz frame can be defined\n\u00b9 \u00b9 1 This is a valid assumption, since the change in the metric from\nthe centre of the star to its boundary is not significant over the\nspacing between a few nucleons [ 4 ] . [The change in the metric can be\nestimated by considering the espression for @xmath ( 3.14 ).] , and\ntherefore the energy-momentum tensor can be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFrom ( 3.7a ), ( 3.6 ) and ( 3.8 )\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.9)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nand ( 3.9 ) can be solved to obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.10)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEq. ( 3.11 ) is an expression for the gravitational mass i.e. the\nmass-energy that generates a gravitational field included, up to radius\n@xmath , in the star. The relativistic expression (in natural units)\nthat is used to describe the relation between the energy density (\n@xmath ) and the mass density ( @xmath ) is:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nUsing ( 3.10 ) the following expression for ( 3.4b ) can be obtained:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor ( 3.12 ) to agree with Newtonian mechanics in the Newtonian limit,\n@xmath should be defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith @xmath the Gravitational constant [ 4 ] . Thus ( 3.12 ) becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing ( 3.13 ) and ( 3.8 ) the expression for the Einstein field\nequations ( 3.7 ), becomes:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.15a)\n     @xmath   @xmath               (3.15b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.15c)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.15d)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nBy manipulating ( 3.15a ), ( 3.15b ) and ( 3.14 ) and substituting it\ninto ( 3.15c ), the following expression for @xmath is obtained:\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (3.16)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nEq. ( 3.16 ) is the TOV equation in natural units.\n\n### 3.3 Solving the TOV equation\n\nTo obtain sensible information from the TOV equation the coupled\ndifferential equations, Eqs ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ), must be solved. To be\nable to do this the initial conditions (at @xmath ) for @xmath and\n@xmath must be known.\nSince the expression for @xmath ( 3.11 ) refers to the enclosed mass in\nthe star and @xmath refers to the centre of the star, the initial values\nfor both @xmath and @xmath are taken to be zero (or very small). The\nchoice for the initial @xmath depends on the inferred central baryon\ndensity of the neutron star.\nUsing the initial values for @xmath , @xmath and @xmath the pressure (\n@xmath ) at an incremental increase in @xmath , namely @xmath can be\ncalculated using Eq. ( 3.1 ). Using the equation of state, the\ncorresponding energy density, @xmath , can be calculated. Using ( 3.2 )\nthe value for @xmath can be obtained. This cycle is repeated until\n@xmath at which the @xmath is zero, is reached. This denotes the\nboundary of the star and @xmath is the radius of the star. @xmath is the\nmass enclosed by the radius of the star, i.e. the mass of the star.\nEach different assumption of the central density will correspond to a\nunique mass and radius relationship of the neutron star. Therefore by\nvarying the initial central density, a whole sequence of possible masses\nand radii of neutron stars, corresponding to a specific equation of\nstate, can be generated.\nAs was expounded upon at the beginning of this chapter, each neutron\nstar sequence has a maximum mass and as such each equation of state of\nthe neutron star interior implies a different maximum mass. The\nequations of state with higher maximum masses are referred as stiff,\ni.e. the pressure increases rapidly with an increase in density. The\nequations of state with lower maximum masses are referred to as softer\nequations of state [ 4 ] .\n\n## Chapter 4 Modelling dense nuclear matter\n\nThe challenge in the description of matter at high densities, such as\nthat in neutron stars, is to develop a model that not only describes\nmatter at high densities, but also the properties of matter observed at\nnormal densities. Additionally, relativistic effects become much more\npronounced in dense systems as the particles attain energies that are\ncomparable to their rest mass. Therefore it is neccesary that a\ndescription of matter at high densities must incorporate the general\nproperties of quantum mechanics, Lorentz covariance, electromagnetic\ngauge invariance and microscopic causality within a many-body system [\n21 ] . The only framework that can describe a relativistic,\nquantum-mechanical, many-body system in such a way is relativistic\nquantum field theory based on a local, Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian\ndensity [ 21 , 22 ] .\nQuantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes the interaction between quarks\nvia the exchange of gluons. This fundamental theory is an obvious\ncandidate to describe dense matter systems, but unfortunately this\ntheory has computational difficulties at such scales [ 21 ] . It is also\ncumbersome to describe nuclear phenomena in terms of quarks and gluons\nsince quark degrees of freedom are not observed in nuclear experiments\nbut, hadronic degrees of freedom. Hadrons are particles that consist of\na number of quarks and are further subdivided into baryons and mesons:\nbaryons are particles that contain three quarks (such as protons and\nneutrons), while mesons contain a quark - anti-quark pair. A description\nof the interaction between two nucleons (particles in the nucleus),\nbased on the exchange of mesons was first introduced by Hideki Yukawa in\n1935 [ 23 ] and gained much acceptance after the actual discovery of\nmesons. A complete discussion of the mesonic theory of the nucleus is\ngiven in Ref. [ 23 ] .\nA quantized field theoretical description of nuclei and nuclear matter,\ncalled quantum hadrodynamics (QHD), which is based on hadronic degrees\nof freedom was introduced by John Walecka in 1974 [ 24 ] . It should be\nnoted that QHD is not a fundamental theory, but an effective one since\nhadrons are composite particles.\nIn QHD, as in QCD, one soon runs into computational difficulties and to\nobtain solutions from the description certain approximations have to be\nmade. The coupling constants in QHD are large and thus a perturbation\nexpansion in terms of the coupling constants will not suffice. Instead\nthe system can be approximated in the relativistic mean-field. This\napproximation will be discussed in Sec. 8.3 . The saturation properties\nof nuclei and nuclear matter, that any description of dense matter\nshould reproduce, are discussed in Section 4.1 . In Chapter 5 a brief\noverview of relativistic quantum mechanics is given. This chapter is\nfollowed by a brief discussion of the necessary tools and concepts in\nclassical field theory that is used in quantum field theory in Chapter 6\n. Quantum field theory is discussed in Chapter 7 , after which QHD is\nformulated in Chapters 8 and 9 .\n\n### 4.1 Properties of symmetric nuclear matter constraining nuclear\nmodels\n\nSymmetric nuclear matter, or just nuclear matter, is an idealised system\nthat stems from one of the original models of the nucleus, the\nliquid-drop model. The properties of nuclear matter are inferred from\nthe experimentally observed properties of finite nuclei [ 4 ] , but,\nsince it cannot be directly observed, there seem to be some disagreement\nas to what the exact values of certain properties of nuclear matter are.\nIn this work the values of the properties of nuclear matter given in\nRef. [ 4 ] will be taken as the observed values.\n\n#### 4.1.1 Saturation density\n\nNuclear matter is a saturated system, due the characteristics of the\nstrong interaction. The short-ranged, strong nuclear interaction is the\ndominant interaction between nucleons. It is essentially attractive,\nwhich is necessary to form stable nuclei, but repulsive at short\ndistance ( @xmath fm). Since the strong force acts only over a short\ndistance, the interaction is limited to nearest neighbours in a dense\nsystem. Therefore at a certain density the central density of the system\nwill not increase any further, even as more nucleons are added to the\nsystem. The density at which this occurs is referred to as the\nsaturation density. At saturation density the pressure of the system is\nzero and the system will remain in this state if left undisturbed. [ 4 ]\nThe density of saturated nuclear matter given as 0.153 fm @xmath in Ref.\n[ 4 ] and 0.16 fm @xmath in Ref. [ 6 ] .\n\n#### 4.1.2 Binding energy\n\nIn general terms the binding energy of a system is the energy expended\nor required to form a system. In the case of a stable system the binding\nenergy is negative, hence energy was donated to the surrounding\nenvironment in forming the system, leaving the system at a lower energy\nstate than the sum of all the individual parts of the system.\nAt saturation density the binding energy of the system will be at a\nminimum since at this density the system is in its most stable (lowest\nenergy) state, compared to other densities. The binding energy of\nnuclear matter is given as -16.3 MeV\/nucleon in Ref. [ 4 ] and -16.0\nMeV\/nucleon in Ref. [ 6 ]\n\n#### 4.1.3 Symmetry energy\n\nStable nuclei with low proton ( @xmath ) number prefer a nearly\nequivalent neutron ( @xmath ) number. As @xmath increases the\n(repulsive) Coulomb interaction between the protons also increases.\nStable nuclei then diverge from being @xmath nuclei to nuclei with a\n@xmath larger than @xmath , as can been seen on a Segre diagram. The\ninfluence of this preference is accounted for by the symmetry energy.\nThe symmetry energy coefficient, @xmath , stems from liquid-drop model\nof the nucleus, and refers to the contribution made by the isospin\nassymetry to the energy of the nucleus [ 25 ] .\nThe symmetry energy coefficient is given by:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe value of @xmath is estimated to be between 31 and 33 MeV according\nto Ref. [ 5 ] , while Refs [ 4 ] and [ 6 ] state the value of @xmath to\nbe 32.5 MeV (without any uncertainty).\n\n#### 4.1.4 Compression modulus\n\nThe compression modulus defines the curvature of the equation of state\nat saturation [ 4 ] and is related to the high density behaviour of the\nequation of state. If the energy density rapidly increases with an\nincrease in pressure the equation of state is referred to as stiff. With\na soft equation of state the energy density increases more gradually\nwith an increase in the pressure [ 4 ] .\nThe compression modulus, @xmath , defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe value of @xmath has been estimated to 234 MeV (with some\nuncertainty) [ 4 ] . Ref. [ 6 ] state the value of @xmath to be 265 MeV.\n\n## Chapter 5 Relativistic quantum mechanics\n\nThis chapter is a very concise introduction to relativistic quantum\nmechanics, introducing only concepts necessary within the scope of this\nwork. A much more thorough discussion can be found in Refs [ 26 ] to [\n30 ] .\n\n### 5.1 Introduction\n\nRelativistic quantum mechanics is the merger of quantum mechanics and\nspecial relativity. One possible candidate for a relativistic quantum\nmechanical description could be the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation can be motivated by applying the canonical\nquantization to the non-relativistic energy-momentum relationship [ 26 ]\n,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere the physical quantities are replaced by operators, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n                 \n     @xmath      (5.1a)\n     @xmath      (5.1b)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand by letting the operators operate on the wave function @xmath , the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation is obtained:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nRelativity requires that the equations of motion in one inertial frame\nare valid in all inertial frames, meaning that all equations describing\nthe motion of a particle must transform covariantly under Lorentz\ntransformations. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation does not transform covariantly\nand therefore another approach is needed to describe relativistic\nparticles in a quantized theory [ 27 ] . An obvious candidate would be\nto apply the canonical quantization to the relativistic mass-energy\nrelationship.\n\n### 5.2 Klein-Gordon equation\n\nImposing the canonical quantization procedure to the relativistic\nenergy-momentum relationship,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nresults in the Klein-Gordon equation [ 26 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is some wave function that depends on the four-vector\n@xmath .\nThe Klein-Gordon equation can be expressed in a covariant manner as:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nSince\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ntransforms like a scalar under Lorentz transformations [ 4 ] , the wave\nfunction, @xmath , has to describe a scalar particle for Eq. ( 5.2 ) to\nbe a covariant equation. Therefore plane-wave solutions of the form\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwith @xmath the momentum four-vector and @xmath , can be solutions of\nthe free particle Klein-Gordon equation [ 26 ] .\nSubstituting this wave function into the Klein-Gordon equation ( 5.2 ),\nthe relativistic energy-momentum relation,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis obtained. As such, the possible energies are:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThus the Klein-Gordon equation allows for positive as well as negative\nenergy solutions.\nThe Klein-Gordon equation has the conserved current @xmath (i.e. @xmath\n), with @xmath , where\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nIf the time-like component of the conserved current ( @xmath ) is\ninterpreted as the probability density, the negative energy solution\nwould imply that the probability density will not be positive definite [\n28 ] .\nHistorically the possibility of negative energy solutions and the\nprobability not being positive definite led to the Klein-Gordon equation\nbeing abandoned as a physical description [ 26 ] . However, the\nKlein-Gordon equation was redeemed when a physical interpretation was\ngiven to the negative energy solutions (see Sec. 5.4 ).\n\n### 5.3 Dirac equation\n\nP. A. M. Dirac wanted to formulate an equation based on the relativistic\nenergy-momentum relationship that is linear in spatial and time\nderivatives in an effort to overcome the difficulties of the\nKlein-Gordon equation, especially the positive definiteness of the\nprobability density [ 28 ] .\nOne way to obtain the Dirac equation, using the relativistic\nenergy-momentum relationship, is by making the following substitution [\n29 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath need to be determined, but are assumed to be\nconstants, independent of spacetime and to commute with position and\nmomentum operators [ 30 ] .\nMaking the substitutions of the canonical quantization ( 5.1 ), the\nabove expression reduces to the Dirac-equation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAs is discussed in Ref. [ 27 ] the properties of the Dirac equation (\n5.4 ) can be derived by considering certain requirements: Since Eq. (\n5.4 ) must be invariant under spatial rotations, @xmath and @xmath\ncannot simply be numbers. If it is considered that the probability\ndensity, @xmath , must be the time component of a conserved four-vector\nif integrated over all space at constant time, Dirac proposed that the\nwave function must be analogous to a @xmath -component spin wave\nfunction,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe column vectors satisfying the Dirac equation are called Dirac\nspinors. Therefore @xmath and @xmath must be @xmath matrices. Since the\nDirac equation ( 5.4 ) must satisfy the relativistic energy-momentum\nrelationship, the following properties can be derived:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------\n                             \n     @xmath      @xmath      (5.6a)\n     @xmath      @xmath      (5.6b)\n  -- -------- -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince the Hamilton operator, in this case\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nmust be hermitian it implies that @xmath and @xmath must also be\nhermitian [ 30 ] . Thus @xmath and @xmath both must be traceless, even\ndimensional matrices with eigenvalues of @xmath .\nFor @xmath = 2 the conditions of ( 5.6 ) are satisfied by the\nPauli-matrices and the identity matrix, but not all these matrices are\ntraceless. Thus the lowest dimensionality that satisfies all conditions\nfor @xmath and @xmath is @xmath = 4 [ 27 , 28 ] . One representation of\nthese matrices is known is the Pauli-Dirac representation, given by :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.7b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.8a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.8b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.8c)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nare the Pauli-matrices.\nIn the non-relativistic limit the Dirac equation reduces to the Pauli\nequation describing spin- @xmath [ 27 ] . Thus the free particle\nsolutions of the Dirac equation can be found in analogy to that of a\nnon-relativistic spin- @xmath particle, where the wave functions consist\nof a two component spinor and a plane-wave function [ 26 ] . A possible\nsolution to the Dirac equation ( 5.4 ) is [ 26 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are spacetime and momentum four-vectors and\n@xmath is a four component column vector written as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwith @xmath and @xmath two component spinors.\nSolving for @xmath , Eq. ( 5.4 ) reduces to:\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\nthus obtaining coupled equations for @xmath and @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n                 \n     @xmath      (5.10a)\n     @xmath      (5.10b)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nFrom Eq. ( 5.10b ), @xmath is given by:\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\nWhen the solution for @xmath [from Eq. ( 5.10b )] is substituted into\nEq. ( 5.10a ), it can be shown that [ 26 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich implies that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nthus allowing positive and negative energy solutions to the Dirac\nequation [ 26 ] .\nTo be able to write the Dirac equation in a covariant form, the @xmath\n-matrices are defined as:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.11a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (5.11b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe properties of the @xmath -matrices in the Pauli-Dirac representation\nare derived from the properties of @xmath and @xmath ( 5.6 ) and that of\nthe Pauli-spin matrices ( 5.8 ):\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --\n\nand the adjoints of the @xmath -matrices are\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe Dirac equation ( 5.4 ) can be written in a covariant form, by\nmultiplying it from the left by @xmath , as:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEq. ( 5.13 ) will only be covariant under a Lorentz transformation,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nif the wave function, @xmath transforms as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is some matrix [ 28 ] .\nAs shown in Refs [ 27 ] and [ 28 ] , @xmath must satisfy:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nDefining the Dirac adjoint @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nit is also shown in Ref.

First P.\nA. M. Dirac put forward an interpretation of the negative energy\nsolution of the Dirac equation for fermions and then R. P. Feynman added\nanother interpretation that could be applied to fermions as well as\nbosons (scalar particles, described by the Klein-Gordon equation) [ 29 ]\n.\n\n#### 5.4.1 Dirac\u2019s interpretation\n\nThe Dirac description states that there are positive and negative energy\nstates available to a free spin- @xmath particle, such as an electron.\nThese energy levels are symmetric around the zero energy state. To\nprevent positive energy particles from spontaneously decaying to\nnegative energy states Dirac postulated that in the vacuum state all the\nnegative energy states are filled (the Dirac sea [ 26 ] ). Since all\nnegative energy states are filled, Pauli\u2019s Exclusion Principle prevents\nthe decay of a positive energy electron to a negative energy state. [ 26\n]\nAn electron occupying a negative energy state can be excited to a\npositive energy state, leaving a hole in the Dirac vacuum. Due to the\nabsence of a negatively charged electron the hole will behave as a\npositively charged particle with a positive energy with regards to the\nFermi sea, predicting the existence of a positron [ 26 ] .\nIt should be noted that due to this interpretation the Dirac equation no\nlonger describes a single particle state, but a many-particle state,\nthus necessitating a many-particle description such as quantum field\ntheory to describe relativistic particles [ 27 ] .\n\n#### 5.4.2 Feynman\u2019s interpretation\n\nR.P. Feynman interpreted the negative energy state as positive energy\nparticle propagating backwards in time or as an anti-particle\npropagating forward in time [ 29 ] .\nThe Feynman\u2019s interpretation vindicated the Klein-Gordon equation. Since\nthe Klein-Gordon equation describes bosons, which do not obey the Pauli\nExclusion Principle, the Dirac interpretation could not be applied to\nexplain the negative energy solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation.\n\n## Chapter 6 Lagrangian mechanics and field theory\n\n### 6.1 Lagrangian mechanics\n\nH. Goldstein et al. explain Lagrangian mechanics in Ref. [ 31 ] as a\ndescription of a physical system in terms of the degrees of freedom of\nthe system. Lagrangian mechanics does not contain any new physics, but\nis simply an alternative expression of the physical laws governing the\nequations of motion of objects. Since the description is in terms of the\ndegrees of freedom of the system, the formulation is not restricted to\njust describing classical particles, but can also describe discrete or\ncontinuous systems in the classical or relativistic regimes. Lagrangian\nmechanics is a desirable description since all the information\npertaining to the system is contained in one function: the Lagrangian.\nThe Lagrangian (L) is defined by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere,\n\n-   @xmath is the kinetic energy of the system and\n\n-   @xmath the potential energy of the system,\n\nand can thus be seen as an expression of the energy of a system. Each\ndegree of the @xmath degrees of freedom of the system is described by a\ngeneralised coordinate @xmath , with @xmath . The Lagrangian is given in\nterms of the generalised independent coordinates and the time-derivates\nof these, @xmath and time, @xmath .\nThe generalised momentum (conjugate momentum) of each generalised\ncoordinate is @xmath with\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe evolution of the system is governed by Hamilton\u2019s principle. It\nstates that the system will evolve over a time interval @xmath in such a\nway that the action ( @xmath ) is stationary. The action is the line\nintegral of the Lagrangian between time @xmath and time @xmath . If the\naction is stationary the variation of the action will be equal to zero,\ni.e.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe equation of motion of a specific degree of freedom described by the\ncoordinate, @xmath , is given by the Euler-Lagrange equation [ 31 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equation follows from the application of Hamilton\u2019s\nprinciple with regards to a specific coordinate [ 31 ] .\n\n### 6.2 Hamiltonian formulation\n\nThe Hamiltonian formulation is an alternative way to express Lagrangian\nmechanics. The Hamiltonian formulation has found various extension in\nphysics and is therefore also briefly discussed.\nThe essential difference between the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian\nformulation is that in the former the Lagrangian is expressed in terms\nof the generalised coordinates, the time-derivatives of the generalised\ncoordinates and time itself, ( @xmath ). In the Hamiltonian formulation\na new quantity, the Hamiltonian, @xmath , is defined and expressed in\nterms of the generalised coordinates, the conjugate momenta of the\ngeneralised coordinates and time, ( @xmath ). Thus on a mathematical\nlevel, the switch from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian formulation can\nbe seen as a Legendre transformation [ 31 ] .\nThe Hamiltonian is defined by (with the sum over @xmath implied) [ 31 ,\n32 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAnagolous to the interpretation of @xmath , @xmath can be seen as an\nexpression of the total energy of the system. If @xmath is @xmath and if\nthe momentum times the speed of each degree of freedom summed over the\nwhole system is twice the kinetic energy ( @xmath ) of the system,\n@xmath is given as @xmath [ 32 ] .\n\n### 6.3 Field theory\n\nIn Ref. [ 31 ] a field is defined as set of one or more functions of\nspace and time. These functions can be used to describe the displacement\nand velocity of points in a (continuous) system [ 32 ] . The formalism\nof previous section can be applied to describe continuous systems using\nfields, by replacing the discrete coordinates, @xmath , by fields,\n@xmath . Accordingly the fields @xmath with @xmath , describe the\ndegrees of freedom of the system.\nIn general, all the fields described in this work will be in\n4-dimensional Minkowski space [see Eq. ( 2.1 ) for the metric of this\nspace] and thus the fields will depend on spatial and time coordinates,\ni.e.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn field theory the Lagrangian would be defined in terms of the\nLagrangian density ( @xmath ):\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.3)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations can be generalised (see for instance Refs [\n31 ] and [ 32 ] ) to directly apply to the Lagrangian density, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor the field @xmath the conjugate momentum of ( 6.1 ) is defined as\n@xmath [ 31 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe Hamiltonian is defined as:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (6.6)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nand thus the Hamiltonian density @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n### 6.4 Noether\u2019s theorem\n\nNoether\u2019s theorem describes the relation between the invariance of the\nLagrangian density under certain transformations and conserved\nquantities (currents).\nThe transformation could be a coordinate transformation,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nor a field transformation,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (6.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe theorem states that\n\n-   if the space is flat, and,\n\n-   if the coordinate\/field transformation is continuous and the\n    transformation can be written in terms of the coordinates as\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (6.10)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    and in terms of the fields as\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (6.11)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    where the functions @xmath and @xmath depend on the coordinate\/field\n    variables and @xmath is an infinitesimal parameter ( @xmath runs\n    from @xmath ), and,\n\n-   if the Lagrangian density is form- and scale invariant under these\n    transformations,\n\nthen the following will hold [ 31 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (6.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nso that there are @xmath conserved currents of the form:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nForm invariance of the Lagrangian density under a transformation implies\nthat\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nso that the effect of the transformation on the Lagrangian density would\nbe\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nScale invariance implies that the magnitude of the action integral is\nalso assumed to be invariant under the transformation, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nA proof of Noether\u2019s theorem is given in amongst other Refs [ 31 ] and [\n35 ] .\n\n#### 6.4.1 Energy-momentum tensor as conserved quantity\n\nA typical symmetry of the Lagrangian density is translational\ninvariance. This means that the Lagrangian density describing the system\nis independent of the spatial and temporal origin of the system. With\nNoether\u2019s theorem one can show that translational invariance imply that\nthe energy-momentum tensor is a conserved quantity (also see Sec. 2.5 )\n[ 4 , 31 , 35 ] .\nConsider the following spacetime translation\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is an arbitrary constant and @xmath as in ( 6.10 ). Since\nthe Lagrangian density (and therefore the fields) are translational\ninvariant, the coordinate change would have no effect on the fields and\n@xmath of Eq. ( 6.9 ) would be zero and therefore also @xmath of Eq. (\n6.11 ).\nFrom Noether\u2019s theorem ( 6.12 ) it therefore follows that\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nSince @xmath is arbitrary, it follows that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand so the energy-momentum tensor, @xmath , is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (6.13)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nIn Chapters 8 and 9 the fields, @xmath , that will be considered will\nactually be field operators. Therefore the (ground state) expectation\nvalue have to be taken [ 21 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nif a static, spherical symmetric fluid, moving with velocity is consider\n[from Eq. ( 2.14 )].

The first being that field theory is a many-body description\nin which various degrees of freedom are handled with ease. The\nLagrangian density is a Lorentz scalar and therefore invariant under any\nLorentz boosts or rotations. Since the extreme value of the action is\ntherefore also invariant, the Euler-Lagrange equation gives rise to\nLorentz invariant equations of motion of the fields contained in the\nLagrangian. A many-particle theory is also necessary in order to\npreserve causality as is shown in Ref. [ 33 ] .\nThe quantization procedure is very similar to that of normal quantum\nmechanics, except that in this case it is not the particles that are\nquantized, but fields describing the particles.\n\n### 7.1 Quantization of a field\n\nFor the quantization of the fields, @xmath , the field and the conjugate\nfields, @xmath , are promoted to field operators, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n                 \n     @xmath      (7.1a)\n     @xmath      (7.1b)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese operators are Heisenberg operators and the following equal-time\ncommutation relationship are imposed [ 34 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n                 \n     @xmath      (7.2a)\n     @xmath      (7.2b)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese commutation relations are imposed to ensure that the correct spin\nstatistics are satisfied [ 33 ] .\nSince the field operators are time-dependent their dynamics are\ndetermined by Heisenberg\u2019s equation of motion [ 35 ] . Heisenberg\u2019s\nequation of motion states that for an operator @xmath the time-evolution\nof the operator is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the Hamiltonian ( 6.6 ).\nThe field operators are defined in the space defined by the state\nvectors of the particles described by the field. To obtain an explicit\nexpression of these operators they are Fourier decomposed in terms of a\ncomplete set of wave functions in the space [ 35 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n                 \n     @xmath      (7.4a)\n     @xmath      (7.4b)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe operator properties and the time-dependence of @xmath are carried by\nthe expansion coefficients, @xmath [ 35 ] .\n\n### 7.2 Relativistic Scalar fields\n\nFrom Chapter 5 , relativistic, spin-0 (scalar) particles are described\nby the Klein-Gordon equation. The Lagrangian density that describes a\nreal scalar field, @xmath , with particles of mass @xmath , is (in\nnatural units) [ 35 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThe equation of motion of the field is derived by applying the\nEuler-Lagrange equation ( 6.4 ), and is\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe conjugate field to @xmath is defined analogous to the conjugate\nmomentum of a classical field ( 6.5 ) by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand the Hamiltonian density ( 6.7 ) is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\n#### 7.2.1 Quantization\n\nIn canonical field quantization the following substitutions are made\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand the operators have to satisfy the following equal-time commutation\nrelationships :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.7a)\n     @xmath   @xmath               (7.7b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is shown in Ref. [ 35 ] that the scalar field has to satisfy the\nabove commutation relations, otherwise the principle of microcausality\nwill be violated.\nThe Hamiltonian of the quantized field is simply found to be [ 35 ]\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.8)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\n#### 7.2.2 Expansion of operators\n\nThe equation of motion of @xmath follows from Heisenberg\u2019s equation (\n7.3 ) (keeping in mind that @xmath ),\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (7.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhich is just the free Klein-Gordon equation ( 5.2 ). Expanding the\noperator in terms of the plane wave basis for the operator space, the\nwave function in Fourier decomposition of the operator ( 7.4 ) becomes\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is just a normalisation constant. Thus @xmath can be\nwritten as [ 35 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSubstituting the above equation back into Eq. ( 7.9 ), it is found, as\nshown in Ref. [ 35 ] , that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich means that solutions for @xmath are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand @xmath and @xmath are constants in time [ 35 ] . Since the original\n@xmath was a real-valued classical function, the operator should be\nhermitian ( @xmath ), and therefore one of the operators can be\nexpressed in terms of the other as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThus the free particle solution for the quantized scalar field ( 7.10 )\nbecomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand the conjugate field operator, @xmath , as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAs is shown in Ref. [ 35 ] , by substituting the expressions for the\nfield operator ( 7.12 ) and the conjugate field operator ( 7.13 ) back\ninto the commutation relations ( 7.7 ) the commutation relations for\n@xmath and @xmath can be obtained and are\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.14a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (7.14b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nThus @xmath and @xmath satisfy the commutation relationship for creation\nand annihilation operators for scalar particles (bosons) [ 33 ] . Scalar\nparticles are described by symmetric states. The states that the field\noperators will operate on are clearly symmetric from the above\ncommutation relationships, since for an arbitrary state @xmath\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe Hamiltonian is constructed from Eq. ( 7.8 ), by replacing the field\noperators by their expansions [Eqs ( 7.12 ) and ( 7.13 )]. After some\nalgebra (as is shown in Ref. [ 35 ] ) the Hamiltonian is expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.15)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nIf the above Hamiltonian operates on any state, even the vacuum, it will\nhave infinite energy, due to the contribution of the last term in Eq. (\n7.15 ). This contribution is attributed to the filled negative energy\nstates that defines the vacuum [ 35 ] . To remove this constant\ncontribution, Hamiltonian is defined to contain the normal-ordered\nproduct of the operators. Normal-ordering entails that all creation\noperators have to stand on the left and all the annihilation operators\non the right [when operators are switched around the commutation\nrelationships ( 7.14 ) have to be taken into account]. The Hamiltonian,\nas the normal-ordered product of the field operators, is:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\n### 7.3 Dirac fields\n\nTo describe a field of Dirac (spin- @xmath ) particles the ansatz is\nthat the Lagrangian density for the field is given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath and the conjugate field @xmath [see ( 7.17 )] are classical\nfields describing the Dirac particles with mass @xmath .

Thus @xmath for @xmath and @xmath for\n@xmath . @xmath are the Dirac spinors and from Ref.

The only contribution of the negative\nenergy states that should be considered is if an negative energy\nparticle has been excited to a positive energy state, leaving a hole in\nthe vacuum. To have a sensible interpretation of the Hamiltonian the\ncontribution of the vacuum has to be removed, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (7.25)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nFor Eq. ( 7.25 ) to be expressed as a product of normal-ordered\noperators, @xmath with ( @xmath ) are the annihilation operators for\nparticles and @xmath with ( @xmath ) are the annihilation operators for\nantiparticles (holes). Similarly @xmath with ( @xmath ) are the creation\noperators for particles and @xmath with ( @xmath ) are the creation\noperators for antiparticles. To more easily distinguish between\noperators for particles and antiparticles, the spinors are renamed as:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nand the operators as:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the spin projections. The expression for the field\noperators therefore changes to (from Ref. [ 35 ] )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n### 7.4 Vector boson fields\n\nVector bosons are spin-1 particles and the commonly known ones are the\nmassless photon and the massive @xmath and @xmath bosons [ 35 ] . The\n@xmath - and @xmath -mesons are also spin-1 particles [ 21 ] .\nThe quantization of the fields describing the massive @xmath - and\n@xmath -mesons are of particular interest in this work, since these\nmesons are included in the description of nuclear matter studied in\nChapters 8 and 9 . The quantization of massive vector boson is to a\nlarge extent based on the quantization of the photon, a massless vector\nboson, and therefore the quantization of the photon field will be\ndiscussed first.\nAs is explained by Greiner et al. in Ref. [ 35 ] the vector boson fields\nseem to be overdetermined since one would usually expect four degrees of\nfreedom to be associated with a vector field (that of a scalar\ncomponent, longitudinal and two transversal polarization directions).\nPhotons, being massless, have only two observed degrees of freedom (two\ntransversal polarization states), while massive vector bosons\nadditionally also have a longitudinal polarization state. This reduction\nof the degrees of freedom has to be taken into account when quantizing\nthe theory by imposing additional constraints on the field operators [\n35 ] .\n\n#### 7.4.1 Photon field\n\nThe electromagnetic interaction between particles via the exchange of\nphotons is described by Maxwell\u2019s equations. (For a complete description\nof the electromagnetic interaction see for instance Introduction to\nElectrodynamics by D. J. Griffiths [ 15 ] .) Maxwell\u2019s equations can be\nexpressed in a covariant manner by defining the field-strength tensor\n(or field tensor), @xmath ,\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\nas\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n                 \n     @xmath      (7.28a)\n     @xmath      (7.28b)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere @xmath is the electromagnetic four-current density.\nIn terms of the electromagnetic vector potential, @xmath , the field\ntensor can be expressed as [ 35 ]\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nEq. ( 7.28a ) then leads to a second-order wave equation and field\nequation for @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfrom which it can be seen (by taking the four-divergence) that the\nelectromagnetic current is conserved, i.e. @xmath .\nSince the addition of any scalar function @xmath to @xmath in the form\nof\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nleaves @xmath invariant and thus also the field equation ( 7.29 ). Since\nEq. ( 7.30 ) describes a local gauge transformation, @xmath is therefore\ngauge invariant [ 35 ] .\nThe property of gauge invariance leads to technical complications in the\ntheory [ 35 ] and an additional constraint (\u201cgauge\u201d) needs to be imposed\non the field to remedy the situation (in this case by reducing the\ndegrees of freedom of the field) [ 34 ] . There are various different\nconditions that can be imposed on the photon field, one of which is the\nLorenz condition,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nBy demanding that the Lorenz condition is satisfied, is known as the\nLorenz gauge. (This condition is mostly misattributed to H. A. Lorentz [\n36 ] .)\nThe photon field equation ( 7.29 ) can be derived from the following\nLagrangian density [ 34 ] ,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand the conjugate field to the photon field is therefore\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 7.4.2 Quantization\n\nThe photon field is quantized by considering the field and the conjugate\nfield as field operators and imposing the equal-time commutation\nrelationships [ 35 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n                 \n     @xmath      (7.33a)\n     @xmath      (7.33b)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere @xmath is the metric as defined in ( 2.3 ).\nUsing the expression for the conjugate photon field ( 7.32 ), Eq. (\n7.33a ) becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe commutator of the divergence of the field operator, @xmath , and the\nfield operator can be evaluated, using Eqs ( 7.33 ) and ( 7.34 ), and\nyields\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nFrom the above it can be seen that @xmath and thus the canonical\nquantization procedure and the Lorenz gauge are not compatible [ 35 ] .\nIf the Lorenz gauge is not imposed \u201cscalar\u201d photons can be created that\narbitrarily add energy to the system. Since only transversal photons are\nobserved, another constraint has to be imposed to be able to quantize\nthe photon field. In the Gupta-Bleuler method only the state vectors in\nthe Hilbert space, @xmath , that satisfy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nare admitted. By imposing condition ( 7.35 ) on the states in the\nHilbert space the photon field can be quantized by demanding that the\nphoton field operators satisfy the conditions given in ( 7.33 ). [ 35 ]\n\n#### 7.4.3 Massive vector bosons\n\nA massive neutral vector bosons (spin-1) field, @xmath , is described by\nthe Lagrangian density [ 35 ] ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is once again the field tensor,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand @xmath the current density.\nUsing the Euler-Lagrange equation ( 6.4 ), the equation of motion of the\nfield is calculated to be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is the Proca equation [ 34 ] .\nBy taking the four-divergence of the Proca equation, one finds that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIf one assumes that there are no sources, i.e. @xmath , or that the\nsource current is conserved, i.e. @xmath , the above condition on the\nfield reduces to\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich is the Lorenz condition ( 7.31 ). Thus the Proca equation for\nmassive vector bosons automatically satisfies the Lorenz condition under\nthe assumptions mentioned and simplifies to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe conjugate field ( 7.6 ) is derived from the Lagrangian density (\n7.36 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince @xmath has no diagonal elements, @xmath would be zero and @xmath .\nBecause the Proca equation automatically satisfies the Lorenz condition\nthe time-component of the conjugate field is a dependent variable. This\nis to be excepted since by automatically satisfying the Lorenz condition\nthe Proca equation only has three degrees of freedom [ 35 ] . As a\ndependent variable the time-component of field is given in terms of the\ndegrees of freedom ( @xmath ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (7.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 7.4.4 Quantization\n\nThe canonical quantization of the massive vector field is achieved by\nimposing the following commutation relationships:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n                 \n     @xmath      (7.41a)\n     @xmath      (7.41b)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nIt may seem that the quantization of the field might not be covariant,\nsince it is only expressed in terms of the spatial components of the\nfield operators. According to W. Greiner et al. a covariant quantization\ncan be achieved by defining the time component of the field operator to\nbe [ 35 ] :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFrom ( 7.41 ) this operator satifies the following commutation\nrelationships\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --\n\n## Chapter 8 Quantum hadrodynamics\n\n### 8.1 Introduction\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 4 , J. D. Walecka introduced a description of\nnuclei and nuclear matter based on the exchange of mesons in 1974. This\ndescription will be referred to as quantum hadrodynamics or QHD.\nSince nuclei and nuclear matter are complex systems, there exist various\nmodels of nuclei and nuclear matter of which QHD is one. All models need\nsome form of experimental input to constrain the model. In the case of\nQHD it is the coupling constants (or coupling strengths) between the\ndifferent meson and nucleon fields that are the unknown parameters.\nThese couplings are determined by fitting the calculated properties of\nnuclei and nuclear matter (such as the properties that were described in\nSec. 4.1 ) to the experimentally observed (or inferred) values. In the\nlast few decades various other parameter sets for QHD have been\ncalculated by different authors by fitting various other observed\nproperties of nuclei and\/or nuclear matter. These different parameter\nsets differ amongst one another since they might include other meson\nfields and\/or different couplings between the various fields and\/or\nrecalculated values of the couplings constants.\nIn Sec. 8.2 the basic philosophy and calculations will be introduced\nwithin the context of the original parameter set, QHD-I, as introduced\nby J. D. Walecka [ 24 , 21 ] .\nIn Chapter 9 other parameter sets and variations based on QHD-I will be\ndiscussed.\n\n### 8.2 Formalism\n\nQuantum hadrodynamics I (QHD-I), also known as the @xmath - @xmath\nmodel, is the original and simplest parameter set of QHD. It models the\nnuclear force by the exchange of neutral (isoscalar) scalar sigma (\n@xmath ) mesons and neutral (isoscalar) vector omega ( @xmath ) mesons.\nThese mesons have been found to be the most important in describing the\nproperties of nuclei and nuclear matter [ 25 ] . The baryons included in\nQHD-1 are protons and neutrons. The scalar meson gives rise to a strong\nattractive central force and a spin-orbit force in the nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction, while the vector meson gives rise to a strong repulsive\ncentral force and a spin-orbit force (with the same sign as the\nspin-orbit force of the scalar meson) [ 23 ] . Thus the nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction is described by three fields, the baryon-, scalar meson- and\nvector meson-fields. No charged mesons are included in this parameter\nset (i.e. the electric properties of the baryons are not considered) and\nthe masses of the proton and neutron are taken to be equal in QHD-I.\nThe Lagrangian density of QHD-I (in natural units) is given by [ 21 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nwhere\n\n-   @xmath denotes the vector meson field,\n\n-   @xmath denotes the scalar meson field,\n\n-   @xmath and @xmath the different meson masses and @xmath denotes the\n    nucleon mass,\n\n-   @xmath and @xmath are the vector and scalar coupling constants and\n\n-   @xmath .\n\nThe Lagrangian density is a Lorentz scalar and has the dimension of\nlength @xmath .\nIn constructing the Lagrangian density it was assumed that the neutral\nscalar mesons couple to the scalar density of the baryon field and that\nthe neutral vector mesons couple to the conserved baryon current [ 21 ]\n.\nUsing the Euler-Lagrange equation ( 6.4 ) the equations of motion of the\ndifferent fields can be derived:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.1a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.1b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.1c)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nEq.\u2009( 8.1a ) is analogous to the equation of motion of the free scalar\nfield, the Klein-Gordon equation ( 7.5 ), with the baryon scalar\ndensity, @xmath , as the source term.\nEq.\u2009( 8.1b ) is analogous to the Proca equation ( 7.38 ), with the\ncoupling of the vector field to the conserved baryon current as the\nsource term.\nThe equation of motion of the baryon field is the Dirac equation ( 7.16\n) with modified mass (due to the scalar field) and interaction with the\nvector field introduced in a minimal fashion [ 21 ] .\nSince the equations of motion ( 8.1 ) are non-linear, coupled equations\nthey are very difficult to solve and are therefore approximated. The\napproximation that will be used is the relativistic mean-field\napproximation .\n\n### 8.3 Relativistic mean-field theory\n\nIn other quantized theories, such as QCD, a perturbation expansion in\nthe coupling strengths can be used to approximate complicated equations.\nWithin the framework of QHD the coupling strengths are large and thus\nthe higher-order terms in a perturbative approximation will diverge.\nWithin the context of the study of dense nuclear systems an\napproximation that is increasingly valid as the density increases, is\nalso preferred. In the relativistic mean-field approximation (RMF)\nwithin QHD, the meson field operators are replaced by their ground state\n( @xmath ) expectation values, which are classical fields, in the\nfollowing way [ 21 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n                 \n                 (8.2a)\n     @xmath      (8.2b)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe mean-field approximation ( 8.2 ) can be motivated if a system of\n@xmath baryons (which are at rest and at zero temperature), occupying a\nbox of volume @xmath is considered. Since the system is static, the\nbaryon flux, given by @xmath , will be zero [ 22 ] . If the baryon\ndensity, @xmath , is increased the source terms on the right-hand side\nof Eqs ( 8.1a ) and ( 8.1b ) will become large. If the source terms are\nlarge enough the meson field operators can be approximated by their\nground state expectation values, instead of evaluating the operators at\nevery spacetime point in the box. For a stationary, uniform system\n@xmath and @xmath will be constants, independent of space and time. The\nspatial components of @xmath will vanish, since, as mentioned above, the\nbaryon flux is zero and the system is at rest. Another illustration for\nthe vanishing spatial components of @xmath is given in Ref. [ 4 ] .\nIn the mean-field approximation the meson field operators are replaced\nby their ground state expectation values in order to simply the solution\nto the field equations. However, the nucleon field operators remain\noperators. Since only the ground state expectation values of the meson\nfield operators are considered in the approximation it follows that the\nbaryon operators (the baryon sources to which the meson fields couple)\nmust be evaluated by operating on the ground state. As such these baryon\noperators in the equations of motion of the meson fields ( 8.1 ) are\nreplaced by their normal-ordered ground state expectation values [ 37 ]\n:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.3a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.3b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the spatial components vanished due to the consideration of the\nground state. The normal-ordered expectation value is taken since the\ncontribution of the filled negative energy baryon states (the vacuum) is\nignored, since the vacuum has a (infinite!) constant energy. Thus only\nthe positive energy baryon states are considered. This is known as the\nno-sea approximation [ 42 ] .\nSince @xmath and @xmath are constants in the RMF approximation the\nequations of motion of the fields ( 8.1 ) reduce to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.4a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.4b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.4c)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe RMF QHD-I Lagrangian density is:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFrom the above Lagrangian density the RMF energy-momentum tensor of\nQHD-I can be constructed using the definition of the energy-momentum\ntensor ( 6.13 ) as well as keeping Eq. ( 8.1c ) in mind, and is given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe energy density and the pressure, using ( 6.14 ) for QHD-1 is [ 21 ]\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n                                         \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.5a)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.5b)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\n### 8.4 Evaluation of expectation values\n\nSince @xmath and @xmath (the baryon field operators) are still\noperators, their expectation values have to be calculated to obtain\nsensible information for, amongst others, the energy density and the\npressure. As mentioned previously, it is the ground state expectation\nvalues of the baryon field operators that have to be evaluated.\nThese expectation values can be evaluated by constructing an explicit\nexpression for @xmath . For the RMF approximation a uniform static\nsystem is assumed, so @xmath is expanded in terms of the momentum\neigenstates [ 21 ] . The momentum eigenstates are denoted by @xmath ,\nwhich is the wave vector. The wave vector is related to the momentum (\n@xmath ) through the expression of the de Broglie wavelength [ 38 ] ,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn natural units the momentum and the wave vector are equivalent.\nSolutions for the field operator are thus of the form [analogous to the\nfree single-particle solution for a Dirac particle ( 7.20 )],\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the four component Dirac spinor ( @xmath denotes the\nspin index) and @xmath the energy associated with specific state denote\nby @xmath [ 21 ] . Substituting Eq. ( 8.6 ) into Eq. ( 8.4c ) yields\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nBy multiplying the above equation by @xmath , it reduces to (having\nreverted back to the notation of the @xmath - and @xmath -matrices)\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere\n\n-   @xmath is the reduced nucleon mass, defined as\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (8.8)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe presence of the scalar meson field thus shifts the mass of the\nnucleons [ 21 ] .\nSquaring both sides and keeping the properties of the @xmath - and\n@xmath -matrices ( 5.6 ) in mind one finds that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (8.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFrom Eq. ( 8.9 ) is it clear that positive and negative energy\nsolutions, which are symmetric around @xmath , are still found. Defining\npositive and negative energy spinors @xmath and @xmath that in general\nsatisfy the same orthogonality and completeness properties as in ( 7.21\n), as well as the following normalisation condition [ 21 ]\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nthe general solution for the baryon field operator ( 8.4c ) can be\nwritten as [ 21 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the particle and anti-particle creation and annihilation have been\nincluded (using the same notation as in Sec. 7.3 ).\nThe ground state @xmath is defined by @xmath , called the\nFermi-wavenumber: @xmath denotes the filled positive energy baryon\nmomentum state below which all positive energy states are also filled.\nThe ground state in the the no-sea approximation has the following\nproperties:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------- --\n     @xmath      @xmath   \n     @xmath      @xmath   \n     @xmath      @xmath   \n  -- -------- -- -------- --\n\nThe expectation value in the expression for the RMF value of @xmath (\n8.4b ) can be evaluated by using the construction of @xmath ( 8.10 ) and\ntaking the normal-ordered expectation value, as in Eq. ( 8.3 ). In\nnormal-ordering the expression the following should be kept in mind: The\nanti-commutation relationship of @xmath and @xmath , which is the same\nas the creation and annihilation operators of the general Dirac field\ngiven in Sec. 7.3 , as well as the properties of the ground state. Then\nit can be shown that, after some algebra, @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.11)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the nucleon spin-degeneracy of the state. From ( 8.11 )\nit is clear that @xmath is the nucleon (baryon) number density at @xmath\n, which will be denoted by @xmath .\nFrom ( 8.5 ) the expressions for the energy density and the pressure for\nQHD-1 in the RMF approximation become\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.12a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.12b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe expectation values in ( 8.12 ) can be evaluated in the same way as\nthe one in Eq.\u2009( 8.11 ). After some algebra [using in particular the\nproperties of the spinors ( 8.7 ) as well as Eq.\u2009( 8.9 )], the\nexpectation values in the expressions for the energy density and the\npressure reduce to:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.13a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.13b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe remaining expectation value, that of @xmath in the equation of\nmotion of the scalar meson field ( 8.4a ), can be evaluated in this\nexplicit manner, but was not done in this work. Rather other\nconsiderations (as explained in Ref. [ 21 ] ) will be employed to yield\nthe expectation value (see below and Sec. 8.6 ).\nAnother method to evaluate the expectation values is given by N. K.\nGlendenning in Ref. [ 4 ] . It states that the expectation value of an\noperator ( @xmath ) in the ground state can be given in terms of the\nexpectation value of the single-particle state,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere\n\n-   @xmath denotes the momentum, and,\n\n-   @xmath the spin of the single-particle state.\n\nThe expectation value in the many-nucleon system is then [ 4 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n-   @xmath is the positive single-particle energies ( 8.9 ), since only\n    the ground state is considered,\n\n-   @xmath is the chemical potential\/Fermi energy ( single-particle\n    energy @xmath ) , and ,\n\n-   @xmath is a step function with\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\nAll the possibilities for @xmath will in general appear in the Dirac\nHamiltonian [ 4 ] . The Dirac Hamiltonian @xmath can be constructed from\nthe equation of motion of the nucleon field ( 8.4c ) and the expression\nof @xmath ( 8.6 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTaking the single-particle expectation value of @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.16)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere @xmath (this can be seen from the expression for @xmath and the\nnormalisation of the spinors). Taking the derivative of the left-hand\nside of Eq. ( 8.16 ) with respect to any variable, @xmath , yields\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.17)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nas @xmath is an eigenfunction of @xmath , the second term on the right\nvanishes [ 4 ] . Thus Eq. ( 8.17 ) [considering Eq. ( 8.16 )] yields\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.18)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nAny expectation value can therefore be obtained by using the general\nexpression ( 8.14 ): taking the derivative of @xmath for the appropriate\nchoice of @xmath to yield @xmath and obtaining the expression for the\nsingle particle expectation value of @xmath from Eq. ( 8.18 ).\nUsing this method the same results are obtained as with the first\nmethod, just with much less effort. The expectation value in the\nexpression for the energy density ( 8.12a ), when @xmath operated on\n@xmath ( 8.6 ), using Eqs ( 8.7 ) and ( 8.9 ), is:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nand using the value of the single-particle expectation value of @xmath (\n8.16 ), the expectation value in the energy density yields\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath            \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThe expectation value in the expression for the pressure ( 8.12b ) is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath            \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nand the single-particle expectation value of the operator @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nand using the general expression for the expectation value ( 8.14 )\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.19)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nA result for @xmath can also be obtained in this manner: taking @xmath\n(the nucleon mass) as @xmath , the single-particle expectation value is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nUsing the general expression for the expectation value ( 8.14 ) and the\nabove result, @xmath yields\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (8.20)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\n### 8.5 QHD-I parameter set\n\nThe values of the particle masses used in this work for QHD-1 was taken\nfrom Ref. [ 22 ] and are listed in Table 8.1 .\n\nThe values for the coupling constants used in this work for QHD-1 were\ntaken from Ref. [ 22 ] (these values are preferred to those given in\nRef. [ 21 ] , as those in Ref. [ 22 ] give a better description of the\nsaturation properties of nuclear matter). The couplings constants are\ngiven in terms of @xmath and @xmath , which are defined as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn Table 8.2 the values for @xmath and @xmath and the corresponding\nvalues for @xmath and @xmath , using the values of the particle masses\nin Table 8.1 , are given.\n\n### 8.6 Equation of state\n\nUsing the results for the expectation values obtained in Sec. 8.4 , the\nRMF equations of motion for the fields ( 8.4 ) reduce to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.21a)\n     @xmath   @xmath               (8.21b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhile the energy density and pressure, from ( 8.5 ) and using Eq. (\n8.21b ) to simplify the expression for the energy density, are\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n                 \n     @xmath      (8.22a)\n     @xmath      (8.22b)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe expression for @xmath could have also been obtained from the\nthermodynamic argument that a closed, isolated system such as the one\nassumed for the RMF approximation will minimise its energy. Therefore an\nexpression for @xmath (and therefore @xmath ) can be obtained by\nminimising the energy density ( 8.22a ) with regards to @xmath . In this\nway the expression for @xmath is obtained,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich is equivalent to Eq. ( 8.21a ) when the definition for @xmath (\n8.8 ) is considered.\nImposing spherical symmetry, the energy density ( 8.22a ) and the\npressure ( 8.22b ) can be re-written as:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.24a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (8.24b)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\n### 8.7 Observables of nuclear matter in QHD-I\n\n#### 8.7.1 Symmetry energy\n\nTo calculate the symmetry coefficient, @xmath , given by ( 4.1 )\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nthe energy density must be expressed in terms of @xmath . This can be\ndone by considering the expressions for the proton ( @xmath ), neutron (\n@xmath ) and baryon ( @xmath ) number densities. These are given in\nterms of the different fermi momenta ( @xmath for the protons and @xmath\nfor the neutrons) of the species as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nIn the case of symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath ) the proton and\nneutron fermi momenta are equal, @xmath = @xmath = @xmath , and the\nbaryon density reduces to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (8.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe only terms in the energy density ( 8.24a ) that will contribute to\n@xmath are the integrals over the filled baryon states.

This chapter will\nserve as the foundation for the derivation of the equation of state of\nnuclear and neutron star matter in other, more advanced QHD parameter\nsets. These parameter sets will be discussed in the next chapter.\n\n## Chapter 9 Advanced QHD parameter sets\n\n### 9.1 Introduction\n\nThe coupling constants of QHD-I were fitted to reproduce the saturation\nof nuclear matter at a fermi wavenumber of 1.30 fm @xmath and binding\nenergy of -15.75 MeV [ 22 ] . Unfortunately this parameterisation\nproduces too high a value of the nuclear matter compressibility ( @xmath\n). In 1977 J. Boguta and A. R. Bodmer proposed that self-couplings of\nthe scalar meson field should be included in the Lagrangian density and\nthe coupling constants re-adjusted to reproduce @xmath more accurately [\n39 ] . These self-couplings of the scalar meson field are included in\nall other QHD parameter sets studied in this work.\nAnother addition is the inclusion of the charged (isovector) vector rho\nmeson triplet ( @xmath , @xmath ) in all parameter sets discussed below.\nSince protons and neutrons practically only differ in terms of their\nisospin projections, the rho mesons are included to distinguish between\nthese baryons and to give a better account of the symmetry energy [ 4 ]\n. (As these vector meson are charged, the reaction between a rho meson\nand a proton will differ from the reaction between a rho meson and a\nneutron.)\nThe rho mesons are introduced in a similar fashion as the other mesons\nin QHD: the free Lagrangian density describing the vector field is\nincluded in the QHD Lagrangian density as well as a coupling between the\nrho meson and the conserved isospin density [ 4 , 21 ] .\nThe NL-SH parameter set is \u201can expansion of the ideas of Boguta and\nBodmer\u201d [ 40 ] and was formulated to reproduce the neutron radii of\nneutron-rich nuclei more accurately. This was to be achieved by fitting\nthe coupling constants to reproduce the experimentally observed values\nof the root-mean-square neutron radii of neutron-rich nuclei [ 40 ] .\nIn 1994 Y. Sugahara and H. Toki introduced a self-coupling in the omega\nmeson field to the Lagrangian density and formulated the TM1 and TM2\nparameter sets. This was done to obtain better agreement with other\nmodels for nuclei and nuclear matter. The parameters were fitted to\nobtain agreement with the observed properties of unstable nuclei [ 41 ]\n. The TM1 parameter set is obtained when the fitting procedure is done\nto obtain agreement with light unstable nuclei and the TM2 parameter set\nfor heavy unstable nuclei.\nAccording to Ref. [ 42 ] the NL3 parameter set was formulated by G. A.\nLalazissis et al. to (amongst others) further improve the predicted\nvalue of the compressibility, @xmath . The NL3 parameter set is based on\nthe QHD-I Lagrangian density with the inclusion of rho mesons and\nself-couplings of the scalar field. This parameter set aimed to achieve\na better description of nuclei with large isospin asymmetry, i.e. nuclei\nfar from the valley of beta stability. The parameters were calculated by\nfitting the predicted values of various properties (such as binding\nenergies, charge radii, and neutron radii of spherical nuclei) to the\nobserved values of nuclei that has a large isospin asymmetry [ 42 ] .\nAs a further refinement to the TM1 parameter set, the PK1 parameter set\nwas obtained by fitting properties (such as binding energies and charge\nradii) of a wide range of heavy nuclei. This was done to, amongst\nothers, better reproduce the nuclear symmetry energy and compressibility\n[ 43 ] .\nB. Todd-Rutel and J. Piekarewicz introduced a coupling between the omega\nmeson field and the rho meson field in an attempt to better describe the\ndensity dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy without changing the\nsaturation properties of nuclear matter [ 44 ] . The FSUGold parameter\nset was obtained by fitting the binding energies and charge radii of a\nvariety of magic nuclei to the calculated properties.\n\n#### 9.1.1 Photon field\n\nIn general the photon (Coulomb) field is included in all the models\nmentioned above when studying the properties of finite nuclei. In this\nwork the properties of infinite nuclear matter, specifically those which\nare applicable to the study of neutron star matter, will be studied.\nSince the Coulomb forces are much stronger than the gravitational forces\non the nuclear scale, neutron stars are assumed to be charge neutral [ 4\n] , and therefore the contribution of the photon field is ignored in\nthis treatment of nuclear matter.\n\n### 9.2 Lagrangian density\n\nThe most general Lagrangian density, that describes the QHD-I, NL-SH,\nNL3, FSUGold, PK1, TM1 and TM2 parameter sets in QHD, is [ 37 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.1)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nwhere the field tensors have been defined as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --\n\nwith\n\n-   @xmath the isodoublet baryon field (only protons and neutrons are\n    considered in this work),\n\n-   @xmath the sigma (scalar) meson field,\n\n-   @xmath the omega (vector) meson field,\n\n-   @xmath is the Lorentz vector field denoting the three isospin\n    components of the rho meson fields,\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n    The charged rho meson fields ( @xmath ) can be constructed in terms\n    of the first two components of @xmath as [ 4 ]\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (9.3)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\n    and,\n\n-   @xmath the isospin operator. This operator is described in terms of\n    the Pauli 2 @xmath 2 spin-matrices ( 5.8 ) as\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n    It should be noted that since the nucleon field, @xmath is an\n    isodoublet and therefore\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n    where is the @xmath is the proton field and @xmath is the neutron\n    field, each consisting of the 4 @xmath 1 Dirac spinors, that the\n    total dimension of @xmath is 8 @xmath 1. Therefore @xmath is in\n    actual fact given by\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (9.4)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\n    and therefore the explicit expression for @xmath , using explicit\n    representation of @xmath ( 5.8c ), is\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (9.5)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\nUsing the Euler-Lagrange equation ( 6.4 ) the equations of motion of the\ndifferent fields are:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.6a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.6b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.6c)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.6d)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n### 9.3 Conventions\n\nIn the literature two different conventions for expressing the\nLagrangian density of QHD are used. These differences are obvious when\nthe Lagrangian density and the values of the coupling constants of the\nNL3 parameter set in Ref. [ 44 ] are compared to those in Ref. [ 42 ] .\nThe way in which the Lagrangian density ( 9.1 ) is expressed will be\nreferred to as the Walecka convention, which is used in the original\nformulation of QHD by J. D. Walecka (see Ref. [ 21 ] ). The other\nconvention of expressing the Lagrangian density is mainly used by\nauthors from Europe and the Orient. This formulation will be referred to\nas the Ring convention.\nThe differences are:\n\n1.  In the Walecka convention the scalar field @xmath is explicitly\n    positive, where as in the Ring convention it is negative.\n\n2.  The first four components in the nucleon field, @xmath , of the\n    Walecka convention refer to the proton field and the last four to\n    neutron field, whereas in the Ring convention the first four\n    components of the nucleon field refer to the neutron field and the\n    last four to the proton field.\n\n3.  In the Walecka convention the coupling between the rho-field, @xmath\n    and the isospin density, @xmath has an explicit factor of a half and\n    in the Ring convention this factor is implied.\n\nIn this work the Walecka convention will be used. The expressions in the\nRing convention will be given for certain properties, but will be\nidentified as such. Both conventions are included in this work, because\nthe different QHD parameter sets were studied in the specific context\nthat they were defined in. It should also be noted that while certain\nterms will be present in one convention it might not be present in the\nother. This is due to the fact that different parameter sets include\ndifferent couplings and as such certain couplings might only be used in\nparameter sets studied by authors using a specific convention.\nIt should also be noted that the coupling constants are defined\nseparately for each convention.\nThe differences between the two conventions are contrasted in Table 9.1\n.\n\n#### 9.3.1 Note on @xmath\n\nThe reduced mass ( 8.8 ),\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (9.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nis only defined in terms of the generic baryon mass, @xmath . The\nbaryons considered in this work are protons and neutrons and their\nmasses are usually taken to be equal (939 MeV). However, the PK1\nparameter set distinguishes between the proton and the neutron mass (see\nTable 9.5 ). This distinction should be taken (and is taken into account\nin this work) when calculating @xmath in the PK1 parameter set, but it\nis not explicitly shown in the expressions for @xmath .\n\n### 9.4 Relativistic mean-field theory\n\nAs in Chapter 8 the equations of motion for the different fields are\nsolved in the relativistic mean-field approximation, which assumes that\nthe ground state of a uniform, static, spherical symmetric system is\ndescribed and therefore the meson fields can be replaced their\nexpectation values [ 37 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThe spatial components of @xmath and @xmath vanish due to the\nconsideration of a uniform, static ground state (as was explained in\nChapter 8 ). The ground state is also assumed to have definite spin and\nparity. Since the first two components of @xmath can be written in terms\nof raising and lowering operators of the charged rho meson fields ( 9.3\n), only the third component (that describes the neutral rho meson,\n@xmath ) has a non-vanishing expectation value in the RMF approximation\n[ 4 ] .\nCorrespondingly the baryon sources in the equations of motion are\nreplaced by their normal-order expectation values in the RMF grondstate,\n@xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nIn the RMF approximation, the equations of motion of the fields ( 9.6 )\nreduce to:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath               (9.8a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.8b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.8c)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.8d)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the Ring convention \u00b2 \u00b2 2 The coupling between the rho- and the omega\nmeson fields, @xmath , is not included in any of the parameter sets\nstudied within the Ring convention. the equations of motion are given\nby:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n                                   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.9a)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.9b)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.9c)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.9d)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nIn the RMF approximation the Lagrangian density ( 9.1 ) reduces to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath                     (9.10)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nUsing the RMF Lagrangian density and ( 6.14 ) [keeping Eq.

Glendenning in Ref. [ 4 ] ,\nwhich is explained in Sec. 8.4 .\nThe calculation is essentially the same as in Sec. 8.4 , with the only\ndifference being that the expression for the Dirac Hamiltonian, @xmath ,\nand the positive single-particle energies ( @xmath ) are slightly\ndifferent. In this case, @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (9.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and the expansion for @xmath is taken to be as in ( 8.6 ),\nwith only the value for @xmath changing.\nUsing the above it can be established that the expression of @xmath will\nnot change from that in Chapter 8 , except in this case the contribution\nof the baryons are evaluated separately (each baryon has 2 spin states,\nand @xmath and @xmath denote the fermi momenta of the different\nspecies),\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.15)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe same applies to the expression for @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (9.16)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nTo evaluate @xmath , a slightly different approach will be used. Since\nthe baryon field can be expanded in terms of the different baryon\ncomponents (in this case protons and neutrons), each described by a four\ncomponent Dirac spinor, @xmath can be written as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n@xmath is given by Eq. ( 9.5 ) and therefore the effect of the operation\nof @xmath will be to separate the contribution of the baryons into a\npositive (proton) and negative (neutron) parts.

By examining the equations of motion of the different meson\nfields ( 9.20 ), it is clear that the scalar meson field is isospin\nindependent. The omega meson field has an implied isospin dependence\nthrough the @xmath -coupling to the rho meson field (which is explicitly\nisospin dependent). Thus the only explicitly isospin dependent part of\nthe energy density, defined as @xmath , is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n                                \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nFrom the equation of motion of the rho meson field ( 9.20c ), @xmath can\nbe written in terms of @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThe expression for @xmath then becomes\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (9.24)\n                                @xmath   \n                                         \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThus the defining equation for the symmetry energy coefficient Eq.

Having approximately the same\ndensity as atomic nuclei but being about @xmath times larger, these\nobjects have to be approached in a manner different from \u201cnormal\u201d\nmatter. If the densities of neutron stars are considered, one can\nconclude that neutron stars could consist, in some part, of normal\nnuclear matter (protons and neutrons). Thus an oversimplified\ndescription of a neutron star is that of a giant nucleus with mass\nnumber of @xmath [ 4 ] . As mentioned in Chapter 1 , the difference\nbetween a neutron star and a normal nucleus is that where the nucleus is\nbound by the nuclear strong force, the neutron star is bound by gravity.\nThus the description of a neutron star must be anchored in general\nrelativity to account for the gravitational effect of not only the mass,\nbut also the energy of this ultra-dense object. Using the principles of\nthe special and general theories of relativity the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation describing a static, spherical\nsymmetric neutron star was derived in Chapter 3 . To solve the TOV\nequation, the relationship between the energy density and the pressure\n(equation of state) in the interior of the star must be known.\nThe neutron star must also be charge neutral: while the gravitational\nforces are very strong on the large scale, a nett charge would result in\nvery disruptive Coulomb-forces in the neutron star [ 4 ] .\nThe focus in this chapter will be on deriving the equation of state for\nmatter in the neutron star interior by considering various physical\neffects, such as beta-equilibrium as well as the contribution of the\nneutron star crust.\n\n### 10.2 Crustal effects\n\nThe crust of a neutron star is usually divided into the inner and the\nouter crust. The outer crust ranges from the density where atomic nuclei\nbecome fully ionised, at about @xmath g\/cm @xmath ( @xmath MeV\/fm @xmath\n), up to the density at which the nucleus becomes so neutron-rich that\nneutrons start to drip from the nucleus ( \u201cthe neutron drip line\u201d) [ 45\n] .\nThe inner crust covers the density range from the neutron drip line up\nto the density (denoted by @xmath ) at which nuclei cease to exist and\nnuclear matter undergoes a phase transition to a uniform liquid [ 46 ] .\n\n#### 10.2.1 Outer crust\n\nThe BPS equation of state is commonly used to describe the outer crust\nof neutron stars. This equation of state was first described by G. Baym,\nC. Pethick and P. Sutherland in 1971 [ 46 ] . The departure point of the\nBPS equation of state is that the nuclei in the crust of a neutron star\nare arranged in a body-centred cubic (bcc) lattice immersed in a sea of\nfree electrons, and that the energy of the system can be lowered by the\ncapture of energetic electrons by protons (inverse beta decay) [ 46 ] .\nThe beta-decay of neutrons in the outer crust is (at this point) blocked\nby the filled electron states [ 46 ] . The lattice contributes to lower\nthe energy of the system by minimising the Coulomb interaction energy of\nthe nuclei [ 45 ] .\n\nAt a specific pressure the nucleus that minimises the chemical\npotential, @xmath , of the system is deemed the equilibrium nucleus. The\npressure range spanned by the outer crust is therefore defined by a\nsequence of equilibrium nuclei. Each equilibrium nucleus defines a\ncertain pressure range which is characterised by the maximum mass\n(energy) density, @xmath , at which the nucleus can be deemed the\nequilibrium nucleus. At any given pressure in the outer crust the\nproperties of the equilibrium nucleus (either gathered from experimental\ndata or from some theoretical model of the nucleus) together with the\nenergy of the electrons determine the energy density. Since the pressure\nin the neutron star crust increases as a smooth function of depth, each\ntransition from one equilibrium nucleus to another, will be accompanied\nby a discontinuity in the energy density [ 46 ] . This can be clearly\nseen in Fig. 10.1 where the BPS equations of state represented by the\nsequence of equilibrium nuclei in Tables 10.1 and 10.2 , have been\nplotted.\nThe BPS equation of state is described in detail in Refs [ 45 ] and [ 46\n] , and can be summarised as follows: the pressure, P, is given, for an\nequilibrium nucleus characterised by A (mass number) and Z (proton\nnumber), by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (10.1)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n-   @xmath is the number density of nuclei, related to the baryon number\n    density ( @xmath ) by\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n-   @xmath is the contribution from the free electrons with fermi\n    momentum ( @xmath ) and mass ( @xmath )\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n-   @xmath is the lattice energy per nucleus\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n    where @xmath is the charge of an electron and @xmath is given for a\n    bcc lattice by,\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\nThe energy density ( @xmath ) is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (10.2)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere\n\n-   @xmath is the total energy of an isolated nucleus, and,\n\n-   @xmath the total electron energy density given by\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (10.3)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe equilibrium nucleus is determined by the @xmath , @xmath\nconfiguration that minimizes the chemical potential, @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe sequence of equilibrium nuclei used in the original BPS paper is\nshown in Table 10.1 , where the properties of the equilibrium nuclei\nwere calculated in Ref. [ 45 ] , using the nuclear data set that was\nused in the original BPS paper (Ref. [ 46 ] , which was published in\n1971, and used nuclear data from the 1960\u2019s). Since experimental\ntechniques have undergone some improvement since the 1960\u2019s, the\nsequence of equilibrium nuclei between mass (energy) densities of @xmath\ng\/cm @xmath ( @xmath MeV\/fm @xmath ) and @xmath g\/cm @xmath ( @xmath\nMeV\/fm @xmath ) can be determined from experimental data [ 45 ] . The\nsequence of equilibrium nuclei in Table 10.2 was calculated in Ref. [ 45\n] using modern experimental nuclear data and nuclear models. The upper\npart of the table was determined from experimental data (compiled by G.\nAudi et al. ), while the lower part was calculated using a modern\nrelativistic nuclear field theory model by L.S. Geng et al. called TMA\n(see Ref. [ 45 ] and references therein).\nThe BPS equation of state can be determined from either Table 10.1 or\nTable 10.2 . It can be done by either interpolating the energy density\nat a given pressure, or at a specific pressure (and hence equilibrium\nnucleus) the contribution of the electrons to the pressure can be\ndetermined from Eq. ( 10.1 ) and the fermi momenta of the electrons (\n@xmath ) obtained. If @xmath is known, @xmath can be determined from Eq.\n( 10.3 ). Using the value of @xmath and the properties of the\nequilibrium nuclei, the energy density can then be obtained from Eq. (\n10.2 ).\n\n#### 10.2.2 Inner crust\n\nThe BBP equation of state (by G. Baym, H. A. Bethe and C. J. Pethick [\n47 ] ) assumes that at densities above the neutron drip line, up to\n@xmath , nuclear matter consists of a lattice of nuclei immersed in a\ngas of free neutrons. The equation of state is calculated by matching\nthe pressure and the energy density of the lattice nuclei to that of a\nfree neutron gas [ 47 ] . The equation of state is given in Table 10.4\n(at the end of the chapter).\nThe value of the density at which the inner crust becomes a uniform\nliquid ( @xmath ) depends on the model (and parameter set) used to\ndescribe the matter of the neutron star crust and interior. J. Carriere\net al. calculated the value of @xmath for different QHD parameter sets\nin Ref. [ 48 ] . In Ref. [ 48 ] the authors used the relativistic\nrandom-phase approximation to analyse if and when a system consisting of\nprotons, neutrons and electron would undergo a second-order phase\ntransition. For the inner crust they assumed a polytropic equation of\nstate,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (10.4)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are constants that are determined so that the\nabove equation of state matches the equation of state for the outer\ncrust (pressure and energy density) at the neutron drip line as well as\nthe equation of state of the liquid interior at @xmath .\n\n### 10.3 Equilibrium conditions\n\nFree neutrons are not stable particles and have a half-life of about 10\nminutes [ 49 ] . The neutron will decay into a proton, electron and an\nantineutrino (beta-decay):\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nTherefore free neutrons in the neutron star will undergo beta-decay\ncreating a proton and neutron. Since a neutron stars exists for a period\nlonger than the half-life of a neutron, a significant number of neutrons\nin the star will undergo beta-decay. Since a neutron star consists of a\nhuge amount of neutrons, the number of electrons (resulting from the\nbeta-decay of neutrons) present in the star will also be quite\nsignificant. Due to the densities of the electrons, some electrons will\nattain relativistic energies, making the inverse process (capture of a\nelectron by a proton to form a neutron) energetically favourable, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe two decay processes mentioned above represent two competing\nprocesses and since the neutron star has a lifetime that is long\ncompared to the timescale of these decay processes, the matter in the\nstar has time to reach beta-equilibrium. The beta-equilibrated state is\nthe state where, for a fixed baryon number density ( @xmath ), the\nproton and neutron number densities ( @xmath and @xmath ) are such that\nthe energy density ( @xmath ) of the system is at a minimum. From Ref. [\n4 ] , the condition for beta-equilibrium can be expressed in terms of\nthe chemical potential (Fermi energy), @xmath .

Muons have the same charge as an electron, but a mass of\n105.7 MeV [ 50 ] . In this work it is assumed that muon states will be\npopulated once the electrons reach energies comparable to the mass of\nthe muon.

Both\nthe original sequence of nuclei (of Table 10.1 ) and modern calculations\nof the sequence of nuclei using the TMA model (as in Table 10.2 ) are\nused. The difference between the resulting equations of state is shown\nin Fig. 10.1 . When the values of Table 10.1 are used for the sequence\nof equilibrium nuclei, it will be denoted by BPS. When those of Table\n10.2 are used, it will be denoted by TMA.\nFor the equation of state of the inner crust the BBP equation of state\nwas initially used, but since only the energy density or the pressure\ncan be matched at @xmath the equation of state has a rather large\ndiscontinuity, as can be seen in Fig. 10.2 . As such the BBP equation of\nstate was not used in further calculations presented in this work.\nRather the polytropic equation of state ( 10.4 ) for the inner crust is\nused, since the values of @xmath and @xmath can be calculated to the\nequation of state of the liquid interior at @xmath . Due to time\nconstraints, the calculation of @xmath for the different QHD parameter\nsets was not repeated. Rather the published values for @xmath , where\navailable, were used. For the parameter sets for which values of @xmath\nare not available, the value of the pressure at @xmath was estimated to\nbe @xmath dyne\/cm @xmath ( @xmath MeV\/fm @xmath ). This pressure is\nsimply the average pressure, corresponding to the published values for\n@xmath , in the specific parameter sets. The published values for @xmath\n, together with the corresponding pressures, are listed in Table 10.3 .\nWhen crustal effects are included, the equation of state of the liquid\ninterior of the star is given by the energy density and the pressure\nderived for the QHD description of the neutron star interior ( 10.11 ).\nThe equation of state of the neutron star interior, when crustal effects\nare included, can therefore be summarised as\n\n  -- -- -- ---------\n           (10.12)\n  -- -- -- ---------\n\n### 10.5 Neutron star constraints\n\nAs with any investigation into natural phenomena, experimental and\nobservational inputs are crucial to the development of the description\nof a physical system. In the case of neutron stars these inputs could\nstem from experiments or astrophysical observations. Recently a testing\nscheme based on various different constraints derived from heavy-ion\ncollisions and astrophysical observations has been proposed by T. Kl\n@xmath hn et al. [ 51 ] . In this section the constraints proposed in\nRef. [ 51 ] and other publications, applicable to the scope of this\nwork, will be discussed.\n\n#### 10.5.1 General theory of relativity\n\nFrom the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation ( 3.1 ) it is implied that\nthe radius of the star ( @xmath ) cannot be smaller or equal to @xmath .\nIf this condition is not obeyed, the change in the pressure is infinite\nor increases as one moves from the centre of the star to the boundary.\n@xmath defines a massive object\u2019s Schwarzschild radius and if the radius\nof the object lies within its Schwarzschild radius, i.e.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nthen the object has collapsed under its gravity and is a black hole [ 4\n] .\n\n#### 10.5.2 Observational constraints\n\nThe mass of a neutron star in a binary system can be quite accurately\nmeasured [ 5 ] and the mass of various neutron stars have been\ndetermined. The list of known masses of neutron stars is given in Fig.\n10.3 .\nThe known neutron star masses cover a narrow range, between about 1.4\nand 1.5 @xmath (solar mass). This narrow mass range may be due to\nspecial circumstances that govern the evolution of binaries, but no\nthorough explanation has been put forward to date [ 5 ] . The heaviest\nknown neutron star is PSR J0751+1807 with a mass of @xmath [ 52 ] . The\nreproduction of this mass by any model for the neutron star interior\n(equation of state) has been hailed as a very important constraint in\ndetermining whether certain models for the neutron star interior are\napplicable or not [ 51 ] . J. M. Lattimer and M. Prakash have however\nwarned in Ref. [ 5 ] that caution should be exercised before the\ncurrently known heavy neutron stars are taken as firm evidence that such\nheavy neutron stars exists, due to uncertainties in the measurements.\nTo determine the radius of a neutron star is much more difficult than\nthe mass and there are large uncertainties in the measurements [ 3 ] .\nTo date, the only neutron star whose mass and radius has been determined\nis EXO 0748-676 [ 53 ] . A. R. Villarreal and T. E. Strohmayer\nestablished that the mass of EXO 0748-676 must lie between 1.5 and 2.3\n@xmath while the radius could lie between 9.5 and 15 km [ 54 ] . F.\n@xmath zel determined the lower limits of the mass and radius of EXO\n0748-676 to be @xmath and @xmath km [ 53 ] .\nThese considerations are used in this work to evaluate different\nequations of state for the neutron star interior.\n\n### 10.6 Summary\n\nIn this chapter a description of a neutron star was presented, based on\ncertain assumptions about the crust of the neutron star as well as\nequilibrium conditions in the interior of the star.\nThe equation of state of neutron star matter was also derived.\n\n## Chapter 11 Results and discussion\n\nThe results in this chapter were generated by writing a computer program\nto solve the applicable equations in the FORTRAN90 programming language.\nA description of the programs as well as the actual equations that were\nused in the computations, are given in Appendix A .\n\n### 11.1 Properties of saturated nuclear matter\n\nThe properties of saturated nuclear matter were calculated using the\ndifferent parameter sets discussed in Chapters 8 and 9 (QHD-I, NL-SH,\nTM1, TM2, NL3, PK1 and FSUGold). The calculated values are compared to\nthe published ones for the different parameter sets. The results are\nlisted in Tables 11.1 , 11.2 and 11.3 . The properties of saturated\nnuclear matter calculated in this work shows good agreement with the\npublished values.\n\nTo determine the accuracy with which the FORTRAN90 program calculates\nthe properties of saturated nuclear matter, these properties were also\ncalculated using the NL-SH, TM1 and TM2 parameter sets. However, from\nthis point onwards only the QHD-I, NL3, PK1 and FSUGold parameter sets\nwill be considered.\nThe binding energies around the saturation density (at a fermi momentum\nof 1.30 fm @xmath ) of the QHD-I, NL3, PK1 and FSUGold parameter sets\nare shown in Fig. 11.1 . From this plot it is clear that the different\nparameters sets have very different high density behaviour. All the\nparameter sets give almost exactly the same values for the binding\nenergies below saturation, but above saturation the values diverge. (The\nQHD1 parameter set was fitted to reproduce a binding energy at\nsaturation of -15.75 MeV and therefore its description differs slightly\nfrom that given by the other parameter sets [ 22 ] .) These\ndiscrepancies in the description of the binding energy at high densities\nemphasise that more information about dense matter is needed to better\nconstrain the descriptions of nuclear matter.\n\n### 11.2 Neutron star properties\n\nIn this work the NL3, PK1 and FSUGold parameter sets will be used to\ncompare different calculated neutron star properties. The FSUGold\nparameter set will be the default.\n\n#### 11.2.1 Inclusion of different particles\n\nAs a first approximation the neutron star can be considered to be\nexclusively composed out of neutrons. This satisfies the condition of\ncharge neutrality, but not the condition of beta-equilibrium, as\nexpounded upon in Chapter 10 . By including the effects of\nbeta-equilibrium the maximum mass of the neutron star sequence is\nreduced, i.e. the equation of state is softened. As was explained in\nSec. 4.1.4 , a hard equation of state is when the energy density\nincreases rapidly with an increase in pressure and a soft equation of\nstate is when the increase in the energy density is more gradual. The\nequation of state is softened by the inclusion of different particles in\nthe description of neutron star matter, because if it becomes\nenergetically favourable to populate the states of, for example muons,\nthe lowest energy muon states will be populated first, instead of the\nelectron states, thereby reducing the increase in the energy density as\nthe pressure increases. Fig. 11.2 is an illustration of the softening of\nthe equation of state by the inclusion of additional particles to the\ndescription of neutron star matter. If the neutron star is further\nconsidered to not only be in beta-equilibrium, but in general\nequilibrium as well (thus also including muons, instead of just protons,\nneutrons and electrons), the maximum mass of a particular sequence is\nfurther reduced.\n\nTable 11.4 lists the maximum masses of a pure neutron neutron star, one\nin beta-equilibrium and a neutron star in general equilibrium, for\ndifferent parameter sets. Fig. 11.3 shows the effect of the softening of\nthe equation of state on the mass-radius relationship (equation of state\ndescribed by the FSUGold parameter set).\n\n#### 11.2.2 Crustal effects\n\nThe inclusion of crustal effects does not affect the mass of the neutron\nstar, when compared to the case where crustal effects have not been\nincluded. However, the radii of neutron stars are in general larger when\ncrustal effects are considered.\nThe reason that the inclusion of crustal effects do not influence the\nmass of the neutron star is that it does not affect the central pressure\nin the neutron star. The central pressure corresponds to the amount of\noverlying mass. The effect of the inclusion of crustal effects is rather\nto lower the pressure gradient near the boundary of the star, thereby\nenlarging the radius of the star. Fig. 11.4 shows the neutron star\nmass-radius sequence, for an equation of state based on the FSUGold\nparameter set, where different descriptions for the outer crust (TMA and\nBPS), as well as the polytropic equation of state for the inner crust\nhave been included. Fig. 11.5 shows the plot of the neutron star mass\nagainst the central density of this calculation.\n\n#### 11.2.3 Observational constraints\n\nAs argued in Section 10.5.2 observational evidence and theoretical\nconstraints have to be taken into account to determine the appropriate\ndescriptions of the neutron star interior. Fig. 11.6 shows the plot of\nmass-radius sequences corresponding to different equations of state.\nFrom Fig. 11.6 it can be seen that the NL3 and PK1 parameter sets\nprovide a description which is in good agreement with current\nobservational data, while the FSUGold description may seem to be too\nsoft, if the maximum masses of each sequence (as given in Table 11.5 )\nare considered.\nJ. Piekarewicz has pointed out these apparent deficiencies of the\nFSUGold parameter set in Ref. [ 55 ] , but also stated that it would be\nrather naive to only consider neutron star constraints to determine the\nequations of state of dense matter. The difference between NL3 and PK1\nparameter sets, is that the PK1 set includes an additional self-coupling\nin the omega meson field ( @xmath ). Comparing the PK1 and FSUGold\nparameter sets, it will be seen that the FSUGold parameter set contains\na further coupling between the two vector boson fields ( @xmath and\n@xmath ), @xmath , which was introduced to soften the symmetry at high\ndensity [ 44 ] . However, the density dependence of the symmetry energy\nis currently unknown, so @xmath could not yet be firmly constrained [ 55\n] . However, the Parity Radius Experiment (PREX) aims to accurately\nmeasure the neutron radius of @xmath Pb, which would provide an accurate\ndetermination of the density dependence of the symmetry energy [ 3 ] .\nPREX will be conducted at Jefferson Laboratories in the United States\nand is currently scheduled for February 2009 [ 56 ] .\n\n## Chapter 12 Conclusions\n\nIn this work the equations of state of neutron star matter were derived\nusing the quantum hadrodynamics model of nuclei and nuclear matter by\nthe application of the relativisitc mean-field approximation for the\nNL3, PK1 and FSUGold parameter sets. It was also shown (as was done in\nsimilar works, such as Refs [ 48 , 55 ] and [ 57 ] ) that these derived\nequations of state can be applied to calculate the mass-radius\nrelationship of a neutron star and that these calculated values show\ngood agreement with current observational data. However, further\nmeasurements of the properties of nuclear matter as well as that of\nneutron stars are necessary to obtain a complete description of dense\nnuclear matter.\nAs argued by various authors, a description of dense matter should not\nbe based on a single set of observables or a class of observables, but\nrather the most applicable description of dense matter would be the one\nthat describes a plethora of different observables accurately [ 51 , 55\n] . Unfortunately our knowledge of dense matter, in whatever form, is\ncurrently limited. Fortunately it is foreseen that with upcoming\nexperiments at current and new particle accelerator facilities, as well\nas the development of new telescopes, particularly radio-telescopes,\nmuch will be uncovered and discovered about terrestrial and\nextra-terrestrial dense matter in the near future. To gather a more\ncomplete picture of dense matter, works, such as this one, would be\nincreasingly important in providing a link between laboratory physics\nand astrophysics. However, through the study of nuclear physics alone,\nthis picture would not be easily attained and therefore the need for\ncooperation between astro- and nuclear physicists is greater than ever.\nThe application of relativistic mean-field theory to the quantum\nhadrodynamics has therefore shown itself to be relevant to the\ndescription of finite nuclei and nuclear matter [ 22 ] , as well as the\ndescription of neutron stars, based solely on a handful of coupling\nconstants.\n\n## Appendix A Code Documentation\n\nAll numerical problems in this work were solved using programs that were\nwritten for this purpose in FORTRAN90 programming language. This\nappendix will give a brief overview of these computer programs.\n\n### a.1 Introduction\n\nTo obtain the mass-radius relationship of a neutron star using a\nspecific parameter set in QHD is quite a complex physical and\nmathematical problem. Even after using RMF to approximate the\ndescription of nuclear matter, the equations that have to be solved are\nrarely exact, at most self-consisted. The main problem of applying a\ndescription of nuclear matter to neutron stars can be split into the\nfollowing components:\n\n1.  obtaining the values of the unknown meson fields in the RMF\n    approximation,\n\n2.  calculating the equation of state of neutron star matter, and,\n\n3.  using the equation of state to solve the TOV equation.\n\nIn the following sections different parts of the code pertaining to the\nabove-mentioned problem will be discussed. Whenever a function or\nsubroutine is mentioned, it will be written in bold and subroutines are\ndenoted by the prefix sub_ and functions by the prefix func_ .\n\n### a.2 sub_fields\n\nSub_fields is the subroutine used to calculate the RMF values of the\nmeson fields ( @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ).\nA schematic representation of this subroutine is given in Fig. A.1 . As\nimput sub_fields receives values of the proton and neutron fermi\nmomenta, @xmath (denoted by k_p) and @xmath (k_n), and the choice of the\nparameter set (para_choice) for which the RMF meson field values have to\ncalculated. For each specific value of k_p and k_n sub_conversion is\ncalled. Sub_conversion assigns all the coupling constants and masses as\nwell as the baryon number density (density_B) as global parameters for\nthe specific choice of para_choice. Once this is done the value of the\nRMF meson fields can be calculated. This is done by solving the\nself-consistent expressions for the different meson fields ( 9.20 ).\nThe values of the @xmath and @xmath are determined by comparing the\nleft- and right-hand sides of Eqs ( 9.20b ) and ( 9.20c ). The value of\nthe field on the left-hand side of the equation is incrementally\nincreased and then substituted into the expression on the right and the\nvalues on the left and right are compared. The RMF meson fields get\nassigned once the difference between the left and right sides are\nacceptability small (about @xmath fm @xmath ).\nIn the case of @xmath the value of the reduced mass ( @xmath ) is\ncalculated, from which @xmath is then calculated using Eq. ( 9.7 ). An\nexpression for @xmath in terms of @xmath can be easily deduced from the\nexpressions for @xmath ( 9.20a ) and @xmath ( 9.7 ) and yields\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.1)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nThe integral in the above expression is evaluated using the analytical\nexpression for the integral given in Appendix B .\nAfter checking one final time if the self-consistent equations are\nsatisfied to the desired accuracy (this is necessary, especially since\nin the FSUGold parameter set there is a coupling between @xmath and\n@xmath which complicates the calculation) the values of @xmath [denoted\nby sigma_0 ( sic ) throughout the code], @xmath (m_reduced), @xmath\n(omega_0) and @xmath (rho_0) are assigned (as global variables).\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nare also assigned. @xmath and @xmath are used in the calculation of the\nenergy density and the pressure and stem from the analytical solution to\nthe integrals Appendix B in the expression for the energy density and\nthe pressure ( 9.22 ).\nThe differences between the Walecka and Ring conventions (see Sec. 9.3 )\nnecessitate the definition of a different subroutine to calculate the\nRMF meson field values in the Ring convention. Sub_fieldsI is very\nsimilar to sub_fields , but one of the few differences is that a\nnumerical approximation is made to calculate the integral in the\nexpression for @xmath .\n\n### a.3 sub_epNS\n\nThis subroutine calculates the arrays containing corresponding values of\nthe energy density and the pressure to be used in sub_TOV , which solves\nthe TOV equation. Sub_epNS is represented graphically in Fig. A.2 .\nSpecific choices of the crust (crust_choice), equilibrium (beta of\ngeneral, eqm_choice) and the parameter set (para_choice) serve as input\nto sub_epNS .\nFor a specific choice of the crust sub_pcutoff determines the transition\nbetween the inner crust and the liquid interior and\/or between the outer\nand inner crust. It returns a value of @xmath and @xmath (k_cutn and\nk_cutp) at the corresponding pressure or number density of the\ntransition.\nIf the description of matter in general equilibrium is required,\nsub_muon returns the value of @xmath (k_max_no_muons) above which the\nmuons states will be populated. Sub_muon also assigns the minimum values\nof @xmath (k_n_beta_min) at which the matter can be in beta-equilibrium.\nThe value of k_n_beta_min is not calculated by sub_muon , but was\ndetermined by hand and then hard coded to be @xmath fm @xmath . Sub_beta\nis used to determine the values of the proton, electron and muon fermi\nmomenta (kp, ke and kmu) corresponding to a neutron fermi momentum, kn\n(which of course this calculation is parameter set specific). If only\nbeta-equilibrated matter is desired, sub_beta calls sub_beta2 , which\ndoes the necessary.\nIf no crustal effects are considered, sub_fields is called to determine\nthe values of @xmath (sigma_0), @xmath (omega_0), @xmath (rho_0), @xmath\n(x_p) and @xmath (x_n). These values, along with the values of @xmath\n(k_e) and @xmath (k_mu), are then used by func_epsNS and func_presNS to\ncalculate the energy and the pressure of neutron star matter, using Eqs\n( 9.22 ) and ( 9.22b ) respectively.\nThe equation of state for the outer crust is calculated by func_bps .\nFor the choice of the sequence of equilibrium nuclei (either TMA from\nTable 10.2 or BPS from Table 10.1 ) and specific value of the pressure\nin the outer crust, func_bps returns the energy density. For the inner\ncrust the BBP equation of state can be used or the polytropic equation\nof state [denoted by RPA in the program and given by Eq. ( 10.4 )]. The\nBBP equation of state is calculated by reading the values given in Table\n10.4 from file (BBPE.txt and BBPP.txt for the energy density and the\npressure respectively) and determined by interpolating the energy\ndensity at a specific pressure. The polytropic equation of state is\ncalculated by first determining the values for @xmath and @xmath . Using\nequation 10.4 the energy density is calculated for each input value of\nthe pressure. The equation of state of the liquid interior of the\nneutron star is given by calling func_epsNS and func_presNS for values\nof @xmath (kn) greater than kcutn.\nThe output of sub_epNS is a file, ep.txt, which contains the pressure in\nthe first column and the energy density in the second. The following\ndata is also printed to file: The value of @xmath (kn) and @xmath (kp)\nto kn_kp_ep.txt; @xmath (ke), @xmath (kmu) and density_B ( @xmath ) to\nke_kmu_ep.txt, while fields_ep.txt contains the values of @xmath\n(sigma_0), @xmath (omega_0) and @xmath (rho_0).\n\n### a.4 sub_TOV\n\nThis subroutine solves the TOV equation. As input sub_TOV receives the\nneutron fermi momentum (k_fn) assumed to describe the matter at the\ncentre of the star, as well as the choices for the parameter set, crust\nand equilibrium conditions.

{"input":"## Introduction\n\nThe Sun is undoubtedly the most important astronomical object for\nthe human kind. Although its proximity and the fact that it has been\nlargely studied, our knowledge is yet quite poor in understanding how it\nreally works: which are the mechanisms that rule its behaviour, with the\neleven years solar cycle, and further more facts concerning the magnetic\nnature and its implications in the structure of our closest star.\n\nThe study of the Sun embraces nowadays multiple branches: from the study\nof the solar interior through helioseismology techniques up to the study\nof the solar wind that impacts the Earth after traveling a long distance\nacross the emptied space. The majority of advances in solar physics have\ncome thanks to the new telescopes and observational techniques. The\nquality of the images taken by telescopes has improved considerably in\nthe last decades and nowadays it has almost reached the diffraction\nlimit imposed by the instrument. Computational tools have also taken\npart in the development of solar physics by improving modelling and\nsimulations which are in their turn corroborated by observations, hereby\nthe importance of reaching high-resolution observing levels.\n\nThe Sun evolves and changes in different time and spatial scales. Added\nto the 11 years cycle that marks the biggest changes in the solar\nmagnetic field structure, it also presents more rapid changes that can\nbe seen from Earth. Appearance of sunspots, for instance, was first\nobserved in the XVII century with the use of the telescope in astronomy\nthough there were many records of sunspots observations since antiquity.\n\nThe aim of this thesis associated to the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment\n(IMaX) project developed by several Spanish institutions \u00b9 \u00b9 1 Instituto\nde Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias (IAC), Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Andaluc\u00eda\n(IAA), Instituto Nacional de T\u00e9cnica Aeroespacial (INTA), Grupo\nAstronom\u00eda y Ciencias del Espacio (GACE) has two main branches. Firstly,\nthe initial part of the thesis deals with instrumental aspects,\nreviewing the latest restoration techniques and concerning the design of\na method to calibrate the in-flight instrumental aberrations of IMaX.\nThe second part of the thesis is dedicated to the study of the dynamics\nof structures in the solar photosphere, in particular in solar active\nregions. A more detailed information of the contents for each chapter is\ndescribed below:\n\nIn Chapter\u00a0\u00a7 1 we start reviewing the theory concerning the image\nformation which is crucial to understand many concepts developed through\nall the thesis, such as the degradation of images and the restoration\ntechniques applied to reconstruct them.\n\nChapter\u00a0\u00a7 2 is devoted to the instrument IMaX, describing first the\nproject it is associated to, the objectives of the mission and some\nimportant characteristics about it. Moreover, the main concern of this\nsection is the definition of the method for the IMaX in-flight\ncalibration and the subsequent test of the robustness of the method\ntaking into account all possible error sources.\n\nChapter\u00a0\u00a7 3 is the first chapter within the second part of the thesis.\nIt introduces the theory on solar active regions and the current\nknowledge in the field, i.e. the description of the structures\nconforming a solar active region, ranging from the widely studied umbra\nand penumbra of sunspots to the more recently discovered fine\nstructures.\n\nIn Chapter\u00a0\u00a7 4 we employ the restoration techniques to correct solar\ndata and show the first results yield by the study of horizontal proper\nmotions in and around sunspots. Maps of horizontal velocities are\npresented for a complex solar active region with a @xmath\n-configuration. Some of the results in this chapter have already been\npublished in the The Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL) .\n\nChapter\u00a0\u00a7 5 extends the study of proper motions to a larger sample of\nsunspots displaying various penumbral configurations. Most of the\nresults presented in this chapter have already been published in the The\nAstrophysical Journal (ApJ) .\n\nChapter\u00a0\u00a7 6 extends the study of solar active regions done in the\nprevious two chapters by analyzing a sample of solar pores from\nground-based and space observations. This chapter is a extended version\nof the work to be published in the The Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) .\n\nChapter\u00a0\u00a7 7 summarizes the conclusions of the work and the final\ndiscussion.\n\n###### Contents\n\n-    I Defining a method for in-flight calibration of IMaX aberrations\n    -    1 Foundations on image restoration\n        -    1.1 Introduction\n        -

I concentrate on the techniques\nwe employ to achieve high-resolution solar images that enable us to\nstudy the Sun at very small spatial scales (fine details).\n\n#### 1.1 Introduction\n\nCurrent problems trying to explain the physics of the Sun require to\nresolve very tiny structures as the first step to be able to model what\nis actually happening in different layers and regions in the Sun.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s atmosphere can be considered as an isotropic turbulent\nmedium. The quality of the solar images captured by ground-based\ntelescopes is severely affected by the atmospheric turbulence. The image\ndegradation is generally described as the combination of three main\ncontributions, as follows:\n\n-    Structures smearing ( blurring ).\n\n-    Global displacements of the image ( image motion ).\n\n-    Distortion of the structures caused by the differential image\n    motion of different patches in the FOV ( stretching ).\n\nAll these degradation effects considered together are usually referred\nto with the term seeing and represent the first problem to face if we\nare interested in high resolution data.\n\nThere have been recent efforts trying to circumvent the atmospheric\ninfluence on the observed images. Space-based telescopes ( Domingo,\nFleck & Poland , 1995 , SOHO) are undoubtedly the obvious best choice to\nget rid of the atmospheric effects. We all have got fascinated with the\nimages obtained by space facilities and nowadays we are still getting\nastonishing data from them (HINODE; Kosugi et al. , 2007 ) . But the\nelevated cost of construction and operation of these space solar\ntelescopes has made the scientific community to think about an\nalternative.\n\nIn recent years and in order to improve the ground-based observations,\nthe Adaptive Optics (AO Rimmele , 2000 ; Scharmer et al. , 2000 ) has\nmade possible to partially correct both, the instrumental and the\natmospheric aberrations. The idea is conceptually simple and uses\noptical elements deforming in real-time to compensate the wavefront\naberration induced by the atmosphere and the telescope.\n\nDue to the temporal scale in the evolution of the seeing, the AO only\npursues low-order corrections that moreover are limited to an\nisoplanatic patch of a few arc seconds, so that it is compulsory to\nimplement post-facto computational techniques to complement the\nreal-time corrections. Powerful numerical codes for image restoration\nhave been thus developed in the last decade, every single one requiring\nan especially designed observing strategy.\n\nIn order to quantify how the aberrations affect the images, it is worth\nto dedicate the next section to the mathematical formalism describing\nthe image formation in the telescope.\n\n#### 1.2 Image formation\n\nThe basic process describing the formation of images is shown in Figure\n1.1 a. The object of study is placed on the so-called object plane\nrepresented by the coordinates system ( @xmath ), and another coordinate\nsystem ( @xmath ) called the image plane is situated right in the focal\nplane of the telescope. The wave coming from a point source in the\nobject plane passes through the atmosphere and part of it enters the\ntelescope and forms the corresponding image (not a point anymore but a\nspot) centered at position ( @xmath ) in the image plane.\n\nIf the object source is the impulse unit function its image corresponds\nto the impulse response function of the optical transmission system\n(atmosphere + telescope). This response is also named Point Spread\nFunction (PSF) of the system. The PSF can be viewed as the normalized\ndistribution of intensity in the image of a point source and can be\nexpressed as @xmath , where @xmath represent the variability of the\ntransmission system (e.g.\u00a0atmospheric turbulence evolves at a fast rate)\nand ( @xmath ) reflects that the PSF is, in general, space variant,\ni.e.\u00a0the distribution of intensity in the image of a point source\nchanges with its location ( @xmath ) in the object plane. Note that (\n@xmath ) is the image conjugated point of ( @xmath ).\n\nConsidering an extended object like the Sun as composed by multitude of\nincoherent point sources, with individual intensities @xmath , we can\nestimate the resulting intensity distribution in the focal plane of the\ntelescope. Assuming a linear optical system and incoherent illumination,\nthis intensity can be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath represents the distribution of intensity in the ideal image\n(i.e.\u00a0also in the object) that would produce a perfect system free from\naberrations and with infinite aperture. The intensity at each point\n@xmath of the image has a contribution from the images centered at\npoints in the neighbourhood, e.g. @xmath in Figure 1.1 b\u00a0.\n\nFor an isoplanatic system having a spatially invariant PSF, i.e.\n@xmath , the equation 1.1 can be written as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (1.2)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nwhere @xmath stands for convolution and is the vectorial notation for\nthe coordinates in the image points. Using the convolution theorem \u00b9 \u00b9 1\nThe convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of the\nconvolution of two functions is the product of their respective Fourier\ntransforms. , the intensity can be expressed in the Fourier domain as\nthe product\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere capital letters stand for the Fourier transforms of the functions\nin lowercase, is the frequency vector in the Fourier domain and, @xmath\nis the so-called Optical Transfer Function (OTF) of the system. The\namplitude of the OTF is defined as the Modulation Transfer Function\n(MTF): @xmath . According to equation 1.3 the MTF is a filter that\nattenuates the amplitudes of the Fourier components of the ideal image\nto form the observed image.\n\n#### 1.3 Image restoration as a particular case of the Inverse Problem\nin Physics\n\nImage restoration fits into the format of the Inverse Problem in Physics\n\u00b2 \u00b2 2 The inverse problem frequently occurs in different branches of\nscience where the values of some model parameters must be obtained from\nthe observed data. which, in general, can be considered to as the\nsolution @xmath of the Fredholm inhomogeneous integral equation of the\n@xmath kind\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is known as the kernel of the integral equation. Equation\n1.2 is a particular case of equation 1.4 , where the kernel is the PSF.\n\nThe inverse problem in our particular case is usually called image\nreconstruction or image restoration since the target is to achieve an\nestimate of the ideal image or equivalently of the true object starting\nfrom a degraded image . Because in our particular case the inverse\nproblem can be formulated as a convolution equation (eq. 1.2 ), image\nrestoration can also be referred to as a deconvolution problem , the\nformal solution of which can be expressed from equation 1.3 as follows,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nor in the measuring domain as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe symbol @xmath over @xmath means that the restoration will not be\ncomplete in any case since the transmission system operates as a\nlow-pass spatial frequency filter with a given cut-off. In other words,\nthe restoration problem will render an estimate of the true object .\n\nIn order to compute @xmath it is mandatory to characterize the PSF (or\nits Fourier transform the OTF) describing the optical system. Several\napproaches to the PSF determination lead to different numerical methods\nfor the restoration of solar images ( Bonet , 1999 ) .\n\n##### 1.3.1 Noise contribution\n\nAn additional difficulty in the inversion problem arises from the fact\nthat in the real case, the observed image is affected by noise caused by\ndifferent sources being the readout and the photon noise the more\nrelevant components. Though the latter is proportional to the square\nroot of the number of photons in the incoming signal, in most solar\nphysics applications the assumption of uncorrelated signal and noise\ngives good results. In this manner, equation 1.2 can be completed\nincluding the noise as and additive contribution, and reformulated as \u00b3\n\u00b3 3 Note that the variable t is dropped from the formulae describing the\nimage formation in order to shorten the notation. However, one has to\nkeep in mind that the formulae describe instantaneous events.\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand in the Fourier transformed domain\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe restoration based in formula 1.5 leads to\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the term @xmath represents a noise amplification, making\ncompulsory to pursue a noise filtering, previous to the restoration\nprocess.\n\n##### 1.3.2 Noise filtering\n\nFiltering of the noisy signal is standardly done by using the so-called\noptimum filter @xmath , described for 1D problems by Brault & White (\n1971 ) , which is a real function that weights the diverse Fourier\nspectral components according to the noise level at each frequency.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe optimum filter is formulated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nCombining the noise filtering together with the deconvolution, we\neventually find the optimum filter for restoration @xmath , better known\nas the Wiener-Helstrom filter \u2074 \u2074 4 Named after the optimal estimation\ntheory of Norman Wiener, this filter simply acts separating signals\nbased on their frequency spectra. The gain of the filter at each\nfrequency is determined by the OTF of the system and the relative amount\nof signal and noise at that frequency.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere SNR @xmath is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Since we do not\nknow a priori the function @xmath , some models for SNR @xmath are\ncommonly assumed ( Collados , 1986 ) . Hereafter the superscript @xmath\nstands for complex conjugate.\n\n#### 1.4 The Phase Diversity Technique for image restoration\n\nThe Phase Diversity (PD) technique was first proposed by Gonsalves &\nChildlaw ( 1979 ) as a new method to infer phase aberrations working\nwith images of extended incoherent objects formed through an optical\nsystem. This technique of image reconstruction (see also Gonsalves ,\n1982 ; Paxman et al. , 1992 ) requires to use at least two images of the\nobject we want to reconstruct. One of the images is the conventional one\ndegraded by an unknown aberration (atmosphere and telescope) and the\nsecond one is a strictly simultaneous image of the same object affected\nby the same unknown aberration plus a known intentionally induced\naberration. Figure 1.2 shows an optical setup where we induce a known\namount of defocus by displacing backwards the camera with respect to the\nnominal focus.\n\nThe system of equations that mathematically describes the formation of\nboth images can be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere :\n@xmath is the focus-defocus image pair. @xmath are the corresponding\nPSF\u2019s for both channels. @xmath are the noise additive terms. @xmath is\nthe so-called true object .\n\nIf we do not consider the noise terms the system above is determined\nsince it has two equations and two unknowns: @xmath and @xmath . Note\nthat @xmath and @xmath differ in a well-known defocus value and\nconsequently are analytically related.\n\nNevertheless, the noise terms force a statistical solution of the\nproblem. Paxman et al. ( 1992 ) propose a least squares solution for the\nsystem of equations. For Gaussian noise, they derived the following\nerror metric in the Fourier domain to be minimized\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere capital letters stand for the Fourier transforms of the functions\nin lowercase in the system of equations 1.13 , @xmath is introduced by\nL\u00f6fdahl & Scharmer ( 1994 ) as a weighting factor to equalize the noise\ncontributions for the case when the noise variances @xmath and @xmath\nare not the same in both images. @xmath represents the OTF of the system\nwhich can be derived as the auto-correlation of the so-called\ngeneralized pupil function @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath stand for the working wavelength and the\neffective focal length of the optical system, respectively, and @xmath\nis a vector with dimensions of spatial frequency. @xmath , in turn, can\nbe expressed in terms of the joint phase aberration @xmath caused by the\ntelescope and the turbulence as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe phase aberration can be parametrized by using a Zernike polynomials\nexpansion (see Appendix A)\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the pupil radius, is the vectorial notation for @xmath\nwith @xmath defined in a unit circle @xmath and @xmath being the\nazimuthal angle.\n\nThus, equation 1.16 can be then written as\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (1.18)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath are the coefficients of the terms in the Zernike expansion\nand @xmath is the diverse phase, i.e.\u00a0the induced defocus in our case.\nThe final result is that the OTF (equation 1.15 ) and therefore the\nerror metric @xmath (equation 1.14 ) are parametrized by the expansion\nin Zernike polynomials, so that one can write: @xmath . The diverse\nphase @xmath will be zero in the case of @xmath that corresponds to the\nfocus image.\n\nPart of the minimization of the equation 1.14 can be performed\nanalytically. The solution of the equation @xmath yields an object\nestimate @xmath that minimizes the equation 1.14 ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nReplacing @xmath in the equation 1.14 , we obtain a so-called modified\nerror metric\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that this modified metric is not explicitly depending on the\nFourier transform of the object @xmath but only includes the unknown\n@xmath vector. By means of non-linear optimization techniques, we find\nthe @xmath vector, characterizing the aberration components, that\nminimizes the equation 1.20 . Once these components are determined,\n@xmath and @xmath can be calculated from equations 1.18 and 1.15 and the\nobject estimate can be eventually derived from equation 1.19 ,\ncompleting in this way the restoration process.\n\nIn conditions of poor seeing, the restored images are sometimes\ncontaminated by some artifacts like periodic strips or other regular\npatterns. This is a consequence of having zeros or quasi-zeros in the\nOTFs at some specific spatial frequencies which produce a poor SNR at\nthese frequencies. Thus, the division in equation 1.19 by the squares of\nthese nearly zero values cause excessive amplification of some spectral\ncomponents. To circumvent this drawback, a sort of speckle summation of\nvarious realizations close in time has been successfully used. This\nsummation carries out compensation for spectral information gaps in the\nFourier domain. From equation 1.19 and summing up @xmath realizations,\none can easily derive\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (1.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is not affected by the @xmath -subscript because it must be\nunique, i.e.\u00a0the estimate of the true signal that we are seeking \u2075 \u2075 5\nFor more detailed information on the PD-method see e.g. Bonet & M\u00e1rquez\n( 2003 ) ; Criscuoli et al ( 2005 ) and references therein. .\n\n#### 1.5 Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution\n\nThe MFBD (Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution) is a restoration method that\nuses multiple frames, bringing in such a way complementary information\nto recover the aberrations affecting the images (MFBD; L\u00f6fdahl , 2002 ,\n1996 ) . The method generally works in a better way when the contrast is\nhigh, the exposure time is short and the noise is low.\n\nAn extension of the MFBD, named Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind\nDeconvolution (MOMFBD; Van Noort, Rouppe van der Voort & L\u00f6fdahl , 2005\n) , has made possible to use, apart from multiple frames, also multiple\nobjects simultaneously observed, to restore the images in a more\nefficient way. By different objects we mean the same field-of-view in\nthe Sun but observed in different wavelengths (within a rather narrow\nspectral range). For each object, PD focus-defocus pairs can also be\nincluded. The observations in all channels must be simultaneous so that\nwe can assure a common atmospheric aberration. The joint restoration of\nseveral objects has also the advantage that almost perfect alignment can\nbe achieved between all of them.\n\nFigure 1.3 shows a sketch of the optical setup at the Swedish Solar\nTelescope (Observatorio Roque de los Muchachos). The MOMFBD technique is\napplied independently to the blue and the red channels. The G-band and\nG-cont beams in the figure are splitted into two channels\n(focus-defocus) that produce PD image-pairs. Red channel has also its\nown PD-pair \u2076 \u2076 6 The detailed description of the setup will be\ncommented in the next chapter when dealing with the observations we\npursued in different campaigns. .\n\nThroughout this thesis work we employ all the restoration methods\ndescribed above (i.e.\u00a0PD, MFBD and MOMFBD) depending on the particular\ncircumstances for each situation. The high-spatial-resolution achieved\nby using these methods is evident from the results shown in all the\ndifferent chapters.\n\n.\n\n### Chapter 2 In-flight calibration of IMaX aberrations \\dropping\n\n[0pt]2One of the main concerns of this thesis has an instrumental\nnature. This chapter is devoted to present the assignments I have\ndeveloped in this field as a member of the Imaging Magnetograph\neXperiment (IMaX) project at the IAC in Tenerife. Initially, a brief\npreliminary part is presented to introduce the balloon-borne SUNRISE\nproject conceived to pursue high-resolution solar observations and from\nwhich IMaX is part of. Afterwards, I will introduce the IMaX concept.\nFinally, I will explain with great detail the specific part I have\nperformed within the IMaX project that consists in designing a robust\nmethod to calibrate the in-flight instrumental aberrations of IMaX.\n\n#### 2.1 Sunrise\n\nThe SUNRISE project consists of a balloon-borne 1-m aperture solar\ntelescope (Figure 2.1 ) that aims at high-resolution\nspectro-polarimetric observations of the solar atmosphere, to be flown\nin the framework of NASA\u2019s LDB (Long Duration Balloon) program in 2009,\nin a series of flights on circumpolar trajectories at a float altitude\nof 35\u00a0-\u00a040 km. The main goal of the project is understanding the\nformation of magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere and their\ninteraction with the plasma convective flows. The SUNRISE equipment\nconsist of the main telescope feeding two focal-plane instruments\nthrough a light distribution system.

This instrument\nwill then provide magnetograms of extended solar regions by combining\nhigh temporal cadence and polarimetric precision while preserving the\nbidimensional integrity of the images. To meet this goal IMaX has to\nwork as a:\n\n-    High-efficient image acquisition system.\n\n-    Near diffraction limited imager.\n\n-    High resolving power spectrograph.\n\n-    High sensitivity polarimeter.\n\nFigure 2.3 shows the final optical and mechanical design of the\ninstrument in a 3D representation; the main optical components will be\ndescribed in detail in the next section. Table 2.1 lists the main\nparameters of the instrument.\n\n##### 2.2.1 Optical description\n\nThe box diagram in Figure 2.4 shows a concise description of the IMaX\noptical configuration \u00b2 \u00b2 2 From the IMaX Final Optical Design document\nSUN-IMaX-RP-IX200-023. (see figure caption).\n\nFigure 2.4 ( lower panel ) shows a more detailed view of the IMaX\noptical layout that will be briefly commented in the next lines. The\noptical interface with SUNRISE is the ISLiD Focus F4. Next to F4 we\nlocate the prefilter (PF) set (bandwidth 1\u00c5) and the modulator based on\nLiquid Cristal Variable Retarders (LCVRs or ROCLIs). After suffering the\nselected polarization, the beam passes through a collimator system\nconsisting of 2 lenses and a doublet. In the collimated space we locate\none solid Fabry-Perot Interferometer (which cavity is LiNbO @xmath \u00b3 \u00b3 3\nDue to its unique electro-optical, photoelastic, piezoelectric and\nnon-linear properties Lithium Niobate (LiNbO @xmath ) is widely used in\na variety of integrated and active acousto-optical devices. ) in the\nposition of a pupil image of the SUNRISE system. The etalon operates in\ndouble pass which means that the light passes once through it, then\nreflects back by means of two folding mirrors and crosses for the second\ntime the etalon. The beam is then focused by an imaging optical system\n(camera optics) that consist of a doublet and two lenses. A cubic\npolarizing beamsplitter divides the light beam into two branches, to\nform in the CCDs respective images with orthogonal polarization states.\nA parallel glass plate can be optionally inserted in the light path\nbetween the BS and one of the CCDs for calibration purposes by applying\nthe post-facto phase diversity technique. We will extensively detail the\nphase diversity mechanism in section\u00a0\u00a7 2.3 .\n\n#### 2.3 The Phase Diversity plate\n\nAs commented in the last section, the IMaX design includes a mechanism\nto apply the Phase Diversity technique for calibration purposes\n(wavefront sensing). According to section\u00a0\u00a71.4 where the PD method is\ndescribed, we need to combine information included in at least two\nsimultaneous images of the object, one being the conventional\nfocal-plane image that is degraded by the unknown system aberrations we\nare interested in, and the other one affected by the same unknown\naberrations plus an extra known aberration intentionally induced.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity this extra aberration is commonly chosen as a\ndefocus (see Appendix A) induced by simply displacing one of the cameras\nout of focus by a certain known distance that we will also term\ndiversity . For IMaX another alternative was implemented since the\ndisplacement of the camera could generate inertial problems caused by\nredistribution of masses or vibrations when moving a heavy CCD. One\nalternative option to induce defocus in one of the images without moving\nthe CCD camera to avoid the above mentioned problems, consist on\nintercalating a light plane-parallel glass plate in front of one the\nCCDs to induce a known displacement of the image focus as will be\ndescribed below.\n\nThe defocus aberration can be described as an excess\/defect in the\nradius of the spherical wavefront with respect to the value that would\nbe required to form the image of a point source at the nominal focus\n@xmath (see Figure 2.5 ). The subtraction between both wavefronts give\nus the defocus aberration function @xmath that turns out to be a\nparaboloid function.\n\nGeometric considerations lead to the following relationship between the\naxial displacement of the image plane ( @xmath ) and the defocus\naberration function\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the aperture, @xmath , @xmath is the radial distance\nfrom the pupil center, @xmath is the working wavelength and @xmath the\neffective focal length of the system.\n\nOn the other hand, the defocus aberration function expressed as a\nZernike polynomial in the Noll\u2019s basis (see Appendix\u00a0A) is\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the defocus weighting coefficient (in radian). The last\nterm @xmath in equation 2.2 represents an offset that is not affecting\nthe shape of the wavefront but only an axial shift (piston). Thus we can\nrelate expressions in equations 2.1 and 2.2 as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nand finally obtain the displacement in terms of the coefficient @xmath\n(in radian ):\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nBy replacing the IMaX working parameters (Table 2.1 ) in the last\nexpression we obtain @xmath as proportional to @xmath as follows: @xmath\n= -\u00a04.68923 @xmath mm.\n\nThis relation will be used later on to have an intuitive and also\nquantitative feeling about how significant is a defocus aberration\nexpressed as a certain @xmath value.\n\nApart from the axial displacement @xmath , another way to characterize\nthe amount of defocus is by means of the Peak-to-Valley (PV) optical\npath difference (OPD) which obviously corresponds to the value of the\ndefocus aberration function at the pupil edge. According to expression\n2.1 this value is\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nor in wavelength units\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTable 2.2 presents the defocus aberration in terms of the PV optical\npath difference corresponding to the focus displacement along the\noptical axis for a telescope with @xmath = 45.0 and @xmath 525.02 nm,\nwhich are the adopted values in IMaX.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, an amount of defocus corresponding to @xmath = 1\n@xmath at the pupil edge has proved to be satisfactory for the phase\ndiversity inversions. Using the IMaX parameters (see Table 2.1 ), and by\nsetting @xmath = 1 @xmath , we obtain a value for the focus displacement\nalong the axis @xmath = 8.51 mm.\n\nAs mentioned above, we will induce the image plane displacement by\nemploying a glass plate of thickness d, as shown in Figure 2.6 . This\ndisplacement can be mathematically formulated by the expression\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the refractive index of the material. The thickness of\nthe plate required to produce a desired displacement depends on the\nrefractive index of the optical glass commercially available, and for\nIMaX the selected material was Fused Silica \u2074 \u2074 4 Fused Silica is a high\npurity synthetic amorphous silicon dioxide. This noncrystalline,\ncolorless, silica glass combines a very low thermal expansion\ncoefficient with excellent optical qualities and exceptional\ntransmittance over a wide spectral range and is also resistant to\nscratching and thermal shock. with @xmath =1.461. Assuming a PV\naberration of 1 @xmath or equivalently @xmath =8.51 mm as reported\nabove, the required thickness for our PD plate would be @xmath =27 mm.\n\n###### Defocus tolerance\n\nThe image blurring permitted for an instrument can be specified by the\ndiameter of the blur spot or as the angle ( @xmath ) subtended by such a\ndiameter. For a given @xmath of acceptable blurring, the focus deepness\nis lower towards the lens that in the backward direction.\n\nA criterion for the defocus tolerance can be made by fixing the blur\nangle @xmath permitted for our purposes. For instance, we can select\n@xmath as the value of the diffraction cutoff wavelength, that is\nslightly greater than the Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) of the Airy\nspot. According to this criterion the defocus tolerance @xmath can be\nexpressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nNevertheless, this criterion is quite severe and there is another\nless-strict and more commonly used to establish the limit of the defocus\ntolerance in an optical system. This criterion is based on the loss of\nintensity in the central part of the PSF.\n\nRayleigh \u2075 \u2075 5 Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt), 1842-1919, Nobel\nprize in Physics in 1904. first (for the spherical aberration) and other\nauthors afterwards (for other aberrations), demonstrated that when the\nPV value of the error in the wavefront is @xmath , the central intensity\nof the PSF of the system reduces by less than 20 @xmath with respect to\nthe central intensity of the Airy function.\n\nMarechal demonstrated that when the rms of the wavefront aberration in\nan optical system is @xmath , the central intensity of the PSF also\nreduces by less than 20 @xmath , or in other words, the Strehl ratio \u2076 \u2076\n6 The Strehl ratio of an optical system is defined as the quotient\nbetween the central intensities of the real PSF and the theoretical one\nassuming a diffraction limited system, the latter being the Airy\nfunction. @xmath PSF @xmath . This ratio is closely related to the\nsharpness criteria for optics defined by Karl Strehl. is @xmath 0.8.\n\nBoth limits described above, @xmath for the PV value or @xmath for the\nrms, are commonly accepted as tolerable when establishing whether or not\na system achieves the resolution limit for practical purposes. These\nlimits are referred to as the @xmath -Rayleigh and the Marechal image\nquality criteria, respectively.\n\nBorn & Wolf ( 1999 ) study the distribution of intensity in a volume\naround the focus in a diffraction limited optical system and, in\nparticular, the intensity in the central part of the PSF along the\noptical axis. In this study it is demonstrated that to reduce the\ncentral intensity of the PSF by a 20 @xmath , the displacement as\nmeasured from the nominal focus is given by the equation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis is the classical limit adopted as the tolerance for the defocus, an\nit is based on the above described Rayleigh and Marechal criteria. Note\nthat the difference in both defocus tolerances in equations 2.8 and 2.9\nis a factor of 2, meaning that the last one is more permissive as a\nquality criterion.\n\nWith the IMaX parameters (in Table 2.1 ) the defocus tolerances @xmath\nfor the instrument according to both defocus criteria are, respectively,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNevertheless, the modelled defocus error in IMaX, stemming from optical\ntolerancing and thermal effects, remains within the tolerance range even\nin the more restrictive case ( @xmath 1.06 mm).\n\n#### 2.4 Defining the method for the in-flight calibration of the IMaX\nimage aberrations\n\nThe goal of this section is to define the procedure that will be\nemployed in IMaX to calibrate the image degradation during the flight.\nThe proposed calibration procedure is based on the PD-speckle technique\nfor image reconstruction and wavefront sensing (see section\u00a0\u00a71.4). To\nthat aim IMaX has been provided by a PD-plate to intentionally induce a\ncontrolled defocus.\n\nThe PD-plate can be optionally intercalated in one of the IMaX imaging\nchannels (see Figure 2.7 and section 2.3 ) so that a simultaneous\nfocus-defocus image-pair, i.e.\u00a0a PD image-pair, can be recorded. From\nthis pair an estimate of the aberrations will be possible in\npost-processing by means of a PD inversion code. PD-inversions\nthroughout this chapter have been performed with an IDL code developed\nby Bonet & M\u00e1rquez ( 2003 ) .\n\nAssuming a long-term variation in the instrumental aberrations, the\nimage acquisition for calibration could be performed with a cadence of\none hour. A burst of 25-30 PD-pairs taken in a short time interval in\nthe spectral continuum would be enough each time. This way we get a\nlarge amount of information \u2077 \u2077 7 Improving the SNR. collected within a\nsufficiently short time period so that it can be assumed negligible\nevolution of the solar structures in the FOV. The averaged results from\nthe PD-inversions of these calibration image-pairs in a post-facto\nprocess will provide a description of the aberrations also affecting our\nscience spectral images and, in turn, the maps of the full-Stokes\nvector. Subsequently, the science images will be reconstructed by using\na standard deconvolution code to nearly reach the diffraction limit of\nSUNRISE.\n\nThe organogram of Figure 2.8 shows a schematic representation of the\nsequential steps in the post-processing calibration procedure.\n\n#### 2.5 Testing the robustness of the calibration method\n\nThe purpose of this section is to evaluate by means of numerical\nsimulations, the robustness of the method we have implemented for the\nwavefront error calibration in IMaX, versus a variety of aberration\nassumptions. To pursue the numerical experiments we select an\nisoplanatic patch consisting of a portion of one of the synthesized\nimages of solar granulation, from the MHD model developed by V\u00f6gler et\nal. ( 2005 ) ; Sch\u00fcssler et al ( 2003 ) . The spatial resolution of this\nsynthetic image is much higher than that corresponding to the cutoff\nfrequency in SUNRISE \u2078 \u2078 8 In order to be as realistic as possible\nconstructing the theoretical images one has to consider the spectral\ncontamination by the wings and lobes of the filter transmission curve\n@xmath . For this purpose a sequence of images are constructed from the\ntheoretical model for different @xmath \u2019s around our working @xmath :\n@xmath . This sequence has been convolved with @xmath : @xmath = @xmath\nand from the resulting sequence @xmath the central image in our working\n@xmath is extracted. These calculations have been done by D. Orozco\nSu\u00e1rez. , and represents what will be termed hereafter the true object .\n\nThe testing procedure will consist in simulating the formation of PD\nimage-pairs as produced by a telescope with the SUNRISE aperture and a\ngiven set of aberrations (model of aberrations). A total of 30\nimage-pairs for different photon noise realizations is hereby obtained.\nThe resulting degraded image-pairs are re-sampled to the IMaX pixel size\nand inverted with the PD-code. This set of images will be processed\naccording to the diagram sketched in Figure 2.8 applied to the\nparticular case of only one isoplanatic patch, and the set of averaged\naberrations retrieved from the inversions will be compared to the input\nmodel of aberrations.\n\nIn our simulations we intend to reproduce the global aberration as close\nas possible to the real one affecting the image quality when the\ninstrument is acquiring data in real-time. For this purpose we need to,\nfirstly, identify the potential sources of error and, secondly, make\nrealistic assumptions about the quantitative contribution from each of\nthem.\n\n##### 2.5.1 Identifying the error sources\n\nThe contribution from the different error sources can be mathematically\nrepresented through the generalized pupil function (see equation\u00a01.18)\nas follows,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the terms in the exponential stand for:\n\n  -------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  @xmath   @xmath Differential aberration between focus\/defocus channels @xmath phase diverse.\n  @xmath   @xmath Main mirror polishing error.\n  @xmath   @xmath Phase error from the etalon.\n  @xmath   @xmath Low-order optical system aberrations common in focus\/defocus channels.\n  @xmath   @xmath Atmospheric aberration which is negligible in IMaX.\n  @xmath   @xmath Transmission function over the pupil.\n  -------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition we have to include in the error budget the pixel integration\neffect in the CCD and the noise.\n\n@xmath and @xmath will be expressed as a polynomial expansion in a basis\nof Zernike as explained in section\u00a0\u00a71.4. The rest of the contributions\nwill be introduced as amplitude- or phase-screens constructed according\nto a model or obtained from direct laboratory measurements.\n\nWe emphasize that the formulation of the Zernike\u2019s basis we use\ncorresponds in all cases to that introduced by Noll ( 1976 ) as stated\nin section\u00a0\u00a71.4.\n\n##### 2.5.2 Quantifying the contribution of the error sources\n\nThe opto-mechanical elements in SUNRISE which are affecting the\nformation of our images are: Telescope , ISLiD , mechanical interface\nwith IMaX and IMaX itself (see Figure 2.2 for a schematic view of the\noptical design including all these components). The first step is,\nconsequently, the compilation of data from the design and specifications\nof all the different components \u2079 \u2079 9 Most of these data have already\nbeen published in the IMaX technical document: SUN-IMaX-RP-IX200-023\nIMaX Final Optical Design (2007) . .\n\nTable 2.3 lists a compendium of some nominal values for the rms\nwavefront error ( rms-WFE ) derived from the optical design including\nthe statistical modelling for the optical tolerancing and the thermal\nbehaviour of the systems \u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u2070 10 Thermal effects are simulated with an\noptical design software ( CODE V ) by varying the refractive index and\nthe geometry of the opto-mechanical components as a function of the\ntemperature and the expansion coefficients. Temperature variations, for\ninstance, are taken into account in the expected range except in those\ncomponents having their own temperature control in a lower range (i.e\nLiquid Cristal Variable Retarders - LCVRs -, etalon, etc). Simulations\nare meant to study the aberration for three possible cases: operative ,\nhot and cold . It is mandatory to know the thermal variation of the\nrefractive index ( @xmath ) for every optical material and the thermal\nexpansion coefficient for every opto-mechanical element. The thermal\neffects have been studied for IMaX as a whole and also for its main\ncomponents independently (e.g.\u00a0the PD-plate, etc). The calculations were\nmade under the assumption of a temperature variation range of 15 @xmath\n7.5 @xmath C. However, further improvements in the thermal system (May\n2008) have provided a more restrictive range for the temperature\nexcursions: 24.5 @xmath 0.5 @xmath C. This implies that the rms-WFE\nvalues in the table, derived from the former thermal model, are rather\npessimistic estimations. Nevertheless, we preserved them because new\nestimations are not available for all cases yet. Moreover, testing the\nrobustness of our calibration method with over-degraded images will\nreinforce the conclusions about the reliability of the calibration\nmethod. Optical tolerancing is a critical step in the design of an\noptical system. The objective is to define a fabrication and assembly\ntolerance budget and to accurately predict the resulting as-built\nperformance, including the effects of compensation. Also part of the\nstudy is determining the best set of compensators. .\n\nThe rms values shown hereafter are computed excluding piston and image\ndisplacement (tip\/tilt) from the error budget.\n\n###### Low-order optical system aberrations\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned mean parameters describing the rms\naberration in Table 2.3 , we also have available the sets of Zernike\ncoefficients corresponding to the nominal design for both,\nTelescope+ISLiD and IMaX , up to a total of 36 modes (7 @xmath order)\nstarting from the term of index 4, i.e.\u00a0defocus (see columns 2 and 3 in\nTable 2.4 ). Respective rms-WFE are included in Table 2.3 (1\/26 and\n1\/140 waves).\n\nInitially, at a first stage we represented the model for low-order\naberrations in our numerical experiments by re-scaling the coefficients\nof the nominal design by a factor accounting for the thermal effects and\noptical tolerancing \u00b9\u00b9 \u00b9\u00b9 11 Let @xmath be the set of Zernike\ncoefficients of the expantion in the Noll\u2019s basis, approaching a\nwavefront aberration. The orthogonality properties of these basis\nfunctions facilitate the calculation of the rms-WFE as @xmath .\nRe-scaling the coefficients to provide a wavefront aberration with a\ngiven ( rms-WFE ) @xmath consists of simply computing a new set of\ncoefficients @xmath such that @xmath ( rms-WFE ) @xmath ( rms-WFE ). ,\nexcluding the etalon (the contribution of which is explicitly introduced\nin the simulations by means of amplitude- and phase-screens supplied by\nthe manufacturer) and the ISLiD-IMaX interface contribution. In Table\n2.3 the re-scaling factors correspond to: Telescope+ISLiD (with optical\ntolerancing and thermal effects, item 2) and IMaX (with optical\ntolerancing and thermal effects, item 7), so that their values are\n1\/8.25 and 1\/19, respectively. The resulting sets of re-scaled Zernike\ncoefficients were summed up to give the desired low-order aberrations\nmodel (column 4 in Table 2.4 ).\n\nA criticism to this procedure is that the simple re-scaling preserves\nthe distribution curve of the nominal Zernike coefficients, which might\nbe a rather arbitrary statement because the contribution from optical\ntolerancing and thermal effects could modify in a non-proportional way\nthe different aberration terms. Having this in mind, we changed,\naccording to our possibilities, the criterion to construct the model of\naberrations affecting the images in IMaX.\n\nTable 2.5 complements Table 2.3 by adding new empirical measurements and\nother considerations regarding the wavefront errors. Once IMaX has been\nmanufactured and assembled (excluding etalon and PD-plate), the\naberrations have been calibrated in the laboratory by using a Zygo\nInterferometer at INTA. Figure 2.9 shows the arrangement in the\nlaboratory including IMaX and Zygo, sketching the optical elements and\nthe light paths along the whole system when calibrating the optical\naberrations of IMaX. The etalon and PD-plate drawn in the sketch have\nbeen actually removed for this calibration as mentioned above.\n\nFrom these measurements we obtained the Zernike coefficients approaching\nthe real IMaX aberrations (excluding etalon and PD-plate) at laboratory\nconditions \u00b9\u00b2 \u00b9\u00b2 12 Atmospheric pressure and room temperature about 20\n@xmath C. At a first stage, laboratory experiments for checking the\nthermal behaviour of the system have not been performed. (Column 5 in\nTable 2.4 ). The corresponding value for the rms-WFE is 1\/16.8 waves\n(item 1 in Table 2.5 ).\n\nConcerning the Telescope+ISLiD contribution, we do not have the\nlaboratory measurements and therefore we have preserved the procedure of\nusing the coefficients from the nominal design after rescaling by a\nfactor accounting for the average sources of error (optical tolerancing\nand thermal effects; item 2 in Table 2.3 ) numerically modelled (column\n6 in Table 2.4 ). Figure 2.10 ( left panel ) plots the Zernike\ncoefficients for IMaX as measured at the laboratory and the\nTelescope+ISLiD coefficients as re-scaled from the nominal ones. The\ntotal added contribution of both (Column 7 in Table 2.4 ) is plotted in\nFigure 2.10 ( right panel ) and represents the set of coefficients we\nare going to use in the simulations. In all cases we present the Zernike\ncoefficients corresponding to the Noll\u2019s basis and starting from\ncoefficient @xmath (defocus). The terms for piston, tip and tilt are\nexcluded from our model since they do not represent figure errors.\n\nThe calculation of the rms-WFE from the quadratic sum of coefficients in\nour model produce a joint aberration of 1\/6 waves (item 2 in Table 2.5 )\nto be compared with the value RSS (=1\/7.6 waves) derived from items 2\nand 7 in Table 2.3 that represent the global error effect (excluding the\nISLiD-IMaX interface and the etalon) as modelled with CODE V \u00b9\u00b3 \u00b9\u00b3 13\nSoftware by Optical Research Associates used at INTA for designing and\nanalysing the IMaX optical configuration. . The difference might be\npartially ascribed to the approximate behavior of the RSS parameter\nrepresenting the joint aberration of various optical systems.\n\n###### Phase and transmission errors from the etalon\n\nAs described before, the etalon is placed onto a conjugate pupil of the\nSUNRISE system. Nevertheless, up to this step, we are not including in\nthe model of aberrations the etalon contribution. The effects induced by\nthe etalon in amplitude (transmission) @xmath ) @xmath and phase @xmath\nwill be explicitly included in our simulations. The manufacturer, CSIRO\n\u00b9\u2074 \u00b9\u2074 14 Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research\nOrganisation,\nwebsite: http:\/\/www.csiro.au\/ , provided computer files mapping the\nerrors in amplitude and phase all over the etalon circular surface of 70\nmm of diameter (this information is what we call amplitude- and\nphase-screens). Based on these maps we selected two optimal circular\nareas of 25 mm of diameter each. The criterion for this selection was to\nachieve the best compromise to minimize both the amplitude and phase\nerrors. The etalon surface was oriented so that the selected circular\nareas fitted the position of the pupil image on the etalon operating in\ndouble pass mode. Considering the double pass through the selected areas\nwe derived from the error maps supplied by the manufacturer, the\namplitude- and phase-screens displayed in Figure 2.11 that exhibit\npredominately high-spatial frequency structures (high-order Zernike\nmodes in the phase-screen). The resulting rms-WFE value is as small as\n1\/26 waves (Table 2.5 , item 3). The residual piston and tip\/tilt were\nremoved from the phase-screen.\n\nNevertheless, the problem gets complicated when enclosing the etalon in\nthe pressurized and thermalized oven (the thermally controlled enclosure\n). Interferometric measurements (with Zygo at INTA) of the wavefront\nerror in double-pass and parallel-beam configuration, unveiled in the\njoint etalon+oven system a significant extra contribution of low-order\nZernike modes (column 8 in Table 2.4 and Figure 2.12 ) with a rms-WFE of\n1\/9.2 waves (item 4 in Table 2.5 ). Since this value comes from the\nmeasured Zernike coefficients, that do not fundamentally describe the\nhigh-spatial frequencies detected in the calibration maps from CSIRO, we\nwill assume that both contributions are complementary and additive and\nso we will treat them in our simulations. The origin of low modes is not\nfully-characterized yet though we speculate they are originated by\ndeformations of the oven windows caused by mechanical stresses or by the\nbulge of the etalon itself when applying high voltages (ranging from 0\nto 2000 volts) while scanning our working spectral line.\n\nNote that the major contribution to low-order modes in the etalon\ncorresponds to the defocus coefficient ( @xmath 0.65 rad or 3 mm of\ndisplacement), and we are confident it can be compensated when coupling\nthe etalon+oven system into IMaX by optimizing the position of the image\nfocal plane \u00b9\u2075 \u00b9\u2075 15 By means of an MTFs optical bench. . For this\nreason this defocus contribution will be considered as null in our\nsimulations (first value in column 8 in Table 2.4 ), so that the rms-WFE\nascribed to the etalon+oven in low modes shrinks from 1\/9.2 to 1\/28.5\n(item 5 in Table 2.5 ). The rest of the Zernike coefficients will be\nadded to the low-order Zernike coefficients characterizing the system\nTel+ISLiD+IMaX (column 7 in Table 2.4 ) thus resulting the total budget\nof low-order aberration terms affecting the image formation in IMaX\n(column 9 in Table 2.4 and Figure 2.13 ) with a rms-WFE =1\/5.2 waves\n(item 6 in Table 2.5 ). The total phase error induced by low-order\naberrations will be denoted hereafter as @xmath .\n\nIn the final array of Zernike coefficients remains a non-zero value for\ndefocus stemming mainly from ISLiD. This coefficient can not be set to\nzero in the simulations as we did in the case of the etalon defocus\nsince the ISLiD system has been designed and integrated with total\nindependence with respect to IMaX. Thus, we have not any chance to\ncompensate the defocus contribution from ISLiD when fixing the optimum\nposition of the image focal plane during the IMaX integration.\n\n###### Main mirror polishing errors\n\nAnother effect we are meant to include in our numerical experiment is\nthe so-called ripple . Commented briefly in section\u00a0\u00a7 2.5.1 this error\nis caused by the polishing tool on the main mirror surface of the\nSUNRISE telescope. The wavefront error induced by this effect is\nquantified by a certain rms-WFE that will be, from now on, represented\nas rms-ripple and modelled by a phase screen arbitrarily chosen out of a\nsample of realizations which average power spectrum matches a von Karman\n\u00b9\u2076 \u00b9\u2076 16 Theodore von Karman (1881-1963), originally from Hungary, is\nresponsible for many advances in aerodynamics, supersonic and hypersonic\nairflow characterization, among others. The von Karman spectrum is a\npower spectrum of the refractive index fluctuations describing the\natmospheric turbulence. Thus, phase errors caused by atmospheric\nturbulence are also standardly modelled to match, in average, a von\nKarman power spectrum for given values of the inner- and outer-scale of\nturbulence. Inner- and outer-scales mean the smallest\/largest spatial\nscales of the fluctuations also referred to as smallest\/largest eddies\nin the turbulent medium. power spectrum, for an outer-scale equal to the\nsize of the polishing tool (hereafter ripple-scale ). The size assigned\nto the ripple-scale in our simulations is 30 cm. Note that the amount of\nrms-ripple we are considering is derived from the wavefront and\nconsequently it is twofold the ripple error in an optical surface\nworking by reflection. The total phase error induced by ripple will be\ndenoted hereafter as @xmath .\n\nThe ripple can be classified as a high-order modes contribution to the\nglobal WFE. Figure 2.14 shows a ripple screen realization.\n\n###### Phase Diversity plate\n\nAs commented in section\u00a0\u00a72.3 the PD-plate will introduce a defocus in\none of the cameras. Apart from that, we were interested in finding out\nother possible contributions from the PD-plate to the error budget of\nthe global system. To that aim an interferometric calibration of the\nisolated glass plate was made at the IAC optical laboratory \u00b9\u2077 \u00b9\u2077 17 The\nlaboratory conditions were: temperature 23 @xmath C and humidity 38\n@xmath . by means of a Zygo interferometer. The aberrations were\nevaluated in 9 footprints of the IMaX telecentric beam (1.88 mm of\ndiameter each) over the plate, arranged as shown in Figure 2.15 ( right\npanel ). A view of the optical setup for the calibration is shown in\nFigure 2.15 ( left panel ).\n\nThe final results expressed by the Zernike coefficients for each single\nfootprint are plotted in Figure 2.16 , and the obtained rms-WFE is, in\naverage, 1\/21.3 waves. Although this is a small contribution, we suspect\nthat it has been over-valuated (i.e.\u00a0the aberration must be still\nsmaller) because of some parasitic structures detected in the\ninterferograms probably caused by reflections at the front and back\nfaces of the plate. This reflections are the consequence of an\ninappropriate light source wavelength differing from the IMaX working\nwavelength for which the surface coating was designed and manufactured.\nIn consequence, apart from its inherent task of displacing the image\nplane, we will assume a null contribution from the PD-plate to the error\nbudget.\n\nBased on the IMaX thermal study \u00b9\u2078 \u00b9\u2078 18 Performed in May 2008 by Carmen\nPastor Santos at INTA on the basis of the new thermal model\ncalculations. , Table 2.6 lists for three different cases within the\nexpected temperature variations range, the amount of defocus (in mm)\ninduced by the PD-plate.\n\n###### Detector contribution\n\nThe CCD mainly produces three effects that degrade the image quality (\nBoreman , 2001 ) , namely:\n\n-    Detector footprint effect: It consist of the integration of the\n    image information over the surface of the detector elements since\n    they have a physical size.\n\n    A detector element with dimensions @xmath and @xmath performs a\n    spatial averaging of the irradiance falling onto its surface, that\n    in the frequency domain is equivalent to a spatial filtering\n    represented by a transfer function OTF @xmath , mathematically\n    expressed as\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (2.13)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    where @xmath , @xmath represent the components of the spatial\n    frequency.\n\n    The smaller the pixel size the broader the resulting transfer\n    function and, therefore, the lesser the smoothing in the image when\n    recorded by the CCD.\n\n-    Sampling effect: A sampled-imaging system is not shift-invariant\n    and the position of the light reaching the detector, with respect to\n    the pixels, will affect the final image. This effect is commonly\n    treated as a statistical average of the relative image locations\n    respect to the CCD.\n\n-    Crosstalk effect: Charge-carrier diffusion \u00b9\u2079 \u00b9\u2079 19 The absorption\n    of photons in a semiconductor material is wavelength dependent: high\n    for short-wavelength photons and decreases for longer-wavelength\n    photons. With less absorption the long-wave photons penetrate deeper\n    into the material and thus the charges generated should travel\n    longer paths to be collected. and charge-transfer inefficiency \u00b2\u2070 \u00b2\u2070\n    20 It is caused by incomplete transfer of charge packets along the\n    CCD delay line. over the detector induce a spurious signal on the\n    neighbourhood.\n\nIn what follows, we only model in our simulations the first effect,\nwhich is the most significant.\n\n###### Noise\n\nTypically, the noise in the image recorded by a CCD has two components:\nthe photon noise and the readout noise. Due to the high performance of\nthe CCDs in IMaX we can neglect, for the sake of simplicity, the\ncontribution from the readout noise. We will simulate the photon noise\nas having a Gaussian distribution with a given rms. As an IMaX\nrequirement and in order to reach a spectral sensitivity of 10 @xmath\ndecisive to perform precise polarimetric measurements, the value we\nadopt in our simulations is rms-noise =10 @xmath times the signal in the\nspectral continuum, i.e.\u00a0a SNR=10 @xmath in the continuum.\n\n##### 2.5.3 Numerical simulations and results\n\nIn order to do a systematical presentation of the numerical experiments\nwe are going to describe hereafter for various aberration assumptions,\nand taking into account all the different error sources described above,\nwe consider appropriate to classify these error contributions in three\nmain groups, as follows:\n\n1.   Low-order aberrations (LOA) caused by the following optical\n    sub-systems: SUNRISE telescope (excluding polishing errors), ISLiD,\n    Interface ISLiD-IMaX, and IMaX excluding high-spatial frequency\n    inhomogeneities in the etalon but preserving figure errors caused by\n    deformations in the etalon and in the windows of its thermally\n    controlled enclosure.\n\n    These aberrations, except for those from the ISLiD-IMaX Interface\n    which will not be explicitly considered, are modelled by the set of\n    Zernike coefficients listed in column 9 of Table 2.4 with a rms\n    wavefront error rms-LOA = 1\/5.2 waves (Table 2.5 ). This will be our\n    reference value for LOA in our simulations. So as to avoid the\n    danger of going to one extreme or the other, whereby either\n    excessively pessimistic considerations when evaluating the error\n    budget, or the possibility that unexpected error sources could arise\n    (e.g uncontrolled spikes in the temperature or pressure variations),\n    we will include other cases of aberration in our simulations, with\n    rms-LOA values that vary from that of the reference. To do that as\n    simple as possible, we will re-scale by a certain factor the list of\n    coefficients in column 9 of Table 2.4 . Thus, different cases of LOA\n    will be simulated by assuming the following values for rms-LOA : 0,\n    1\/12, 1\/7, 1\/5, 1\/4, 1\/3 and 1\/2 waves.\n\n    The efficiency of the PD-inversion is strongly dependent on the\n    particular set of LOA terms included in the simulation. For\n    instance, the problem becomes simpler when the main contribution to\n    the aberration comes from very low order terms. Then, the inversion\n    code gives good results by assuming a small number of unknowns\n    (e.g.\u00a015 or 21 Zernike coefficients or equivalently 15 or 21\n    equations). This simplifies the iterative solution of the equations\n    system and speed up the convergence.\n\n2.   High-order aberrations (HOA) caused by ripple in the telescope main\n    mirror and by high-spatial frequency inhomogeneities in the etalon\n    surface as described by laboratory calibration maps. Figure errors\n    in the etalon, induced by high voltages are not included in this\n    budget but in the LOA.\n\n    This HOA enter into the simulation code as respective phase-screens.\n    The rms-WFE measured for the etalon in double-pass configuration (\n    rms-etalon ) is 1\/26 waves (Table 2.5 ) and will be considered as a\n    fixed value in all numerical experiments in which this effect is\n    included. For the polishing errors three different cases will be\n    considered: rms-ripple =0, 2\/60 and 2\/28 waves. The way we write\n    down the precedent values as fractions with a nominator 2 is meant\n    to denote the effect of reflection of the wavefront in the main\n    mirror (e.g.\u00a0in the case 2\/60 we are adding two contributions:\n    1\/60 + 1\/60, each of them corresponding to the rms-ripple\n    characterizing the mirror surface). Apart from the etalon\n    phase-screen, we also have available an amplitude-screen mapping its\n    transmission inhomogeneities.\n\n3.   Pixel integration in the CCD and Noise . The first effect is\n    simulated by an analytical formula (see equation 2.13 ) as a\n    function of the pixel size (fixed value equals 12 @xmath m). The\n    noise contribution is introduced into the code as noise-screens\n    generated by an IDL \u00b2\u00b9 \u00b2\u00b9 21 The Interactive Data Language is a\n    widely known programming language that is a popular data analysis\n    language among scientists. simulator of pseudo-random signals with\n    Gaussian distribution for a given rms value. As justified above, we\n    take for all considered cases a fixed value rms-noise =10 @xmath\n    (the signal in the spectral continuum).\n\nIn what follows, a variety of aberration models will be made up by\ncombining weighted contributions from different error sources. In an\nattempt to approach the real observations when recording bursts of 30\nimage-pairs for calibrations (see section\u00a0\u00a72.4), 30 realizations of\nnoise will be systematically performed for every aberration model\nadopted.\n\nTable 2.7 reports on the different ingredients composing the aberration\nmodels considered in every numerical experiment. The results of these\nexperiments are displayed in Figures from 2.17 to 2.28 .\n\n###### Key notes for the interpretation of Figures 2.17 to 2.28\n\nFigures 2.17 , 2.20 , 2.23 , 2.26 display PD-speckle reconstructed\nimages from 30 realizations for every aberration assumption. Lying below\nevery restored scene we present one out of the 30 realizations of the\nin-focus degraded images. To facilitate the visual comparison between\ndifferent images, all of them are displayed by employing a common\ngray-scale ranging from the minimum to the maximum intensity values of\nthe true object shown at the upper right corner for reference. This way,\nreal differences in contrast and resolution can easily be detected by\neye.\n\nApart from the visual comparison, we also calculate the values of\ndifferent parameters to quantify the degree of success achieved in our\nnumerical experiments basically consisting of: degradation followed by\nPD-inversion . Figures 2.18 , 2.19 , 2.21 , 2.22 , 2.24 , 2.25 , 2.27\nand 2.28 are arranged in three columns. The panels in left, middle and\nright columns of the figures correspond to different assumptions for the\nrms-ripple : 0, 2\/60 and 2\/28 waves, respectively. The abscissae in all\npanels stand for different cases of rms-LOA . Bullets linked by dotted\nlines show the mean values resulting from PD-inversions. Vertical bars\nrepresent the dispersion of these results caused by 30 different\nrealizations of photon noise. Dashed lines represent the values of the\ndifferent parameters in the degraded (smeared) images simulated.\n\nTo evaluate the reliability of the results from the PD-process we need\nsome expected reference values for comparison, e.g.\u00a0the contrast of the\ntrue object that should ideally by reached after restoration, or the\nzero value that should ideally result from the subtraction of certain\nwavefronts (see thick solid lines in Figures 2.18 , 2.21 , 2.24 and 2.27\n). We also use as a reference the results of the restoration @xmath\nperformed with expression\u00a01.21, by only employing the input Zernike\nterms simulating the LOA of the system, @xmath (see thin solid lines in\nFigures 2.18 , 2.21 , 2.24 and 2.27 ).\n\nSubscripts t,s,r and Z in Figures 2.18 , 2.21 , 2.24 and 2.27 stand for\ntrue object , smearing (simulated degradation), reconstruction with PD,\nand restoration performed with only the Zernikes representing the LOA in\nthe input, respectively.\n\n###### Experiment 1\n\nCombined effects considered (see also Table 2.7 ).\n@xmath rms-ripple = 0, 2\/60 and 2\/28 waves. @xmath rms-LOA = 0, 1\/12,\n1\/7, 1\/5, 1\/4, 1\/3 and 1\/2 waves. @xmath rms-noise = 10 @xmath continuum\nsignal (30 realizations per aberration model.) @xmath No CCD effects.\n@xmath No etalon effects: @xmath 1 , @xmath 0. @xmath PD-defocus in mm\n(degradation\/inversion): 8.51 \/ 8.51. @xmath Inversion with 25\ncoefficients.\n\nA glance at Figure 2.18 , rows (a), (b), (c), reveals that the results\nderived from the application of PD to the simulated observations and the\nexpected values for different parameters (thick solid line) are in good\nagreement when rms-ripple =0 or 2\/60 waves ( left and middle columns )\nand rms-LOA =0, 1\/12, 1\/7, 1\/5 or 1\/4 waves. Thus the retrieved rms\ncontrast for @xmath ranges from 16 @xmath to 17.4 @xmath versus the\nreference rms( @xmath )=17.5 @xmath ; the mean absolute difference mean\n@xmath remains always below 2.5 @xmath and rms( @xmath ) below 3.5\n@xmath . In many cases the results are also reasonably good for rms-LOA\n=1\/3 waves but always noticeably worse for the case rms-LOA =1\/2 waves.\n\nThe figure shows that the results from the PD-inversions deviate\nprogressively from the reference values as long as the amount of ripple\nand LOA augment in the simulated aberrations. This behavior reflects the\nlimitations of the method stemming from: 1) the unsensed aberrations due\nto the limited number of Zernikes used in the inversion (25 coefficients\nversus 36 employed to simulate LOA in the total system -see Table 2.4 ;\n2) the influence of the also non-sensed HOA terms present in the ripple\n\u00b2\u00b2 \u00b2\u00b2 22 In further experiments also the inhomogeneities in the etalon\nphase will bring additional HOA contribution. ; 3) the noise in the\ndata; and 4) the instabilities in the PD-method itself.\n\nThe comparison of the bullet-dotted with the dashed lines evidences the\nenormous improvement obtained from PD-inversions with respect to the\nsmeared images. It is worth mentioning that Figure 2.18 , rows (a), (b),\n(c), (d), show the good coincidence (within the above mentioned range\nrms-ripple @xmath 2\/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1\/4) between the bullet-dotted\nand the thin solid lines , the latter representing the results of the\ndeconvolution performed by only employing the Zernike coefficients\nassumed as the input to simulate LOA in the total system. This\ncoincidence, even extensive to the third column, reveals that the\nPD-algorithm compensate reasonably well at least for the degradation\ncaused in the simulation by LOA terms. Note also that, for a given\nparameter and for rms-LOA @xmath 1\/4, the variation trend in the\nbullet-dotted and thin solid lines is quite similar in the three\ncolumns, being the main difference between these variations a vertical\noffset which increases from the left to the right columns. We ascribe\nthese offsets to a loss of contrast caused by the ripple.\n\nRipple errors are high-frequency phase errors and can be viewed as noise\nin the wavefront since they can hardly be modelled even with very high\norder Zernike terms in a polynomial expansion. The consequence of these\nerrors is a transfer of energy from the peak of the PSF to its far wings\nthus producing stray-light and consequently an unrecoverable loss of\ncontrast as evidenced in Figure 2.18 , row (a) \u2013\u00a0this degradation\nincreases as the ripple-scale decreases ( Bello , 2001 ) . Thus, large\nvalues of rms-ripple have more impact on the image contrast than on the\nimage resolution since the latter is related to the FWHM of the PSF\nthat, for well corrected systems, changes rather slowly \u00b2\u00b3 \u00b2\u00b3 23\nAccording to equations\u00a01.15, 1.16 and the auto-correlation theorem, the\nPSF of an optical system is proportional to the power spectrum of the\ngeneralized pupil function. Consequently, the presence of high-spatial\nfrequencies in @xmath will cause a long tail in the power spectrum or\nequivalently long wings in the PSF of the system. Furthermore, the\nenergy conservation forces the normalization of the volume enclosed by\nthe PSF; thus the extension of its wings will be done at the expenses of\nan intensity decrease at shorter distances, in particular at its central\npoint. If, apart from the ripple, the optical system is well corrected,\nthis transfer of energy from short to long distances will provoke a\nclear decrease in the central intensity of the PSF as long as the ripple\nincreases, but because of the very steep slopes in the PSF core, the\nFWHM of the PSF will scarcely be affected. . Note that the Strehl ratio\nis strongly dependent on the amount of ripple (see panels in row (f) of\nFigure 2.18 ). The case rms-ripple =2\/28 has only an academic interest\nin our simulations because we expect a better polishing quality in the\nSUNRISE main mirror surface \u00b2\u2074 \u00b2\u2074 24 In fact the expected rms values for\npolishing errors as measured on the mirror surface range from 5 to 10\nnm. For our working wavelength, @xmath 525.02 nm, this range corresponds\nto 1\/100 to 1\/50 waves, which includes the value 1\/60 assumed as the\nsecond case for rms-ripple in our simulations. .\n\nStray-light in solar photometry represents a problem that classically\nhas been faced from various approaches, all of them based on modelling\nthe far wings of the PSF by linear combinations of Gaussian and\nLorentzian functions, the parameters of which are determined from solar\naureole measurements ( Mart\u00ednez Pillet , 1992 , and references therein)\n. In spectro-polarimetry, being the case of IMaX, stray-light is a\nparticularly delicate issue because it represents a contamination of the\nmagnetic signal at a given feature by the signal originated in other\nstructures located all around the feature even at quite large distances\n(e.g. @xmath arc minutes).\n\nThe loss of contrast and spatial resolution, as long as the rms-ripple\nand rms-LOA increase, can be visually appreciated in the strips of\nrestored images in Figure 2.17 . Image resolution is particularly\naffected by rms-LOA @xmath 1\/4 waves: medium-high spatial frequency\nstructures, grains-like or fringes-like patterns start arising. These\nartifacts originate because the OTF in these cases drops to\nclose-to-zero values in a range at medium-high spatial frequencies \u00b2\u2075 \u00b2\u2075\n25 This effect is favoured by the central obscuration in the SUNRISE\u2019s\npupil inherent to the particular design adopted for this telescope. The\ncentral obscuration depresses the central region of the MTF in\ncomparison with its typical shape for diffraction-limited telescopes\nwith clear aperture. See Figure 2.29 illustrating this depression. and\nare more evident in single-restored images before doing the speckle\nsummation of equation\u00a0 1.21 (see discussion at the end of section\u00a0\u00a71.4).\nThus, the final product for single restorations is often arbitrarily\naffected by over restoration of some particular spectral components.\n\nIn Figure 2.19 , thick lines represent the variation of the Zernike\ncoefficients (up to index 11) used as the input to simulate the LOA\n(i.e.\u00a0the reference for comparison), whereas thin lines mark simply the\nzero level. Bullet-dotted lines represent again values retrieved from\nthe PD-inversion process. In most cases the coincidence of the retrieved\ncoefficients with the expected values is quite good even in the right\ncolumn of the figure (we exclude from this comparison the case rms-LOA\n=1\/2 waves). Nevertheless, the deviations encountered from the reference\nvalues could probably be ascribed to cross-talk between the limited\nnumber of Zernike terms employed in the PD-inversions (25 terms) in an\nattempt to compensate for the contribution of higher-order terms which\nare in fact present in the simulated wavefront: we have used 36 terms to\nsimulate the system LOA and, furthermore, we can not disregard the\ncontribution from polishing errors and noise to the signal. In other\nwords, as argued by L\u00f6fdahl & Scharmer ( 1994 ) the inversion program\ncompensates for the missing high-order terms by introducing errors in\nthe lower Zernike coefficients. To understand such compensations, we\nnote that the inversion algorithm does not attempt to derive the best\nfit to the wavefront. Because of the chosen error metric (see\nequation\u00a01.19), the inversion attempts to find two internally consistent\n(i.e.\u00a0derived from the same Zernike coefficients) transfer functions for\nthe focus and defocus images such that the error metric is minimized.\nThe value of the transfer function at a specific frequency is given by\nan average over the aperture of all differences in phase taken at a\nfixed separation (see equation\u00a01.15). Thus, mainly at low and\nintermediate frequencies, different wavefronts can give similar transfer\nfunctions. This gives the possibilities for compensations and allows the\ninversion procedure to find the wavefront that gives the best fit to the\ntransfer functions given the observed data and the number of Zernike\ncoefficients used to represent the wavefront. Nevertheless the\nimprovement given by such compensations is limited because of the\nabsence of high-spatial frequencies in the lower aberrations.\n\nThe panels in rows (d) and (e) in Figure 2.18 deserve a particular\ncomment. The inversion process yields rms( @xmath ) values that fit rms(\n@xmath ) very well, at least up to rms-LOA =1\/4 waves. In spite of this\ncoincidence, the deviation of the parameter rms( @xmath ) from zero\nincreases as the ripple and the LOA augment. This variation preserves a\nsimilar trend in the three columns of row (e) although it is affected by\na vertical offset in the middle and right columns. Note that the\nparameter rms( @xmath ) is also affected by similar offsets. In fact\nthese offsets coincide, as expected, with the rms-ripple value assigned\nto each case. The slope in the variation of rms( @xmath ) could be\njustified in terms of the compensations mentioned in the previous\nparagraph (cross-talk between low order modes), which reproduce good\ntransfer functions but not so good wavefront shapes. Apparently, the\ndifference in the wavefront shape does not imply a substantial\ndifference between rms( @xmath ) and rms( @xmath ) as shown in the\npanels of row (d).\n\n###### Experiment 2\n\nCombined effects considered (see also Table 2.7 ).\n@xmath rms-ripple = 0, 2\/60 and 2\/28 waves. @xmath rms-LOA = 0, 1\/12,\n1\/7, 1\/5, 1\/4, 1\/3 and 1\/2 waves. @xmath rms-noise = 10 @xmath continuum\nsignal (30 realizations per aberration model.) @xmath No CCD effects.\n@xmath Etalon effects: @xmath and @xmath derived from lab. calibration\nmaps. @xmath PD-defocus in mm (degradation\/inversion): 8.51 \/ 8.51.\n@xmath Inversion with 25 coefficients.\n\nThe only difference of this Experiment with respect to Experiment 1 is\nthat now we include in the simulated degradation the contribution from\n@xmath and @xmath mapping the transmission inhomogeneities and the HOA\nof the etalon, respectively. Note that the PD-code is only designed for\nthe retrieval of the phase-error function in the pupil but not of the\npupil transmission function. Thus, in the inversion process the function\n@xmath cannot be considered as an unknown in any case but one has to\npresume a certain model for it. In a first attempt we used for the\ninversion the same amplitude-screen as the one applied to simulate the\ndegradation but this way of proceeding generated a disastrous behaviour\nin the PD-code with strong fluctuations during the iterative process\nthat minimizes the error metric, and eventually collapsed the\ncalculations. So, we were compelled to use in the inversion the simple\nideal model @xmath =1 all over the pupil.\n\nNow we center our attention in the impact of these new complications in\nthe efficiency of the PD-code to recover the global phase-error\nintroduced as the input to simulate the degradation. Firstly, we\nconcentrate in Figure 2.21 , rows (a), (b), (c), for rms-ripple =0, 2\/60\nwaves and for rms-LOA @xmath 1\/4 waves. As in Experiment 1, a good\nagreement between the results of the inversion and the reference values\nis found. In most cases, the contrast rms @xmath ranges from 16.5% to\n18.4%, that is, close to the reference value 17.5%. The trends and\nranges in the variations of the mean absolute differences mean @xmath\nand of the rms @xmath remain quite similar to those in Figure 2.18 .\nHowever, a significant difference with Experiment 1 deserves special\ndiscussion. Now, for the cases with small rms-LOA @xmath 1\/7 waves, the\ninversion yields image contrasts rms @xmath overvalued with respect to\nthe reference one.\n\nWe ascribe this result to the non-realistic assumption made when setting\n@xmath =1 in the inversions. The error metric to be minimized in the\nPD-inversions does not explicitly contain neither the phase, @xmath ,\nnor the amplitude, @xmath , that define the generalized pupil function\n(expression\u00a01.16), but the OTFs that can be derived from the latter.\nThus, the defective information assigned to the amplitude @xmath can be\ncompensated by some extra errors \u2013\u00a0in comparison with Experiment 1\u00a0\u2013 in\nthe phase functions provided that the resulting generalized pupil\nfunctions still yield appropriate OTFs that minimize the error metric.\nThese extra errors are evident from the comparison of Figures 2.18 and\n2.21 , rows (d) and (e), and can be the cause of the over-restoration\nmentioned above. Figure 2.21 , row (e), also shows the deviations of\nrms( @xmath ) from zero. These vertical offsets are related to the HOA\ncontribution from polishing errors in the main mirror and\ninhomogeneities in the etalon surface and, as expected, in the three\npanels they very closely amount to RSS= @xmath .\n\n###### Experiment 3\n\nCombined effects considered (see also Table 2.7 ).\n@xmath rms-ripple = 0, 2\/60 and 2\/28 waves. @xmath rms-LOA = 0, 1\/12,\n1\/7, 1\/5, 1\/4, 1\/3 and 1\/2 waves. @xmath rms-noise = 10 @xmath continuum\nsignal (30 realizations per aberration model.) @xmath CCD effects.\n@xmath Etalon effects: @xmath and @xmath derived from lab. calibration\nmaps. @xmath PD-defocus in mm (degradation\/inversion): 8.51 \/ 8.51.\n@xmath Inversion with 25 coefficients.\n\nIn this Experiment we add to the image degradation one more contribution\nwith respect to Experiment 2. It consist of the integration over the\npixel area, of the information reaching the image plane as commented in\nsection\u00a0\u00a7 2.5.2 . Table 2.7 ticks off the error contributions taken into\naccount for this simulation. Dotted line in Figure 2.29 shows the OTF\n@xmath representing the degradation effect which is incorporated to the\ntotal error budget by simple multiplication by the OTF describing the\nglobal aberration in Experiment 2. The new ingredient in the simulated\naberration has no significant impact in the results of the PD-inversion.\nThus, for rms-ripple @xmath 2\/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1\/4 waves the\ndifferential impact in the parameters rms @xmath , mean @xmath and rms\n@xmath \u2013\u00a0Figure 2.24 , rows (a), (b), (c)\u00a0\u2013, with respect to Experiment\n2, is smaller than 2 tenths %. Similar coincidences between the results\nfrom Experiments 2 y 3 are achieved for the parameter rms @xmath .\nHowever, the influence of the CCD pixel integration is remarkable in the\nStrehl ratio as evidenced by comparing Figures 2.21 and 2.24 , rows (f).\n\nConcerning the retrieved Zernike coefficients from the PD-process, they\nlook very similar in Figures 2.22 and 2.25 , within the range of\naberrations mentioned above ( rms-ripple @xmath 2\/60 and rms-LOA @xmath\n1\/4 waves). Nevertheless, as discussed in previous paragraphs, small\ndifferences in the Zernike coefficients of both Experiments would not be\ncrucial provided that the resulting generalized pupil functions yield\nappropriate OTFs to obtain a good minimization of the error metric. This\nseems to be the case in the present Experiment to judge by the good\nimage restorations achieved. Therefore, we will consider the results\nfrom Experiment 3 as the reference for the next numerical test.\n\n###### Experiment 4\n\nCombined effects considered (see also Table 2.7 ).\n@xmath rms-ripple = 0, 2\/60 and 2\/28 waves. @xmath rms-LOA = 0, 1\/12,\n1\/7, 1\/5, 1\/4, 1\/3 and 1\/2 waves. @xmath rms-noise = 10 @xmath continuum\nsignal (30 realizations per aberration model.) @xmath CCD effects.\n@xmath Etalon effects: @xmath and @xmath derived from lab. calibration\nmaps. @xmath PD-defocus in mm (degradation\/inversion): 8.51 \/ 9.00.\n@xmath Inversion with 25 coefficients.\n\nThe recent IMaX thermal design (May 2008) predicts for the PD-plate,\nduring the flight, a temperature variation range of 24.5 @xmath 0.5\n@xmath C. From this thermal model, simulations with CODE V estimate the\ndefocus displacement induced by the PD-plate ranging from 8.46 mm\n(PV-WFE=1.008 waves; hot case) to 8.56 mm (PV-WFE=1.019 waves; cold\ncase), being 8.51 mm (PV-WFE=1.015 waves) the displacement corresponding\nto the operative case (24.5 @xmath C).\n\nThe amount of displacement of the image plane produced by the PD-plate,\nalso called diversity , is an input parameter in the PD-code. One of our\nconcerns has always been how critical the value assigned to the\ndiversity is, or in other words, how much robust is the PD-code in\nrendering good results versus possible errors in the value of the\ndiversity . This concern arises from the possibility of having during\nthe flight unexpected peaks in the temperature fluctuation, out of the\nrange predicted by the thermal model.\n\nTo clarify this question, we have designed the following numerical\nexperiment: in the inversion process we will take for the diversity the\nexpected nominal operative value 8.51 mm, whereas in the degradation\nprocess, we will assign to the diversity a different value thus\nsimulating an unexpected temperature peak which we are not aware of.\n\nIn the first realization of the Experiment we have selected for the\ndegradation process a rather large diversity value (12 mm) as compared\nwith the nominal one used in the inversion (8.51 mm). Always within our\nstandard range of analysis (i.e.\u00a0for rms-ripple @xmath 2\/60 and rms-LOA\n@xmath 1\/4 waves), the inversion produces over-restoration: rms @xmath\nranging from 17.5 to 20.7 %, mean @xmath from 2.6 to 5.5 % and rms\n@xmath from 3.6 to 7.1 %. Also the retrieved Zernike coefficients,\nparticularly @xmath , differ substantially from the reference values. A\ncurious result is that the values obtained for @xmath are larger than\nthose corresponding to the Experiment 3 by a roughly constant amount of\nabout 0.1 waves, corresponding to a defocus distance of @xmath 3 mm,\nsimilar to the diversity error (3.49 mm). It seems like if the error in\nthe diversity would have misled the PD-algorithm in such a way that this\nerror is now ascribed to the image in nominal focus position, in the\nform of defocus aberration. This could explain the resulting\nover-restoration mentioned above. Since this is an extreme experiment\nconsidering diversity values far away from the IMaX case, we do not\ndisplay the results.\n\nIn a second and more realistic numerical experiment we have selected a\ndiversity of 9 mm for the degradation process whereas we have kept the\nnominal value for the inversion. Thus, the error introduced, 9.00 - 8.51\n= 0.49 mm, is greater by a factor of 10 than the expected peak variation\nof the diversity ( @xmath 0.05 mm) according to the IMaX thermal model\n(Table 2.6 ). Even so, the PD-inversion gives very similar values to\nthose in Experiment 3 (compare rows (a) to (f) in Figures 2.24 and 2.27\n). However, small discrepancies can be detected in the retrieved Zernike\ncoefficients, from the comparison of Figures 2.25 and 2.28 . In\nparticular, the bullet-dotted line for @xmath in the latter figure is\nshifted upwards by @xmath 0.015 waves ( @xmath 0.44 mm of defocus\ndistance) with respect to the corresponding line in the former figure.\nAgain we find that the error in the knowledge of the real diversity is\ntransferred to the budget of real aberrations in the system, in the form\nof a defocus error. Nevertheless, in this case, the impact on the\nrestorations can be consider as negligible since we get very similar\nresults to those obtained in Experiment 3.\n\nThe repercussion of the discrepancies between the results of Experiments\n1, 2, 3 and 4,are very subtle as to be easily detected by comparing the\nFigures 2.17 , 2.20 , 2.23 and 2.26 .\n\n###### Case of IMaX\n\nAccording to the aberrations estimated from laboratory measurements and\nrealistic models, the case of IMaX fits into Experiment 3 for rms-ripple\n@xmath 2\/60 and rms-LOA = 1\/5 waves. This implies a loss of contrast of\n@xmath 5 % of the real value and rms @xmath @xmath 3 % (see Figure 2.24\n). Figure 2.29 ( left panel ) shows the diffraction limited MTF ( solid\nline ) for SUNRISE. The dotted line is the MTF @xmath representing the\npixel integration effect in the CCD. The dashed line is a section of the\nMTF resulting from the total error contribution estimated for the IMaX\nimages including also the CCD pixel integration effect. The central\ndepression in the MTF profile is very sensitive to the significance of\nLOA in such a way that it can almost reach a zero level at some\nparticular spatial frequencies (see right panel in Figure 2.29 ). These\nsingularities complicate the construction of the noise filter (see\nsection\u00a0\u00a71.3.2) to be applied in the restoration process.\n\nFigure 2.30 is a comparative plot of the Zernike coefficients used for\ndegrading the images (from index 4 to 36) and those retrieved from the\ninversion process (from index 4 to 25).\n\n#### 2.6 Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter, a method for in-flight calibration of aberrations in\nIMaX has been proposed. The method is based on the Phase Diversity (PD)\ninversion procedure.\n\nThe robustness of the method has been tested by numerical experiments\nsimulating different aberration components. The sources of aberration\nhave been modelled and added in subsequent experiments. The repercussion\nof every new added ingredient in the final result from the inversion has\nbeen evaluated.\n\nThe PD-code does not accurately reproduce the shape of the wavefront\nerrors but provides reliable OTFs for subsequent satisfactory\nrestorations.\n\nSmall-scale irregularities in the wavefront error are not detectable by\nthe PD-code where a finite (rather low) number of Zernike terms is used.\nThis limitation mainly produces stray-light all over the restored image\nand consequently a loss of contrast. This effect is tolerable within\ncertain margins, and fixes constraints to the polishing quality in the\nmain mirror of the SUNRISE\u2019s telescope and to the inhomogeneities in the\netalon of IMaX.\n\nThe inhomogeneities in the transmission function of the etalon are\nconverted by the inversion process into some extra errors in the\nresulting wavefront which partially compensate for the loss of contrast\ncaused by the high-order aberrations terms non-sensed by the PD-code.\n\nExperiment 3 (see Table 2.7 ) includes all the error sources assumed as\nsignificant for IMaX, and the results of its inversions can be\nconsidered reliable enough as to validate the method proposed for the\ncalibration of errors in the images of IMaX, at least for aberrations\nlying in the range: rms-ripple @xmath 2\/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1\/4 waves.\nThe case of IMaX, with the expected values of rms-ripple @xmath 2\/60 and\nrms-LOA @xmath 1\/5 waves, is included in this range of aberrations and,\nconsequently, the calibration method is applicable to IMaX.\n\nFor the case of IMaX, the residual errors in the proposed calibration\nmethod induce, in turn, errors in the subsequent restoration: mean\n@xmath @xmath 2.5 %, rms @xmath @xmath 3.3 %, and a loss of rms contrast\n@xmath 5 %.\n\nThe amount of defocus (also named diversity ) produced by the PD-plate\nis a critical parameter in order for the PD-algorithm to work optimally.\nWe have got acceptable results for errors in the diversity of @xmath 5\n%.\n\n## Part II Study of proper motions in solar active regions\n\n### Chapter 3 Solar active regions \\dropping\n\n[0pt]2The second part of this thesis, devoted to the study of solar\nactive regions, is introduced in this chapter based on the revision of\nliterature published on this topic. Information about solar active\nregions is firstly presented starting from the historical point of view,\nsecondly going into the theoretical and observational framework and\nfinally reviewing the state-of-the-art in the research on the dynamics\nand evolution of photospheric structures around sunspots.\n\n#### 3.1 Introduction\n\nThe importance of the Sun for humankind is more than justified as well\nas the research on solar physics in which the Sun appears to be a\nfabulous laboratory to study multitude of phenomena and fundamental\nprocesses in astrophysics. By the analysis of the radiation ( photons )\ncoming from the different layers of the Sun (see Figure 3.1 ) scientists\nhave been able to figure out a large amount of information about the\nunderlying physics behind our closest star. Telescopes and solar\ninstrumentation have played an important role since the very first\nground-based observations up to the more recent space telescopes and\nfuture missions trying to untangle the behavior of the Sun. The Sun as a\nvariable star experiences a changing magnetic activity framed in what is\ncalled the solar cycle. The main cycle is composed by two consecutive 11\nyears cycles and represents a reversal of the global magnetic field. The\nsolar cycle is evidenced by the variation of the number of sunspots,\nnumber of solar flares and solar irradiance among other parameters.\nMagnetism then dominates the Sun\u2019s behavior and can be studied in more\ndetail than in any other stellar body. The vast majority of light\nleaving the Sun and reaching us (approx. 8 minutes later) comes from the\nphotosphere, a thin layer of about 500 km of thickness (sort of 0.04\n@xmath of the solar radius) that is actually the densest part of the\nsolar atmosphere, composed by convective cells known as solar\ngranulation. Underneath the photosphere, convection is taking place\ncarrying the energy released by thermonuclear fusion in the solar core.\nPlasma motions in the underlying convection zone are therefore driving\nthe dynamical behavior of the photosphere and reveal through the\ngranulation pattern.\n\n#### 3.2 Sunspots\n\nSunspots are the most evident manifestation of the solar activity and of\nthe solar cycle. They are related to the majority of violent phenomena\noccurring in the solar external layers and moreover a clear sign of the\nmagnetism effects in the dynamics and structure of our closest star.\nSolar active regions (sunspots and plages) are labeled for\nidentification by consecutive numbers as they appear on the visible\nsolar disk. One of the most widely used identifiers is the NOAA\n(National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) catalogue. Many\nimportant facts about the sunspots have been studied for many years and\nwe have learned things about its nature, origin and evolution, but there\nare still fundamental questions we are willing to clarify. One of the\nimportant issues about sunspots was to discover that they were the first\nastronomical object known to harbor a magnetic field ( Hale , 1908 ) .\n\nSunspots are nowadays interpreted as complex structures having strong\nmagnetic fields that inhibit the plasma convection reducing therefore\nthe efficiency in the convective energy transport. The temperature of\nsunspots is for this reason lower than that in the surrounding\nphotosphere. They are seen as black entities when comparing it with the\noutside brightness but actually the temperature inside sunspots goes up\nto 5000 K.\n\nStudy of sunspots is important because they are connected to intense and\nexplosive phenomena in the chromosphere and solar corona. Coronal loops,\nfor instance, are magnetic lines anchored to sunspots that after mutual\ninteraction and reconnection liberate strong amounts of energy in the\nform of the so-called flares and coronal mass ejections (CME). The\nreleased energy travels millions of kilometers before interacting with\nthe Earth\u2019s atmosphere and affecting the terrestrial communications and\norbiting satellites. Clarifying the sunspots internal structure and\ntheir physical processes is demanding to understand and predict the\nsolar activity and its influence on Earth.\n\n#### 3.3 Historical overview\n\nThe first observations of sunspots on the solar surface brought another\nview regarding the incorruptibility of heavens so that at the beginning\nmany astronomers rejected to believe that sunspots were actually\nattached to the Sun. J. Fabricius was the first to write a book on\nsunspots in 1611 ( Fabricius , MDCXI ) and independently C. Scheiner\nclaimed to observe sunspots the same year associating them to orbiting\nobjects ( Scheiner , 1623-30 ) . Scheiner is also regarded as the first\nwho evidences velocity fields in the solar photosphere noting that\nsunspots near the equator traverse the solar disc faster than those at\nhigher latitudes. Galileo associated the sunspots to a sort of thick\nclouds sharing the solar rotation, as dense that they were able to block\nthe Sun\u2019s light. He was the first that used the terminology of solar\nlatitude and longitude to locate sunspots on the Sun. Galileo\u2019s accurate\nobservations using a rather good telescope for the time being, allowed\nhim to look at many details on the solar surface. He was also the first\nto discover brighter zones which he called faculae . But it was not\nuntil Keppler that sunspots were indeed put right on the solar surface (\nKeppler , 1955 ) . Keppler had first postulated that the Sun should\nrotate in less than three months but later on reduced the rotating\nperiod to just one day. After proving by means of geometrical arguments\nthat Scheiner was wrong when considering the behavior of sunspots at the\nsolar limb, Keppler settled the question, being convinced that spots are\non the Sun as we all know now.\n\nSunspots observations continued in the XVII century although there is a\nlapse from 1645 to 1715 where a very few sunspots were observed. This\nfact is known as the Maunder minimum and corresponds to a time period in\nwhich the Earth suffered from very low temperatures and cold winters\nthat are associated to the reduction of the solar activity. Nowadays,\nthe Sun is still affecting us directly and indirectly and the Sun\u2018s\nchanging magnetic behavior has an influence on the solar neighborhood\nclimate.\n\nMore solar properties and parameters, as the solar axis inclination and\ndifferential rotation rate were inferred by Carrington ( 1859 ) and\nconfirmed by several studies afterwards. The dynamics of the plasma in\nthe solar photosphere was found to show several convective patterns at\ndifferent spatial scales. In addition to the granular pattern (with\ntypical diameters of 150-2500 km), the mesogranular one at intermediate\nscales (5-10 Mm) and the supergranular one at large scales (over 20 Mm)\norganize the plasma in a sort of hierarchical convective structure.\nThere is still an open debate concerning the nature, origin and\nstructure of these convective patterns.\n\nFor a more extensive and detailed historical review on observations of\nsunspots see Casanovas ( 1997 ) and references therein.\n\n#### 3.4 Structure of sunspots\n\nThe responsible for the origin and structure of sunspots is believed to\nbe the deep-seated toroidal (azimuthally oriented) magnetic flux in the\nsolar interior ( Sch\u00fcssler et al , 2002 ) . This magnetic flux is\nthought to be situated between the convective zone and the radiative\ninterior and increases by means of a dynamo action up to the formation\nof a kind of instability. The eruption of flux leads to the formation of\n@xmath -shaped magnetic loops coming up to higher layers, therefore\nreaching the convective zone and emerging through the solar surface as\nactive regions ( Zwaan , 1992 ) . Summarizing this idea, what we have is\nthat the magnetic field generated underneath the convective zone in the\nSun, emerges to the solar surface forming sunspot groups and active\nregions and spreads around its surface through convective mechanisms.\n\nDiverse models for sunspots have been proposed through the years such as\nthe cluster model and the monolithic model. On the one hand the cluster\n( spaghetti ) model developed by Parker ( 1979 ) in which the magnetic\nfield divides into many separate flux tubes in the first few Mm below\nthe surface. On the other hand the monolithic model by Cowling ( 1957 )\nestablishes that the magnetic field underneath the solar surface is\nconfined to a single flux tube and the plasma flows crossing it are\nprohibited.\n\nSunspots, as complex magnetic structures embedded in a convective\nplasma, show many active and changing features on multiple scales.\nConvective flows and large-scale plasma circulation plays an important\nrole in the dynamics and evolution of solar active regions (see, e.g.,\nSchrijver & Zwann , 2000 )\n\nImportant physical processes are present in sunspots, some of them at\nspatial-scales beyond the resolution limit of the current solar\ntelescopes. In the last years and using the latest restoration\ntechniques and advances in adaptive optics, the complex magnetic and\ndynamic structure of sunspots have been unveiled in some detail.\nNevertheless, there are many important questions concerning them that\nremain unanswered yet.\n\n##### 3.4.1 Umbra\n\nThe umbra is the central dark area that corresponds to the coolest part\nof a sunspot. The temperature inside the umbra is low ( @xmath 3500-5000\nK) due to the presence of a strong magnetic field that inhibits the\nconvective energy transport underneath ( Biermann , 1941 ) . The\nmagnetic field orientation inside the umbra is vertical respect to the\nsolar surface and becomes slightly inclined when approaching the\numbra-penumbral boundary. Larger sunspots with bigger umbrae exhibit a\nmore intense magnetic field strength and the range inside umbrae goes\nfrom 2000 to 3500 Gauss in average. The energy radiation in the umbra is\nroughly 20 @xmath of the photospheric value.\n\nAlthough the umbra seems to be completely dark and with non internal\nstructure, when observed in high-resolution, a lot of fine features in\nits interior can be detected, for instance the umbral dots which are\nbright dots with sizes of about 0.2-0.5 arc seconds and hotter than the\numbral background. These features are still under study to clarify and\nconfirm whether they are related to convective phenomena transporting\nsome sort of flow. Light bridges are other structures inside the umbra\nthat look like luminous streaks or narrow bands with different ages and\nsizes.\n\n##### 3.4.2 Penumbra\n\nThe penumbra is the filamentary and deeply-rooted (thick) structure in a\nsunspot that forms the ring-shaped part surrounding the umbra, where a\nsignificant part of the total magnetic flux is carried ( Schmidt , 1991\n; Thomas & Weiss , 1992 ) . The penumbra is seen in continuum images as\nradial alternating bright and dark filaments (e.g. Collados, del Toro\nIniesta & V\u00e1zquez , 1988 ) and exhibits an intermediate brightness\nbetween the umbra and the quiet photosphere (see also the reviews by del\nToro Iniesta , 2001 ; Solanki , 2003 ) . Figure 3.2 shows some high\nresolution images taken with the SST in La Palma, where we can see the\nintricate filamentary structure of the penumbra and the fine features\ninside and around pores.\n\nMagnetic field is in general stronger in the inner part closest to the\numbra and decreases in the outer frontier and its energy radiation is\napproximately 75 @xmath the photospheric value. The picture of the fine\nstructure of the penumbra has not always been the same but evolved\nduring the last years. Nowadays it is commonly accepted that the\npenumbral magnetic field is uncombed so that at least two different\ninclinations of the magnetic field coexist on a small scale in a sort of\ninterlocking structure (see Figure 3.3 ).\n\nThe main two distinct inclinations correspond to the component where the\nmagnetic field is tilted by @xmath 40-50 degrees (with respect to the\nvertical to the solar surface) with a strength of @xmath 2000 G, and the\ncomponent in which the magnetic field is almost horizontal and weaker (\nLites et al , 1993 ) . Vertical magnetic inclinations were first\nassociated to bright filaments whereas the more horizontal ones to dark\nfilaments though nowadays this picture has changed significantly since\nthe discovery of two narrow lateral brightenings located at each side of\nthe central obscuration, as will be commented below.\n\nRecent works using high-resolution images have improved the measurements\nof the field inclination in the penumbral filaments ( Bello et al , 2005\n; Langhans et al , 2005 ) . Results from full-Stokes profiles have\nconfirmed and firmly established that variations of inclination and\nfield strength are indeed present in sunspot penumbrae, and moreover\nthey are anti-correlated: the less inclined components (known as spines\n) have stronger magnetic field than the more horizontal ones (know as\nintraspines , Lites et al , 1993 ) . In the intraspines, some flux tubes\n(collection of multiple magnetic field lines) overtake the external\npenumbral border ( Sainz Dalda & Mart\u00ednez Pillet , 2005 ) whereas some\nother immerse below the surface due to the turbulent effect of the\ngranular convection pushing them downwards ( Westendorp Plaza et al. ,\n1997 ; Thomas et al , 2002 ) . We will come back again to this topic.\n\nAlthough many unknowns have been unveiled, there are still many\nfundamental and unanswered questions such as why sunspots have a\npenumbra and how it is maintained for a few days before it disappears. A\nlot of internal structure has been resolved in penumbral filaments and\nthey seem to be composed by a dark core accompanied by a bright halo at\nboth sides. This new features named dark-cored penumbral filaments,\nrecently discovered by Scharmer et al. ( 2002 ) , have brought great\ninterest as they can unveil the very fundamental influence of\nmagnetoconvection at small scales occurring in sunspot penumbrae. At the\nbeginning of the filament, the dark core is not present and the lateral\nbrightenings merge into a larger bright structure known as penumbral\ngrains (PG) that seems to move radially in the penumbra.\n\nSeveral authors have worked on this new observational evidence to\ninvestigate on the fine structure of the penumbra and nowadays there\nsome models of the penumbral fine structure trying to explain all\ndiverse phenomena. Firsly, the most mentioned and confronted one, the\nuncombed model proposed by Solanki & Montavon ( 2003 ) in which the\npenumbra is seen as a collection of horizontal flux tubes embedded in an\nalmost vertical and strong background magnetic field. Numerical\nsimulations of the temporal evolution of flux tubes (the moving-tube\nmodel of Schlichenmaier, Jahn & Schmidt , 1998a , b ) have modelled them\nstarting at the magnetopause, then rising adiabatically as a result of\nradiative heating, by magnetic buoyancy, and eventually being bent into\nthe horizontal where they cool down due to radiative losses while\ncontinue outward from the center of the spot. Recently, some new\nobservational and theoretical works support the uncombed model \u00b9 \u00b9 1\nAlso known as embedded flux tube model. (e.g. M\u00fcller et al , 2002 ;\nBellot Rubio et al. , 2003 ; Borrero et al , 2005 ; Bellot Rubio et al ,\n2007 ; Jur\u010d\u00e1k & Bellot Rubio , 2008 ; Ruiz Cobo & Bellot Rubio , 2008 )\n. A second model has been proposed by Spruit & Scharmer ( 2006 ) , the\nso-called gappy penumbral model (see also Scharmer & Spruit , 2006 ) .\nThese authors interpret the penumbral filaments as due to convection in\nfield-free, radially aligned gaps below the surface of the penumbra and\nargue that this solves the discrepancy between the large heat flux and\nthe low velocities present in penumbra or, in other words, that their\nmodel can explain the heating of the penumbra. Apart from these two\nmodels, alternative ones have come out on the scene based on\nMIcro-Structured Magnetic Atmosphere (MISMA, S\u00e1nchez Almeida , 1998 ,\n2005 ) . These models assume that the penumbra is formed by optically\nthin magnetic fibrils a few km in diameter and moreover that every\nresolution element contains a bunch of unorganized field lines with\nrandom strengths and inclinations. In general, all models have some\nproblems (see Bellot Rubio , 2007 ) and the debate is not sealed yet.\n\nNew features and fine-scale structures have been recently observed\nthanks to the improvements in the real-time and post-facto correction of\nthe images. It is likely that inside dark cores there is more unseen\nfine structure. This new structures will add more ingredients to this\nalready complicated scenario.\n\nThe penumbra not only shows an intricate magnetic structure but also a\ncomplex dynamics. The PGs for instance, are moving in two privileged\ndirections, radially towards the umbra in the inner penumbra with\nvelocities of the order of 500 m s @xmath ( Muller , 1976 ) and towards\nthe surrounding photosphere in the outer penumbra ( Sobotka et al. ,\n1999 ; Sobotka & S\u00fctterlin , 2001 ) . The line dividing both distinct\ndirections of movement is placed at a distance from the outer penumbral\nborder of about one third of the total penumbra longitude. Some of the\nPGs cross the penumbra-photosphere boundary and continue to move in the\ngranulation as small bright features ( Bonet et al. , 2004 ) .\n\nApart from the radial proper motions of PGs, M\u00e1rquez, S\u00e1nchez-Almeida &\nBonet ( 2006 ) find, by using local correlation tracking techniques,\nthat radial motions diverge away from bright filaments to converge\ntoward dark filaments, leading to an association between downflows and\ndark features that could be a sign of convection in penumbra. This\nresult is reinforced by S\u00e1nchez Almeida et al. ( 2007 ) on the basis of\nspectroscopic measurements, with high-angular resolution, of the\nEvershed effect (see next section).\n\n##### 3.4.3 Evershed flow\n\nThe Evershed Flow (hereafter EF) is associated to an observational\neffect in the penumbra registered as a global wavelength shift for\nspectral lines forming in the penumbra of sunspots. There are actually\ntwo kinds of EF registered: 1) the normal EF at photospheric level where\nblueshifts are observed in the penumbra on the sunspot side close to the\nsolar disc center whereas redshifts are detected on the sunspot side\ntowards the solar limb. It corresponds to mainly radial and horizontal\nflows traveling in the penumbra of the sunspots towards the external\nphotosphere; 2) at chromospheric level, the so-called inverse EF, where\nthe material flows towards the umbra, contrary to the normal EF and much\nless studied so far. From here forth, we will focus on the normal EF.\n\nThis effect was first observed by Evershed in 1909 ( Evershed , 1909 )\nat Kodaikanal Observatory in India and is interpreted as a Doppler\nshifting caused by the radial and predominantly horizontal flow along\nthe penumbra. The EF has been interpreted as a siphon flow along\nmagnetic flux tubes ( Meyer & Schmidt , 1968 ; Thomas , 1988 ) .\n\nThere have been several studies trying to explain the properties and\nnature of the EF in the last forty years (e.g. Haugen , 1969 ; Maltby ,\n1975 ; Moore , 1981 ; Dialetis, Mein & Alissandrakis , 1985 ; Dere,\nSchmieder & Alissandrakis , 1990 ) . For a very recent review the reader\nis referred to the work by Bellot Rubio ( 2007 ) .\n\nIn more recent studies and helped by high-resolution observations, it\nhas been confirmed that there is a strong correlation between the EF and\nthe horizontal magnetic fields in the penumbra. It is the expected\nbehavior as resulted from magnetohydrodynamical considerations that\nrequire for the flow to be aligned respect to the magnetic field lines (\nBellot Rubio et al. , 2003 ) . Rimmele ( 1995 ) found that the EF is\nconfined in thin channels which elevate upon the continuum level over\nthe vast majority of the penumbra. The last result has been afterwards\nconfirmed in different observations. It has also been found that some of\nthese channels and their associated field lines re-enter the solar\nsurface in the outermost part of the penumbra and beyond ( Westendorp\nPlaza et al. , 1997 ; Schlichenmaier & Schmidt , 2000 ) . Some recent\nresults indicate that the EF does not end abruptly at the white-light\nsunspot boundary, but that at least part of it continues beyond the\nvisible boundary and forms an extensive magnetic canopy (e.g. Solanki,\nMontavon & Livingston , 1994 ; Rezaei et al , 2006 ) . The existence of\nradial outflow in the sunspot canopy is still an ongoing debate.\n\n#### 3.5 Photosphere surrounding sunspots\n\nSunspots are immersed in the convective plasma as mentioned above, and\nthis plasma is observed mainly as granulation. Granulation is the first\npattern that can be identified when looking at the solar photosphere and\ncovers the vast majority of its surface. Figure 3.4 shows the underneath\nconvective pattern mechanism forming the granulation that we see on the\nphotospheric layer. In the inter-granular lanes we can detect the\npresence of magnetic flux coming from below, sometimes visible as bright\nand elongated structures as shown in the high-spatial resolution image\nin Figure 3.4 .\n\nThe granulation convective pattern surrounding sunspots is perturbed by\nthe presence of magnetic elements that move radially outwards through an\nannular cell called the \u201dmoat\u201d. Next sections comment on the physical\nproperties of these magnetic structures and on the plasma flows around\nsunspots.\n\n##### 3.5.1 Moving Magnetic Features\n\nThe Moving Magnetic Features (MMFs) are bright features that correspond\nto small magnetic elements of mixed polarity traveling radially outwards\nwhile immersed in the granulation surrounding sunspots ( Sheeley , 1972\n; Harvey & Harvey , 1973 ; Hagenaar & Shine , 2005 , for a recent\nreview) . These features move with velocities of some hundredths of\nmeters per second up to 3 km s @xmath and can be generally classified in\nthree main groups, as follows:\n\n-    Type I: Bipolar pairs of magnetic elements moving together outwards\n    the sunspot inside the moat, with velocities in a range between 0.5\n    a 1 km s @xmath . They appear just outside the penumbra along\n    directions that are extensions of the dark penumbral filaments.\n    These bipolar pairs are interpreted as being footpoints of a loop\n    emerging to the solar surface belonging to a penumbral flux tube in\n    which there is a strong vertical convection. The loop is then swept\n    away by the moat flow. Several loops can emerge in different\n    positions and different times along the same flux tube and this\n    mechanism is seen when successive MMF Type I tend to follow similar\n    trajectories across the moat region. As long as the flux tube is\n    attached to the sunspot, this type of MMFs associated to the tube\n    are not responsible for the sunspot decay. Figure 3.5 shows the\n    diverse interpretations of bipolar type I MMFs ( Yurchyshyn et al ,\n    2001 ; Wilson , 1973 ; Harvey & Harvey , 1973 ) .\n\n-    Type II: Consist of unipolar magnetic elements with the same\n    polarity as the parent sunspot that are shed from the sunspot\n    border, moving across the moat with velocities of 2 and 3 km s\n    @xmath . They are interpreted to be flux tubes that have been\n    separated from the main flux and are dragged by the moat. The loss\n    of flux represented by this features is a possible mechanism\n    involved in the sunspot decay ( Hagenaar & Shine , 2005 ) .\n    Nevertheless, further investigations should be done to know whether\n    or not this type of MMFs is more common in rapidly decaying\n    sunspots.\n\n-    Type III: The last type of MMFs are also unipolar features but in\n    this case with magnetic polarity opposite to that of the parent\n    sunspot, having high velocities in a range similar to that of the\n    Type II. They are more transitory than the first two types and\n    travel outward a few thousand km before disappearing, and are\n    thought to be produced when a flux tube section emerges to the\n    surface generating a rapid horizontal displacement of the footpoints\n    in the moat.\n\n##### 3.5.2 Moat flow\n\nThe existence of an annular region around sunspots was first reported by\nSheeley ( 1969 ) who termed it moat . Radially oriented outflows in\nmoats were found by Sheeley & Bhatnagar ( 1971 ) .\n\nThe sunspot moat defines an organized horizontal flow pattern that ends\nquite abruptly at a distance that can be comparable to supergranular\nsizes or even larger. Sheeley ( 1972 ) reported Doppler speed of these\noutflows 0.5\u00a0-\u00a01.0 km s @xmath for distances 10-20 Mm beyond the outer\nboundary of the sunspot. Brickhouse & Labonte ( 1988 ) performed a study\nof the properties of moats and concluded that the moat radius is roughly\nproportional to the penumbral radius.\n\nThe characteristics and temporal evolution of moats derived at two\nheights in the atmosphere for a large sample of sunspots with different\nsizes, shapes and evolutionary stages have been recently studied by\nSobotka & Roudier ( 2007 ) . These authors establish a relation between\nsunspot types and their occurrence, areas, and horizontal velocities of\nthe moats in the photosphere and in the transition region and found that\nmoats do not show substantial changes for periods of about 12 hours.\nTable 3.1 lists the averaged horizontal velocities inside and outside\nthe moat for young and old spots and Figures 3.6 and 3.7 show plots (for\nyoung and old spots) of the maximum moat radius versus the sunspot\nradius, and the average azimuthal distribution of the the moat area and\nvelocities respectively.\n\nBonet et al. ( 2005 ) have found that MMFs in the moats are mostly\nlocated in radially oriented channels between the local divergent\nmotions of mesogranular scale. This motions confine the MMFs within the\nchannels. They also found that most MMFs move passively with the same\naverage speeds as the neighbouring granules, that is, they are carried\nalong by the same large-scale moat flows as the granules. However, a\nsmall fraction of them (6%) move away from the spot more rapidly (they\nreach velocities grater than 1.4 km s @xmath ) than the neighbouring\ngranules which can be interpreted as the consequence of interactions\nwith fast moving small granular fronts or fragments.\n\nNew findings ( Sainz Dalda & Mart\u00ednez Pillet , 2005 ) have shown that\nthe penumbral filaments extend beyond the sunspot boundary entering the\nregion dominated by the moat flow where the MMF activity is detected.\nThus, the temporal average of magnetograms has unveiled the existence of\nmoat filaments: horizontal, filamentary structures coming from the\npenumbra and reaching the photospheric network as an extension of the\npenumbral filaments. Moreover, some MMF have been found ( Sainz Dalda &\nMart\u00ednez Pillet , 2005 ; Ravindra , 2006 ; Cabrera Solana et al. , 2006\n) starting just inside the outer penumbral boundary in its way out from\nthe sunspot (see Figures 3.8 and 3.9 ). Kubo et al. ( 2007 ) have\nrecently established a relationship between the vertical component\n(spines) of the magnetic field in the so-called uncombed structure of\nthe penumbra (section\u00a0\u00a7 3.4.2 ) and MMFs (with the same polarity as the\nsunspot) observed in the moat regions.\n\n### Chapter 4 Proper motions in a complex active region \\dropping\n\n[0pt]2This chapter is the first one devoted to the analysis of solar\nobservations, showing the results from the application of the image\nrestoration process commented in the former part of the thesis. The\nstudy is based on ground-based observations of a complex @xmath\n-configuration solar active region in which we performed a detailed\nanalysis of proper motions at photospheric level describing the dynamics\nof the plasma in the FOV. Some results presented in this chapter are an\nextensive version of Vargas Dom\u00ednguez et al. ( 2007 ) .\n\n#### 4.1 Introduction\n\nSunspots that contain umbrae of opposite magnetic polarity within a\nsingle penumbrae are known as @xmath -configuration sunspots. They are\ncomplex active regions that usually evolve rapidly and are likely to\nproduce energetic solar flares ( Zirin & Wang , 1989 ) . The present\nchapter is based on an excellent @xmath 79 minutes time series of a\nsunspot group with a @xmath -configuration. The long duration of the\nseries, besides the high and stable quality throughout the entire\nperiod, substantially improved after image reconstruction, make of this\nmaterial an excellent data set to study morphology and dynamical\nbehavior of sunspots and their surroundings. We are interested here in\nthe relation between the existence of penumbra in this active region and\nthe dynamics of the convective plasma surrounding it. The proper motions\ninside penumbrae are also analyzed and a statistical study between the\ndifferent regions over the FOV is performed.\n\n#### 4.2 Observations\n\nThe first observing campaign I was involved in at the Swedish 1 m Solar\nTelescope (SST \u00b9 \u00b9 1 The SST is operated by the Institute for Solar\nPhysics (ISP) of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at the Roque de\nlos Muchachos Observatory in La Palma, Canary Islands. , Scharmer et al.\n, 2003a ) corresponding to the so-called Spanish Time \u00b2 \u00b2 2 The Spanish\nTime corresponds to the 20% of the total observing time at the\nObservatories of the Canary Islands, assigned to Spain by the\ninstitutions the telescopes belongs to, by virtue of the International\nAgreements on Cooperation in Astrophysics . , was held in April 2004.\nDuring this campaign I was particularly interested on becoming familiar\nwith the instrumentation, software and observing techniques that have\nbeen in constant evolution and development in recent years. Moreover,\nthe observed images were used to test the restoration algorithms (see\nchapter\u00a0\u00a71).\n\nThe second observing campaign was held at the SST in July 2005 and\ncorresponded to the so-called International Time Program (ITP) \u00b3 \u00b3 3\nPeriod corresponding to the 5% of the total observing time (see previous\nfootnote), aimed to promote astrophysical research in cooperation with\nvarious telescopes and institutions. . In this framework, several\nJapanese scientists came to the Canary Observatories \u2074 \u2074 4 Observatorio\ndel Teide (OT) in Tenerife and Observatorio Roque de los Muchachos (ORM)\nin La Palma. for a joint programme of simultaneous observations using\nvarious solar telescopes: the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT), the Solar\nSwedish Telescope (SST), the Dutch Open Telescope (DOT), and the\nsatellites Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) and Solar and\nHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The observations were focused on\ntargets displaying solar active regions and, in particular, regions\ninside and around sunspots where various magnetic features (e.g.\u00a0MMFs,\nsee section\u00a0\u00a73.4) are widely observed. The SST and the DOT were devoted\nto imaging, pursuing observations of the photosphere and chromosphere\nwith high -spatial and -temporal resolutions. The main objective of\nthese coordinated observations was to figure out what kind of magnetic\nfeatures in the photosphere\/chromosphere are responsible for\nquasi-steady heating and enhanced activities well observed in the active\ncorona.\n\n##### 4.2.1 Instrumentation and setup\n\nThe work and results presented in all this chapter are based on the\nobservations done at the SST (during the ITP collaboration, see Figure\n4.1 ), using the adaptive optics (AO) system. The AO system has a\nbi-morph mirror equipped with 37 electrodes and a Shack-Hartmann\nwavefront sensor with 37 microlenses. A thin-film filter (dichroic\nfilter) separates the light in two beams,the blue and the red beams. The\nblue beam for imaging and the red one to feed a longitudinal\nmagnetograph (the SOUP Tunable Filter that will be described in detail\nlater on). Table 4.1 enumerates the main characteristics of the\ntelescope.\n\nIn order to apply the restoration techniques described in chapter\u00a0\u00a71 we\nrecorded two objects : images in G-band \u2075 \u2075 5 Spectral band of molecular\nlines at @xmath 430.5 nm. and G-cont \u2076 \u2076 6 Relatively clear continuum,\nclose to the G-band, at @xmath 436.3 nm. . The setup included then, for\nthe blue beam, two channels taking simultaneous images. In the first\nchannel, G-cont ( @xmath 436.3 nm, FWHM=1.15 nm), two Kodak Megaplus 1.6\nCCD cameras with a 10-bits dynamical range and 1536 @xmath 1024 pixels\nwere employed, as corresponding to the PD focus-defocus image-pair. The\ndefocus image was generated by moving backwards the camera a certain\ndistance to generate a larger optical path in comparison to the focus\none, hence inducing a known amount of defocus. The second channel was\ndevoted to G-band ( @xmath 430.5 nm, FWHM=1.08 nm). The pixel size of\nthe cameras was 0 041 square.\n\nApart from the two above described, a third independent channel\n(asynchronous respect to G-band and G-cont) was acquiring reference\nimages in the Ca\u00a0II\u00a0H line ( @xmath 396.9 nm, FWHM=0.3 nm). Table 4.2\ngroups the main characteristics for the blue channel.\n\nFigure 4.2 shows the setup with all the optical elements used in the\nconfiguration we mounted for the campaign. The optical paths and\ninstruments employed by the adaptive optics system are drawn in red in\nthe figure. On the right-hand side, the blue beam includes the PD\nimage-pair (G-cont), the G-band channel (synchronized with G-cont by\nmeans of a chopper ) and the independent Ca\u00a0II\u00a0H channel.\n\nThe Solar Optical Universal Polarimeter (SOUP, Title et al , 1986 )\ntunable filter, owned by the Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics\nLaboratory (LMSAL), was placed along the red beam. This instrument is\nessentially a temperature compensated Lyot filter. It operates by\nrotating a series of linear polarizers and 1\/2-wave retarders placed\nbetween calcite crystal optics. The selected wavelength is adjusted by\ntuning the servo motors for each rotating element to a previously\ncalibrated position. Two bandpass modes, wide ( @xmath 100 m\u00c5) and\nnarrow ( @xmath 100 m\u00c5), are selectable for any given line tuning. The\ncomplete configuration of the SOUP also includes two Liquid Crystal\nVariable Retarders (LCVRs) for measuring the polarization state of the\nincoming light. The SOUP filter is used for observations in the H @xmath\nspectral line that forms in the solar chromosphere and to obtain\nmagnetograms using the magnetically sensitive line Fe I 6302\u00a0\u00c5.\n\nA beam splitter in front of the SOUP divides the light beam to obtain\nsimultaneous images in the continuum near the selected bandwidth. These\nimages, understood as additional objects , will help us to restore the\nnarrow band images (by MOMFBD) and to obtain high-resolution\nmagnetograms.\n\nFigure 4.3 shows the SOUP ( left ) and the science high-resolution\ncameras of the blue beam ( right ) as placed on the optical bench at the\nSST \u2077 \u2077 7 The complete description of the instrumentation and the\nmanuals of operation of the SST can be found in the website\nhttp:\/\/www.solarphysics.kva.se\/LaPalma\/ .\n\n##### 4.2.2 Data acquisition\n\nDuring the period 3-13 July 2005, images were acquired as listed in\nTable 4.3 . The weather conditions at the observatory through all the\ncampaign were quite variable obtaining rather medium quality images\nthough for the observing run on July 9 we were able to record very good\nimages (close to the diffraction limit after restoration) due to an\nexcellent seeing.\n\nOur targets of interest were sunspots in different evolutionary stages\nclose to the solar disc center both, leaders and followers. Within all\nthe images recorded, a post-facto pre-selection was made in order to get\nrid of the data below a certain quality threshold. The quality of the\nimages is quantified by averaging the local gradients in absolute value\ninside a granulation window within the FOV. The quality was measured by\nusing the G-band images as reference. Figure 4.4 shows a plot of the\nquality for the G-band images through the entire observation on July 9,\n2005.\n\nAmong all the acquired data, we decided to work with the best quality\nimages that corresponded to the NOAA Active Region 10786 observed on\nJuly 9, 2005. This complex region, displaying a @xmath -configuration,\nwas placed at heliocentric position @xmath 0.9 as shown in the SOHO\nfull-disk continuum image in Figure 4.5 . The sequences span for more\nthan one hour, from 7:47 UT to 9:06 UT, following the evolution of the\nsunspots.\n\n#### 4.3 Data processing\n\nReal-time corrections with the AO of the telescope and further\npost-processing techniques rendered up images near the diffraction\nlimit. The main steps performed in the processing of the images are\nsequentially detailed in the next sections.\n\n##### 4.3.1 Flatfield and darkfield corrections\n\nStandard procedures for flatfielding and dark-current subtraction were\nfirstly applied. During the observations, apart from the science images,\nwe also acquired the corresponding flat and dark images \u2078 \u2078 8 To improve\nthe SNR, every flat and dark image resulted from real-time averages of\n100 single exposures. The flats were taken while the telescope,\nout-of-focus, scanned the central area of the solar disc at fast speed.\n. The corrections were made by applying the following expression\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the final image after flatfield and dark current\ncorrections, @xmath is the observed raw image, @xmath and @xmath are the\nmean dark and flat images, respectively, and indexes @xmath stand for\nthe pixel position in the image matrix. Special care has been taken\nduring these corrections to eliminate dark and hot pixels, and also the\nblack borders in the flat images, as a crucial step to ensure the images\nwill not be affected by spurious artifacts when applying the restoration\ncode.\n\n##### 4.3.2 Restorations\n\nPost-processing for image restoration was performed by employing the\nMulti-Object Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution (MOMFBD) described in\nsection\u00a0\u00a71.5. In the blue beam, the observing strategy to apply this\ntechnique consisted in taking G-band images and simultaneous G-cont\nphase diversity image-pairs. Sets of about 18 images per channel (i.e.\u00a03\n@xmath 18 images) within a temporal cadence of 10.0517 s, were combined\nto produce a pair of simultaneous G-band and G-cont restored images.\nTable 4.4 shows the information about the images employed in the\nrestoration process.\n\nFollowing this procedure, two time series of reconstructed images were\nproduced: 472 images for each channel, G-band and G-cont, that\ncorrespond to 79 min of continuous solar observation. Figure 4.6\ndisplays an example of the restorations pursued, for one out of the 472\nimage groups processed. The total FOV in the original non-restored\nimages was 63 @xmath 42 \u201d whereas the final FOV in the final restored\nimages was 60 @xmath 40 \u201d.\n\n##### 4.3.3 De-stretching and subsonic filtering\n\nOnce the images were restored, they were, firstly, de-rotated to\ncompensate for diurnal field rotation observed in the focal plane,\ninduced by the alt-azimuthal configuration of the telescope and,\nsecondly, aligned by cross correlation.\n\nAdditional image processing included the so-called de-stretching. The\nstretching or distortion effect on the images, commented in\nsection\u00a0\u00a71.1, consist on differential local displacements over the FOV.\nThey are due to differential deviations from the original tilts in the\nwavefronts coming from different point sources. Atmospheric turbulence\nis the responsible for this problem. The effect is specially strong\nduring the morning time when the line-of-sight (hereafter LOS) to the\nSun is more inclined hence inducing a greater optical thickness in the\nlight path and consequently, a larger atmospheric turbulence\ncontribution.\n\nThus, the stretching is a local effect manifested with different\nstrength at different positions over the FOV and can be corrected at\nmedium- and large-spatial scales by applying local correlation\ntechniques. The local correlation tracking (LCT) technique was\noriginally designed for the removal of distortions in image sequences (\nNovember , 1986 ) and later on, was used to infer the proper motions of\nthe granulation in a time series of white-light images ( November &\nSimon , 1988 ) .\n\nDue to the strong distortion present in our time series, the\nde-stretching algorithm was applied repeatedly in four subsequent steps,\nto completely eliminate residual effects. In every step, the size of the\ncorrelation tracking window was modified from greater to smaller sizes\nto ensure corrections at different spatial scales.\n\nSubsonic filtering is the last stage in the corrections applied to the\nimages and deals with the cleaning process pursued to eliminate high\nfrequency oscillations, such as the p-modes and residual jitter stemming\nfrom de-stretching, in the frequency @xmath domain ( Title et al , 1986\n) . A filter with a phase-velocity threshold of @xmath km s @xmath was\nemployed with satisfactory results (see Figure 4.7 center ). The sharp\ncutoff in the subsonic filter was replaced by a smooth transition from 1\nto 0.\n\nAn apodization in the temporal dimension (8 @xmath of the total length\nat each end) was also applied to minimize border effects in the\nfiltering process. The final product were two movies (G-band and G-cont)\n\u2079 \u2079 9 See the movies at the web site:\nhttp:\/\/www.iac.es\/galeria\/svargas\/movies.html of 428 frames each,\nspanning over 71 min with a cadence of 10.0517 s, and covering a FOV of\n57 8 @xmath 34 4. The time series reached the high-resolution level\nshown in Figure 4.7 ( lower central panel ). This quality is pretty much\nsuitable for subsequent scientific analysis. Figure 4.8 shows the superb\nquality achieved in the best image of the time series.\n\n##### 4.3.4 Maps of displacements\n\nThe LCT method has been commonly used for determining velocity fields in\ntime-resolved image data and was first applied by November & Simon (\n1988 ) to measure proper-motions in solar granulation. Since then,\ndifferent authors have used LCT techniques at many different spatial\nscales to study the solar dynamics, such as long-term evolution and\nflows in supergranulation ( Shine, Simon & Hurlburt , 2000 ; De Rosa,\nDuvall & Toomre , 2000a ) .\n\nThe method is based on a simple but powerful idea that works on the\nprinciple of finding local concordances between two frames (images). A\ncorrelation window selects corresponding sub-areas in both images (the\npatches to be correlated). The selected sub-areas include those\nstructures we want to track, such as solar granules that evolve in time.\nThe displacement vector is given by the difference of the coordinates of\nthe sub-area centers when the best match between them is found.\nMathematically this idea is expressed in terms of a correlation function\nbetween two instants.\n\nThe selection of the sub-areas is performed by means of a window which\nis usually set to be a Gaussian function with a Full-Width at Half\nMaximum (FWHM) adapted to the desired size for the correlation patch and\ndepending on the spatial-scale of the structures we are about to track.\n\nIt is well documented in the literature that LCT-techniques in general\nproduce some systematic errors in the determination of displacements.\nThe nature of the interpolation algorithm to fix the position of the\ncorrelation maximum with sub-pixel accuracy may play a role in the\nresults. The LCT-method typically underestimate the velocity fields.\nTests performed by the authors of the LCT-code we are employing in this\nwork lead to conclude that in the worst cases this underestimation can\namount to 20-30\u00a0% ( Yi , 1992 ; Molowny-Horas , 1994 ) .\n\nFigure 4.9 , taken from November & Simon ( 1988 ) , displays a plot of\nthe precision of the displacement measurements by means of LCT and using\na quadratic interpolation formulae to determine the correlation maximum.\nThese authors have used solar granulation images recorded on\nphotographic film support, digitized at 12 positions with increments of\n0.1 pixel. Then, they have computed displacement maps by comparison with\nthe unshifted image applying their LCT algorithm. Figure 4.9 shows the\nratio between the computed and the real displacements. The former being\nthe average of displacements over the area of each displacement map with\nerror bars representing @xmath .\n\n##### 4.3.5 Magnetograms\n\nIn the red beam, the SOUP tunable birefringent filter working at Fe I\n6302\u00c5\u00a0in combination with a modulator composed by liquid crystal\nretarders, produced longitudinal magnetograms as mentioned above. The\nSOUP filter recorded images in the two flanks of the line at @xmath 50\nm\u00c5\u00a0 from its core. The modulator switched between two states to obtain\n10 left and 10 right circular polarization states (LCP and RCP) at each\nline position. The total time required to record all four-type images\nwas 33 s. A beamsplitter in front of the SOUP filter deflected 10% of\nthe light to obtain broad-band phase diversity image-pairs, that\ncombined with the narrow-band images of the SOUP allowed MOMFBD\nreconstructions. The MOMFBD restoration was therefore performed from\nsubsets of 40 SOUP images including all polarization states and line\npositions, and 40 simultaneously recorded wide-band PD image-pairs, that\nis, a total of 120 images to produce 5 restored ones: @xmath , @xmath ,\n@xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Magnetograms (M) and also Dopplergrams (D)\ncan be generated from the saved restored images by means of the\nfollowing expressions\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe Doppler velocity @xmath is given by: @xmath , where @xmath is a\nconstant to convert Doppler signal to Doppler velocities and is\nestimated to be @xmath km s @xmath by comparing the Doppler signal with\nthe mean LOS Doppler velocity of granules ( @xmath km s @xmath ). The\nFOV of the restored SOUP images is @xmath (with a pixel size of 0 061\npixel @xmath ). Figure 4.10 displays one of the resulting magnetograms\nhaving a spatial resolution of about 0 2.\n\n#### 4.4 Results\n\n##### 4.4.1 General description of proper motions\n\nThe G-band series was employed to study the proper motions of the\nstructures in the FOV by using a LCT algorithm implemented by\nMolowny-Horas & Yi ( 1994 ) . For our analysis, we have preferably\nchosen a Gaussian tracking window with FWHM 0 78 being half of the\ntypical granular size, which is suitable for tracking mainly granules.\n\nWith this code we obtained two maps of horizontal displacements or\nproper motions per time step (i.e.\u00a0the horizontal velocity components\n@xmath and @xmath ), which were averaged in time. Averages of horizontal\nvelocity components were performed over 5-min and 71-min intervals.\n\nFigure 4.11 shows the resulting flow map averaged over the whole series\n(71 min). Moat flows are seen in the spot on the lower left of the FOV\nbut more prominently in the spot on the right side in the upper and\nlower penumbral regions (moats flows will be treated in more detail in\nsection 4.4.2 ). Several centers of diverging horizontal motions are\npresent in the entire FOV. Some of them surround sunspots (lower left\nand right sides of the figure) but the most conspicuous ones are seen in\nthe lesser magnetized area (lower part of the FOV between the spots),\ndisplaying greater velocities and more symmetrical shapes. These\nvelocity structures, related to recurrent expansion and splitting of\ngranules, are commonly associated with mesogranulation ( Roudier et al.\n, 2003 ; Roudier & Muller , 2004 ; Bonet et al. , 2005 ) .\n\nThe white lines in Figure 4.11 delineate the LOS neutral lines inferred\nfrom a SOUP magnetogram (see Figure 4.10 ). The regions crossed by these\nlines correspond naturally to horizontal fields, similar to those found\nin penumbrae. However, we caution that these horizontal fields can have\ndifferent flows as those that occur in normal penumbra (such as shear\nflows, as found by Deng et al. ( 2006 ) or the supersonic nozzles\nobserved by Mart\u00ednez Pillet et al. ( 1994 ) . Close inspection also\nshows that areas near neutral lines have a filamentary appearance that\nis much less distinct than observed in normal penumbrae extending\nradially from umbral cores.\n\nWe measured a mean speed in the granulation outside the moats of @xmath\n0.35 km s @xmath . This small value reflects the presence of high\nmagnetic signal (dense population of pores and G-band bright points all\nover the field), however, it is even smaller than the reported, also for\nmagnetized granulation, by other authors that employ tracking windows of\nsimilar widths ( Berger et al. , 1998 ; Bonet et al. , 2005 ) .\n\nThe region in between the left and right hand side sunspots in the\nactive region under study is indeed a plage region of abnormal granules\nfull of magnetic activity as revealed by Ishikawa et al. ( 2007 ) .\nFigure 4.12 shows the results from these authors working with the\ncentral region of the FOV (in an upside-down position respect to the one\nshown in Figure 4.11 ). The G-band image shows a large amount of bright\nstructures that are selected and marked in white (see Figure 4.12 center\n). These G-band bright points are ubiquitously distributed over the\nwhole plage region and point out the intense magnetic activity in this\nso-called magnetized granulation. The corresponding magnetogram (see\nFigure 4.12 right ) also reveals the magnetic polarities behavior and\nintense activity in the same region.\n\nInside penumbrae the proper motions were studied to infer the systematic\ndirections of the flows. Figure 4.13 shows, with enlarged velocity\nscale, the proper motions inside penumbra using a tracking window FWHM=\n0 78 and averaging over 71 minutes. These displacements do not\nnecessarily correspond to real motions of plasma but could reflect\ndisplacements of brightness. We are aware that the tracking window used\nallows us to determine only averaged displacements of the penumbral fine\nfeatures, however, the description of the proper motions of this\nfeatures is out of the scope of the present work. Figure 4.13 reveals\nmean flows at spatial resolution of @xmath 1 @xmath (mean velocity\n@xmath 0.4 km s @xmath ), moving toward the umbra in the inner penumbra\nand toward the surrounding granulation in the outer penumbra. The\nfilamentary like structures in grey, mapping small horizontal velocities\n( @xmath 0.13 km s @xmath ), outline the frontiers separating both kinds\nof flow. This clear division of the velocities field in two quite\ndifferentiable tendencies has already been mentioned by some authors\n(see Bonet et al. , 2004 ) but not in a systematically way inside\nsunspots in a complex active region as presented in this work.\n\nIn order to perform a statistical study of horizontal velocities, a\nsequence of 14 velocity maps was obtained averaging over 5-min windows\nalong the whole series. As expected, the resulting maps are a little\nmore noisy but with a wider range of variation of the speeds\n(i.e.\u00a0velocity magnitudes) as compared with the case of averaging over\n71 min. Figure 4.14 shows the histogram of the speeds as measured in\nthis sequence of maps, for different regions within the FOV: penumbral\nareas, granulation outside the moats and moat regions (see also Table\n4.5 for mean and rms values). Note that the moat histogram in the Figure\n4.14 shows a cutoff imposed by the lower threshold selected to define\nmoat velocities.\n\nThe statistical analysis of the results (Figure 4.14 and Table\u00a04.5)\nrenders a value for the mean speed in the moats of @xmath 0.67 km s\n@xmath , similar to that reported by Bonet et al. ( 2005 ) , that is\nalmost twice the mean value in the rest of the granulation field. The\nconfinement of such significantly higher speeds in restricted areas\nclose to the sunspots makes moats a sharply differentiated structure in\nthe photospheric granulation.\n\nWe pursued the same statistical calculations for velocity maps computed\nwith a tracking window with FWHM 0 2. The results revealed that when\nreducing the size of the tracking window, the measured mean and rms\nspeed values increment since we are also including small structures, as\nbright points, moving faster than the general flows observed in the\ngranulation pattern evolution. In our experiment, for instance, the\ndifference between the mean and rms values is about twofold when going\nfrom FWHM 0 78 to 0 2.\n\n##### 4.4.2 Large-scale horizontal granular flows\n\nTo study the proper motions surrounding the sunspots and in particular\nthe behavior of the large-scale flows in the FOV, a velocity threshold\ncan be selected to only plot a given range. The map in Figure 4.15 shows\nonly those velocities in the granulation field with magnitude above 0.4\nkm s @xmath . Strong radial outflows (moats) are evident surrounding the\nsunspots and 0.4 km s @xmath appears to be a characteristic speed value\nto define the moats. The black contours in the figure outline the area\nof the moats. It was drawn by hand following visual criteria of\nproximity to the sunspot and avoiding a few strong exploding events at\nthe lower part of the FOV that contaminate the large-scale moat flow.\nEmpty areas in the moat region in the velocity maps are a result of the\nchosen value for the speed threshold and correspond to the interaction\nwith exploding events that occur inside the moat.\n\nFrom inspection of Figure 4.15 , it becomes evident that the moats are\nclosely associated with the presence of a penumbra. The examples in the\nlower left, lower right and upper right corners are quite revealing. The\nright pointed velocity vectors on the lower left corner correspond to\nthe moat flow of a penumbra that is not visible in the FOV of this\nfigure, but can be seen in an image covering a wider FOV, of the same\nactive region in Figure 4.16 . Moats are missing in the sunspot sides\nwith no penumbral structure. This is readily seen in the right side of\nthe umbral core at coordinates (9,10), but also in the left side of the\none at (25,18). None of the pores in the middle of the FOV is associated\nwith any moat-like flow. More importantly, moats are also absent in\ngranulation regions that are located side by side with a penumbra, but\nin the direction perpendicular to that marked by the penumbral\nfilaments. A clear example is the region around coordinates (9,6-7) in\nFigure 4.15 . As a normal (meaning here far from the neutral line)\npenumbra, it is a candidate to develop a moat flow, but none is seen in\nthis region. The moat flow only appears along the direction delineated\nby the penumbral filaments. Moats, thus, appear to be a natural\nextension of the flow along the direction of penumbral filaments and do\nnot exist as outflows in the transverse direction.\n\n##### 4.4.3 Neutral lines affecting the flow behavior\n\nAs commented in section\u00a0\u00a7 4.3.5 we produced magnetograms of the FOV by\nmeans of the SOUP filter. The high-resolution magnetogram in Figure 4.10\nshows the two polarities. The positive polarities ( in white ) dominate\nthe left and right areas of the FOV and correspond widely to the\npolarities of the respective sunspots. The central area of the image is\ndominated by a negative polarity ( in black ). Two neutral lines can be\nthen identified separating opposite polarities. These neutral lines are\nalso overplotted in the magnetogram, dopplergram and white-light image\ntaken by the DOT during the same observing run but with a wider FOV (see\nFigure 4.16 ).\n\nIt is seen that when the neutral lines run close to a penumbral border\nand parallel to it, the expected behavior of the outflows in the\ngranulation region side by side with that penumbra changes somehow and\nthe moats do not appear in those regions. The penumbral region in Figure\n4.15 , centered at coordinates (5,20), does not show clear evidence of a\nmoat flow (although localized outflows are seen above and below it).\nThis region corresponds to a strongly sheared neutral line (see Figure\n4.11 ) commonly seen in @xmath spots ( Deng et al. , 2006 ) . In the\nSOUP magnetogram (Figure 4.10 ) the spot centered on the left side of\nthe FOV ( white polarity ) does not show a radially outward directed\npenumbra, but penumbral filaments that run parallel to the neutral line.\nThis is a configuration commonly referred as sheared. This configuration\nis also inferred from the filaments observed in the G-band frames. We\nsuspect that both conditions, the presence of a neutral line and the\nabsence of radially oriented filaments, are responsible for the absence\nof a clearly developed moat flow.\n\nThe nature of neutral lines with sheared configurations in @xmath -spots\nis not well understood. But we stress that if they correspond to\nrelatively shallow structures, they would also block the upward\npropagation of heat and should be able to generate a moat flow. Such a\nmoat flow is not observed in this sunspot.\n\n##### 4.4.4 Motions of centers of divergence\n\nFollowing November & Simon ( 1988 ) , (see also M\u00e1rquez, S\u00e1nchez-Almeida\n& Bonet , 2006 ) , the divergences and the vertical velocities can be\ncalculated from the horizontal velocities, according to the expression\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath 150 km stands for the scale height of the flux of mass and\n@xmath the divergence of the horizontal velocity field.\n\nFor this purpose, we generated four horizontal velocity maps (Gaussian\ntracking window of FMWH= 0 78) averaging over time windows of 5, 15, 40\nand 70 min, and starting from the beginning of the time series. From\nthese maps we obtained the divergences and the corresponding vertical\nvelocities. Since we were not interested in describing details but only\ngeneral trends in the granulation vertical flows, the resulting @xmath\nmaps were smoothed by convolving with a Gaussian running window of\nFWHM=1 47, so that the identification of coherent structures was\nfacilitated. Figure 4.17 displays the resulting four vertical velocity\nmaps as images representing the velocity magnitudes by using a\npseudocolor scale. Structures corresponding to positive divergences\n(i.e.\u00a0recurrent exploding granules) and sinks with negative divergences\nare coherently distributed all over the FOV for all the different\ntemporal averages though an evident evolution can be noticed between\nthese averages. The figure shows extreme cases for both positive\ndivergences at coordinates (30,0) in dark red , and sinks in the upper\nright part of the image in blue .\n\nFor the particular case of 5-min horizontal velocity averages we\ncomputed 14 of these maps covering the whole time series (70 min), thus\nderiving 14 vertical velocity maps similar to the one in the upper left\ncorner in Figure 4.17 . Figure 4.18 shows the histogram of vertical\nvelocities as calculated from these 14 maps, that shows a\nquasi-symmetric behavior around the mean value ( @xmath 0).\n\nThe divergence structures displace in time dragged by flows at scales\nlarger than the mesogranular ones. In order to follow the evolution of\nthe centers of divergence along the time series, we employed the same 14\nvertical velocity maps described in the previous paragraph \u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u2070 10 For\nthe purpose we are interested here, the distinction between vertical\nvelocity maps and divergence maps is irrelevant since both quantities\nonly differ by a constant factor @xmath . . Then, by applying the LCT\nagain but this time upon the sequence of 14 images of divergence, we can\ndetermine how the centers of divergence displace in time. Because of the\nlarger size of the structures we want to track, the correlation tracking\nwindow was set to FWHM 3 .\n\nFigure 4.19 displays the resulting map corresponding to the averaged\nvelocities of the centers of divergence during the whole time series (70\nmin). The velocities inside sunspots and pores are set to zero since we\nare only interested in the granulation proper motions. Figure 4.19\nreveals the smooth character of the flow transporting the centers of\ndivergence; the flows are more organized and uniform as compared with\nthose in Figure 4.11 but they still preserve signatures of mesogranular\nflows. The well-organized moat flows are also clearly defined in the\nfigure as they were in Figure 4.11 . Note that the scales employed to\nrepresent the velocity vectors in Figures 4.19 and 4.11 are quite\ndifferent so that the velocities displayed in the former are much lower\nthan those represented in Figure 4.11 .\n\n##### 4.4.5 Study of convective cells\n\nUsing the map of averaged velocities calculated in section\u00a0\u00a7 4.3.4 from\nthe 428 images conforming the time series (Figure 4.11 ), we can study\nthe evolution (displacement) of passive corks homogeneously distributed\nin the FOV at time equal zero, one per pixel. By applying the mentioned\naveraged velocity field to the spread corks we can follow the\ndisplacement of every single cork in time steps of 10.0517 s. With this\nprocedure, a sequence of images showing the locations of corks in every\nmoment can be generated. Figure 4.20 displays the position of corks (in\nwhite ) within the FOV after 0, 22, 45, 67, 89, 111, 134 and 156 minutes\nrespectively. It is important to differentiate between the sequence of\n428 solar images conforming the time series and the sequence of images\nshowing the evolution of the corks.\n\nThis evolution can be extended to times longer than the total duration\nof the series (71 min). This is done by assuming the same map of\nvelocities affecting the corks, as shown in the last 4 panels of Figure\n4.20 .\n\nSome properties concerning the displacement of corks in the FOV can be\ninferred from Figure 4.20 . Regions having stronger horizontal\nvelocities are quicker emptied and correspond to the large-scale flows\n(moats) presented in Figure 4.15 . After 22 minutes there are evidences\nof mesogranulation and exploding granules affecting the displacements of\nthe corks. Already in minute 45 the mesogranular flows dominate the FOV,\nthese mesogranules appear as elongated structures when located inside\nthe moat flows due to the dragging effect. After 67 minutes when the\nmean lifetime of mesogranules has been reached or even overtaken, the\nmesogranular structures tend to disappear, except in the upper central\npart of the FOV where the intense magnetic field confine and limits the\nhorizontal proper motions of the plasma. A considerable number of corks\nare distributed along dark penumbral filaments as pointed out by\nM\u00e1rquez, S\u00e1nchez-Almeida & Bonet ( 2006 ) . In the more quiet\ngranulation regions ( lower central area of the FOV) and in the last\npanels of Figure 4.20 the remaining bright structures trace a pattern\nresembling supergranular structures which mean lifetime is superior to\nthe duration of the present sequence.\n\n#### 4.5 Conclusions and discussion\n\nTime series of G-band and G-cont images of a sunspot group with @xmath\n-configuration (NOAA active region 10786), spanning over 71 min, were\nobserved and corrected for atmospheric and instrumental degradation.\nProper motions in the entire FOV have been measured in the G-band series\nby means of local correlation tracking techniques. In this chapter, we\nconcentrate in the results obtained in the identified moat flows (or\nlack thereof) of several structures within the FOV. The main conclusions\nfrom the analysis can be summarized as follows:\n\n1) We have identified inside the penumbra frontiers separating mean\nlongitudinal flows (parallel to the direction of the filaments) at\nspatial resolution @xmath 1 @xmath (mean velocity about 0.4 km s @xmath\n), moving toward the umbra in the inner penumbra and toward the\nsurrounding granulation in the outer penumbra.\n\n2) We have detected strong (mean speeds of 0.67 km s @xmath with an rms\nof 0.32 km s @xmath ) outflows streaming from penumbrae radially\noriented from an umbral core, the so-called sunspot moats. Our velocity\nvalues are comparable to those reported by i.e, Sheeley ( 1972 ) ,\nVrabec ( 1974 ) , Harvey & Harvey ( 1973 ) , Hagenaar & Shine ( 2005 )\nand Bonet et al. ( 2005 ) , which describe the outflow velocities in the\nrange 0.5\u00a0-\u00a01 km s @xmath . Umbral cores sides with no penumbra do not\ndisplay moat flows.\n\n3) Furthermore, the moats are also absent on penumbral sides parallel to\nthe direction defined by the penumbral filaments. They are not found in\ndirections transverse to them. A special case is sheared penumbral\nconfigurations tangential to the umbral core. No moat flow is found\nthere either.\n\nThis evidence is clearly suggestive of a link between the moat flow and\nflows aligned with the penumbral filaments. The possible connection with\nthe Evershed flow is inescapable. Although it can be argued that a\nphysical relationship between these two flows is not firmly established\nin this chapter, we believe the evidence is clear-cut and that a\nstatistical analysis of a larger number of regions, as done here, can\nestablish this connection more solidly. This is one of the goals in the\nnext chapter, where we extend the sample of solar active regions in\norder to consolidate the main conclusions of the present chapter.\n\n##### 4.5.1 Implications of the results\n\nThe results in this chapter should be put in the context of the recent\nfindings by Sainz Dalda & Mart\u00ednez Pillet ( 2005 ) ; see also Ravindra (\n2006 ) mentioned in chapter\u00a0\u00a73. These authors find that the penumbral\nfilaments extend beyond the photometric sunspot boundary and cross the\nregion dominated by the moat flow. This region is also the location\nwhere the MMF activity is normally found. Indeed, some of these MMFs are\nseen by these authors to start inside the penumbra. All these results\npoint to an origin linking the moat flow and MMF activity with the\nwell-known Evershed flow. Cabrera Solana et al. ( 2006 ) also suggest\nthat the Evershed clouds inside the penumbrae propagate to the moat,\nbecoming MMFs once they leave the sunspot. It is indeed somewhat\nparadoxical that while the final fate of the Evershed flow has remained\nunknown for decades, independent explanations and physical scenarios\nhave been proposed for the generation of the moat flow (that starts\nexactly where the Evershed flow is seen to vanish).\n\nSimilarly, the results obtained from local helioseismology near\nsunspots, in particular those related to the f-mode ( Gizon et al. ,\n2000 ) , are also quite relevant to the results presented here. The\ninterpretation of these results in terms of convective cells surrounding\nsunspots (e.g., Bovelet & Wiehr , 2003 ) may be different if the\nEvershed flow turns out to be the major process that injects mass into\nthe moats surrounding sunspots.\n\n### Chapter 5 Moats flows surrounding sunspots \\dropping\n\n[0pt]2This chapter is an extended and more detailed version of the paper\nby Vargas Dom\u00ednguez et al. ( 2008 ) published in the The Astrophysical\nJournal (ApJ) . The analysis is performed employing ground-based\nobservations of solar active regions, and complements the ideas already\npresented in the previous chapter concerning the plasma motions at\nphotospheric level.\n\n#### 5.1 Introduction\n\nThe sunspot moat, as previously commented in this thesis, consists of an\norganized horizontal radial flow pattern surrounding the sunspots, which\nends quite abruptly at a distance that can be comparable to\nsupergranular sizes or even larger.\n\nIn the last chapter the moat flow in a complex active region was studied\nand described in detail. As a result, some conclusions were established\nrelating these large outflows and certain physical characteristics of\nthe sunspots: a) No outflow was detected in the granulation next to\numbral cores that lack penumbrae, b) Outflows were only found in the\ngranulation regions adjacent to the penumbrae in the direction following\nthe penumbral filaments. c) Granulation regions located next to\npenumbral sides parallel to the direction of the filaments show no moat\nflow.\n\nThe aim of the present chapter is to extend the study done in chapter\u00a0\u00a7\n4 to a larger sample of cases, that is, to establish whether this\nmoat-penumbra relation is systematically found in other active regions\nand how the granulation convective pattern surrounding sunspots behaves.\n\nIn doing so, we have used several time series of images observed at\nhigh-spatial resolution. A total of 7 different sunspot series have been\nprocessed and analyzed. The sample includes sunspots with different\npenumbral configurations, varying from well-developed penumbrae to\nrudimentary penumbral morphologies.\n\n#### 5.2 Observations and data processing\n\nThe observations were obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope\n(SST, Scharmer et al. , 2003a ) on La Palma between 2003 and 2006. All\nobservations benefited from the use of the SST adaptive optics system (\nScharmer et al. , 2003b ) that minimized the degrading effects of\nseeing. Image post-processing techniques were applied to increase the\nhomogeneity in the quality of the time series and to enhance the image\nquality over the whole FOV. For the 2003 data set we applied Multi-Frame\nBlind Deconvolution (MFBD) using the implementation developed by L\u00f6fdahl\n( 2002 ) . The MFBD code was succeeded by the Multi-Object Multi-Frame\nBlind Deconvolution code (MOMFBD, Van Noort, Rouppe van der Voort &\nL\u00f6fdahl ( 2005 ) ) which employs multiple objects and phase-diversity\n(see section\u00a01.5 for more details on this method). MOMFBD was applied to\nthe data sets after 2003. For all the time series we present in this\nchapter, the seeing conditions were generally very good and sometimes\nexcellent, being able to record for more than 40 min in all cases. A\nlarge fraction of the restored images in the different time series\napproached the diffraction limit of the telescope.\n\nAfter image restoration, we applied standard techniques to the time\nseries including correction for the diurnal field rotation, rigid\nalignment and de-stretching to correct for seeing-induced image warping.\nA p-modes filtering was also applied to the series (phase-velocity\nthreshold of 4 km\u2009s @xmath ).\n\nTable 5.1 presents details on the different active region targets which\nare also shown in Figure 5.1 . The observations were performed in\nregions at different positions on the solar disc as listed in the\ncolumns 4 and 5 in Table 5.1 , including one of them (S2) very close to\nthe limb. Table 5.2 gives some details on the restored time series. The\nduration of the time series is in all cases longer than 40 minutes so\nthat we can use them to get a reliable average of the displacements of\nthe structures. Below we provide more detailed information on the\ndifferent data sets, including the restoration process applied in each\ncase.\n\n##### 5.2.1 S1: AR440, 22-Aug-2003\n\nAn interference filter centered at the continuum at 436.4\u00a0nm (FWHM\n1.1\u00a0nm) was used. In the remainder, this filter will be referred to as\nthe \u201cG-cont\u201d filter. Every 25\u00a0s, the three highest contrast images were\nselected and stored to disk. These three images were used for MFBD\nprocessing. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S1).\n\n##### 5.2.2 S2: AR608, 10-May-2004\n\nAn interference filter centered at the G-band at 430.5\u00a0nm (FWHM 1.2\u00a0nm)\nwas used. In the remainder, this filter will be referred to as \u201cG-band\u201d\nfilter. This observation involved two cameras set-up as a\nphase-diversity pair: one in focus and one slightly out of focus. 20\nexposures from each camera, acquired over the course of 7.5 seconds,\nwere used for MOMFBD processing. During processing of the time series, a\nfew bad quality images, suffering from too much blurring, were dropped.\nThe exposure time was 11\u00a0ms. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S2).\n\n##### 5.2.3 S3: AR662, 20-Aug-2004\n\nThis time series was observed with the G-cont filter. The MOMFBD\nprocessing was performed using 10 exposures (acquired during 7 s) from a\nphase-diversity pair of cameras. For the central part of the FOV,\ncentered on the sunspot, the MOMFBD processing was extended to involve a\nG-band phase-diversity pair of cameras. After MOMFBD restoration, the\nbest quality image from 3 subsequent images was selected for further\nprocessing of the time series. The exposure time was 11.3\u00a0ms. This\nsunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S3).\n\n##### 5.2.4 S4: AR662, 21-Aug-2004\n\nThis time series was processed in a manner similar to S3. After MOMFBD\nrestorations, the worst 14% of the images were dropped from the time\nseries. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S4).\n\n##### 5.2.5 S5: AR789, 13-Jul-2005\n\nFor this time series, MFBD processing was applied to 18 subsequent\nG-band images, acquired during 10\u00a0s. Images that were too blurred and\nwhen the AO system was not actively compensating, were dropped from the\nMFBD sets. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S5).\n\n##### 5.2.6 S6: AR813, 4-Oct-2005\n\nThis time series was observed with an interference filter centered on\nthe spectral region between Ca\u00a0K and Ca\u00a0H at 395.4\u00a0nm (FWHM 1.0\u00a0nm). For\nthe MOMFBD processing, 20 exposures (acquired during 8.3\u00a0s) from a\nphase-diversity pair of cameras were used. In addition, simultaneous\nexposures from two other cameras were used for the restoration: one\nequipped with a narrow-band filter centered in the Ca\u00a0H wing at 396.5\u00a0nm\nand one equipped with a narrow-band filter centered on the Ca\u00a0H core\n(396.8\u00a0nm). The exposure time was 11\u00a0ms. This sunspot is shown in Figure\n5.1 (S6).\n\n##### 5.2.7 S7: AR893, 10-Jun-2006\n\nThis time series was observed with an interference filter centered at\n630.2\u00a0nm (FWHM 0.8\u00a0nm). This is the pre-filter for the Lockheed SOUP\nfilter. MOMFBD processing was applied to 400 exposures obtained during\n19\u00a0s. The restorations included images from a phase-diversity pair of\ncameras with the wide-band filter, and narrow-band SOUP exposures in the\nFe\u00a0I\u00a0630.2\u00a0nm spectral line. This sunspot is shown in Figure 5.1 (S7).\n\n#### 5.3 Data analysis and results\n\nThe high quality, stability and long duration of the restored sunspot\nseries, enable us to study the dynamics of the plasma around the\nsunspots. We have computed proper-motion velocity fields (horizontal\nvelocities) employing the LCT technique described in the previous\nchapter. A Gaussian tracking window of FWHM 1 0 suitable for mainly\ntracking granules has been used for all the series. The method produces\na sequence of map-pairs each one describing, within a short time\ninterval (tens of milliseconds), the horizontal velocity components,\n@xmath and @xmath , along the FOV. These maps of components have been\naveraged over 5 and 10 min periods, and also over the respective total\nduration of every sunspot series (more than 40 min in all cases). From\nthe averaged maps of velocity components, the distribution of velocity\nmagnitudes over the FOV (flow map) has been easily derived.\n\nAs described in section\u00a0\u00a74.3.4 , it is well documented in the literature\n( November & Simon , 1988 ) that LCT-techniques in general produce some\nsystematic errors in the determination of displacements. Their\nsignificance depends also on several factors like the width of the\ntracking window in relation to the size of the elements used as motion\ntracers, and the presence of large intensity gradients in the images\n(see section\u00a0\u00a74.3.4 for more details). Even so, this drawback does not\nchange the main conclusions of the present work since we are not\ninterested in fixing absolute values of velocities but rather in the\ndetection of large-scale regularly organized flows around the sunspots\nin comparison with those typically found in a normal granulation field.\nIn both cases we use the solar granules as the tracers of motion and the\nsame size for the tracking window so that in case of some bias it will\naffect to both velocity fields similarly.\n\n##### 5.3.1 De-projection of horizontal velocities\n\nThe sample of sunspots studied in this paper includes a variety of\nheliocentric positions on the solar disc as shown in Table 5.1 (with\n@xmath , where @xmath is the heliocentric angle). Away from the solar\ndisc center, the measured proper motions are in fact projections of the\nreal horizontal velocities in the sunspot plane onto the plane\nperpendicular to the LOS. Thus, to evaluate the real horizontal\nvelocities we have de-projected the velocities obtained from the LCT\ntechnique to a plane tangent to the solar surface at the center of the\nsunspot.\n\nTo that aim, let us consider in Figure 5.2 the orthogonal coordinate\nsystem SX,SY,SZ (the Sunspot System, SS) with the SZ-axis perpendicular\nto the plane tangent to the solar surface at the sunspot location and\nthe SX-axis tangent to the meridian of the solar sphere at this\nlocation. Also included in the drawing is the coordinate system X,Y,Z\n(the Observing System, OS) with a common origin, the Z-axis coinciding\nwith the LOS and the X-axis pointing to the axis crossing the Sun center\nin a direction parallel to the LOS. Note that the axis, X, SX, Z, and SZ\nare coplanar and SY and Y are collinear. The real horizontal velocities,\n@xmath ( @xmath , are contained in the (SX, SY) plane whereas we observe\ntheir projections @xmath ( @xmath , in the (X,Y) plane.\n\nCalculations based on Figure 5.2 lead to the following relationships\n(equations 5.1 and 5.2 ) between the magnitudes @xmath and @xmath , and\nthe azimuths @xmath and @xmath , that will allow us to de-project our\nobservations.\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nSince the X- and Y- axes do not necessarily coincide with our natural\nreference system (i.e.\u00a0the edges of the CCD frame), the measurement of\nthe projected azimuths, @xmath , requires the knowledge of the\norientation of our FOV with respect to the X-axis that points to the\nsolar disc center.\n\n##### 5.3.2 Masking moats\n\nAs mentioned above, for every sunspot series, the map of horizontal\nvelocities averaged over the whole time series is evaluated. In order to\ncoherently detect the moats and compare their statistics (section\u00a0\u00a7\n5.3.6 ) in all active regions of our sample, we have de-projected the\nobserved velocity vectors onto the sunspot plane (SX,SY) as described in\nsection\u00a0\u00a7 5.3.1 .\n\nOverlaying the observed images, we construct maps showing in the\ngranulation field only those projected velocity vectors having\nde-projected magnitudes above a certain threshold. In these maps,\nextensive organized outflows coming out from the sunspots can easily be\nidentified so that we can outline masks delimiting in a qualitative way\nthe area of the moats for the purpose of statistical calculations and\ngraphical representation.\n\nWe have fixed the mentioned threshold to @xmath 0.3\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath as the\nbest compromise to define the limits of the moats. This value should not\nbe understood as an absolute (universal) velocity threshold to define\nmoats in general. As we have mentioned before, the particular method\nused here to measure the displacements may underestimate the velocity\nmagnitudes. Moreover, outside the moat one can easily find velocities\nlarger than that. The point is that this particular threshold makes in\nour case more evident the existence of a well organized radial outflows\naround the sunspots in comparison with the rest of the FOV. Lower values\n(even zero) for the threshold do not extend the areas of organized flows\naround the sunspots but produce maps with a very dense and noisy\n(exploding granules everywhere) representation of arrows where the\noutline of the frontiers of the moats results more difficult.\n\nThe whole masking process for one of the time series is illustrated\nthroughout the panels in Figure 5.3 and consist of:\n\n-    a) Selecting the FOV we want to analyze. Hereafter we will use the\n    spatial-scale in arc seconds.\n\n-    b) Creating, by thresholding, a binary mask for the sunspots\n    (including umbra and penumbrae) and pores.\n\n-    c) Computing the proper motions of structures by applying LCT and\n    plotting the flow map for the whole FOV in granulation regions.\n\n-    d) De-projecting the velocities according to the equations 5.1 y\n    5.2 . The de-projected magnitudes are represented in gray-scale.\n    Bright\/dark areas correspond to large\/small velocity magnitudes. The\n    velocity units are in km\u2009s @xmath .\n\n-    e) Creating a binary mask for the de-projected velocity magnitudes\n    according to the following rule: pixels with de-projected velocity\n    magnitudes greater than 0.3\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath are set to \u201d1\u201d and the rest\n    to \u201d0\u201d.\n\n-    f) Applying the mask in e) to the flow map in panel c), so that we\n    get only those projected velocities that have a de-proyected\n    magnitude above the threshold of 0.3\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath . Over these new\n    flow map we identified visually the flows coming out from the\n    sunspot that correspond to the moat flows described before in this\n    work. These moat flows are easily recognized surrounding the sunspot\n    as large-scale outflows and hence they can be outlined without\n    difficulty.\n\n-    g) Creating a binary mask of moats from the mask generated in e),\n    with the help of the moat boundaries outlined from the visual\n    inspection in f).\n\n-    h) Plotting the final flow map showing the moat flows. We apply the\n    moat mask generated in g) onto the flow map of velocities in panel\n    c).\n\n##### 5.3.3 Moat flows around the sunspots\n\nOur sunspots sample includes different penumbral configurations as a key\nfactor to establish the moat-penumbra relation in a more robust way.\nFigures 5.4 to 5.8 show within the moats, only those velocity vectors\nwith de-projected magnitudes above 0.3\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath after applying the\nwhole masking procedure described above. In Figure 5.9 we extend this\nrepresentation to the entire granulation field showing that large\nvelocities are also present outside the moat. These velocities are\ngenerally grouped and associated with exploding granules.\n\nFirst we focus on granulation regions that display moat flows. Close\ninspection of Figures 5.4 to 5.9 , and the upper panel of Figure 5.12\nreveals that the velocity vectors in the moats are oriented following\nthe direction of the penumbral filaments. We observe that in all cases\nthe moat flow direction lines up with penumbral filaments that are\noriented radially with respect to the sunspot center. Nevertheless, the\ncompleteness of the velocity vectors (density of arrows) in the flow\nmaps depends on the threshold previously imposed, as expected. This can\nbe seen in Figure 5.7 where the left-side penumbra does not seem to be\nstrictly associated with large flows in the granulation region. However,\nthis penumbral part has in fact an associated moat flow similar to the\nother penumbral regions that is not visible in the representation since\nthe magnitude of the velocities is slightly lower than the threshold of\n0.3\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath .\n\n##### 5.3.4 Lacking moat flows\n\nNext we consider granulation regions close to the sunspots that do not\ndisplay moat flows. All sunspots of our sample, except S3, have parts of\nthe umbral core sides that are free from penumbrae, having direct\ncontact with granulation regions. In all these granulation regions we do\nnot detect systematic large-scale outflows that fulfill our criteria for\nmoat flows. This supports the conclusion that umbral core boundaries\nwith no penumbra do not display moat flows.\n\nFinally, there are also granulation regions in the vicinity of penumbrae\nthat lack significant moat flows. To study these cases in more detail we\nmark peculiar regions of interest in Figures 5.4 , 5.6 , 5.7 and 5.8\nwith rectangular white boxes . These regions are represented as\nclose-ups in Figure 5.10 . In the first three panels (T), the penumbral\nfilaments display significant curvature such that they are not radially\noriented with respect to the sunspot center but extend in a direction\ntangential to the sunspot border (as marked with black lines in the\noverview images Figures 5.4 , 5.6 and 5.8 ). The lower right panel (R)\nin Figure 5.10 shows a penumbra extending radially from the umbra. The\nsurrounding photosphere exhibits moat flows only in the direction of the\npenumbral filaments (also see Figure 5.7 ). These four examples lead to\nthe conclusion that moat flows are not found in directions transverse to\nthe penumbral filaments.\n\nIn a few cases we found small pores in the vicinity of penumbrae in a\nregion where we would expect moat flows. Such cases are seen around\ncoordinates (19,29) in Figure 5.4 and coordinates (29,11) in Figure 5.8\n. For these regions the measured proper motions are less reliable since\nwe have a FWHM=1 0 tracking window acting on a region of only a few arc\nseconds ( @xmath 2-3) between the pore and penumbra. Another possibility\nis that the pores themselves are somehow blocking the large outflows\nchanging the expected behavior. In the case presented in Figure 5.8 the\nmost plausible explanation for the absence of moats is the presence of a\nneutral line close to coordinates (29,11) as we shall describe in\nsection\u00a0\u00a7 5.3.5 .\n\nThe findings described above suggest a link between the moat flows and\nthe Evershed flows in penumbrae. We come back to this relation in\nsection\u00a0\u00a7 5.4 .\n\nThe debate regarding the existence of a moat flow around umbral cores\nand individual pores is still ongoing. In a work by Deng et al. ( 2007 )\n, these authors found that the dividing line between radial inward and\noutward proper motions in the inner and outer penumbra, respectively,\nsurvived the decay phase, suggesting that the moat flow is still\ndetectable after the penumbra disappeared. These issues will be deeper\nmentioned in the next chapter contrasting the results presented in this\nthesis and some more examples in the literature.\n\n##### 5.3.5 Neutral lines affecting the flows behavior\n\nOnly one of the sunspots we study displays a complete regular and\nwell-developed penumbra completely surrounding the umbral core. Figure\n5.12 shows the flow map calculated for this active region, plotting the\nhorizontal velocities surrounding the sunspot with de-projected\nmagnitudes @xmath 0.3\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath . Large outflows are not found in a\npart of the right side of the upper panel of Figure 5.12 ( rectangular\nbox) .\n\nFollowing the findings of section\u00a0\u00a7 5.3.3 , we would expect to find a\nmoat flow in this region. The penumbral filaments are oriented radially\nfrom the umbral core which suggest the presence of a moat flow in the\ngranulation region in the direct vicinity. Even with a lower velocity\nthreshold, no moat flow can be discerned in this region. Nevertheless,\nwhen comparing with a simultaneous magnetogram (see lower panel in\nFigure 5.12 ), we found an inversion in magnetic polarity just outside\nthe right border of the sunspot: the magnetogram displays positive\npolarity ( in white ) for the sunspot but negative polarity for the\nsmall magnetic elements and pore just outside the penumbra. The reversal\nof polarity (or neutral line) is confined to a narrow region that\nroughly coincides with the sunspot border. The absence of large outflows\nfollowing this penumbra is suggestively related to the presence of this\nneutral line that might somehow be acting as a blocking agent for the\nmoat flow in this region. The position of the neutral line measured by\nLOS magnetograms is generally influenced by the location of the sunspot\n( @xmath angle). In this case since the sunspot is very close to the\ndisc center we can claim for a reliable determination of the neutral\nline.\n\nFor sunspot in Figure 5.8 there is also a neutral line crossing all\nalong the right-hand border of the sunspot from top to bottom around\ncoordinates (20,28) to (28,11), respectively, as reported by De Pontieu\net al. ( 2007 ) and shown here as Figure 5.11 . The penumbral filaments\nextend from the umbra to the right and seems to bend, being forced to\nfollow the direction of the neutral line as approaching to it. The\nsheared configuration of this penumbra is arranged so that the penumbral\nfilaments end up along directions parallel to the sunspot border. Moat\nflows are then not found beyond this sort of penumbral configuration as\nmentioned in section\u00a0\u00a7 5.3.4 . The same behavior when having neutral\nlines was presented in section\u00a0\u00a74.4.3 for a complex @xmath\n-configuration active region. For that active region we found a strong\nsheared neutral line crossing a penumbral border in a place where a moat\nflow was expected to follow the penumbral filaments direction but\nactually not detected. More observations of complex active regions with\nneutral lines present in the vicinity of penumbrae are needed to firmly\nestablish the relation between the absence of moat flows and magnetic\nneutral lines.\n\n##### 5.3.6 Statistics of velocity fields in moats vs.\u00a0quiet granulation\n\nIn this section the statistics of time-averaged horizontal velocity\nfields in moats is performed. For the sake of comparison, the velocity\nstatistics in quiet granulation areas has also been computed. To that\naim, boxes ( @xmath 9 @xmath 9 arcsec @xmath ) in regions of\nless-magnetized (quiet) granulation and far from the moat flows have\nbeen manually selected in every FOV. Table 5.3 summarizes the\nstatistical properties of the de-projected magnitudes of horizontal\nvelocity fields within both moat masks and selected granular boxes. Here\nwe again remark that because of the possible underestimation of the\ndisplacements by using LCT, we intend to perform not an absolute but a\ncomparative statistical study between moat regions, where we find\nradially organized outflows, and quiet granulation regions far from the\nsunspots.\n\nFor each sunspot of our sample three velocity magnitude maps result from\naveraging over different time periods, namely: 5 min, 10 min and the\nwhole duration of the corresponding time series \u00b9 \u00b9 1 Actually, when\naveraging over 5 min (or 10 min) we obtain more than one map since we\nthen compute maps every 5 min (or 10 min) up to complete the total\nduration of the series (i.e when having 40 min of duration for a time\nseries, we would finally obtain 8 maps of 5 min or 4 maps of 10 min).\nThis enable us to improve the statistics of the velocity magnitudes and\nreduce the noise in our calculations. . Table 5.3 shows that in most\ncases the mean velocity magnitude in moats is greater than in\ngranulation. In a few cases and only for averages in short time periods\n(5, 10 min), we find similar values in both or even slightly lower\nvelocities in moats. However, when averaging over a long time period,\nthe difference of mean velocities in moats and granulation is in all\ncases positive and more conspicuous than for short time period averages\n(see column 10 in the Table). A similar behavior is obtained for the rms\nparameter (see column 9 in the Table). The maximum velocity values are\nalso systematically larger in moats than in granulation.\n\nThe described statistical behavior is expected since for short time\naveraging periods, of the order of the granulation lifetime (5-16 min,\nsee Hirzberger et al. ( 1999 ) and references there in), the proper\nmotions of the granulation structures compete in magnitude with the\nvelocity of large-scale flows. However, averaging velocity components\nover long time periods results in local velocity cancellations in\nshort-lived structures while steady motions at large spatial scales\nprevail. So moats can be considered as a long-term and large-scale\nphenomenon where the mean velocity exceeds that of quiet granulation by\nabout 30%.\n\nThe significant fluctuations in @xmath (rms) and @xmath (mean) (columns\n9 and 10 in Table 5.3 ) for the velocity fields averaged over the whole\ntime series, deserve a comment and possibly future improved\nmeasurements. They could be ascribed to morphological differences in the\nvarious cases considered or they could be related to the particular\nevolutionary state or magnetic field strength in the various sunspots of\nour sample. But we cannot forget that the de-projection formulas ( 5.1 )\nand ( 5.2 ) include products, divisions and sums of products of\ntrigonometric functions. Accordingly, the accuracy in the measurement of\n@xmath and @xmath is crucial for the determination of @xmath . Thus, two\nsources of inaccuracy are: a) the assumption of constant heliocentric\nangle @xmath all along the sunspot area (this has important impact in\nregions far from the solar disc center), and b) the determination in our\nFOV of the direction pointing to the solar disc center which defines the\nX-axis of the Observing Coordinate System, i.e.\u00a0the angular origin for\n@xmath .\n\nFigure 5.13 shows the histograms of de-projected velocity magnitudes for\naverages over the whole time series for sunspots S1 to S7. Red lines\ncorrespond to velocities inside the moats and the blue ones to\nvelocities in quiet granulation boxes. In all cases we find the same\ngeneral trend in both histograms. The red histograms are globally\nshifted toward the right with respect to the blue ones.\n\nThe left wings of the histograms for granulation lie systematically\nabove those of the histograms for moats, and for S1, S2, S3, S4 and S6,\nboth histograms nearly coincide at the farthest left end. This means\nthat within the moats standard velocity values for quiet granulation are\nstill present although with a lower weight. Such is the case for the\nfragments of exploding granules that additionally are swept by\nlarge-scale moat flows.\n\nAt some point from left to right, both histograms cross each other so\nthat the right wing of the moat histogram surpasses the corresponding\nquiet granulation wing and extends to larger velocity values ( @xmath\n0.6\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath ). This confirms the predominance of large velocities in\nmoats. The intersection point of both histograms corresponds to @xmath\n0.3\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath in almost all cases (a bit higher in S1, S2 and S4).\nInterestingly, this value coincides with the threshold empirically\nselected a priori (section\u00a0\u00a7 5.3.2 ) to clearly distinguish the\nfrontiers of the moats, which confirms the goodness of the limit-value\n(0.3\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath ) chosen to detect moats in our data set.\n\n#### 5.4 Conclusions and discussion\n\nSeven time series of sunspots were restored from instrumental and\natmospheric aberrations using MFBD and MOMFBD techniques. The great\nquality of the images allowed us to study proper motions of granules\noutside the sunspots and measure their time-averaged velocities which\ndescribe the general trends of motions (not the same as the\ninstantaneous velocities).\n\nThe results from chapter\u00a0\u00a74 are extended in this chapter to a larger\nsample of active regions and systematically confirmed the same findings:\na) moat flows are oriented following the direction of the penumbral\nfilaments; b) in granulation regions found adjacent to an irregular\npenumbral side parallel to the penumbral filaments, moats are absent, or\nin other words, moats do not develop in the direction transverse to the\npenumbral filaments. Note that if the moat flows were originated by the\nblockage of the heat flux from below by the penumbra, one would expect\nmoat flows directed along, but also, transverse to the direction of the\npenumbral filaments; c) umbral core sides with no penumbra do not\ndisplay moat flows. Moreover we include in our sample a case in which a\nneutral line extends along a penumbral border where we would expect a\nmoat flow continuation. For this sunspot we do not find any moat flow\nfollowing the direction of the penumbral filaments after crossing the\npenumbral border where we see a change in magnetic polarity. The same\nresult was found in section\u00a0\u00a74.4.3 in a penumbral portion of a complex\nactive region crossed by a strong sheared neutral line.\n\nAll these results indicate a likely connection between the moat flows\nand flows aligned with penumbral filaments. In a recent work, Cabrera\nSolana et al. ( 2006 ) suggest that the Evershed clouds inside penumbrae\npropagate to the surrounding moat and then become MMFs after crossing\nthe sunspot border. The MMFs displacements trace very well-defined paths\nthat can actually be clearly seen when averaging magnetograms in time.\nSome of these MMFs are seen to start inside the penumbra ( Sainz Dalda &\nMart\u00ednez Pillet , 2005 ) . We refer the reader to section\u00a0\u00a73.5.2 for\nmore information about these new studies.\n\nIn this chapter we also complement the results of section\u00a0\u00a74.5 with a\nstatistical analysis describing in a quantitative way the differences\nbetween velocity fields in moat flows and in less-magnetized solar\ngranulation in the nearby. In contrast to the case of granulation, moat\nflows are well-organized, steady and large-scale motions. For averages\nmade over more than 40 minutes, the mean velocity in moats (0.3\u00a0km\u2009s\n@xmath ) exceeds that of quiet granulation ( @xmath 0.23\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath )\nby about 30%, although we obtain a considerable dispersion in the\nresults. Also the rms of the velocity magnitude is greater in moats by a\nsimilar percentage.\n\nThe histograms of velocity magnitudes in the moats are broader than\nthose in granulation (see Figure 5.13 ). The histograms of granulation\nshow conspicuous maxima, most of them in a range from 0.2 to 0.3\u00a0km\u2009s\n@xmath , whereas the histograms of moats present a flatter top.\nSystematically, the left wing of the granulation histogram lies above\nthat corresponding to the moat. At some point about 0.3\u00a0-\u00a00.4\u00a0km\u2009s\n@xmath , both histograms cross each other and the right wing of the moat\nhistogram extends beyond that of the granulation to larger velocity\nvalues ( @xmath 0.6\u00a0km\u2009s @xmath ).\n\nWe have studied one case of a sunspot penumbra displaying a neutral line\nall along a sector of the penumbra (Figure 5.12 ). This neutral line is\ndetected at the penumbral boundary but also emphasized by a large\nopposite polarity concentration nearby. Interestingly, this penumbral\nsector shows no moat flow. We interpret this evidence as an indication\nof the Evershed flow being forced to go into deeper sub-photospheric\nlayers at a faster pace than what is normally though to occur in\npenumbral regions not associated to neutral lines ( Westendorp Plaza et\nal. , 1997 ) . A similar case, but in a sheared neutral line of a @xmath\n-spot, was found in section\u00a0\u00a74.4.3.\n\nThe important questions related to the flows inside and outside sunspots\nare yet being studied. In the present work we contribute with a new\nsample of sunspots observed between 2003 and 2006 in six different\nobserving campaigns. The data sets have been selected on basis of the\nseeing quality (sharpness, homogeneity, duration) and the availability\nof suitable targets: the presence of spots with some form of irregular\npenumbra. In all of our samples we follow the evolution of the sunspots\nfor more than 40 min. Although this only represents a snapshot in the\nevolution of the sunspots through all their emerging and decaying\nprocesses, our sample includes sunspots in different evolutionary stages\nand penumbral configurations.\n\n### Chapter 6 Flow field around solar pores \\dropping\n\n[0pt]2This chapter is devoted to the study of flows around solar pores.\nAfter the last two chapters, meant to analyze horizontal flows\nsurrounding different types of sunspots in detail, this one deals\nspecifically with pores. We are interested in observing and analyzing\npores because, different from sunspots, they do not have penumbra at\nall, so that our main conclusions about the relation between moats and\npenumbrae can be tested in these scenarios as explained in the following\nsections.\n\n#### 6.1 Introduction\n\nThough there is increasing evidence linking the moat flows and the\nEvershed flow along the penumbral filaments, the debate regarding the\nexistence of a moat flow around umbral cores and individual pores is\nstill undergoing. In a recent work, Deng et al. ( 2007 ) , found that\nthe dividing line between radial inward and outward proper motions in\nthe inner and outer penumbra, respectively, survived the decay phase,\nsuggesting that the moat flow is still detectable after the penumbra\ndisappeared. Figure 6.1 shows the active region studied by these\nauthors. The sunspot evolution is shown over six days during its\ndecaying phase. Yellow corks trace the dividing line between inward and\noutwards proper motions in the penumbra.\n\nPrevious works ( Sobotka et al. , 1999 ; Roudier, Bonet & Sobotka , 2002\n; Hirzberger , 2003 ) have measured horizontal proper motions in and\naround pores and have observed some penetrating flows at the umbral\nboundaries and a ringlike structure of positive divergence (\u201drosettas\u201d)\naround the pores which is related to a continuous activity of exploding\ngranules in the granulation around them. Roudier, Bonet & Sobotka ( 2002\n) identified a very clear inflow around pores which corresponds to the\npenetration of small granules and granular fragments from the\nphotosphere into the pores, pushed by granular motions originated in the\ndivergence centres around them. They conclude that the motions at the\nperiphery of the pore are substantially and continuously influenced by\nthe external plasma flows deposited by the exploding granules. Figure\n6.2 shows the pore studied by Roudier, Bonet & Sobotka ( 2002 ) and the\nhorizontal velocity field averaged over 5 minutes where the centers of\ndivergence are clearly identified forming the ringlike structure around\nthe pore with mean velocities @xmath 0.3 km s @xmath .\n\nPores are interesting to analyze since, as they do not display penumbrae\n( Keil , 1999 ) , what we actually observe is the direct interaction\nbetween the umbra (with a strong vertical magnetic field that inhibits\nconvection inside it) and the convective plasma in the surrounding\nphotosphere, without any intermediate structure in between. Many\nobserved features such as bright granules moving in the border of a pore\n( Sobotka et al. , 1999 ) show the complex exchange taking place between\nthe pore and the granulation surrounding it.\n\nIn this chapter we aim to get velocity flow fields from high-resolution\ntime series showing the evolution of solar regions having pores. Thus,\nwe shall be able to analyze the horizontal flows around the solar pores\nunder study to figure out from the flow maps how the plasma behaves. The\ndata analyzed are sets taken at both ground-based and space telescopes.\nThe observations were obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope and\nthe space telescope HINODE in 2007. In the next two sections the\nobservations and the processing applied to the images are described in\nsome detail.\n\n#### 6.2 Observations and data processing: SST Data\n\n##### 6.2.1 Observations\n\nThe campaign at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope was carried out during\nSeptember-October 2007 and corresponds to an important collaboration\namong several European and Japanese institutions. This was a long\ncampaign (24 days) with joint observations using not only the SST but\nalso three other solar telescopes (DOT,VTT and THEMIS) at the Canary\nIslands Observatories in La Palma and Tenerife, respectively. Moreover,\nand for the very first time, coordinated observations with the space\nsolar telescope HINODE ( Kosugi et al. , 2007 ) were performed as part\nof the Hinode Operation Program 14.\n\nThe data from the SST analyzed in this chapter were recorded during a\nparticular observing run on 30 September 2007 and correspond to the\nactive region NOAA 10971. The characteristics of the telescope and some\nimportant details concerning the observations are sketched and listed in\nFigure 4.1 and Table 4.1 respectively. The main target was a region\nclose to the solar disc center ( @xmath =0.98) with some pores of\ndifferent sizes embedded in a plage region that exhibits an intense\nmagnetic activity.\n\nThe optical setup consisted in two channels: ( blue and red ). The blue\nchannel was devoted to imaging and the red one to feed the SOUP filter.\nIn the blue channel, images in G-band and CaII\u00a0H were acquired at a high\ncadence so that the MFBD restoration technique (see section\u00a0\u00a71.5) could\nbe applied to correct for atmospheric and instrumental aberrations.\nTable 6.1 enumerates the main parameters of the images in the blue\nchannel.\n\nAlong the red beam the SOUP filter was placed, as mentioned before.\nSection\u00a0\u00a74.2.1 details the description of the instrument and its\noperation. A beam splitter positioned in front of the SOUP deflected a\nfraction of light to obtain simultaneous broad-band PD image-pairs in\nthe continuum near the selected wavelength (FeI 6302 \u00c5). These images\nmade up an additional object for the MOMFBD algorithm to jointly restore\nboth, the broad-band and the narrow-band images (see section\u00a0\u00a71.5). From\nthe restored narrow-band images we computed magnetograms and\ndopplergrams.\n\nOnce the observing run was over, only the best quality images (above a\ncertain threshold) in both channels (blue and red) were preserved for\nfurther processing and the rest were discarded.\n\n##### 6.2.2 Data processing\n\nPost-processing of the images included first the standard flatfielding\nand dark current subtraction, as well as the elimination of hot and dark\npixels and spurious borders in the flatfielded images. After these\nsteps, the images were ready to be restored so that we could group them\nin sets of restoration.\n\n###### Blue beam\n\nIn the blue channel, G-band and CaII\u00a0H images were independently\nrestored by employing MFBD. For each wavelength, the image sequence was\ngrouped in sets of about 80 frames acquired within time intervals of 10\nseconds each. Every set yielded one restored image. So, from @xmath\n52640 single exposures in G-band and as many in CaII\u00a0H (more than 10\n@xmath images adding G-band and CaII\u00a0H) we obtained a total of 658\nrestored images per wavelength.\n\nNext steps in the data post-processing were: compensation for diurnal\nfield rotation, rigid alignment of the images, correction for distortion\nand finally subsonic filtering. For more details see section\u00a0\u00a74.3.3\nwhere similar procedures are described for the SST data of the 2005\ncampaign.\n\nDue to periods of bad seeing in which the quality did not reach the\ndesired top level, some of the images were discarded and we kept only\nthe best and longest consecutive sequence of images. The very final\nproduct were 4 time series (2 for G-band, 2 for CaII\u00a0H) with the\ncharacteristics listed in Table 6.2 . The time gap of about 5 min\nbetween the two consecutive series for each wavelength was a consequence\nof a telescope tracking interruption. That is also why the FOV is\nslightly different in both time series. Most images forming the time\nseries show details near the diffraction limit of the telescope. Figure\n6.3 displays one of the G-band restored images (in false color) with\nclose-ups enhancing very tiny bright features in the intergranular\nlanes.\n\n###### Red beam\n\nIn the red beam images were restored with MOMFBD. The procedure followed\nfor image restoration and for obtaining magnetograms and dopplergrams is\nthe same as that applied to the observing material of the 2005 campaign\n(see section\u00a0\u00a74.3.5). Figure 6.4 shows one of the co-temporal sets of\nimages of the emerging active region after restorations.\n\n#### 6.3 Observations and data processing: HINODE Data\n\nAfter launched on the 22 @xmath September 2006 HINODE has become a very\nuseful tool in the solar physics research. It has played an important\nrole since it started pointing to the Sun and managed to observe many\nsolar features in such a high detail by avoiding the distortion effects\nproduced by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The public archive of HINODE \u00b9 \u00b9 1\nSee the website: http:\/\/solar-b.nao.ac.jp\/hsc_e\/darts_e.shtml is an\norganized data base where all HINODE observations can be searched and\ndownloaded in such an easy way.\n\nWe were interested in HINODE observations of solar pores taken with the\nSolar Optical Telescope (SOT), in order to pursue our study of\nphotospheric flows as explained in section\u00a0\u00a7 6.1 . Next two sections\ndescribe the HINODE data we analyze in the present work. These data\nextend the sample of cases under study in the present work and moreover\ngive us the possibility to compare with the results stemming from\nground-based observations.\n\n##### 6.3.1 Data on 1 June 2007\n\nSolar portion including an isolated and round-shaped pore observed by\nHINODE on 1 June 2007. Images were acquired in G-band with a cadence of\n30 seconds covering a FOV of 27 85 @xmath 55 70 close to the disk center\n( @xmath =0.87). After subsonic filtering we obtained two time series:\none from 21:35 to 21:55 UT with 40 images and a second one from 22:26 to\n23:33 UT with 134 images. Table 6.3 (1 Jun) summarizes the parameters of\nthe time series in more detail.\n\nThe treatment performed with HINODE data does not include any\nrestoration process because of their excellent quality as a consequence\nof the absence of atmospheric turbulence.\n\n##### 6.3.2 Data on 30 September 2007\n\nThe data from HINODE on 30 September 2007 corresponds to the coordinated\nobservations described in section\u00a0\u00a7 6.2.1 . HINODE observed in G-band\nthe emerging flux region during almost the whole day from 00:14 to 17:59\nUT with a few brief interruptions for calibrations. Table 6.3 (30 Sep)\nsummarizes the parameters of the time series in more detail. Figure 6.5\n( left ) sketches the correspondence between the FOV observed by HINODE\n(51 1 @xmath 102 2) and the one framed by the SST (69 6 @xmath 69 6). A\nlarge region of the SST FOV is covered by HINODE observations as shown\nin the figure.\n\nHINODE data presents quite a few misalignments due to tiny tracking\nflaws and also to every temporal interruption. Hence, we decided to\nalign all the 1030 images (18 hours) at a sub-pixel level. Taking the\nfirst image as the reference, next consecutive images were aligned to it\nby using a routine that made a first alignment approach (in case of\nlarge misalignments). In a second iteration, the alignment with the\nfirst image was refined by correlating pairs of subsequent images and\naccumulating their misalignments. Once all images were perfectly\naligned, the FOV was clipped to get rid of spurious borders resulting\nfrom the alignment process.\n\nNext step on the processing is the subsonic filtering of the series.\nThis task resulted a bit tedious not only because of the short temporal\ninterruptions (a total of 7 during the 18 hours) in the series but also\nbecause of the big size of the images and the large amount of them. To\novercome this drawback we fragmented the total 18 hours series in 8 data\ncubes of about 130 images each so that consecutive images in every cube\nwere equally spaced. Subsonic filtering was applied independently to\nevery cube. The final FOV (57 1 @xmath 102 2) is shown in Figure 6.5 (\nright panel ) for the first image at 00:14:55 UT.\n\n#### 6.4 Data analysis and results\n\n##### 6.4.1 General description of horizontal proper motions in the FOV\n\nThe G-band series taken from SST and HINODE have been used to analyze\nthe horizontal proper motions of structures in every FOV. Proper motions\nwere measured by using the same LCT-technique employed in previous\nchapters. In this section we show the maps of horizontal velocities\ncalculated for the different time series using a Gaussian tracking\nwindow of FWHM @xmath which is roughly half of the typical granular\nsize.\n\nFigure 6.6 shows the flow maps computed from the two restored time\nseries in the SST. The velocities were averaged over the total duration\nof each series. The underlying background in the maps is the average\nimage of the respective series. As commented above, the FOV is slightly\ndifferent in both cases so that, for instance, pore at coordinates\n(17,26) in the upper map of the figure is located at (24,42) in the\nlower map.\n\nThe maps are dominated by flows coming from exploding granules taking\nplace all over the FOV. The map averaging over a longer time period (48\nmin) is slightly smoother than the other one (20 min), and displays\nrather lower velocities. Nevertheless, both maps (48 and 20 min average)\nreproduce in general the same proper motions all over the FOV. The top\nof the FOV in Figure 6.6 ( upper panel ) shows large flows caused by\nexploding granular events. These events are grouped at every upper\ncorner of the FOV forming two structures that fit well the supergranular\nscale (see also the magnetogram in Figure 6.4 ). A smaller portion of\nthese structures can also be identified in the lower panel of Figure 6.6\n. Even though a complete description of the proper motions around the\npores in the FOV will be done in section\u00a0\u00a7 6.4.5 , a glance at the\nfigure reveals no evidence of a moat-like pattern around any of the\npores. The central part of the FOV where the smaller pores are embedded,\nexhibits a lower magnitude of horizontal velocities. This behavior is\nexplained by the intense magnetic activity in this part of the FOV as\nunveiled by the correspondent magnetogram of the zone shown in Figure\n6.4 .\n\nConcerning HINODE data, the computed map of horizontal velocities for\nthe time series on 1 June 2007 is displayed in Figure 6.7 . The flow map\nshown in this figure is calculated for the longest time series (67\nminutes, see Table 6.3 ). The isolated solar pore is immerse in a\ngranular region displaying several and recurrent large exploding\ngranular events all around it. The connection of the centers of the\nexploding events outlines a round-shaped contour at a distance from the\npore border similar to the pore radius. The periphery of the pore is\nhereby influenced by plasma flows being deposited by exploding granular\nevents. Velocity magnitudes in the outer part of the outlined contour\nare clearly larger than those in the inner part between the contour and\nthe pore border.\n\n##### 6.4.2 Averaging horizontal flows in different time intervals\n\nHere we study the influence of different time averages of velocity maps\nin a time series of solar pores. To that aim we consider averaging\nintervals of 5, 10, 15 and 20 min in the best quality G-band time series\nrecorded at the SST (the second series in Table 6.2 ). Figures 6.8 and\n6.9 show the resulting mean velocity map for each case. As expected, the\nmaps are smoother for longer averaging periods. Note that regardless we\naverage over 5 or 20 min intervals, we find essentially the same general\ntrends and exploding granular patterns all over the FOV, meaning that\nthe averaging periods we are employing are smaller than or about the\nlifetime of the observed structures, and that even from a short time\nsequence we get a reliable picture of the plasma dynamics in the FOV. It\nis also worth mentioning that we do not recognize any moat-like flow\naround the pores for such different time averages.\n\nThe statistics of the velocity magnitudes for every time average has\nbeen computed and the resulting histograms are shown in Figure 6.10 .\nAlthough the distribution of velocity magnitudes is very similar in the\nfour cases considered, one can easily detect that the histograms shift\nto the left as long as the averaging periods increase. Thus, the largest\nvelocity magnitudes range from 1.83 to 1.97 km s @xmath and the mean\nvalues from 0.48 to 0.50 km s @xmath . In both cases, smaller\/larger\nvalues correspond to longer\/shorter time averages.\n\n##### 6.4.3 Long-term evolution of the velocity field\n\nIn order to investigate how the evolution of the emerging region affects\nthe velocity in the FOV for long periods of time, we have used the\nHINODE time series lasting for several hours. HINODE data on 30\nSeptember 2007 corresponds to 18 hours of almost continuous solar\nobservation as reported in section\u00a0\u00a7 6.3.2 . The stability and long\nduration of the series is ideal for the analysis of proper motions in\nthe emerging flux region. In particular we are interested in the\nevolution of the maps of horizontal velocities averaged over every hour.\nWe have computed 14 of this maps starting from the first hour of\nobservation 00:14 UT up to the time 14:00 UT; during this long period of\ntime we have the region of interest in our FOV. Afterwards, because of\nfailures in the telescope tracking and a stop for calibration purposes,\nthe FOV changes significantly and the main pore within the region moves\nfurther away to the border of the FOV.\n\nImages are grouped then in sets of one hour and every set is processed\nindependently resulting in a map of horizontal velocities averaged over\nthe total duration of the set. The majority of the sets have a duration\nof 60 minutes except for four of them with 46,45,45 and 55 min\nrespectively. These four sets will be understood hereafter as one-hour\nsets for description purposes although the average to calculate the map\nof velocities is performed over the actual duration of every set,\nrespectively. The 14 maps of horizontal velocities are computed using a\nGaussian tracking window of FWHM 1 0. Figures 6.11 - 6.14 show all the\nflow maps with the indication of the time period they correspond to, and\nthe background image represents the averaged image of every 1-hour set.\n\nThe main pore is located in the spatial position (37,55) in the first\nmap (Figures 6.11 ) and surrounded by some smaller pores which form\naltogether a sort of vertical and elongated structure in the figure. The\ncollection of these pores is evolving in time and some of them start\nmerging and disappearing. The final picture of the region displayed in\nFigure 6.14 shows the isolated main pore with only a very tiny\ncompanion.\n\nWe do not identify any signal of moat-like flow around the pores in any\nof the evolutionary stages shown in the maps sequence but continuous\nactivity caused by exploding granules. Centers of divergence are\nsystematically identified, some of them very close to the pore border.\nProper motions displaying inward components are more common around the\npores and any outward regular and large-scale flow, as corresponding to\na moat-flow, is found. These results are firmly validated because of the\nlong duration of the sample and reinforce the previous analysis pursued\nfor the only 1-hour SST data.\n\n##### 6.4.4 Distribution of horizontal speeds in the FOV\n\nThe global speed distribution in a granulation field can be easily\nvisualized by means of false-color maps showing the areas including\nvelocity magnitudes within certain ranges. Figures 6.15 and 6.16 show\nthe location ( white areas ) of velocity magnitudes in three different\nranges in km s @xmath , for the SST data (the first series in Table 6.2\n):\n\n-    Low velocity magnitudes: @xmath 0.3.\n\n-    Medium velocity magnitudes: 0.3\u00a0-\u00a00.8.\n\n-    Large velocity magnitudes: @xmath 0.8.\n\nSmall speeds are mainly grouped in the central part of the FOV where an\nintense magnetic activity is detected as evidenced by the high\nconcentration of G-band bright points and faculae present in this region\n(see Figures 6.3 and 6.4 ). Around pores, the velocity magnitudes mainly\ncorrespond to the lower range ( @xmath 0.3 km s @xmath ) so that they\nare surrounded by white areas in Figure 6.15 ( upper panel ).\n\nThe areas mapping medium velocity magnitudes are regularly spread out\nall over the FOV except in the proximity of pores (Figure 6.15 lower\npanel ). The shape of empty ( non white ) areas around the pores almost\nreproduce the pores shape.\n\nLarge velocities ( @xmath 0.8 km s @xmath ) are not homogeneously\ndistributed in the FOV but mainly located in the two upper corners of\nFigure 6.16 ( upper panel ) where the granulation is less-magnetized\n(see magnetogram in Figure 6.4 ). These zones show large velocity flows\nthat might reflect the presence of supergranular cells as commented in\nsection\u00a0\u00a7 6.4.1 .\n\nFigure 6.16 ( lower panel ) shows the mask of areas ( in white )\ncorresponding to very low horizontal velocities ( @xmath 0.2 km s @xmath\n) plotted over co-spatial and temporal H @xmath ( false color ) image.\nThe correspondence between the bright structures in H @xmath and the\nregions of close-to-zero horizontal velocities is clearly seen. In the\nfilamentary stripe-like structures in H @xmath connecting the two\npolarities (see magnetogram in Figure 6.4 ), there is a high density of\nlow velocities ( white areas ) whereas this density shrinks when going\nto the upper part of the FOV in Figure 6.16 ( lower panel ).\n\n##### 6.4.5 Velocity distribution around solar pores\n\nFrom the computed velocity fields we can do detailed analysis of the\nvelocity distribution around the solar pores. To pursue this study we\nwill use the region observed with the SST were we have a collection of\npores to work with. As we have two time series for this region (see\nTable 6.2 ), we will employ the first one covering a longest time\nperiod, except for one of the pores which is out of the FOV. For this\npore we will use the second time series. Figure 6.17 shows the FOV\nincluding all the pores under study which are labeled for easy\nidentification hereafter.\n\nFigure\u00a06.18 illustrates the projection of the velocities into radial and\ntransversal components as a convenient way to compute inward and outward\nmotions. The figure plots two points in the granulation surrounding a\nsolar pore ( red dots ) with their corresponding velocity vectors @xmath\n. The pore is centered at coordinates @xmath with respect to the\northogonal coordinate system X,Y placed in the lower left corner of the\nFOV. Vector @xmath is the position vector of a given point with respect\nto the pore center. The pore center is located at its gravity-center\ncalculated by weighting the position of every point inside the pore with\nthe inverse of its respective intensity. Velocity vectors in every point\nof the granulation surrounding the pore are projected into radial @xmath\nand transversal @xmath components.\n\nBy using the pore named as TENERIFE in Figure 6.17 we will illustrate\nthe procedure followed to calculate velocity directions, throughout the\npanels in Figure 6.19 . In the following itemization, we will describe\nthe steps corresponding to each panel in the figure:\n\n-    a) Selection of the FOV that includes the pore under study.\n\n-    b) Selection of a correlation box. Since active regions in general,\n    and pores in particular, exhibit their own displacement (due to\n    differential rotation and intrinsic motions) while embedded in the\n    granulation pattern, we align the time series respect to an area\n    framing the pore (correlation box) so that we make sure we are\n    measuring plasma motions with respect to the pore.\n\n-    c) Horizontal shifts for alignment correction as computed by\n    cross-correlation.\n\n-    d) Vertical shifts for alignment correction as computed by\n    cross-correlation.\n\n-    e) Map of horizontal velocities as computed from LCT.\n\n-    f) Calculation of radial directions for short distances. The\n    \u201dradial directions\u201d that we use as the reference to project the\n    velocities are defined as perpendicular to the pore border. These\n    perpendicular directions are calculated from the gradients of\n    intensity in a smoothed pore-mask image. This way, we can also\n    manage with non round-shaped pores. The limit for short distances is\n    defined by thresholding the intensity gradients. The threshold\n    depends on the pore shape and size.\n\n-    g) Calculation of radial directions for long distances. At large\n    distances we consider all pores as round-shaped structures (as in\n    Figure\u00a06.18) and the radial directions are defined by the position\n    vector @xmath of a given point with respect to the pore center.\n\n-    h) Determination of inward and outward motions. According to\n    Figure\u00a06.18, inward\/outward motions correspond to @xmath\n    negative\/positive, where @xmath is the angle formed by @xmath and\n    the positive radial direction (outward) at each point of the FOV.\n    The value of @xmath is mapped in gray scale in panel h), ranging\n    from 1 for purely radial outward velocities ( in black ) to -1 for\n    purely inward velocities ( in white ).\n\n-    i) Creation of a binary mask. A binary mask is created from the\n    gray-scaled map in h). Areas in black and white correspond to\n    velocities with positive (outward) and negative (inward) radial\n    components, respectively.\n\n-    j) Selection of a final clipped FOV.\n\nOnce the method to describe the velocity directions has been set, we\napply it to our sample of 7 different pores shown in Figure 6.17 . The\nresults are displayed in Figures 6.20 to 6.26 where we have: the\naveraged FOV around the pore, the velocity field, the gray-scale\nrepresentation of @xmath , and the final mask of velocities with inward\n( white ) and outward ( black ) radial components. The analysis of all\ncases establish that the flows display a clear preference for inward\ndirections around the pores. This fact is systematically found in all\nexamples. The more regular-shaped pores (Figures 6.20 and 6.21 ) are\nsurrounded by an also regular annular-like area with inward velocity\ncomponents, having a mean width similar to the center-to-border distance\nin the pore. The dividing line between inward and outward motions is\nconnecting the centers of divergence.\n\nFigures 6.27 and 6.28 show for the two regular-shaped pores, an average\nimage (48 min) of the time series ( upper panels ) and a color-scaled\nimage representing the horizontal velocity magnitudes ( middle panels ).\nBoth pores exhibit a sort of proto-penumbral structure though not very\nemphasized. Signals of proto-penumbra appearance are also visible in\nother pores of our sample (e.g.\u00a0see Figure 6.22 ).\n\nThe FOV in Figures 6.27 and 6.28 is dominated by flows with velocity\nmagnitudes up to 1 km s @xmath . The centers of divergence are also\nvisible and clearly identified in these images as black structures\naround the pores. Another important distinctive feature that comes out\nfrom these images is that the highest magnitudes of horizontal\nvelocities are placed beyond these black structures away from the pore.\n\nIn order to study how speeds of proper motions around the pore are\nchanging, we calculate the mean velocity magnitude in a sort of ribbons\n(stripes) around the pore. A total of 12 adjacent ribbons ( @xmath 0 24\nwide), referred to as ring-like structures surrounding the pore, are\nused for this analysis. Figures 6.27 and 6.28 ( lower panels ) plot the\nrelation between speeds of proper motions versus distance to the pore\nborder. The velocity magnitudes increment as a function of this\ndistance: 1) the mean value of speeds increments rapidly at distances\nranging from @xmath 0 15 to 0 4; 2) in the range 0 4\u00a0-\u00a01 0 the variation\ncurve is flatter; 3) in the range 1 0\u00a0-\u00a01 6 we again obtain very sharp\nincrements. Up to this distance from the pore border, we observe the\nsame behavior in both pores. Nevertheless, the mean speed values at 1 6\nare quite different (250 vs.\u00a0390 m s @xmath ). At further distances (\n@xmath 1 6) the trend in the mean velocity magnitudes differs\nsubstantially. We must have in mind that the flows around the pore can\nalso be affected by the intrinsic characteristics of every single pore\nand by the contribution from other sources in the neighbourhood,\ne.g.\u00a0pores in the vicinity.\n\n#### 6.5 Conclusions and discussion\n\nWe obtained time series for solar regions displaying pores from both\nground-based and space observations. We then analyzed the horizontal\ndisplacements of the plasma around solar pores by means of LCT. This is\nthe first time we have tested with HINODE data, our standard reduction\nroutines for LCT and p-modes filtering. The long duration, stability and\nhigh-resolution of the data achieved by HINODE enable us to get\nextremely useful time series to study dynamical properties of the\nhorizontal flows in the photosphere in periods much longer than those we\nare used to have in ground-based observations which are restricted by\nthe changing seeing conditions.\n\nThe LCT technique applied to the series allowed us to track the proper\nmotions of structures in the regions nearby solar pores. We conclude\nthat the flows calculated from different solar observations are coherent\namong each other and show the determinant and overall influence of\nexploding events in the granulation around the pores and in the whole\nFOV for every single set. Motions towards the pores in their nearest\nvicinity are the dominant characteristic we claim to observe\nsystematically.\n\nThe motions at the periphery of the pores are basically influenced by\nthe external plasma flows deposited by the exploding events, as\nsuggested by other authors in previous works ( Sobotka et al. , 1999 ;\nRoudier, Bonet & Sobotka , 2002 ) .\n\nWe interpret the dividing line between radial inward and outward\nmotions, found by Deng et al. ( 2007 ) outside the residual pore (see\npanel f in Figure 6.1 ), as corresponding to the location of the centres\nof divergence of the exploding events around the pore. The outward\nmotions these authors describe, which are not in the immediate\nsurroundings of the pore but separated by the annular inward motion,\nwould then correspond not to moat flows but to the outward flows\noriginated in the regular mesh of divergence centers around the pore.\n\n### Chapter 7 Conclusions \\dropping\n\n[0pt]2The first part of this work deals with the problem of image\ndegradation caused by atmospheric and instrumental aberrations. By using\nimage restoration techniques we can correct the images and bring them\nnear the diffraction limit of the telescope. One of the aims at working\nwith these novel techniques is the correction of the instrumental\naberrations that will be present in the SUNRISE mission, in particular\nin the images produced by the IMaX instrument, a magnetograph designed\nand built by a Spanish consortium leaded by the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica\nde Canarias.\n\nNowadays, the use of numerical restoration techniques is determinant and\ncompulsory to obtain high-resolution images, and stands as a key tool\nfor recent and future solar physics advances and developments. In that\nsense, the present work represents an effort to have high-quality\nobservations in IMaX by defining the method to calibrate the in-flight\ninstrumental aberrations. The method is based on the Phase Diversity\n(PD) inversion algorithm.\n\nThe robustness of the method has been tested by numerical experiments\nsimulating different aberration components applied to synthetic solar\nimages. Degradation followed by PD-inversion has allowed to compare the\ngoodness of the match between the input values for degradation and those\nresulting from the inversion. The sources of aberration have been\nmodelled and added in subsequent experiments. The repercussion of every\nnew added ingredient in the final result from the inversion has been\nevaluated. The PD-code does not accurately reproduce the shape of the\nwavefront errors but provides suitable OTFs for subsequent satisfactory\nrestorations. The results of the inversions can be considered reliable\nenough as to validate the method proposed for the calibration of errors\nin the images of IMaX, at least for aberrations lying in the range:\nrms-ripple @xmath 2\/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1\/4 waves.\n\nThe second part of the work is devoted to the observation and analysis\nof solar active regions. In particular we have studied the dynamical\nbehaviour of the plasma around sunspots and solar pores at a\nphotospheric level. We analyzed data from ground-based (SST) and space\n(HINODE) telescopes. Ground-based data are firstly corrected for\natmospheric and instrumental aberrations with the methods described in\nthe first part of the work, generating in this way time series of images\ndisplaying the solar evolution in active regions.\n\nLocal correlation tracking techniques have been employed to infer proper\nmotion of structures within the FOV. We are mainly interested in the\nphotospheric horizontal flows around sunspots and pores. A sample\nincluding various sunspots with different penumbral configurations, and\nsolar pores was analyzed.\n\nThe main findings concerning the existence of moats surrounding sunspots\ndepending on the penumbral configurations exhibit by them are:\n\n-    Moat flows are oriented following the direction of the penumbral\n    filaments.\n\n-    In granulation regions found adjacent to penumbral sides parallel\n    to the penumbral filaments, moats are absent, or in other words,\n    moats do not develop in the direction transverse to the penumbral\n    filaments.\n\n-    Umbral core sides with no penumbra do not display moat flows.\n\n-    Around solar pores there are not signs of moat flows. In all the\n    cases studied we have found evidence of exploding granules activity\n    in the pore\u2019s surroundings.\n\nMoreover we include in our study two examples in which a neutral line\nextends along a penumbral border where we would expect a moat flow\ncontinuation. For these cases we do not find any moat flow following the\ndirection of the penumbral filaments after crossing the penumbral border\nwhere we see a change in magnetic polarity. The presence of neutral\nlines appears to be significantly affecting the behaviour of the plasma\nflows, preventing the appearance of moats.\n\n#### 7.1 Future prospects\n\nMore upcoming data from the HINODE telescope as well as from new\nfacilities and missions like SUNRISE will provide long-time series of\nactive regions with a constant image quality and enough\nspatial-resolution to establish firm confirmation of the evidences and\nfindings presented in this thesis. The addition of simultaneous Doppler\nand magnetogram data to the continuum intensity (or G-band) data sets\nwill enhance our understanding of the link between the Evershed flow\ninside penumbrae and the moat flows around sunspots. Needless to say,\nthe study of those stages were penumbrae are just formed or destroyed\nbecomes of extreme importance to validate our findings. Similarly, the\nresults that can be expected in the coming years from local\nhelioseismology, in particular those related to the f-mode ( Gizon et\nal. , 2000 ) , describing the flow patterns in the deeper layers near\nsunspots will be crucial for the establishment of a clear link between\nthese two well-known flow patterns, Evershed and moat, that has not been\nappreciated yet.\n\nThe interpretation of these results in terms of convective cells\nsurrounding sunspots (e.g., Bovelet & Wiehr , 2003 ) may be different if\nthe Evershed flow turns out to be the major process that injects mass\ninto the moats surrounding sunspots.\n\nMore observations of complex active regions with neutral lines present\nin the vicinity of penumbrae are needed to firmly establish the relation\nbetween the absence of moat flows and magnetic neutral lines.\n\nWe believe that one of the more relevant results put forward in this\nwork suggesting that the moat flow is the continuation outside the spots\nof the Evershed flow, deserves adequate attention in the future from\nboth an observational and a theoretical point of view.\n\n### Conclusiones \\dropping\n\n[0pt]2En la primera parte de este trabajo de tesis se aborda el problema\nde degradaci\u00f3n de imagen causada por aberraciones atmosf\u00e9ricas e\ninstrumentales.

Este m\u00e9todo se basa\nen el algoritmo de inversi\u00f3n de Diversidad de Fase (DF).\n\nSe ha validado la robustez del m\u00e9todo de calibraci\u00f3n de aberraciones\nmediante experimentos num\u00e9ricos, simulando diferentes componentes de\naberraci\u00f3n sobre imagenes solares sint\u00e9ticas. La degradaci\u00f3n de las\nim\u00e1genes seguida de su inversi\u00f3n con DF, ha sido el proceso utilizado\npara comparar la bondad del ajuste entre los valores de entrada al\ndegradar y los obtenidos despues de la inversi\u00f3n. Las diversas fuentes\nde aberraci\u00f3n se han modelado y a\u00f1adido en sucesivos experimentos. Hemos\nevaluado la repercusi\u00f3n que tiene cada ingrediente a\u00f1adido, sobre el\nresultado final de la inversi\u00f3n. El c\u00f3digo de DF no reproduce en detalle\nla forma de los errores del frente de onda sino que proporciona OTFs\nadecuadas para producir restauraciones satisfactorias. Los resultados de\nlas inversiones pueden considerarse lo suficientemente fiables como para\nvalidar el m\u00e9todo propuesto para la calibraci\u00f3n de errores en las\nim\u00e1genes de IMaX, al menos para aberraciones dentro del rango:\nrms-ripple @xmath 2\/60 and rms-LOA @xmath 1\/4 waves.\n\nLa segunda parte de la tesis esta dirigida al estudio y an\u00e1lisis de\nregiones solares activas. En particular se ha estudiado el\ncomportamiento y din\u00e1mica del plasma a nivel fotosf\u00e9rico alrededor de\nmanchas y poros solares. Para ello se han utilizado observaciones hechas\nen Tierra (SST) y del telescopio espacial (HINODE) recientemente lanzado\nal espacio. A trav\u00e9s de series temporales se han estudiado los\nmovimientos propios de estructuras en la zona granular que circunda\nmanchas y poros, considerando una amplia muestra de ambos.\n\nLos principales hallazgos que surgen de este trabajo de tesis son:\n\n-    Los flujos de gran escala aldededor de las manchas solares\n    (llamados flujos de foso) se orientan siguiendo la direcci\u00f3n de los\n    filamentos penumbrales.\n\n-    En las regiones de granulaci\u00f3n adjacentes a penumbras en donde los\n    filamentos son paralelos al borde penumbral, no se encuentran signos\n    de flujos de foso .\n\n-    Las regiones de granulaci\u00f3n adjacentes a nucleos umbrales (es decir\n    sin penumbra), no muestran indicios de presencia de flujos de foso .\n    Es decir, los flujos de foso no se producen en direcci\u00f3n transversal\n    a los filamentos penumbrales.\n\n-    Alrededor de los poros analizados no se encuentran signos de flujos\n    de foso . En todos los casos se han encontrado evidencias de flujos\n    provenientes de gr\u00e1nulos explosivos alrededor de estos poros.\n\nSumado a esto, se han analizado tambi\u00e9n un par de ejemplos en donde hay\npresencia de l\u00edneas neutras que se extienden longitudinalmente a lo\nlargo de bordes penumbrales en donde se esperar\u00eda observar flujos de\nfoso. Para estos casos sin embargo no se ha detectado este tipo de\nflujos. La presencia de l\u00edneas neutras parece afectar de forma notable\nel comportamiento de los flujos de plasma impidiendo la aparici\u00f3n de\nflujos de foso.\n\n#### Futuros estudios\n\nDatos provenientes del telescopio HINODE y de nuevos instrumentos y\nmisiones como SUNRISE, permitir\u00e1n tener muchos m\u00e1s ejemplos de series\ntemporales estables, de alta resoluci\u00f3n espacial y temporal, sobre las\ncuales se podr\u00e1 estudiar la din\u00e1mica de las estructuras en las zonas\nactivas para verificar los hallazgos presentados en este trabajo. El\nan\u00e1lisis de series de magnetogramas y dopplergramas simult\u00e1neas a series\nen banda G, enriquecer\u00e1n indudablemente nuestro entendimiento de la\nrelaci\u00f3n entre el flujo Evershed dentro de la penumbra y el flujo de\nfoso alrededor de las manchas solares.\n\nSin duda el estudio de manchas en diferentes estados evolutivos donde la\npenumbra ha sido recientemente formada o esta en fase de disoluci\u00f3n, es\nde vital importancia para validar los resultados y conclusiones que se\nexponen en el presente trabajo.\n\nDe igual forma aquellos resultados aportados por nuevos estudios de\nheliosismologia local, en particular los relacionados con los modos-f (\nGizon et al. , 2000 ) tendientes a describir el patr\u00f3n de flujos a\ndiferentes profundidades bajo las manchas solares y sus regiones\ncircundantes, ser\u00e1n cruciales para establecer una clara relaci\u00f3n entre\nestos dos flujos: dentro y fuera de la penumbra. La interpretaci\u00f3n los\nflujos de foso en t\u00e9rminos de celdas convectivas de gran escala\nalrededor de las manchas (ver Bovelet & Wiehr , 2003 ) puede cambiar\nradicalmente si el flujo Evershed resultara ser el principal proceso que\ninyecta masa en las regiones moat alrededor de las manchas solares.\n\nCreemos que uno de los resultados mas relevantes que se defienden en\neste trabajo y que supone que el flujo de foso es una continuaci\u00f3n,\nfuera de la penumbra, del flujo Evershed, merece especial atenci\u00f3n en el\nfuturo tanto desde el punto de vista observacional como del te\u00f3rico.\n","output":["This thesis can be framed in a more general concept designated as \"High\nresolution in solar physics\".

There are four kinds of interaction in the nature; the weak\ninteraction, the strong interaction, the electromagnetic interaction and\nthe gravitational interaction. In 1967, Glashow, Weinberg and Salam\nsucceeded in the unification of the weak and electromagnetic interaction\nin terms of the @xmath gauge group. The ensuing success is the advent of\nthe \u201dStandard Model\u201d, described by the @xmath gauge group. The Standard\nModel is striking in the sense that it describes all the experimental\nphenomena by setting the 18 parameters in the model.\n\nHowever, there are two serious drawbacks to the Standard Model. First is\nthat we cannot explain theoretically how these 18 parameters are fixed.\nNamely, we have to rely on the experimental data in setting these\nparameters. Second is that the Standard Model does not unify the\ngravitational interaction.\n\nNow, the superstring theory is regarded as the most promising candidate\nto resolve these two drawbacks. The superstring theory regards not a\nzero-dimensional point but a one-dimensional string with the length\n@xmath cm as the fundamental object. Here, @xmath is called \u201dthe Planck\nScale\u201d, which is the fundamental scale in the superstring theory. The\nsuperstring theory incorporates not only the gauge particles but also\nthe gravitons in its oscillation modes. There is an infinite tower of\nthe mass level in the oscillation modes. The massless modes of the open\nstring, which has two ends, are regarded as the gauge particle. On the\nother hand, the massless modes of the closed string, which constitutes a\nclosed circle like a rubber band, gives the spin-2 graviton. In this\nsense, the superstring theory is thought to include not only the\nStandard Model but also the gravitational theory in the low-energy\nlimit, where the massive modes of the superstring theory are ignored.\nThe superstring theory is fascinating in that it incorporates no free\nparameters. It is in contrast to the Standard Model, which suffers the\nproblem of a plethora of free parameters. The superstring theory has a\npossibility to explain the gauge group of the Standard Model, the number\nof the generations of the quarks, the mass of the Higgs particle, quarks\nor leptons, the dimensionality of our spacetime @xmath , from a theory\nwithout any parameter.\n\nWe have seen the so-called \u201dfirst string boom\u201d in the early 1980\u2019s, in\nwhich the perturbative aspects of the superstring theory have been\nelucidated. The striking discovery in 1984 is that the superstring\ntheory is free from the divergence of the gravitational energy.\nPhysicists have been so far puzzled by the UV divergence in the\nquantization of the gravitational interaction. This conundrum has been\nresolved by the superstring theory which alleviates this divergence.\nMoreover, it has also been known that there are only five kinds of\nsuperstring theory well-defined in the ten dimensions. They are the type\nI, type IIA, type IIB, @xmath heterotic and @xmath heterotic superstring\ntheory. Especially, the @xmath heterotic superstring theory is\npropitious for the immersion of the Standard Model in the superstring\ntheory. The exceptional Lie algebra @xmath includes the Lie algebra\n@xmath , which is the gauge symmetry of the Standard Model, as its\nsubalgebra.\n\nThe superstring theory is defined in the ten-dimensional spacetime, but\nthis is not so problematic because it is a theory of gravity. The\nspacetime is regarded as being given not a priori but dynamically from\nthe classical solution of the theory. It is now believed that the\nsuperfluous six dimensions are compactified at an extremely small size\nat the incunabula of the universe. Mathematically, the six superfluous\ndimensions are compactified by the Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\nHowever, the superstring theory suffers a serious setback. Since the\nsuperstring theory is defined only perturbatively, there is no telling\nwhich is the true vacuum. While there are only five well-defined\nsuperstring theories, there are a myriad of ways to compactify the\nten-dimensional superstring theory into the four dimensions and thus we\nare overwhelmed by the infinite vacua. This means that the superstring\ntheory does not have the ability to predict our four-dimensional world,\nand we cannot tell whether the superstring theory dynamically generates\nthe Standard Model. In order to surmount this difficulty, we definitely\nneed the constructive definition (i.e. the definition without the\nperturbation).\n\nThe so-called \u201dfirst string boom\u201d was over at the end of the 1980\u2019s.\nHowever, there were important discoveries at this period about the\nnoncritical string theory and the bosonic matrix model (the extensive\nreview can be found in [ 1 , 2 ] ). Distler and Kawai [ 72 ] succeeded\nin the quantization of the non-critical string theory up to one\ndimension via the conformal gauge. In addition, there is a striking\nrelation between the bosonic string theory and the matrix model,\nproposed by F. David [ 70 ] . For the simplest zero-dimensional\nnon-critical string, the corresponding matrix model is a one-matrix\nmodel described by a simple @xmath hermitian matrix. The correspondence\nhas been found for the central charge @xmath (for @xmath ), in which the\nstring corresponds to the multi-matrix model. The path integral of the\nworldsheet for all genera has been approximated by the random\ntriangulation of the worldsheet. This has led us to identify the Feynman\nrule with that of the one-matrix model. In this way, we have seen the\nformal correspondence between the matrix model and the string theory.\nEven more crucial is that the matrix model can be solved\nnonperturbatively. Brezin and Kazakov [ 74 ] solved the matrix model by\nmeans of the orthogonal polynomial method. They extracted the\nnonperturbative aspects of the bosonic matrix model via the differential\nequation called Painlev\u00e8 equation. They calculated the parameter called\nthe string susceptibility, and found that this agrees with the\ncalculation of Distler and Kawai [ 72 ] for the noncritical string.\n\nWe have failed in extending this idea to the \u201dsuper\u201dstring, and this\nprogress is limited to the bosonic string. This is due to the same\ndifficulty as we face in putting the chiral fermion onto the lattice.\nThus, these discoveries, per se, do not give a technical clue to the\nconstructive definition of the superstring theory. The\n\u2019state-of-the-art\u2019 matrix models (such as the IIB matrix model) do not\ninherit the same techniques as the old matrix model. Nevertheless, these\ndiscoveries serve as an important touchstone for the legitimacy of the\nlarge- @xmath reduced models as the constructive definition of the\nstring theory.\n\nIn the late 1990\u2019s we have seen the so-called \u201dsecond string boom\u201d, in\nwhich we grasped the nonperturbative aspects of the superstring theory.\nDuring the second string boom, Polchinski discovered the soliton-like\nobject called the D-brane. The discovery of the D-brane led to the idea\nof the two kinds of the duality of the string theory. First is the\nT-duality, which is the duality between the large and small radius of\nthe compactification. Second is the S-duality, which relates the strong\ncoupling and the weak coupling. It is now believed that the five\nten-dimensional superstring theories are related with one another\nthrough the T\/S duality. This is an illuminating discovery, in the sense\nthat it is reminiscent of the more fundamental theory whose certain\nlimit might reproduce these five superstring theories.\n\nAnother big progress is the proposal for the constructive definition of\nthe superstring theory via the large- @xmath reduced model. Here, the\n\u2019large- @xmath reduced model\u2019 means the model defined by the @xmath\nhermitian matrices. In 1996, Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind\nproposed the matrix model defined by the dimensional reduction of the\nten-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory to one dimension @xmath the\nso-called BFSS model [ 4 ] . This matrix model is more related to the\ntype IIA superstring theory, and the effect of the type IIA supergravity\nis induced by the one-loop effect.\n\nOther attempts are the IIB matrix model (the IKKT model) [ 5 ] and the\nmatrix string theory [ 6 ] , which are defined by the dimensional\nreduction of the ten-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory to the zero and\ntwo dimensions, respectively. Especially, the IIB matrix model is now\nregarded as one of the most promising candidates for the constructive\ndefinition of the superstring theory (this model is extensively reviewed\nin [ 16 , 75 ] ). As its nomenclature shows, this model is deeply\nrelated to the type IIB superstring theory. The simplest and the most\ndirect correspondence is that the IIB matrix model is defined by the\nmatrix regularization of the Green-Schwarz action of the type IIB\nsuperstring theory; namely by replacing the Poisson bracket with the\ncommutator of the @xmath matrix. In addition, it has been shown [ 7 ]\nthat the Wilson loops satisfy the string field equations of motion for\nthe type IIB superstring in the light-cone gauge. The prominent feature\nof this model is that it does not include any free parameter. The\noverall coefficient which is an artifact of the coupling constant before\nbeing reduced is absorbed by a simple field redefinition.\n\nThere have been hitherto a lot of progresses with respect to the IIB\nmatrix model. First is the relation to the gravitational interaction.\nThe most fundamental feature is the spacetime @xmath supersymmetry [ 5 ]\nwhen we regard the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices as the spacetime\ncoordinate. This urges us to interpret the eigenvalues as the spacetime\ncoordinate. In addition, the graviton and dilaton exchange has been\ncalculated in [ 5 ] . The interpretation of the general coordinate\ninvariance is proposed in [ 14 ] , in which the permutation invariance\nof the eigenvalues is identified with the general coordinate invariance\nof the low-energy effective action.\n\nSecond is the relation to the noncommutative geometry, which has been\nwidely investigated since Seiberg and Witten elucidated the relationship\nwith the superstring theory [ 18 ] . By expanding the IIB matrix model\naround the classical background, it reproduces the noncommutative\nYang-Mills theory [ 17 ] .\n\nThird is the dynamical generation of the four-dimensional spacetime. In\n[ 11 ] , it has been found that the Hausdorff dimension of the\neigenvalue distribution is four. In [ 36 ] , Nishimura and Sugino\nproposed the breakdown of the Lorentz symmetry from @xmath to @xmath by\nmeans of the third order of the Gaussian expansion. Their analysis has\nbeen extended to the seventh order in [ 39 , 48 ] .\n\nThe discovery of the IIB matrix model implies the trilateral\nrelationship of the three important notions in the elementary particle\nphysics; the superstring theory, the quantum field theory and the matrix\nmodel. The discovery of the relationship between the one-matrix model\nand the bosonic string theory is another good example to relate these\nnotions. In the course of the \u201dsecond string boom\u201d we have other\nimportant discoveries for this trilateral relationships. In 1997,\nMaldacena advocated the duality between the type IIB superstring theory\non the @xmath spacetime and the @xmath , four-dimensional super\nYang-Mills theory. This is the so-called \u201dAdS\/CFT correspondence\u201d [ 9 ,\n12 , 15 ] . This correspondence has been conjectured through the\ncoincident symmetries of these two theories. Since the proposal of\nMaldacena, the AdS\/CFT correspondence has been rigorously investigated\nby many authors (among them is the author\u2019s work [ 32 ] , while we do\nnot delve into this work in this thesis). Another important discovery is\nthe so-called Dijkgraaf-Vafa duality [ 41 , 43 , 45 ] . This is a\nduality between the @xmath four-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory and\nthe one-matrix model, which used to attract much attention in relation\nto the bosonic string theory in the early 1990\u2019s. This discovery\nreinstated the one-matrix model into many authors\u2019 attention. At first [\n41 , 43 , 45 ] , this relationship is understood with the intervention\nof the topological string theory. However, Cachazo, Douglas, Seiberg and\nWitten [ 47 , 49 , 53 ] explained this duality directly through the\nsuper Yang-Mills theory without topological string theory. They\nelucidated that these two theories comply with the same Schwinger-Dyson\nequation, employing the notion of the chiral ring and the Konishi\nanomaly [ 67 , 68 ] . Moreover, in [ 54 , 58 ] , the direct relationship\nbetween the large- @xmath reduction and the Dijkgraaf-Vafa duality has\nbeen found. In this way, in the course of the \u201dsecond string boom\u201d, many\ninteresting discoveries, including the IIB matrix model, have been\nunraveled. In the future, we will surely have a synergy in the studies\nof these three germane areas.\n\nWhile the IIB matrix model has a lot of interesting properties, there is\na plenty of room to investigate. The more manifest correspondence with\nthe gravitational interaction is definitely a $64,000 question. If the\nIIB matrix model or its extensions are to be the eligible frameworks to\nunify the gravitational interaction, we must take seriously the relation\nto the gravitational interaction. While several important evidences have\nbeen found, there are a lot of questions to clarify. It has been an\nenigma how we can describe the local Lorentz symmetry in terms of the\nlarge- @xmath reduced models. In addition, the definition of the IIB\nmatrix model relies heavily on the flat background. Especially, the IIB\nmatrix model incorporates the background of the flat space, not the\ncurved space. This prohibits the perturbation around the curved space\nbackground.\n\nIn this thesis, we discuss some of the attempts [ 26 , 38 , 46 , 60 ] to\naddress these issues. This thesis is organized as follows. In Section 2,\nwe give a brief review of the IIB matrix model. Especially, we focus on\nthe development of the IIB matrix model in relation to the gravitational\ninteraction. Moreover, we have a careful look at the alterations of the\nIIB matrix model that incorporate a curved-space background, in relation\nto some of the author\u2019s works [ 46 , 60 ] .\n\nIn Section 3, we review the author\u2019s works about the supermatrix model [\n26 , 46 ] , based on the @xmath super Lie algebra. The studies of the\nsupermatrix models give a rich perspective for the generalization of the\nIIB matrix model in relation to the gravitational interaction. We start\nwith investigating the correspondence of the nongauged @xmath model with\nthe IIB matrix model, paying attention to the supersymmetry. We next\nconsider the so-called \u201dgauged version\u201d, namely the model whose Lorentz\nsymmetry and the gauge symmetry are mixed together. This is an important\nidea in realizing the matrix model equipped with the local Lorentz\nsymmetry, because the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices are identified\nwith the spacetime in the IIB matrix model. We next go back to the\nnongauged version of the @xmath supermatrix model including the mass\nterm [ 46 ] . It has been known that the IIB matrix model with the\ntachyonic mass term, whose review we give in Section 2, incorporates the\ncurved-space background because the trivial commutative background is\ndestabilized. We focus on the similarity of such models and the massive\nsupermatrix model.\n\nIn Section 4, we elaborate on the idea of the \u201dgauged matrix model\u201d\nwithout the supermatrix model [ 38 ] . Especially, we allocate the\nodd-rank matrices of the ten dimensions for the matter field, and the\neven-rank matrices to the parameters of the local Lorentz\ntransformation. When we mix the Lorentz symmetry and the gauge symmetry,\nthe model must inevitably include the higher-rank fields in order for\nthe action to be invariant and for the algebra of the symmetry to close\nwith respect to the commutator. This is a good news in that the rank-3\nfields are identified with the spin connection in the curved space. We\nconsider the explicit identification of the matrices with the\ndifferential operator, and clarify that the bosonic part actually\nreduces to the Einstein gravity in the low-energy limit. We also discuss\nthe structure of the @xmath supersymmetry.\n\nIn Section 5, we study the stability of the fuzzy sphere background in\nthe quantum sense. While it is easy to discuss the stability of the\ncurved-space background (all we have to do is just to plug the solution\ninto the action), it is by no means easy to discuss the stability in the\nquantum sense. In this section, we address this question via the heat\nbath algorithm of the Monte Carlo simulation. We focus on the simplest\ncase; namely the bosonic three-dimensional IIB matrix model with the\nChern-Simons term. We find that this bosonic matrix model has a\nfirst-order phase transition between the Yang-Mills phase (in which the\nquantum effect is large and the fuzzy sphere classical solution is\nunstable) and the fuzzy sphere phase (in which the model is subject to\nthe meager quantum effect and the fuzzy sphere is stable), as we change\nthe radius of the fuzzy-sphere solution (equivalently, the coefficient\nof the Chern-Simons term). Moreover, we find that this model has a\none-loop exactness in the fuzzy sphere phase in the large- @xmath limit.\nThe latter result is especially exciting, in the sense that this helps\nthe analysis of the dynamical generation of the gauge group.\n\nSection 6 is devoted to the conclusion and the future outlook of the\nwork.\n\nIn Appendix A, we summarize the notation of this thesis. We give the\ndetailed notation of the gamma matrices and the supermatrices. In\naddition, we give a proof of the miscellaneous formulae of the gamma\nmatrices.\n\nIn Appendix B, we give the calculation of the Seeley-de-Witt\ncoefficients, which plays an important role in Section 4.\n\nIn Appendix C, we give the detailed recipe for the heat bath algorithm\nof the matrix model. We start with the quadratic one-matrix model in\nfull detail, because this gives the key idea of the simulation of the\nIIB matrix model with\/without the Chern-Simons term. We nextly discuss\nthe simulation of the quartic one-matrix model. Finally, we discuss the\nheat bath algorithm for the IIB matrix model with\/without the\nChern-Simons term.\n\n## 2 Brief review of the IIB matrix model\n\nIn this section, we give a brief review of the IIB matrix model [ 5 ] .\nAs we have mentioned in the introduction, the IIB matrix model is\nregarded as the most promising candidate for the constructive definition\nof the superstring theory. This model is also called \u201dthe IKKT model\u201d,\nwhere IKKT is the acronym for the authors of [ 5 ] ; Ishibashi, Kawai,\nKitazawa and Tsuchiya.\n\n### 2.1 Definition and symmetry of the IIB matrix model\n\nThe IIB matrix model is defined by the dimensional reduction of the\nten-dimensional @xmath super Yang-Mills theory to zero dimension as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, @xmath are the ten-dimensional bosonic vector, and @xmath is the\nten-dimensional Majorana-Weyl (hence sixteen-component) fermion. Both\n@xmath and @xmath are promoted to the @xmath hermitian matrices. This\nmodel incorporates the @xmath Lorentz symmetry and the @xmath gauge\nsymmetry. This model is a totally reduced model in that it is reduced to\nzero dimension. The prominent feature of this model is that it has no\nfree parameter. The overall coefficient @xmath can be trivially absorbed\ninto the fields by the following redefinition.\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe coefficient @xmath is an artifact of the coupling constant of the\nsuper Yang-Mills theory before being reduced, and is nothing but a\nscaling parameter.\n\nThe path integral of the IIB matrix model is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is defined in the ten-dimensional Euclidean space by the\nWick rotation of @xmath and @xmath in the action ( 2.1 ). The\nconvergence of the path integral of the IIB matrix model is not trivial,\nbecause the gauge group @xmath is not compact. However, the convergence\nof the path integral is discussed in the paper [ 24 , 28 ] (the review\nis found in the Ph.D. thesis of Austing [ 34 ] ). The authors\ncorroborated that the path integral converges for \u00b9 \u00b9 1 @xmath is the\ndimension of the IIB matrix model, and the model ( 2.1 ) is defined for\n@xmath . More explicitly, the @xmath -dimensional supersymmetric IIB\nmatrix model means the following action\n\n@xmath\n\nwhich is well-defined for @xmath . The explicit definition of the @xmath\n-dimensional bosonic IIB matrix model is given by\n\n@xmath\n\n@xmath . Only for the bosonic part, the path integral is shown to\nconverge for @xmath . Here, @xmath for the @xmath gauge group, @xmath\nfor the @xmath and @xmath for all the other simple Lie group.\n\n#### 2.1.1 Relation to the type IIB superstring theory\n\nThe IIB matrix model has a deep relation to the type IIB superstring.\nHere, we discern that the IIB matrix model is obtained by the matrix\nregularization of the Green-Schwarz action of the type IIB superstring\ntheory. The Green-Schwarz formalism is defined so that the spacetime\nsupersymmetry should be more manifest. The bosonic Nambu-Goto action is\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, @xmath is a metric on the worldsheet, and has a Lorentz signature\n@xmath . A naive guess for a supersymmetric extension is to replace\n@xmath with\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n@xmath is trivially invariant under the supersymmetry transformation\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, @xmath runs over @xmath , and this is an index for the\nsupersymmetry. However, the naive replacement of @xmath with @xmath for\nthe action ( 2.4 ) is not enough, because it does not have a @xmath\nsymmetry and hence it has twice as many degrees of freedom as it should.\nInstead, we give the following action:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn this section, we define the rank-2 epsilon tensor as @xmath (and\nhence @xmath ). This action is defined for the @xmath dimensional\nspacetime, and the index @xmath runs over @xmath . The supersymmetry\ntransformation of this action is\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere we drop the surface terms. The term ( 2.7 ) is shown to vanish\n(i.e. the action @xmath is supersymmetry invariant) by noting the\nfollowing rewriting:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.8)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, @xmath and @xmath . @xmath and @xmath . @xmath can be further\nwritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe first term vanishes due to the Fierz identity\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe delegate the proof of this Fierz identity to Appendix A.1.6 . The\nsecond and third terms vanish because they are nothing but surface\nterms.\n\nThis model also incorporates the symmetry named the @xmath symmetry:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath is a projection operator defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis satisfies the following properties\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich follow from the inversion rule\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, the parameters of the @xmath -symmetry is subject to the following\nprojection rule:\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (2.15)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nThe @xmath -symmetry transformation varies the action as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.16)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nup to the surface terms that vanish in the integral. We can show that\nthe Green-Schwarz action is invariant under the @xmath -symmetry with\nthe help of the identity ( 2.10 ).\n\nNextly, we explain how the matrix regularization of the Green-Schwarz\naction of the type IIB superstring theory leads to the IIB matrix model.\nFor the type IIB superstring theory, the chirality of the two spinors\n@xmath and @xmath is identical. Therefore, we set @xmath . This\nsimplifies the term @xmath as @xmath . Then, the action is simplified as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIntegrating out @xmath , we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.18)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nIn the last equality, we note that this determinant can be rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.19)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nWe introduce the Schild action and discern that this reduces to the\nGreen-Schwarz action. The Schild action is defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, we introduce the scalar density @xmath as an independent variable.\nThe Poisson bracket @xmath is defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nVarying this Schild action with respect to @xmath , we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis scalar density is clearly identical to the determinant in the\nGreen-Schwarz action @xmath up to a constant. Plugging this into the\naction, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich reduces to the Green-Schwarz action by setting @xmath . We discuss\nthe matrix regularization of the Schild action ( 2.20 ). We perform the\nfollowing replacement:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nBy setting @xmath and dropping the term @xmath , the Schild action\narrives at the IIB matrix model.\n\nWe next discuss the supersymmetry of the Green-Schwarz action. We\nidentify the two combinations of the parameter of the original\nsupersymmetry and the @xmath symmetry, to obtain a new supersymmetry\ntransformation. To this end, we relate the parameters of the\nsupersymmetry and the @xmath symmetry as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe take the following gauge for the Schild action of the type IIB\nsuperstring theory:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus, the fermionic supersymmetry transformation is written as\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (2.27)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nThus, the @xmath symmetry transformation for @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe introduce the following redefinition of the supersymmetry parameter:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe combination of the supersymmetry and the @xmath symmetry is thus\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 2.1.2 Supersymmetry\n\nNow, let us have a careful look at the supersymmetry of the IIB matrix\nmodel. We have formulated the supersymmetry of the Schild action of the\ntype IIB superstring. In the IIB matrix model we consider that the\nmatrix-regularized version of that supersymmetry is inherited. The\n@xmath supersymmetry of the IIB matrix model is then distinguished by\n\n-   homogeneous: @xmath .\n    The feature of the \u2019homogeneous supersymmetry\u2019 is that this\n    supersymmetry transformation depends on the matter fields @xmath and\n    @xmath . And this supersymmetry transformation vanishes if there is\n    no matter field.\n\n-   inhomogeneous: @xmath .\n    The feature of the \u2019inhomogeneous supersymmetry\u2019 is that the\n    translation survives without the matter fields.\n\nThe commutators of these supersymmetries give the following important\nresults:\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- -- --------\n        @xmath   @xmath      (2.31)\n        @xmath               (2.32)\n        @xmath   @xmath      (2.33)\n  -- -- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThese properties can be verified by taking the difference of the two\nsupersymmetry transformations.\n\n1.  This is the most complicated to compute. For the gauge field, we\n    should consider the following transformation\n\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.34)\n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.35)\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n    Then, the commutator is\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (2.36)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    Utilizing the formula @xmath , we obtain\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (2.37)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    For the fermions, we have only to repeat the similar procedure:\n\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.38)\n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (2.39)\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n    Using the formula of the Fierz transformation,\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n    whose proof we present in Appendix A.1.5 , we verify that the\n    commutator of the supersymmetry transformation is\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (2.41)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    Here, we utilize the equation of motion\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (2.42)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    in order to eliminate the second and the third terms of the Fierz\n    identity ( LABEL:AZM31fierz ).\n\n    Next, we note that the commutators of the supersymmetry\n    transformation ( 2.37 ) and ( 2.41 ) vanish up to the gauge\n    transformation. The gauge transformation of the IIB model is to\n    multiply the unitary matrix @xmath . The gauge transformation is\n    expressed in the infinitesimal form as follows :\n\n      -- -- -- --------\n               (2.43)\n      -- -- -- --------\n\n    The supersymmetry transformation ( 2.37 ) and ( 2.41 ) can be gauged\n    away by the gauge parameter @xmath . We now complete the proof of (\n    2.31 ) up to the gauge transformation.\n\n2.  This is trivial because the supersymmetry @xmath involves only a\n    constant.\n\n3.  This can be proven by taking the difference of these two\n    transformations\n\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n         @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n         @xmath   @xmath               (2.44)\n      -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThis completes the proof of the commutation relation of the\nsupersymmetry transformation. When we take the linear combination of the\nhomogeneous and the inhomogeneous supersymmetry as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthe commutator is written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath run over @xmath . The commutation relation ( 2.46 ) has a\nserious consequence. When we regard the eigenvalues of the bosonic\nmatrices @xmath as the spacetime coordinate, the IIB matrix model\ncarries a spacetime @xmath supersymmetry. Namely, the commutator of the\nsupersymmetry transformations gives a translation of the spacetime by\n@xmath . This urges us to interpret the spacetime as emerging from the\neigenvalues of @xmath . This is a crucial property in order for this\nmodel to include the gravitational interaction. If the IIB matrix model\nhas a massless particle, it must have a spin-2 graviton. We have a good\nreason to reduce not the four or six-dimensional, but the\nten-dimensional @xmath super Yang-Mills theory. This model has the 32\nmaximal supersymmetry only if we reduce the ten-dimensional super\nYang-Mills theory. The maximal supersymmetry is an essential aspect for\nthe theory of gravity.\n\n### 2.2 Interaction between the BPS object\n\nWe next review the interpretation of the BPS objects (such as the\nD-brane) in terms of the IIB matrix model. We start with considering the\nclassical equation of motion of the IIB matrix model:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, we set the fermion @xmath to zero. The corresponding equation of\nmotion for the type IIB superstring theory is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn terms of the type IIB superstring theory, this has a solution\nrepresenting the D1-brane:\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (2.49)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the compactification radii of @xmath and\n@xmath , respectively. The parameter @xmath and @xmath take values\n@xmath and @xmath . The Poisson bracket is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe corresponding commutator for the matrix regularization is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.51)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis commutation relation is realized only for the infinite-size\nmatrices (we can see that this is impossible for the finite-size\nmatrices by using the cyclic rule of the trace @xmath ). Namely, we have\nthe following solution:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.52)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath are the infinite-size canonical pair satisfying @xmath .\n\nWe discern that the solution ( 2.52 ) is a BPS saturated state in the\nfollowing way. We substitute the solution ( 2.52 ), along with @xmath\nand @xmath , into the supersymmetry transformation in the previous\nsection to obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.53)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe homogeneous supersymmetry can be clearly canceled by the\ninhomogeneous supersymmetry, when we properly choose the parameter\n@xmath . In this sense, the D1-brane solution of the IIB matrix model (\n2.52 ) actually preserves half of the supersymmetry, and thus is a BPS\nsaturated object.\n\nBy the same token, we can establish the solutions of the IIB matrix\nmodel that correspond to the @xmath brane, by taking the similar\ncanonical pairs as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.54)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis nicely corresponds to the fact that the type IIB superstring theory\naccepts the D1,3,5, @xmath -branes.\n\nWe next see that the bosonic matrices @xmath of the IIB matrix model\ndescribe the multi-body system. We can easily build the solution for the\ntwo D1-branes located at @xmath by taking the following block-diagonal\nmatrices.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the size of each block, and @xmath satisfy @xmath .\n\nBy the same token, we can build the @xmath brane system through the\nfollowing classical solution.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this way, the IIB matrix model describes not only the single\nD-objects , but also the multi-body system by allocating the plural\nmatters on the block-diagonal components. In this sense, there is a\ngreat difference from the action of the D-instanton action, which\nappears to be the same action. Unlike the D-instanton action, the IIB\nmatrix model accepts the multi-body system and thus is a\nsecond-quantized action.\n\nNot only do the matrices of the IIB matrix model @xmath accommodate the\nmulti-body system but also the interaction is embedded in the same\nmatrices. Namely, the off-diagonal part can be interpreted as\nrepresenting the interaction of each block.\n\nWe next investigate the interaction between the D-objects by the\none-loop calculation. To this end, we derive the one-loop effective\naction. We separate the matrices with the classical solution and the\nfluctuation as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.57)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath and @xmath are the classical solution, and @xmath and\n@xmath are the fluctuation. Since the IIB matrix model is invariant\nunder the @xmath gauge transformation ( 2.43 ), we need the gauge\nfixing. Here, we adopt the background gauge\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe corresponding gauge-fixing term @xmath and the ghost term @xmath are\nrespectively\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (2.59)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the ghosts and the anti-ghosts respectively.\nIn the following, we set the parameter @xmath to 1. Then, we extract the\nquadratic term of the fluctuation for the total action @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.60)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nHere, we introduce the following adjoint operators\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.61)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last equality for @xmath follows from the Jacobi identity of\nthe commutators. Integrating the fluctuation, we obtain the following\neffective action.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.62)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nHere, the trace @xmath is for the @xmath matrices, while the trace\n@xmath and @xmath are respectively for the ten-dimensional vector\nindices and the ten-dimensional gamma matrices ( @xmath is the Weyl\nprojector, and effectively the size is not 32 but 16).\n\nWe evaluate the interaction between the diagonal blocks using the\none-loop effective action ( 2.62 ), and elucidate that the IIB matrix\nmodel includes the gravitational interaction. We consider the\nbackgrounds having a block-diagonal form:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.63)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, each block @xmath represents the separate D-object and is an\n@xmath matrix. We decompose the classical background between the trace\nand the traceless part as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.64)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices are regarded as the\nspacetime coordinate in the IIB matrix model, the trace @xmath should be\nidentified with the collective coordinate of the D-objects. We assume\nthat the classical D-objects are separated with each other so that the\ndistances @xmath are sufficiently large.\n\nThe adjoint operator @xmath operates on the @xmath components of the\nmatrix @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.65)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath represent the operation of @xmath from the left\nand right, respectively. Similarly, we simplify the notation of the\noperation of the adjoint operator @xmath . The background field strength\nis rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.66)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe operation of @xmath can be likewise decomposed into the left and\nright operation as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.67)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince the left and right operation are independent, we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.68)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe obtain the one-loop interaction for these D-objects. To this end, we\nexpand the effective action ( 2.62 ) with respect to the power of @xmath\n. The first bosonic term is expanded as\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n                 @xmath   \n        @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n\nWhereas, the third fermionic term of ( 2.62 ) is expanded as\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n                 @xmath   \n        @xmath   @xmath   \n                 @xmath   \n                 @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n\nIn this derivation, we utilize the following formulae of the gamma\nmatrices:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nAlong with the second ghost term @xmath , we discern that the effect of\nthe boson and the fermion cancels up to the @xmath order. This\ncancellation is ascribed to the supersymmetry of the IIB matrix model.\nDue to this cancellation, the leading effect of the one-loop interaction\nis of the order @xmath . Namely, the interaction complies with the power\nlaw @xmath (where @xmath is the distance of the two D-objects, and the\ndimensionality is @xmath ). In this sense, we regard this one-loop\ninteraction as the gravitational interaction. This is an important\nevidence that the IIB matrix model describes the gravitational\ninteraction, and this is a consequence of the supersymmetry. Especially,\nthe contribution of the @xmath block is expressed using the notation for\nthe left and right operation as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.69)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe tensor structure indicates that the first and second term of the\nlast line of ( 2.69 ) represent the graviton and dilaton exchange\nrespectively. This result augurs very well for the IIB matrix model to\nbe a bona fide framework for the gravitation interaction. This argument\nis limited to the background gauge, and it is an interesting future work\nto extend this argument in a gauge independent way.\n\n### 2.3 Interpretation of the diffeomorphism invariance\n\nIn this subsection, we review the interpretation of the diffeomorphism\ninvariance on the target space for the IIB matrix model. In [ 14 ] , it\nhas been pointed out that the invariance under the permutation of the\neigenvalues @xmath is interpreted as the diffeomorphism invariance of\nthe low-energy action. Since the permutation invariance is of course a\nsubgroup of the @xmath symmetry, this means that both the diffeomorphism\ninvariance and the gauge invariance emerge from the @xmath invariance!\nThis is a surprising aspect of the IIB matrix model, in that the\nunification of these two symmetries has been achieved in a natural way.\n\nIn discussing the dynamics of the spacetime, we expand the IIB matrix\nmodel around the diagonal background\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.70)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere these satisfy the constraint @xmath and @xmath , because they\nbelong to the @xmath gauge group. We delegate the details to the\nreferences [ 11 , 14 , 16 , 75 ] , but after we integrate the\nfluctuation at the one-loop level and further the fermion zero mode\n@xmath , we finally obtain the following interesting result:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.71)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath denotes the graphs that connects the eigenvalues @xmath ,\nand @xmath is the Boltzmann weight for the graph @xmath and the\nconfiguration of the eigenvalues @xmath . An explicit calculation also\nindicates that the dependence on the two different eigenvalues @xmath\nand @xmath contributes at the order @xmath , when @xmath and @xmath are\nconnected by the graph @xmath .\n\nThe important property of the integral ( 2.71 ) is that it is invariant\nunder the permutation of the eigenvalues @xmath . We note that this is\nof course not the case with each graph @xmath , because the way to\nconnect the eigenvalues by the graphs impairs the @xmath invariance.\nNevertheless, this symmetry is retrieved when we take a summation for\nall the graphs. This phenomenon is somewhat reminiscent of the dynamical\ntriangulation approach to the quantum gravity, in which the\ndiffeomorphism invariance is retrieved by summing over all the\ntriangulation.\n\nHere, we see how the permutation invariance of the eigenvalues leads to\nthe diffeomorphism invariance. In a sense, this is a very natural\ninterpretation, since we identify the eigenvalues with the spacetime\ncoordinate. To elaborate on this viewpoint, we consider the scalar field\n@xmath propagating in the distributed eigenvalues. Namely, we consider\nthe following effective action as an example;\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.72)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n@xmath is a function damping fast sufficiently at infinity. We introduce\nthe density function @xmath . Along with the continuous function @xmath\nthat satisfies @xmath , the action ( 2.72 ) is rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.73)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, we take an average with respect to the eigenvalue configuration\n@xmath and the graphs @xmath . In order to see clearly the\ncorrespondence between the gravitational background, we further rewrite\nthe action as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.74)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nHere, we normalize the density correlation as @xmath . This urges us to\nidentify the eigenvalue density with the gravitational background as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.75)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNextly, we see how the diffeomorphism invariance is realized. Since the\nIIB matrix model itself is @xmath invariant, the model itself is of\ncourse invariant under its subgroup @xmath . Under the permutation\n@xmath for @xmath , the fields @xmath transform to @xmath . We extend\nthe permutation of the eigenvalue to the transformation of the\ncontinuous transformation @xmath , where @xmath is a continuous function\nsuch that @xmath . It is trivial that @xmath is subject to the general\ncoordinate transformation as a scalar field. In addition, the background\nmetric given in ( 2.75 ) also receives a transformation as a rank-2\ntensor, when the function @xmath decreases rapidly and has a support\nonly near the origin @xmath . In this sense, we can fairly interpret the\n@xmath invariance as the general coordinate invariance of the low-energy\nlimit.\n\nWhile the IIB matrix model has only a flat noncommutative background and\ndepends heavily on the flat metric, we have an interpretation for the\ncurved space background. A nontrivial background is induced dynamically\nthrough the condensation of the graviton.\n\n### 2.4 Alternative totally reduced models\n\nIn this subsection, we review the attempts for the generalization of the\nIIB matrix model. The IIB matrix model augurs well for the unification\nof the gravity. The @xmath supersymmetry is a fundamental object for the\ntheory of gravity. In the preceding two sections, we have reviewed some\nof the evidences for the gravitational interaction: the graviton-dilaton\nexchange in the one-loop calculation and the interpretation of the\ndiffeomorphism invariance. However, the IIB matrix model suffers a\nserious drawback in that it has only the flat noncommutative background.\nHowever, if a matrix model is to be a bona fide framework to describe\nthe gravitational interaction, it should accommodate a curved space\nbackground in a natural way. In this section, we introduce several\ngeneralizations of the IIB matrix model, so that they should incorporate\na curved space background.\n\n#### 2.4.1 The IIB matrix model with the Chern-Simons term\n\nFirstly, we introduce the matrix model with the Chern-Simons term,\ndefined by the following action [ 25 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.76)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, the indices @xmath run over @xmath and this model is defined on\nthe three-dimensional Euclidean space. @xmath are the three-dimensional\nbosonic vectors and @xmath is the three-dimensional Majorana fermion.\nThis is also a totally reduced model like the IIB matrix model, and\n@xmath and @xmath are promoted to the @xmath hermitian matrices. @xmath\nare the Pauli matrices and in the following @xmath denotes @xmath . This\nmodel has the @xmath rotational symmetry and the @xmath gauge symmetry.\n\nIn [ 56 ] , Tomino performed the calculation of the path integral for\nthe @xmath case as a toy model, and elucidated that the path integral\nconverges for the @xmath case (while the bosonic model ( 5.1 ) which we\nanalyze in Sec. 5 does diverge). This is in contrast to the IIB matrix\nmodel without the Chern-Simons term, in which the path integral diverges\nfor @xmath and arbitrary @xmath . Austing and Wheater in [ 57 ]\ncorroborated that adding the Chern-Simons term does not affect the\nconvergence as long as the original path integral (without the\nChern-Simons term) converges absolutely.\n\nThe interesting property of this matrix model is that it incorporates\nthe classical solution of the fuzzy sphere. Its classical equation of\nmotion is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.77)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe fuzzy-sphere solution is given by the @xmath -dimensional\nirreducible representation of the @xmath Lie algebra @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.78)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is regarded as the sphere, firstly because it satisfies the\nrelation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.79)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe relation ( 2.79 ) determines the radius of the sphere as @xmath . In\naddition, the eigenvalues of @xmath are distributed sphere-like. In this\nsense, this classical solution is interpreted as the sphere in the\nthree-dimensional spacetime. That this matrix model has the @xmath fuzzy\nsphere classical solution is a great advantage. While the @xmath fuzzy\nsphere is nothing but a simple manifold, it is of significance as a\nprototype of the curved space background, which is a fundamental\nprinciple of the general relativity.\n\nThis matrix model also incorporates the @xmath supersymmetry. Like the\nIIB matrix model, this model also has the homogeneous and the\ninhomogeneous supersymmetry.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.80)\n                 (2.81)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis model has the similar commutation relation to that of the IIB\nmatrix model:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.82)\n                 (2.83)\n     @xmath      (2.84)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe proof of these commutation relations goes in the same way as in the\nIIB matrix model, and we give only the proof of ( 2.82 ). Using the\nformula @xmath , we obtain the commutation relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.85)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath . For the fermion, we obtain the commutator by\ntaking the difference likewise:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.86)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe use the following Fierz transformation whose detailed proof we give\nin Appendix A.1.5 :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.87)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn ( 2.87 ), we omit the rank-0 contribution, since we are interested in\nthe commutator @xmath . Then, we obtain the commutation relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.88)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe difference from the IIB matrix model is that the commutation\nrelation ( 2.88 ) is satisfied without using the classical equation of\nmotion. The relations ( 2.85 ) and ( 2.88 ) indicate that the\ncommutators vanish up to the @xmath rotation by @xmath , as well as the\ngauge transformation by @xmath . The appearance of the @xmath symmetry\nis a novelty of this matrix model.\n\nWe likewise take the linear combination of the supersymmetry as\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (2.89)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nTheir commutation relation gives the translation of the bosonic matrices\n@xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.90)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe fuzzy-sphere classical solution is a BPS saturated state. Plugging\nthe classical solution ( 2.78 ) and @xmath into the homogeneous\ntransformation ( 2.80 ), we immediately find that the homogeneous\nsupersymmetry vanishes. Whereas, the inhomogeneous supersymmetry ( 2.81\n) survives. In this sense, the fuzzy-sphere solution ( 2.78 ) preserves\nhalf of the supersymmetry.\n\nWe next discuss the expansion of this matrix model around the fuzzy\nsphere solution ( 2.78 ). In the case of the IIB matrix model, we derive\nthe noncommutative Yang-Mills theory by the expansion around the flat\nnoncommutative background [ 17 ] . This derivation of the noncommutative\nYang-Mills theory is quite natural, because the matrices, per se, are\nnoncommutative objects. The studies of the noncommutative field theory\nhave become explosively popular since Seiberg and Witten [ 18 ]\nelucidated the relation to the superstring theory. In the noncommutative\nspacetime, we impose the noncommutativity on the spacetime as @xmath .\nThis relationship is reminiscent of the canonical commutation relation\nof the space and the momentum in the quantum mechanics. Just as the\nspacetime and momentum have the uncertainty principle, the\nnoncommutative spacetime incorporates the uncertainty of the spacetime.\nIn the context of the superstring theory, the noncommutativity of the\nspacetime is introduced by turning on the B field [ 18 ] , which gives\nthe noncommutativity\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.91)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis leads to the uncertainty of the spacetime at the string scale\n@xmath .\n\nWhen we expand the matrix model ( 2.76 ) around the fuzzy sphere\nbackground ( 2.78 ), we obtain a noncommutative Yang-Mills theory on the\n@xmath sphere. The expansion around the sphere is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.92)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the fluctuation. The fluctuation is expanded by the\nnoncommutative spherical harmonics as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.93)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the noncommutative spherical harmonics @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.94)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe indices @xmath run over @xmath , and @xmath is a symmetric and\ntraceless tensor. We can understand that this is a @xmath -dimensional\ntensor as follows. Firstly, when we allocate @xmath to @xmath in a\nsymmetric way, we have @xmath ways. On the other hand, the tracelessness\ncondition implies that @xmath vanishes. This condition stems from the\nconstraint @xmath . This eliminates @xmath ways. Therefore, the\ndimensionality of this tensor is @xmath . Its normalization is defined\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.95)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis of course corresponds to the expansion in terms of the c-number\nspherical harmonics\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.96)\n     @xmath      \n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNow, we can build the mapping rule between the matrices and the\nfunctions on the @xmath sphere. The rule is listed below:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.98)\n     @xmath      (2.99)\n     @xmath      (2.100)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe need to look more closely at the star product ( 2.100 ). Firstly, the\ncorrespondence ( 2.98 ) is rewritten, using the orthogonality condition\n( 2.95 ), as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.101)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nHere, we require that the maximum value of @xmath is @xmath . This leads\nus to define the star product as follows. Here, we require that @xmath\nshould not exceed @xmath .\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThen, the action ( 2.76 ) is mapped as follows:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.103)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nwhere we define the field strength @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.104)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe subscript @xmath indicates that the product is defined by the\nnoncommutative star product. Therefore, the commutator survives even for\nthe @xmath abelian gauge group of the Yang-Mills theory.\n\nThis gives the relationship between the coupling constant of the\nYang-Mills theory @xmath and the artifact of the coupling constant of\nthe Yang-Mill theory before being reduced as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.105)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe go on to the symmetry of this Yang-Mills theory. Firstly, the @xmath\nsymmetry is interpreted as the gauge symmetry. For the element of the\n@xmath Lie group @xmath , it is expanded as @xmath , where @xmath is an\nelement of the @xmath Lie algebra . The gauge transformation for @xmath\nis given by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.106)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis transforms the fluctuation as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.107)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis is immediately translated in terms of the Yang-Mills theory as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.108)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nSecondly, we note that this noncommutative Yang-Mills theory preserves\nthe following @xmath supersymmetry.\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.109)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe have hitherto discussed the perturbation around the irreducible\nrepresentation of the fuzzy sphere ( 2.78 ). In this case, we obtain a\n@xmath abelian noncommutative Yang-Mills theory. The matrix model ( 2.76\n) also accommodates the fuzzy sphere solution of the reducible\nrepresentation\n\n  -- -- -- ---------\n           (2.110)\n  -- -- -- ---------\n\nWhen @xmath is the @xmath representation of the @xmath Lie algebra, the\nsize of the matrices @xmath satisfies @xmath . The perturbation around\nthis reducible representation gives the @xmath nonabelian theory.\n\n#### 2.4.2 Other attempts for higher-dimensional fuzzy sphere solution\n\nWe next review the extension of the above discussion to the\nhigher-dimensional fuzzy sphere classical solution. To this end, there\nare two strategies. First is the addition of the higher-dimensional\nChern-Simons term, and second is the addition of the tachyonic mass\nterm.\n\nThe first attempt is achieved by defining the following action [ 40 , 50\n] :\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.111)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nHere, we define this matrix model in the @xmath -dimensional Euclidean\nspace. The indices @xmath run over @xmath . The supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory can be defined only for the @xmath case, and the\nsupersymmetric matrix model cannot be defined except for the\nthree-dimensional case as we have reviewed before. Hence, we focus on\nthe bosonic matrix model in the following. Except for the @xmath\n(three-dimensional) case, the convergence of the path integral is not\nyet manifestly proven. Nevertheless, we surmise that the fuzzy-sphere\nclassical solution might be a metastable state, in that it is barriered\nby a high potential. We attribute this metastability to the similar\nreasoning to the @xmath matrix model. As we explain in Appendix C , the\n@xmath matrix model retains the metastability near the origin despite\nits unbounded-below potential.\n\nThe illuminating feature of this higher-dimensional matrix model is that\nit incorporates the classical solution of the @xmath fuzzy sphere. The\nequation of motion is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.112)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nIt has the following classical solution of the @xmath fuzzy sphere [ 10\n, 31 , 43 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nWe define the symmetric tensor product more explicitly, for @xmath case\n(namely, for the @xmath and @xmath fuzzy sphere). We denote the matrix\nelement using the orthonormal state @xmath and @xmath as @xmath . The\nusual tensor product (two-fold product, for brevity) is defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.114)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nOn the other hand, the symmetric tensor product is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.115)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe coefficient @xmath is determined, so that the symmetrized state may\nretain the orthonormality. Here, we give a more explicit definition for\nthe two-fold tensor product of the Paulian matrices ( @xmath case). For\nthe two-fold tensor product, the symmetrized orthonormal state is given\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.116)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis difference comes from the fact that the states @xmath and @xmath\nare symmetrized ab ovo and hence that we do not need symmetrization or\nnormalization. We elaborate on these definitions in terms of explicit\nrepresentation in terms of matrices. The usual tensor product ( 2.114 )\nis rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nOn the other hand, its symmetrization is rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe coefficient @xmath is related to the radius parameter of the fuzzy\nsphere @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.119)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere the coefficient @xmath is given later in the self-dual relation\nrelation ( 2.126 ).\n\nThe @xmath fuzzy sphere is mathematically more involved than the @xmath\nfuzzy sphere. We introduce the properties of the higher-dimensional\nfuzzy sphere solution. Firstly, the gamma matrices @xmath is defined by\nthe Wick rotation of those for the Minkowski spacetime given in Appendix\nA . The definition is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n                 \n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.120)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere @xmath runs over @xmath . Namely, we identify @xmath in the\nMinkowski space with @xmath in the Euclidean spacetime.\n\nThe size of the representation ( LABEL:fspsolution ) is given in [ 31 ]\nas\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (2.121)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe see a grave difference between the @xmath (three-dimensional) case\nand otherwise. For @xmath , the representation ( LABEL:fspsolution ) can\nbe defined for an arbitrary integer-size matrices (of course, except for\n1). However, this never holds true for @xmath case. For example, the\nrepresentation ( LABEL:fspsolution ) is possible only for a limited\ninteger size; namely @xmath .\n\nThe important property is that @xmath does not generically close with\nrespect to the commutator for @xmath . This is also a tremendous\ndifference between the three-dimensional case and the higher-dimensional\ncase. Here, we denote @xmath . These satisfy the following relations:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.122)\n     @xmath      (2.123)\n     @xmath      (2.124)\n     @xmath      (2.125)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nIn addition, @xmath satisfies the following self-dual relation.\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.126)\n     @xmath      (2.127)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nBefore verifying these properties, we start with convincing ourselves\nthat the notion of the higher-dimensional fuzzy sphere solution is a\ngeneralization of the @xmath Lie algebra. To this end, we focus on the\nrelation between the @xmath (three-dimensional) case and the @xmath Lie\nalgebra.\n\nFirstly, the @xmath -fold symmetric tensor product for @xmath is\nidentical to the @xmath -dimensional irreducible representation of the\n@xmath Lie algebra. We explicitly give the matrix element of the @xmath\ncase as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n              @xmath   @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n              @xmath   @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.128)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nThese are clearly identical to the @xmath representation of the @xmath\nLie algebra. In addition, the 2-fold tensor product obeys the following\nimportant relation:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.129)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nUtilizing this relation, the radius of the fuzzy sphere is derived as\nfollows:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.130)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nwhere we used ( 2.129 ) in the second equality and recall that @xmath .\nThis proves the relation ( 2.122 ) for @xmath . This is identical to the\nCasimir of the @xmath , which satisfies @xmath . Here, the relation\nbetween @xmath and @xmath is given by @xmath .\n\nThe self-dual relation ( 2.126 ) clearly reduces to the commutation\nrelation of the @xmath Lie algebra:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.131)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe next go into the proof of the relations ( 2.122 ) @xmath ( 2.126 ).\nWe immediately discern that ( 2.124 ) and ( 2.125 ) are verified from\nthe commutation relations of the gamma matrices. ( 2.122 ) can be\nsubstantiated by repeating the same argument as for ( 2.130 ) in the\n@xmath case. In promoting to the higher-dimensional case, we note that\nthe similar relation to ( 2.129 ) holds true of the general case; namely\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.132)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nFor @xmath , this relation can be verified as\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n                 @xmath   \n        @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n\nby using ( 2.129 ) twice. We can verify the higher- @xmath case\nrecursively in the same way. Once we prove ( 2.132 ), the proof of (\n2.122 ) goes in the same way as for ( 2.130 ).\n\nThe relation ( 2.123 ) is verified by the following calculation:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.133)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nLastly, we prove the relation ( 2.126 ). The brutal-force proof up to\n@xmath is given in [ 46 ] . However, the Gordian knot is cut in one\nstroke in [ 50 ] by noting the following reduction law. We consider the\nalgebra at the north pole of the fuzzy sphere; @xmath . Then, @xmath are\nthe generator of the @xmath rotation around the north pole, where the\nindices @xmath run over @xmath . For @xmath , the elements for the\n@xmath fuzzy sphere can be identified with those of the @xmath fuzzy\nsphere;\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.134)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis gives the recursive relation of the coefficient @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThis shows that the coefficient @xmath obeys the recursion relation (\n2.127 ).\n\nThis completes the relations ( 2.122 ) @xmath ( 2.126 ). We can see that\n( LABEL:fspsolution ) represents the sphere simply due to the relation (\n2.122 ). This gives the radius of the @xmath fuzzy sphere as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.136)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe relation ( 2.119 ) has a serious consequence for the radius. For the\n@xmath case, the radius is proportional to the coefficient @xmath .\nHowever, for @xmath case, the radius becomes smaller for the larger\ncoefficient @xmath .\n\nNextly, we point out that the @xmath fuzzy sphere is attached to the\n@xmath fuzzy sphere at each point. This property is understood by\nconsidering the algebra on the north pole @xmath . As we mentioned\nbefore, @xmath are the generators of the @xmath rotation. Since\nidentification ( 2.134 ) gives the algebra of the @xmath sphere, we see\nthat the @xmath sphere is attached on the north pole. While we see only\nthe north pole, it is clear that this holds true of all the points of\nthe @xmath sphere due to the rotational symmetry. Due to the\nidentification ( 2.134 ), the radius of the @xmath fuzzy sphere attached\nto the @xmath sphere is clearly given by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.137)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis property can be understood from the viewpoint of the stabilizer\ngroup. The stabilizer group of the @xmath fuzzy sphere is @xmath . This\nis identical to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (2.138)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nThis solidifies the fact that the @xmath sphere is attached on the\n@xmath sphere.\n\nWe see another grave difference between the @xmath and the\nhigher-dimensional @xmath fuzzy sphere with respect to the classical\nstability. The classical energy is easily calculated by plugging the\nfuzzy sphere solution @xmath into the action as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.139)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nIn this derivation, we use the relation ( 2.122 ) and ( 2.123 ), as well\nas the self-dual relation ( 2.126 ). The classical energy ( 2.139 ) is\nnegative for the three-dimensional ( @xmath ) case, and thus\nenergetically favored than the flat background @xmath , for which @xmath\n. However, the reverse is the case with the @xmath case. In this case,\nthe fuzzy sphere solution is less energetically favored.\n\nWe have seen the alternative matrix model incorporating the\nhigher-dimensional fuzzy sphere solution and the properties of the\nsolution. Another choice is to add the tachyonic mass term to the\nbosonic part of the IIB matrix model as [ 29 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.140)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis model is defined by the general @xmath -dimensional Euclidean space\n(here, the indices @xmath run over @xmath ). The convergence of the path\nintegral of this matrix model is not clear, while it is balanced by the\nmass term and the quartic term. This comes from the diagonal part of the\nmatrices @xmath . The diagonal part of @xmath of course contributes to\nthe tachyonic mass term. Whereas, the quartic term comprises the\ncommutator, so that the diagonal part is canceled. This is a serious\ndrawback, compared with the matrix model with the Chern-Simons term.\n\nThe equation of motion\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.141)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\ngives a variety of the curved-space classical solution. Due to the\ncommutation relation ( 2.124 ) and ( 2.125 ), (for @xmath ) it\naccommodates the @xmath fuzzy sphere solution\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.142)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere @xmath and the mass @xmath is now related as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.143)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe classical energy of the fuzzy sphere solution @xmath for the action\n( 2.141 ) is\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (2.144)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis matrix model model has a wider class of the non-trivial classical\nbackground than the matrix model with the Chern-Simons term. While we\ndelegate the explicit definition to the paper [ 29 ] , this matrix model\naccommodates the classical solution of the fuzzy torus. This property is\nnot shared with the matrix model with the Chern-Simons term. In this\nsense, the matrix model with a tachyonic mass term is an interesting\nattempt for a richer curved space background of the matrix model.\n\n### 2.5 Other related studies\n\nIn this brief review, we do not exhaust all the recent developments of\nthe IIB matrix model. Instead, we touch on the other important studies\nof the IIB matrix model to conclude this review. Firstly, in [ 11 ] ,\nthe reasoning for the IIB matrix model to induce the four-dimensional\nspacetime dynamically has been found. The novelty is that they related\nthe branched polymer and the eigenvalue distribution of the IIB matrix\nmodel. In this way, they found that the Hausdorff dimension of the set\nof the eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath is four. This is a great\ndiscovery, in that the IIB matrix model implies the dynamical generation\nof our real four-dimensional world. This issue is reviewed in detail in\n[ 16 , 75 ] .\n\nAnother proposal for the dynamical generation of the four-dimensional\nspacetime is proposed in [ 36 ] . In this paper, they discussed the\nGaussian expansion of the IIB matrix model, by taking the quadratic\naction to be the \u201dtest action\u201d. They conducted the third-order\ncalculation of the Gaussian expansion, and found that the @xmath Lorentz\nsymmetry breaks down to the @xmath symmetry. This also serves as an\nimportant evidence for the generation of the four-dimensional spacetime.\nIn [ 39 , 48 ] , they refined the calculation by means of the improved\nTaylor expansion and the notion of the 2PI (two-particle irreducible)\nFeynman diagram. They substantiated the breakdown of the @xmath Lorentz\nsymmetry to the @xmath up to the seventh order of the Gaussian\nexpansion.\n\nThe IIB matrix model is a successful proposal for the constructive\ndefinition of the superstring theory, and possesses many exciting\nproperties which solidify the confidence that it is an authentic\nconstructive definition.\n\n## 3 Studies of the @xmath supermatrix model\n\nIn this section, we discuss the matrix model based on the @xmath super\nLie algebra, as a natural extension of the IIB matrix model. Firstly, L.\nSmolin [ 19 ] proposed the matrix model based on the @xmath super Lie\nalgebra as an M-theory matrix model. Smolin discussed the possibility\nfor this matrix model to induce both the BFSS model [ 4 ] and the IIB\nmatrix model [ 5 ] .\n\nAs we have briefly reviewed in the previous section, the IIB matrix\nmodel enjoys a lot of successful aspects. And, we have also discussed\nsome of the attempts for the extensions of the IIB matrix model for a\nmore manifest formulation of the gravitational interaction. Here, we\nintroduce the \u201dsupermatrix models\u201d, which are defined by the \u201dsuper Lie\nalgebra\u201d. There are a lot of illuminating features to the supermatrix\nmodel. Firstly, the models include both the bosons and the fermions in a\nunified way, since the bosons and the fermions are embedded in the same\nmultiplet. Secondly, as we will see more closely in the definition, the\nsupermatrix models accommodate the higher-rank tensor fields, as well as\nthe rank-1 bosonic fields @xmath . Especially, this opens the door to\nthe generalization of the spin connection in terms of the large- @xmath\nreduced models. If we are to describe a gravitational interaction more\nmanifestly, we should take this question more seriously. Thirdly, the\naction is described by the cubic term of the supermatrix. This might be\na natural aspect for the generalization of the superstring theory,\nbecause the cubic interaction is the fundamental one in the sense that\nthe four-point interaction is identical to the connection of the two\ncubic interactions due to the conformal invariance. Moreover, this model\nmight be solvable in relation to the Chern-Simons theory. The\nChern-Simons theory is known to be exactly solvable by means of the\nJones Polynomial in the knot theory [ 73 ] . If we find a correspondence\nbetween the cubic matrix model and Witten\u2019s technique of solving the\nChern-Simons theory, we may obtain a way to solve the superstring theory\nexactly in the distant future. This section is based on the author\u2019s\nworks [ 26 , 46 ] .\n\n### 3.1 Definition of the @xmath super Lie algebra\n\nBefore entering the investigation of the superstring action, we settle\nthe definition of a super Lie algebra. A super Lie algebra is an algebra\nof supermatrix in which both bosonic matrices and the fermionic matrices\nare embedded in one matrix. Supermatrices possess many properties\ndifferent from (ordinary) matrices, and these properties and the\nnotations are summarized in detail in Appendix. A.2 .\n\nLet us start with the definition of the @xmath super Lie algebra.\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n        @xmath   @xmath   \n        @xmath   @xmath   \n        @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n\nWe confirm that, for the first condition, @xmath forms a closed super\nLie algebra. Suppose matrices @xmath and @xmath satisfy the condition\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIf @xmath is to be a closed super Lie algebra, we call for the following\ncondition:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nMultiplying @xmath on both ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) from the left, we\nrespectively obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath . The proof that @xmath is a closed super Lie algebra is\nequivalent to deriving ( 3.4 ) utilizing ( 3.3 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThis statement, per se, can be satisfied whatever the matrix @xmath may\nbe so long as @xmath has an inverse matrix.\n\nHere comes one question: Why do we define a metric @xmath as @xmath ?\nThis stems from the requirement that @xmath should be a real matrix;\nnamely @xmath . Let us consider the consistency between this reality\ncondition and the very definition of @xmath super Lie algebra. Take a\nhermitian conjugate of the definition @xmath . This gives\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nUtilizing the properties introduced in the Appendix. A.2.3 , and the\nreality condition, this is rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn order for the relationship ( LABEL:AZM3ccdef ) to be consistent with\nthe very definition of @xmath , we must call for a condition @xmath .\nAnd the starting point of @xmath is well-defined if we take a metric as\n@xmath .\n\nThe next issue is to investigate the explicit form of this super Lie\nalgebra. This is expressed by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n-   @xmath contains only the terms of rank 1,2,5. In other words, @xmath\n    is expressed as\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (3.9)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\n-   Here @xmath denotes @xmath . However, this is equivalent to @xmath ,\n    because we are now considering a real super Lie algebra.\n\nThe proof of this restriction goes as follows. Let @xmath be the element\nof @xmath and @xmath :\n\n-   @xmath is defined as @xmath .\n\n-   Because @xmath is a real supermatrix, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are\n    real, while @xmath is pure imaginary (and hence @xmath is real).\n\nBy substituting this formula into the very definition, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nWe immediately obtain the relationship between two fermionic fields\n@xmath and @xmath from this definition:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nBy multiplying @xmath on the both hand sides from the left , we obtain\nthe relationship between @xmath and @xmath . We immediately note that\n@xmath is equivalent to the equation ( 3.10 ).\n\nThe constraint on @xmath is trivial, and @xmath must vanish. On the\nother hand, the constraint on @xmath is worth a careful investigation.\n@xmath is imposed on the constraint\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is the very definition of the Lie algebra called @xmath , and this\nstatement indicates that the bosonic @xmath matrix of the @xmath super\nLie algebra must belong to the @xmath Lie algebra. In analyzing this\nsupermatrix model, it is more convenient to decompose the bosonic part\n@xmath in terms of the basis of arbitrary @xmath matrices \u00b2 \u00b2 2 Actually\nthis is a @xmath dimensional basis, because the dimension of this basis\nis @xmath . . Namely, we decompose the bosonic part @xmath in terms of\nthe eleven-dimensional gamma matrices @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath\n, @xmath and @xmath , rather than to obey the expression in the paper [\n19 ] .\n\nThe relationship ( 3.11 ) determines what rank of the 11 dimensional\ngamma matrices survive. Suppose @xmath are expressed in terms of the\ngamma matrices:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe condition ( 3.11 ) is rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen, performing the following computation for @xmath , we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the rank of the gamma matrices. Combining this result\nwith the constraint of the @xmath Lie algebra ( 3.13 ), we discern that\nonly the gamma matrices of rank 1, 2 and 5 survive. We are thus finished\nwith verifying the explicit form of the @xmath super Lie algebra.\n\n### 3.2 @xmath (nongauged) cubic matrix model\n\n#### 3.2.1 Action of the cubic supermatrix model\n\nWe first discuss the nongauged action of the @xmath super Lie algebra\n(we postpone the meaning of the \u201d(non)gauged action\u201d later). We start\nwith the following action proposed by L. Smolin [ 19 ] :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.15)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nHere, @xmath is a supermatrix belonging to the @xmath super Lie algebra.\nThe indices @xmath and @xmath respectively run over @xmath and @xmath .\nThese indices are respectively allocated for the whole @xmath @xmath\nsupermatrix, and the @xmath bosonic part. Here, we promote each\ncomponent of the @xmath super Lie algebra to the @xmath hermitian\nmatrices. In the following, the lowercase trace and the uppercase trace\nare for the @xmath matrices and the @xmath matrices, respectively.\n@xmath is a structure constant of the @xmath Lie algebra, and @xmath is\nnecessitated in the overall definition of the supermatrix model in order\nto render the action real.\n\nThis model apparently possesses the following pathological properties [\n19 ] . The first is that this theory is not bounded from above or below.\nThis pathology stems from the fact that the action is cubic , and can be\nseen by a naive field redefinition @xmath . The action is rewritten as\n@xmath , and we can set this action to be @xmath by setting the\nparameter to be @xmath . This means that the path integral of the theory\n@xmath does not converge. However, note that this pathology is shared by\ngeneral relativity. This pathological property of general relativity can\nbe seen by Weyl transformation\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nAlthough this pathology of Smolin\u2019s proposal is not a happy aspect, this\nmay be regarded as a good news because this may indicate that Smolin\u2019s\nproposals may include general relativity by taking a due limit. The\nsecond problem is that this theory possesses no explicit time\ncoordinate. This is again a property shared by the general relativity.\nWe can introduce a time coordinate by expanding the theory around a\ncertain background. Once a time coordinate is introduced, we can\nconstruct a Hamiltonian of this theory.\n\nWe mention the symmetries of this matrix model. Firstly, this model\nnaturally has the @xmath symmetry, which is the extension of the @xmath\nLorentz symmetry. We note that this symmetry is possible only when we\ndefine the theory in terms of the supertrace, which is defined as @xmath\n. The cyclic rule of the supermatrix holds true not for the ordinary\ntrace but for the supertrace. This property can be verified by the\nfollowing argument. We consider the following two arbitrary matrices\n@xmath , @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath are 32 @xmath 32 bosonic\nmatrices, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are 32-component fermionic\nvectors, and @xmath and @xmath are c-numbers. We consider the supertrace\nof @xmath and @xmath , which are calculated as @xmath , and @xmath .\nSince @xmath and @xmath are fermionic quantities, the sign flips if we\nchange the order. Therefore, we establish that it is not an ordinary\ntrace but a supertrace that the cyclic rule @xmath holds true of the\nsupermatrix.\n\nWe next discuss its gauge symmetry. This model is invariant under the\nfollowing @xmath transformation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this symmetry, we do not mix the @xmath transformation and the @xmath\ntransformation. We have a closer look at the mixed symmetry in an\nattempt to realize the local Lorentz symmetry, and we call such models\n\u201dgauged models\u201d. On the other hand, we call the action ( 3.15 )\n\u201dnongauged\u201d, because we do not mix these two symmetry. This \u201dnongauged\nsymmetry\u201d is close to the symmetry of the IIB matrix model, in which the\n@xmath Lorentz symmetry and the @xmath gauge symmetry are separate.\n\nIn addition, this model incorporates the trivial shift of the\nsupermatrix\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe action ( 3.15 ) is rewritten in terms of the explicit expression of\nthe @xmath super Lie algebra @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe consider the reduction of the model to the ten-dimensions. To this\nend, we first rewrite the action ( 3.15 ) in terms of the expansion for\nthe eleven-dimensional gamma matrices as ( 3.9 ). In order to see the\ncorrespondence between the ten-dimensional IIB matrix model, we perform\na reduction to the ten dimensions. To this end, we specialize the tenth\ndirection @xmath , and we retain the @xmath rotational symmetry. We\ndefine the ten-dimensional fields by the following chiral decomposition\nof the bosonic matrix @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.19)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nHere, we also recall the notation of the left(right)-handed fermion:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe coefficients @xmath and @xmath are self-dual to each other. Namely,\nthey satisfy the relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe action is thus expanded as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.21)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                         \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.22)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the bosonic and fermionic parts of the\naction @xmath , respectively. The whole action is @xmath . The\ncomputation of this action is lengthy, and we delegate the proof to\nAppendix B.2. of [ 27 ] .\n\n#### 3.2.2 Identification of the supersymmetry with the IIB matrix model\n\nWe next discuss the identification of the supersymmetry with that of the\nIIB matrix model. This model has two kinds of supersymmetry\ntransformation, corresponding to the @xmath rotational symmetry and the\ntranslation symmetry.\n\n-   The former supersymmetry corresponding to the @xmath rotation is\n    called the \u201dhomogeneous supersymmetry\u201d, in the same sense as for the\n    IIB matrix model. This is defined by the rotation by the supercharge\n    @xmath . Namely, the transformation of the matrices @xmath is given\n    by\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (3.23)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n-   The latter supersymmetry corresponds to the translation symmetry.\n    This is called the \u201dinhomogeneous supersymmetry\u201d, and is defined by\n    the simple translation of the fermion @xmath .\n\nIn this way, the @xmath supermatrix model has @xmath supercharges. This\nis twice as much as the IIB matrix model. This simply leads us to\nspeculate that the double structures of the IIB matrix model are\nembedded in this supermatrix model. We elaborate on this point, by\nscrutinizing the commutation relation. Especially, we elucidate that\nthere is a nice correspondence with the supersymmetry of the IIB matrix\nmodel, with the chiral decomposition ( 3.19 ). Namely, we identify\n@xmath with the vector fields of the IIB matrix model, and consider its\nsupersymmetry transformation.\n\nSince the fields @xmath are given by \u00b3 \u00b3 3 We recall that @xmath while\n@xmath . Here, we do not take a summation with respect to the duplicate\nindices @xmath .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nthe homogeneous transformation of the vector fields @xmath and @xmath is\ncomputed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.25)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.26)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.27)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe transformation of the vector fields @xmath is beautifully\nreminiscent of the homogeneous transformation of the IIB matrix model.\nIn this sense, we see a correspondence between the chirality of the\nvector fields and the fermions as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe chirally-decomposed fermions @xmath clearly have 16 components,\nwhich coincides the number of the supercharges for the IIB matrix model.\nIn this sense, this identification augurs very well for the reproduction\nof the supersymmetry of the IIB matrix model. On the other hand, the\nhomogeneous transformation of the fermion is given by ( 3.26 ), and is\ndevoid of the commutator of the vector fields like the IIB matrix model.\nThis is a downside in the identification of the supersymmetry\ntransformation with that of the IIB matrix model.\n\nNextly, we have a close look at the commutation relation of the\nsupersymmetry transformation. We wish to find the similar structure of\nthe commutation relations as that of the IIB matrix model. We consider\nthe following commutation relations:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is trivial that the commutator (2) vanishes, because the\ninhomogeneous supersymmetry is nothing but a translation of the fermion.\nHere, we scrutinize the rest of the commutators one by one.\n\n##### Supersymmetry transformation @xmath\n\nIn the IIB matrix model, only the commutator ( 2.33 ) remains\nnonvanishing. We attempt to extract the similar structure to the\ncommutation relation ( 2.33 ). The commutator of the supersymmetry\ntransformation for each @xmath and @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhich can be derived in the same way as ( 2.33 ). Namely, we take the\ndifference of the following paths:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe commutator of the supersymmetry transformation for each @xmath can\nbe extracted as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.31)\n     @xmath      (3.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nExtracting the specific chirality of the SUSY parameters, we obtain the\nnonvanishing commutators as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (3.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe commutators with different chirality of the two supersymmetry\nparameters clearly vanish:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese combinations of the supersymmetry transformations clearly resemble\nthe structure of the IIB matrix model. The correspondence between the\nvector fields and the chirality of the fermionic fields matches that\nobtained by the correspondence of the homogeneous transformation itself.\n\n##### Supersymmetry transformation @xmath\n\nIn the case of the IIB matrix model, this supersymmetry transformation\nvanishes on shell up to the gauge transformation, as we have seen in (\n2.31 ). We want to find the same vanishing in our cubic model, if we are\nto identify the supersymmetry transformation. However, it turns out that\nthis commutator does not vanish. In investigating this commutation\nrelation, it is easier to utilize the following identity:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis commutator of the SUSY transformation is thus obtained by\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (3.36)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nThis relation reveals that the commutators of the two homogeneous\ntransformation are\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.37)\n     @xmath      (3.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe have seen in ( 3.33 ) which chiralities of the supersymmetry\nparameters correspond to the vector fields @xmath . According to this\ncorrespondence, we examine the commutation relation with respect to the\nfollowing cases.\n\nWe first investigate the commutation relation @xmath . We examine this\ncommutation relation of this SUSY transformation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, we recall that the commutator @xmath belong to the @xmath Lie\nalgebra (namely, only the rank-1,2,5 contributions remain).\nUnfortunately, this commutation relation does not vanish exactly in the\nten-dimensional reduction. Now, we have a close look at which components\nsurvive or vanish: Since the chirality of the supersymmetry parameter is\nidentical, the contribution of the odd-rank fields of @xmath (with\nrespect to the ten-dimensional indices) clearly vanishes. On the other\nhand, the contribution of the even-rank fields @xmath survives. For\nexample, the contribution of the rank-0 field @xmath is obtained as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe next investigate the commutation relation of other chirality. @xmath\n. The corresponding field is now @xmath , and the commutation relation\nis now\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nby completely computing in the same fashion as in ( 3.39 ), and we note\nthat the contribution of the even-rank fields @xmath remains\nnonvanishing.\n\nEven the worse news comes in the commutator for the different chirality\nof the supersymmetry parameter. The commutator for the rank-1 vector\nfield is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n                 (3.42)\n     @xmath      \n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe disastrous fact is that these commutators include the fields @xmath\nand @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese commutation relations reveal that the two-fold supersymmetry is\nnot independent of each other, but are connected by not the impurity\n@xmath and @xmath , but the fields @xmath . This is an unfavorable\nsituation in the analysis of the supersymmetry transformation of this\ncubic model.\n\n##### Summary of the supersymmetry structure\n\nWe recapitulate what we have obtained from the above argument of the\nsupersymmetry. Firstly, we have noted that this supermatrix model\nincorporates the two-fold structure of the supersymmetry of the IIB\nmatrix model. This is predictable from the number of the supercharges.\nThis model has the homogeneous supersymmetry and the inhomogeneous\nsupersymmetry coming from the @xmath rotation and the translation\nsymmetry, respectively. Therefore, this model has 64 supercharges, which\nis twice as many as the IIB matrix model. The IIB-like structure of the\nsupersymmetry is extracted by the chiral decomposition of the rank-1\nfield and the supercharges, and we have seen the correspondence ( 3.28\n). While we have reproduced the commutation relation ( 2.31 ) and ( 2.32\n) from the commutator @xmath and @xmath , the commutator @xmath does not\ntrivially vanish, unlike the IIB matrix model. Moreover, the commutation\nrelation ( 3.44 ) unravels that these two supersymmetries are not\nindependent of each other. Its physical interpretation will be reported\nelsewhere.\n\n#### 3.2.3 Induction of the IIB matrix model\n\nWe have seen the correspondence of the supersymmetry with the IIB matrix\nmodel, and we have elucidated the correspondence of the chirality\nbetween the rank-1 vector fields and the supersymmetry parameter as (\n3.28 ). This leads us to the idea that we may be able to induce the IIB\nmatrix model if we integrate out certain fields. To this end, we retain\nthe field @xmath and @xmath , and integrate out the other fields.\nHowever, the solid discussion for the extraction of the IIB matrix model\nis an onerous question, and we contend ourselves with a hand-waving\nargument. This supermatrix model possesses no time spacetime derivative\nfrom the outset, as is true of the IIB matrix model. Its classical\nequation of motion @xmath clearly incorporates the following\nnoncommutative background\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath satisfies the canonical commutation relation @xmath . When\nwe denote the fluctuation as @xmath , the commutator is mapped as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThen, the bosonic and the fermionic terms of the action are expanded as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.47)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                         \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n              @xmath   @xmath            \n              @xmath   @xmath            \n              @xmath   @xmath            \n              @xmath   @xmath            (3.49)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe cubic action, per se, does not include a quartic term of vector\nfields in the action. However, we can interpret that the bosonic term is\ninduced by the fermionic term of the the IIB matrix model. The idea that\nthe theory consisting of fermionic fields and a Dirac operator induces\nthe Einstein gravity and the Yang-Mills theory has long been suggested.\nThe proposal of Connes and Chamseddine is one of these suggestions of\nthe induced gravity [ 3 ] . Based on these suggestions, we find it a\nnatural idea that the bosonic term of the IIB matrix model is induced\nfrom its fermionic term. And we hypothesize that the whole IIB model\nshould be induced only by the fermionic field.\n\nOur goal is thus to find the fermionic terms in this cubic matrix model\nto be identified with that of the IIB matrix model. We have seen in the\nprevious section the correspondence between the vector fields and the\nfermionic fields according to the identification of @xmath supersymmetry\nwith that of the IIB matrix model. And the fermionic terms to be\nidentified with that if the IIB matrix model is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.50)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIf either of these terms exists in the action, this can be identified\nwith the fermionic term of the IIB matrix model. However, the kinetic\nterm of the fermionic fields ( 3.2.3 ), per se, does not include such\nterms as ( 3.50 ), and does not serve to induce the IIB matrix model due\nto the discrepancy of the correspondence of the vector fields and the\nchirality of the fermions. In order to remedy this situation, we\nconsider inducing the terms ( 3.50 ) by the multi-loop effect. The\naction ( 3.47 ) @xmath ( 3.49 ) just tells us that there is no terms to\nbe identified with the IIB matrix model at a tree level . Since the idea\nof \u2019inducing the IIB matrix model\u2019 is to construct the bosonic term by\nthe one-loop effect of the fermionic Lagrangian, the idea of \u2019induced\ntheory\u2019 is a notion based on the multi-loop effect of the perturbative\ntheory. In this sense, there is no problem if the fermionic term is\ninduced by the multi-loop effect.\n\nWe can read off the Feynman rule from the above action. The typical\npropagators and the vertices are given below:\n\nOur goal is to build a fermion vertex ( 3.50 ) by means of the\nmulti-loop effect. In order to build such a term, the above Feynman\ndiagrams do not suffice. Especially we are lacking the propagators of\nthe fields. It is thus necessary to build an induced propagators by\nmeans of the multi-loop effect of the existing Feynman rule. These\ninduced propagators are constructed by the following loop effect.\n\n-   @xmath : It is easy to construct this induced propagator. All we\n    have to do is to connect the fermions using the existing fermion\n    propagators @xmath .\n\n-   @xmath and @xmath : The construction of these propagators is a\n    difficult problem. Unfortunately, it is impossible to construct\n    these propagators perturbatively, and we delegate the disproof of\n    their existence in Appendix B.4. of [ 27 ] . However, this is not\n    the end of the story. Even if we fail to induce these propagators\n    perturbatively, we have a choice to induce these propagators by\n    means of the nonperturbative effect. These propagators may be\n    induced by the following recursive structure.\n\n    This structure is reminiscent of the self-consistency condition of\n    Nambu-Jona-Lasino model. And when we consider the nonperturbative \u2074\n    \u2074 4 Here, we mean the word \u2019nonperturbative\u2019 by the effect not\n    stemming from the multi-loop effect of Feynman diagram. effect,\n    there is no particular conservation law which prohibits the\n    existence of the propagators @xmath or @xmath . Throughout our\n    discussion, we assume the existence of these propagators.\n\nNow we are ready to construct the induced propagators of this cubic\nmodel. In constructing the vertices of the fermionic terms ( 3.50 ). The\nanswer is now easy, and the IIB-like vertex is constructed by the\nfollowing procedure.\n\n-   To construct the induced vertex corresponding to ( 3.50 ), we must\n    first construct two objects. One is the propagator @xmath . This is\n    easily constructed once we admit the existence of the propagator\n    @xmath .\n\n-   Another object is the vertex @xmath . It is also easy to construct\n    this vertex utilizing the induced propagator @xmath .\n\n-   These two objects serve to induce our desired term @xmath . Note\n    that this induced propagator indicates that the kinetic term @xmath\n    . This is diagrammatically regarded as the vertex of @xmath , @xmath\n    and @xmath , where @xmath , around which we have expanded the\n    theory. Therefore, the sum of these two objects is regarded as\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (3.51)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe thus build the vertex for the bosonic field @xmath and the\ncorresponding fermionic field @xmath . This fermionic operator serves to\nderive the bosonic quartic terms of the IIB matrix model. In this way,\nwe expect that the IIB matrix model is induced from the @xmath\nsupermatrix model.\n\n### 3.3 @xmath gauged cubic matrix model\n\nWe next investigate the gauged version of the supermatrix model.\nOriginally, L. Smolin [ 19 ] touched on the suggestion to enhance the\nsymmetry of the matrix model, by regarding the tensor product as not for\nthe Lie group but for the Lie algebra. This attempt is fascinating, in\nthat it broadens the symmetry greatly. Smolin\u2019s proposal turns out to be\nessential to build a matrix model with local Lorentz invariance. To\nelaborate on this point, let us think about the extension of the IIB\nmatrix model to the local Lorentz invariant model. In the IIB matrix\nmodel, we regard the eigenvalues of the matrices as the spacetime\ncoordinate. Therefore, in order to render the Lorentz symmetry \u201dlocal\u201d,\nit is imperative that the parameter of the Lorentz transformation should\nbe dependent on the @xmath element in a nontrivial way [ 26 , 38 ] .\nThen, we introduce the so-called \u201dgauged matrix model\u201d, in order to\nbuild such a matrix model.\n\nIn the IIB matrix model, the @xmath Lorentz symmetry and the @xmath\nsymmetry are totally decoupled. Now, let @xmath and @xmath be the\ngenerator of the @xmath and the @xmath symmetry, respectively (i.e.\n@xmath and @xmath ). The symmetry is a tensor product of the group;\nnamely they are decoupled in terms of the Lie algebra as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.52)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis holds of the nongauged version of the supermatrix model.\n\nOn the other hand, in the gauged model, we enhance the symmetry\ndrastically by mixing these two symmetry. Namely, the element of the\ntransformation group is not @xmath but\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.53)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this way, we build a Lorentz symmetry dependent on the @xmath\nsymmetry. We define a generator with the tensor product of the two Lie\nalgebra. However, we need a caution in defining a tensor product of the\nLie algebra. Suppose @xmath are two different Lie algebra whose bases\nare @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Generally, the space @xmath ,\nwhich is spanned by the basis @xmath , does not close with respect to\nthe commutator\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.54)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nRather, we define the tensor product by @xmath , which is the smallest\nLie algebra that includes @xmath as a subset \u2075 \u2075 5 To illustrate this\nidea, we introduce the following simple case. The Lie algebra @xmath is\nknown as the tensor product of the Lie algebras @xmath and @xmath :\n\n@xmath\n\nThis fact is discerned as follows. Let @xmath and @xmath be the basis of\nthe Lie algebra @xmath and @xmath , respectively. @xmath and @xmath are\n8 and 3 dimensional Lie algebras respectively, and the indices run\n@xmath and @xmath . The tensor product @xmath consists of the following\nelements. @xmath : These are the elements of the tensor product as a set\nof matrices: @xmath . This set, per se, does not constitute a closed Lie\nalgebra. @xmath and @xmath : These are the generators of the group\n@xmath . These elements are known to constitute the algebra of @xmath .\nThis example shows in a pedagogical way how the notion of \u2019gauged\ntheory\u2019 enhances the gauge symmetry. While the Lie algebra of the gauge\ngroup @xmath is a @xmath dimensional algebra, the tensor product @xmath\nis a @xmath dimensional Lie algebra. This is the structure of the\nenhancement of the gauge symmetry. Note that the similar enhancement of\nthe gauge symmetry is seen in Smolin\u2019s proposal [ 19 , 23 ] . .\n\nIn the large- @xmath reduced models, there are several ways to interpret\nthe spacetime coordinate. In the twisted reduced models [ 65 , 66 ] ,\nthe matrices @xmath represent the covariant derivative in the spacetime.\nOn the other hand, in the IIB matrix model, the eigenvalues of the\nmatrices @xmath are regarded as the spacetime coordinate. Both relations\nare linked by the expansion around the flat noncommutative background\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe IIB matrix model reduces to the non-commutative Yang-Mills theory\nafter this reduction. The fermionic term of the IIB matrix model @xmath\nreduced to the action of the fermion in the flat space\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis reminds us of the correspondence between the differential operators\nand the matrices.\n\nWith this idea in mind, we attempt to formulate a matrix model with the\nlocal Lorentz invariance, in which the matrices @xmath look like\ndifferential operators. The action should reduce in the classical\nlow-energy limit to the fermionic action on the curved spacetime\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.57)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, the indices @xmath and @xmath both run over @xmath . The former\nand the latter denote the indices of the Minkowskian and the curved\nspacetime, respectively. In considering the correspondence with the\nmatrix model, we need to absorb @xmath into the definition of the\nfermionic field, since it is not @xmath but @xmath that corresponds to\nthe trace of the large @xmath matrices. And we regard the \u201dspinor root\ndensity\u201d\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nas the fundamental quantity. Then, the action is rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nwhere we have utilized in the last equality the fact that the fermionic\nfield @xmath is Majorana, which leads to the cancellation @xmath . The\ncorresponding matrix model is formulated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn promoting the action ( LABEL:AZ1bonafidefermion ) to the matrix\nmodel, we have identified the covariant derivative with the commutator\nwith the rank-1 matrix @xmath . The rank-3 term is a naive product of\nthe spin connection and the fermion, and it is natural to promote the\nproduct to the anticommutator of the large @xmath hermitian matrices \u2076 \u2076\n6 For the readers\u2019 convenience, we summarize the commutation relations\nof the hermitian and anti-hermitian operators. Let @xmath and @xmath be\nthe set of the hermitian and anti-hermitian operators, respectively.\nWhen @xmath and @xmath , their commutation relations are as follows:\n\nWe prove only the first relation, because the others are easily derived\nin the same way:\n\n@xmath\n\n. In the rank-3 term, the pure imaginary number @xmath is necessary so\nthat the action should be hermitian. The action ( 3.60 ) is an addition\nof the rank-3 term to the fermionic term of the action of IIB matrix\nmodel. Especially when @xmath is a Majorana fermion, ( 3.60 ) is\nequivalent to the following action:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.61)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe equivalence between ( 3.60 ) and ( 3.61 ) is verified as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nLet us next consider the local Lorentz transformation of this matrix\nmodel. Originally the local Lorentz transformation of the fermionic\nfield @xmath should be promoted to the anticommutator of the hermitian\nmatrices as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.62)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nin order to retain the hermiticity. However, it is a very onerous\nproblem to find an action invariant under this transformation. The\nconundrum stems from the noncommutativity of the matrices . The local\nLorentz transformation of the fermion ( 3.62 ) with respect to the\naction ( 3.61 ) entails the terms\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.63)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is extremely difficult to absorb this transformation via the local\nLorentz transformation of the bosonic fields @xmath .\n\nThis obstacle forces us to abstain the hermiticity of the matrices. We\ninstead promote this transformation to the matrix version as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.64)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nand we take the action ( 3.61 ). Since the fermion is no longer\nhermitian, the actions ( 3.60 ) and ( 3.61 ) are no longer equivalent.\nThere are two prices we must pay for this alteration. One is that the\nproduct @xmath does not directly correspond to the covariant derivative.\nThe other is that the matrix model ( 3.61 ) is no longer invariant under\nthe translation @xmath , which is a spacetime translation in the\noriginal interpretation of the IIB matrix model.\n\nThe local Lorentz transformation of the action ( 3.61 ) is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.65)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSince we are now considering the local Lorentz transformation and their\nspace-time dependent parameters are promoted to @xmath matrices, the\ninfinitesimal parameters @xmath are @xmath matrices. Then, the\ncommutator\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nmust include the rank-5 gamma matrices, and the action ( 3.61 ) is not\ninvariant under the local Lorentz transformation.\n\nThe similar thing holds true of the generator of the local Lorentz\ntransformation ( 3.64 ). In order for the algebra to close, only the\nrank-2 terms are not sufficient, because the commutator\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.67)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nincludes the rank-4 gamma matrices.\n\nLet us recapitulate what we have obtained through this observation.\n\n-   Since the information of the spacetime is encoded in the bosonic\n    matrices @xmath , the parameter of the local Lorentz transformation\n    must depend on the @xmath element in a nontrivial manner. This leads\n    us to consider the \u201dgauged\u201d action.\n\n-   The correspondence of the matrices @xmath and the covariant\n    derivative motivates us to construct a matrix model in which the\n    matrices @xmath looks like a differential operators.\n\n-   It is difficult to retain the hermiticity of the fermionic field,\n    when we build a local Lorentz invariant action. This forces us to\n    abstain the hermiticity of the fields, despite the following\n    drawbacks.\n\n    -   The term @xmath no longer corresponds to the covariant\n        derivative @xmath .\n\n    -   The matrix model ( 3.61 ) is no longer invariant under the\n        translation @xmath , which is a spacetime translation in the\n        original interpretation of the IIB matrix model\n\n-   The \u201dgauged\u201d symmetry necessitates the higher-rank fields and the\n    local Lorentz transformation parameters.\n\nThis observation leads us to regard the \u201dgauged\u201d version of the\nsupermatrix model as a mesmerizing candidate for the local Lorentz\ninvariant extension of the IIB matrix model. To this end, we consider\nthe @xmath super Lie algebra, which is the analytic continuation of the\n@xmath , the complexification of the @xmath . In addition, we mix the\n@xmath symmetry and the @xmath gauge symmetry.\n\nThis observation is also elaborated in another angle without the\nsupermatrix models in Section 4 .\n\n#### 3.3.1 Definition of the @xmath and @xmath super Lie algebra\n\nThe @xmath super Lie algebra is a cousin of the @xmath super Lie\nalgebra. More accurately, @xmath is obtained by the analytic\ncontinuation of the imaginary part of the @xmath . Therefore, we start\nwith introducing the @xmath super Lie algebra.\n\nThe very definition of this super Lie algebra is that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.68)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThat this is a complexification of @xmath can be seen from the following\naspect. Unlike the @xmath super Lie algebra, we do not restrict @xmath\nto be a real supermatrix, where the reality of the supermatrix is\ndefined as @xmath . Therefore, we must replace the transpose by the\nhermitian conjugate . Note that in the real version the complex\nconjugate is equivalent to the transpose according to the property in\nAppendix. A.2 .\n\nWe can confirm that the super Lie algebra @xmath actually closes in\ntotally the same fashion as in @xmath . The legitimacy of the metric\n@xmath also stems from the same logic as in @xmath . We specify the\nelement of @xmath group according to the above definition. The result is\nthat\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.69)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n-   @xmath is restricted to be a pure imaginary number.\n\n-   @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are real numbers, while @xmath , @xmath\n    and @xmath are pure imaginary numbers.\n\nThis result is derived from the very definition of the super Lie algebra\n@xmath . The complex conjugate of supermatrices is defined in Appendix.\nA.2 :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\n-   Since @xmath , ( LABEL:AZ51su116162 ) immediately constrains @xmath\n    to be a pure imaginary number.\n\n-   We first investigate the constraint of the bosonic matrix @xmath .\n    These are decomposed as ( 3.12 ), like the @xmath super Lie algebra.\n    We use the relationship of the gamma matrices @xmath . Therefore,\n    @xmath . This is real for @xmath and pure imaginary for @xmath .\n\n-   We investigate the relationship between two fermions @xmath and\n    @xmath utilizing the result @xmath :\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (3.71)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    We can verify that this is consistent with the condition @xmath .\n\nWe are thus finished with the determination of the elements of @xmath\nsuper Lie algebra.\n\nThe important property of @xmath super Lie algebra is that these can be\nuniquely decomposed into the direct sum of two different representations\nof @xmath . We introduce two different representations of @xmath super\nLie algebra\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- -------- --------\n        @xmath   @xmath            (3.73)\n                          @xmath   \n                 @xmath   @xmath   \n                          @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nAnd let @xmath and @xmath be the element of @xmath and @xmath\nrespectively. Because these are real (pure imaginary), these elements\nrespectively satisfy @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, these elements\nsatisfy the following property\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.74)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe set @xmath is, by definition, the @xmath super Lie algebra itself.\nWe investigate an important property of the subset of these two\nsubalgebras. The commutation and anti-commutation relations are\nproperties of grave importance in getting acquainted with their\nalgebras.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (3.75)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath .\nHere, we only give the proof of the first property, because the others\ncan be easily verified likewise.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.76)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nUtilizing these relations, we can discern that @xmath , as well as\n@xmath is the representations of @xmath and also that the algebra @xmath\nis a representation of @xmath super Lie algebra by the commutation\nrelation @xmath for @xmath and @xmath . This commutation relation states\nthat @xmath remain in the super Lie algebra @xmath after the\ninfinitesimal translation by the elements @xmath . In this sense, we can\nunderstand that @xmath is another representation of @xmath .\n\nThe introduction of these two representations of @xmath teaches us the\nrelationship of @xmath and @xmath super Lie algebras. @xmath is a real\npart of @xmath Lie algebra, while @xmath is its imaginary part. It is\nclear that the elements of @xmath can be uniquely decomposed into the\ndirect sum of @xmath and @xmath .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.77)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the direct sum of two sets.\n\nNextly, we introduce the @xmath super Lie algebra, especially paying\nattention to the relation with the @xmath . The definition of @xmath\nsuper Lie algebra is, per se, simple:\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- -- --------\n        @xmath   @xmath      (3.78)\n  -- -- -------- -------- -- --------\n\n-   @xmath is an element of the Lie algebra @xmath , id est, @xmath is\n    allowed to be an arbitrary @xmath bosonic matrix . Decomposing this\n    by the gamma matrices, this can be expressed by @xmath , where the\n    coefficients @xmath are all real.\n\n-   @xmath and @xmath are independent fermionic vectors. Each of them\n    possesses 32 components, and the components are fermionic real\n    number.\n\n-   @xmath is also a real number.\n\nThe definition of @xmath states nothing. This definition just states\nthat an arbitrary real @xmath supermatrix is an eligible member of the\nsuper Lie algebra @xmath . Although this definition does not give any\nrestriction to the elements, the correspondence with the complex group\n@xmath is an interesting aspect of @xmath super Lie algebra. Since\n@xmath and @xmath are independent fermionic vectors, these can be\nrewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.79)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAnd the bosonic @xmath matrices are separated by @xmath , where @xmath\nis rank-1,2,5 and @xmath is rank-0,3,4. Then, we define the sets @xmath\nas follows.\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n        @xmath   @xmath   \n                 @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n\nThe super Lie algebra @xmath is clearly the direct sum of these two\nsuper Lie algebras\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.80)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThese two subalgebras are also the two different representations of\n@xmath super Lie algebra. @xmath is @xmath itself, and the same super\nLie algebra as in introduced in @xmath . On the other hand, the\nsubalgebra @xmath is @xmath . \u2077 \u2077 7 This means that, if @xmath , then\n@xmath . And the elements of these subalgebras readily satisfy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.81)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAnd it is clear that these two subalgebras obey totally the same\ncommutation relations as those of @xmath and @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (3.82)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath . The proof is completely the same as that of (\n3.75 ), and we do not repeat it. The commutation relation @xmath\nindicates that @xmath is a representation of @xmath super Lie algebra.\n\nNow, the relationship of the three super Lie algebras @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath is clear. We have seen that both @xmath and @xmath are\nrepresented by the direct sum of two different representations of @xmath\n:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.83)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe relationship between @xmath and @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.84)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this sense, we can regard @xmath super Lie algebra as the analytic\ncontinuation of @xmath . Although we adopt a matrix theory with the\ngauge symmetry @xmath unlike Smolin\u2019s original proposal [ 23 ] , we note\nthat @xmath is a cousin of the original @xmath .\n\nNextly, we explain why we have to introduce the complexification of the\n@xmath from the outset. It turns out that the simple tensor product\n@xmath does not close with respect to the commutator in mixing these two\nsymmetries. Using the relation ( 3.75 ), we obtain the following\ncommutation relation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.85)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore, the tensor product @xmath is not a closed Lie algebra. In\norder to build a closed Lie algebra, we are urged to include @xmath .\nThis satisfies the commutation relation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.86)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore, we establish the smallest closed Lie algebra that include\n@xmath as a subset as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.87)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is analogous to the situation in which we had to introduce the\nhigher-odd-rank fields in the action and the higher-even-rank fields as\na parameter of the local Lorentz transformation once we mix the\nsymmetries, as we have seen in ( LABEL:higheroddgauged ) and ( 3.67 ).\n\nHere, instead of promoting each element to a hermitian matrix, we can\nmake a closed Lie algebra by restricting them to real matrices. It is\nclear that @xmath forms another closed algebra. In this case, we embed\nthe spacetime into real matrices, instead of hermitian matrices.\n\n#### 3.3.2 Action of @xmath supermatrix model\n\nThe next job is to investigate the action of this theory. The basic idea\nis similar to @xmath non-gauged cubic matrix model, and we proceed\nrather quickly. The action is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.88)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\n@xmath is now a multiplet of @xmath super Lie algebra, with each\ncomponent promoted to the element of @xmath Lie algebra. The indices\n@xmath runs @xmath , while @xmath .\n\nWe have promoted the @xmath matrix @xmath to a large @xmath matrices.\nHowever, the structure of the promotion is completely different from\n@xmath model. The gauge transformation is with respect to not the\nseparate @xmath and @xmath , but the tensor product of the Lie algebra\n@xmath . This drastically enhances the gauge symmetry of the theory. The\ngauge transformation is thus @xmath for an arbitrary element of @xmath .\n\nWe can express this supermatrix model in terms of the basis of the\n@xmath . Here, @xmath is expanded as @xmath . Then, the trace is written\nas\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.89)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, the structure constant @xmath and @xmath are real. Using this\ndecomposition, we can rewrite the action ( 3.88 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.90)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis supermatrix model can be expressed using its explicit expression (\n3.78 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.91)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 3.3.3 Wigner-In\u00f6n\u00fc contraction and supersymmetry\n\nIn considering the relation to the IIB matrix model, we need to reduce\nthe model to the ten dimensions. However, this matrix model has a grave\ndifference from the @xmath nongauged supermatrix. Since the action (\n3.88 ) is no longer based on the commutator for the @xmath matrices, it\nis not invariant under the inhomogeneous supersymmetry, namely the\ntranslation of the fermion. Nevertheless, the matrix model ( 3.88 )\naccommodates @xmath supercharges. This leads us to speculate that this\nmodel may also have the two-fold supersymmetry structure of the IIB-like\nsupersymmetry.\n\nHere, we reduce the model to the ten dimensions by the Wigner-In\u00f6n\u00fc\ncontraction, in order to extract the translation symmetry. Just as we\nperceive the earth as a flat two-dimensional space because the earth is\nmuch bigger than we are, we consider the physics in apparently\n\u2019ten-dimensional\u2019 space because of the large radius of the hyperboloid.\nTo this end, we add the linear term of @xmath to the action ( 3.88 ) and\nstart from\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.92)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nBy adding the linear term, the matrix model ( 3.92 ) incorporates the\nclassical solution \u2078 \u2078 8 This classical solution is impossible in the\noriginal @xmath gauged theory, because the (33,33) component @xmath is\nrestricted to be an anti-hermitian matrix. If we are to consider the\nWigner-In\u00f6n\u00fc contraction, one way is to consider the quintic action\n@xmath . Then, the classical solution @xmath is possible because @xmath\nis now an anti-hermitian matrix. Another caution is that the gauge group\nmust be not @xmath but @xmath . If the gauge group is @xmath , the\nlinear term in ( 3.92 ) vanishes because the generators are @xmath , and\nthe Wigner In\u00f6n\u00fc contraction is impossible from the beginning. .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.93)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe expansion around this classical solution amounts to the Wigner-In\u00f6n\u00fc\ncontraction. We separate the original matrix between the classical\nsolution and the fluctuation and the classical solution as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.94)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen, the action is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.95)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe ignore the terms of @xmath , because this is just a constant. The\nterms of @xmath vanish, because this is a linear term with respect to\nthe fluctuation. Then, the action is expressed as follows:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.96)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe divide the bosonic fluctuation @xmath into @xmath , where @xmath and\n@xmath consist of the even-rank and the odd-rank components in terms of\nthe ten dimensions. Namely, they should be explicitly expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.97)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.98)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nLater, we further decompose @xmath as @xmath according to the @xmath ,\nnamely the plus or minus chirality, in the above decomposition. The\nfermions are divided according to its chirality. The action is then\nwritten as follows.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.99)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nWe integrate out the fields of order @xmath and consider the effective\ntheory. In order to cope with the cubic term @xmath , we consider the\nfollowing rescaling:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (3.100)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nFollowing this rescaling, @xmath and @xmath are excluded, because this\nis rescaled as @xmath . This theory is thus rescaled to be\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.101)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe integrate out the fields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath by Gaussian\nintegration. Completing this action square, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.102)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nwhere we have utilized the fact that @xmath , and thus @xmath possesses\nan inverse matrix. The effective action is given by the following path\nintegral \u2079 \u2079 9 The analogy of this path integral is a following toy\nmodel. (i)For the action @xmath , the path integral is @xmath . And thus\nthe effective action is @xmath . (ii)The second example is the following\naction, @xmath , with @xmath being auxiliary fields. This integration is\nperformed by @xmath , and thus the effective action is @xmath . This\nholds even if @xmath are Grassmann odd quantities. . However, this\neffective action turns out to vanish:\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n                 @xmath   \n        @xmath   @xmath   \n                 @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n\nThat the first term vanishes is discerned from the anti-commutativity of\nthe matrices @xmath and @xmath ; namely @xmath . Noting this fact, we\nrewrite this term as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.104)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWhile the effective action in the ten dimensions turns out to vanish, we\ninvestigate its symmetry. This model is invariant under the @xmath\nrotation @xmath where @xmath . Like the @xmath nongauged model, the\nfermionic part of this rotation serves as the supercharge. In this\nsense, the @xmath supermatrix model also has @xmath supercharges. We\nconsider the following rescaling of this parameter:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.105)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nFor the @xmath rotation\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.106)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\neach component is transformed as follows:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.107)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.108)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.109)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.110)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.111)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.112)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.113)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nThese results possess two major significances. First is that this\nreconfirms that the effective action ( 3.3.3 ) vanish. The effective\naction is invariant under the transformation of the fields @xmath ,\n@xmath and @xmath . Therefore, the effective action makes no difference\nif we translate these fermions arbitrarily. Taking the fields @xmath ,\n@xmath and @xmath to be all zero, we find that the effective action is\n@xmath . Therefore, the effective action remains @xmath even if we\ntranslate these fields into non-zero values.\n\nThe second significance is that this clarifies the structure of the\nsupersymmetry of the effective theory. This gauged theory originally\npossesses no trivial translation like the @xmath non-gauged model,\nbecause this theory is deprived of the symmetry of the commutator.\nHowever, the Wigner-In\u00f6n\u00fc contraction serves to retrieve the translation\nin the ten dimensions. Actually, the underlined transformation of (\n3.108 ), ( 3.110 ) and ( 3.111 ) represents a translation independent of\nthe matter field @xmath . We thus find it natural to extract the\nstructure of the IIB matrix model from the fields @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath . Their supersymmetry transformation is read off from ( 3.108 ),\n( 3.110 ) and ( 3.111 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.114)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis immediately gives the correspondence of the chirality among the\nbosonic fields and the fermionic fields: @xmath and @xmath . This\npairing also resembles the case of the @xmath nongauged model.\n\nWe first scrutinize the former correspondence. In this case, the\nhomogeneous and the inhomogeneous supersymmetry is identified as\n\n  -- -- -- ---------\n           (3.115)\n  -- -- -- ---------\n\nThen, the rank-1 fields are transformed by this homogeneous\ntransformation as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.116)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe inhomogeneous translation of course do not affect the transformation\nof the vector fields.\n\nWe next explore the commutation relations. Firstly, we discern that the\ncommutator @xmath , as well as @xmath , manifestly vanish.\n\n  -- -- -- ---------\n           (3.117)\n           (3.118)\n  -- -- -- ---------\n\nThis is a great advantage compared with the @xmath case, in which we are\nbeset by the nonvanishing commutator of the homogeneous supersymmetry.\nThe commutation relation @xmath is obtained by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.119)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe correspondence of the latter case goes in totally the same way. The\nsupercharges are defined by\n\n  -- -- -- ---------\n           (3.120)\n  -- -- -- ---------\n\nThen, the supersymmetry transformation of the rank-1 fields is obtained\nby\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.121)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe commutators @xmath and @xmath vanish likewise, and the commutation\nrelation @xmath gives\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.122)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe see a better correspondence of the supersymmetry with the IIB matrix\nmodel than the @xmath model. However, the supersymmetry transformation\nof the fermion is not balanced by the commutator @xmath . This obstacles\nare shared with the @xmath case. The decisive drawback of this argument\nis that the ten-dimensional effective action totally vanishes. This\ncomes from too large a symmetry of the model. However, it may be related\nto the notion of the topological matrix model [ 8 ] , in which the IIB\nmatrix model is induced ex nihilo. The exploration of such a gauged\nmatrix model are interesting from various points of view, especially the\nexistence of the local Lorentz invariance, and it is worth further\ninvestigations.\n\n### 3.4 Curved-space classical solutions of the massive @xmath nongauged\nsupermatrix model\n\nIn this section, we review the work [ 46 ] , in which we elaborated on\nthe relation between the supermatrix model and the curved-space\nbackground. In Section 2.4 , we have introduced several generalizations\nof the IIB matrix model to accommodate the curved-space background. The\nwork [ 46 ] focuses on the similarity between the massive IIB matrix\nmodel ( 2.140 ) and the @xmath supermatrix model with the quadratic\nterm. This has led us to expect that the @xmath supermatrix model could\nalso have interesting noncommutative static solutions. We delegate the\ndetailed properties of the higher-dimensional fuzzy sphere, which plays\na main role in this analysis, to Section 2.4.2 .\n\n#### 3.4.1 Action\n\nHere, we go back to the @xmath nongauged supermatrix model instead of\nthe gauged matrix model, since our aim is to unravel the similarity with\nthe alteration of the IIB matrix model described in ( 2.140 ). We start\nwith the following massive model with the cubic interaction \u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u2070 10 We\nwarn the readers that the notation of this section is different from\nthat of [ 46 ] . In this paper, we define the path integral of the\naction @xmath as\n\n@xmath\n\nwhere @xmath is defined in the ten-dimensional Euclidean space by the\nWick rotation of the components @xmath and the gamma matrices @xmath ,\nTherefore, the action is different from that of [ 46 ] by the overall\nsign. :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.123)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nHere, @xmath and @xmath likewise run over @xmath and @xmath . Here, we\nfocus on the nongauged action, and this action has the separated @xmath\nrotational symmetry and the @xmath gauge symmetry. We reduce the above\nmatrix model to ten dimensions, by specializing the tenth space\ndirection @xmath . In Section 3.2 , we focused on the identification of\nthe supersymmetry with that of the IIB matrix model, and we resorted to\nthe chiral decomposition. However, we now focus on the nontrivial\ncurved-space background, which leads us to reduce the bosonic @xmath\nmatrix @xmath to the ten dimensions without the chiral decomposition.\nNamely, @xmath is reduced as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.124)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThen, the relevant action ( 3.123 ) is rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.125)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nIn the purely cubic supermatrix model (without mass term, which has been\nstudied in [ 19 , 23 , 26 , 27 ] ), the rank-2 field @xmath possesses a\ncubic interaction term but has no quadratic term. This has been a severe\nobstacle to the appearance of a Yang-Mills-like structure in the\nsupermatrix model, because it has been impossible to identify @xmath\nwith the commutators of the rank-1 fields @xmath (or @xmath ). In the\neleven-dimensional case, this difficulty has been overcome in [ 37 ]\nthrough the addition of a mass term, and we thus expect this model to\ncontain the massive IIB matrix model, the bosonic part of which has been\nstudied in [ 29 ] to investigate perturbation theory around\nnoncommutative curved-space backgrounds.\n\n#### 3.4.2 Resolution of the equations of motion\n\nWe proceed to search for possible curved-space classical configurations\nsolving the equations of motion that follow from the action ( 3.123 ).\nTo get a clearer picture of the problem, we now set the fermions and the\npositive mass-squared bosonic fields to zero:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.126)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nSince their masses are positive (at least in the spatial directions,\nwhile the time-like direction of quantum fields is generally\nunphysical), ( 3.126 ) is a stable classical solution. Furthermore, we\nchoose to identify the tachyonic ten-dimensional vector field @xmath ,\nrather than the well-defined @xmath with the bosonic fields of the\nmassive IIB matrix model, in order to obtain a possibly stable\ncurved-space classical solution. The classical equations of motion for\nthe remaining tachyonic fields @xmath and @xmath following from ( 3.123\n) are\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.127)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (3.128)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- ---------\n\nAlthough it is difficult to solve these equations in full generality,\nthe equation of motion for @xmath suggests to take @xmath for @xmath \u2019s\nsatisfying a fairly simple commutator algebra. If we look for objects\nhaving a clear geometrical interpretation, it is tempting to look for\nsolutions building fuzzy spheres.\n\n##### @xmath classical solution\n\nThe simplest tentative solution is the product of three fuzzy 2-spheres\nwith the symmetry @xmath . Such a system is described by @xmath\nhermitian matrices building a representation of the @xmath Lie algebra\nin the following way:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.129)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwith similar relations for @xmath and @xmath , trivial commutators for\nindices that do not belong to the same group of 3, and @xmath ( @xmath\nis defined as usually).\n\nThis set of fields ( 3.129 ) describes a space formed by the Cartesian\nproduct of three fuzzy spheres located in the directions @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath , whose radii are all @xmath . @xmath is the quadratic\nCasimir operator of the @xmath Lie algebra. Note that any\npositive-integer value of @xmath is possible here, since @xmath indexes\nthe dimensions of irreducible representations. For @xmath , the irreps\nhave dimensions @xmath , for all integer values of the spin @xmath .\nHowever, we can also use spinorial representations with half-integer\nspins in this case. We have to consider this classical solution instead\nof the single @xmath fuzzy sphere\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.130)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nbecause the solution @xmath is unstable in the directions 4 to 9 due to\nthe negative mass-squared \u00b9\u00b9 \u00b9\u00b9 11 The classical solution with @xmath\nhas no problem, because it has a positive mass unlike the other\ndirections of the field @xmath . of the rank-1 fields @xmath . Without\nrestricting the generality, we can focus on the first sphere located in\nthe direction @xmath , since the three fuzzy spheres all share the same\nequations of motion.\n\nIn the framework of fuzzy 2-spheres, we can solve the equations of\nmotion ( 3.127 ) and ( 3.128 ) with the following ansatz for the rank-2\nfield @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.131)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere @xmath is a function depending on the radius parameter @xmath .\nIndeed, the equation of motion ( 3.128 ) reduces then to:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.132)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\n( 3.132 ) has two solutions: @xmath . When we plug this result in the\nequation of motion for @xmath ( 3.127 ), this leads to\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.133)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThis gives the same condition on the radius parameter @xmath for both\n@xmath and @xmath , namely:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.134)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nTherefore, when we assume the ansatz ( 3.131 ), we obtain the classical\nsolution ( 3.129 ) with the radius parameter set to @xmath , which is\nfortunately real. Indeed, @xmath would indicate that the fuzzy sphere\nsolution is unstable. For example, in the IIB massive matrix model\ndescribed by ( 2.140 ), the sign of the squared radius of the fuzzy\n2-sphere is linked to the sign of the mass term in the action and it\nwould become negative for a correct-sign mass term, which is to be\nexpected, since in that case, the trivial commutative solution becomes\nthe stable vacuum of the theory.\n\nWe next want to discuss the stability of the @xmath classical solution\nin more qualitative terms [ 25 ] . To this end, we compare the energy of\nthe trivial commutative solution @xmath with that of the fuzzy-sphere\nsolution. The classical energy for @xmath is obviously @xmath . \u00b9\u00b2 \u00b9\u00b2 12\nSince we now consider a classical solution with @xmath (thus no need of\nWick rotation), the energy is simply equal to the classical action in\nwhich we substitute the solution.\n\nIn the @xmath fuzzy-sphere background, the 2-form field @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.135)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nTherefore, the total energy is\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.136)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------\n\nThis result shows that the @xmath fuzzy-sphere classical solution has a\nlower energy compared to the trivial commutative solution and hence a\nhigher probability.\n\n##### Other curved-space solutions and the fuzzy 8-sphere\n\nSo far, we have considered the simplest curved-space solution @xmath .\nHere, we consider the other curved-space solutions. We focus on the\nfuzzy 8-sphere solution, which has the @xmath rotational symmetry and is\nspanned by the nine-dimensional space. We assume the following fuzzy\nsphere solution\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.137)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhere @xmath runs over the space component @xmath , and @xmath is\nalready defined by ( LABEL:fspsolution ). We likewise assume the ansatz\nfor the rank-2 field @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.138)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThen, the equation of motion ( 3.128 ) implies\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.139)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nWe again have two choices for the function @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.140)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nThe equation of motion ( 3.127 ) for the rank-1 field @xmath gives\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.141)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nNow, unlike the case of the @xmath fuzzy sphere, @xmath does not have\nany real positive solution for @xmath . However, there is exactly one\nsuch solution for @xmath , which is @xmath .\n\nMore generally, for an @xmath fuzzy sphere @xmath , the same ansatz\nwould give\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nWe discuss the stability of the @xmath fuzzy-sphere classical solution\nby computing its classical energy. At the classical level, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.142)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\n@xmath is given by ( 2.121 ), and we recall that this is given by @xmath\n. In contrast with the @xmath case, @xmath can take here only certain\nprecise values. For example, the smallest non-trivial representation (\n@xmath ) has dimension 16, the following one ( @xmath ) 126, then 672,\netc\u2026 The classical energy for the @xmath fuzzy-sphere solution is of the\norder @xmath while that of the fuzzy 8-sphere solution is of the order\n@xmath . Therefore, at large @xmath , the @xmath triple fuzzy-sphere\nsolution is energetically favored compared to the @xmath solution at the\nequal size @xmath of the matrices. The presence of a spherical solution\nfor all @xmath in the @xmath case may indeed be a stabilizing factor. On\nthe other hand, at equal value of @xmath , whose physical meaning is\nless clear, the fuzzy 8-sphere solution has lower energy.\n\nWe have seen that the fuzzy 8-sphere is energetically favored. This is\nin contrast to the matrix model with the Chern-Simons term ( 2.111 ), in\nwhich the classical energy is given by ( 2.139 ) and thus the fuzzy\n8-sphere is positive. In this case, the fuzzy 8-sphere is less\nenergetically favored than the trivial commutative background. In this\nsense, this situation has more similarity to the IIB matrix model with\nthe tachyonic mass term ( 2.140 ), in which the higher-dimensional fuzzy\nsphere, as well as the @xmath fuzzy sphere, is more energetically\nfavored, as we have seen in ( 2.144 ).\n\nThe single fuzzy @xmath -spheres for @xmath do not constitute a stable\nclassical solution of our model. When the @xmath sphere occupies the\ndirection @xmath , the solution @xmath is trivially unstable because of\nthe negative mass-squared. Whereas, the Cartesian product of several\nfuzzy spheres, such as @xmath , is a possible candidate for a stable\nclassical solution.\n\n#### 3.4.3 Nucleation process of spherical branes\n\nStarting from a vacuous spacetime, it is interesting to try to guess how\nspherical brane configurations could be successively produced through a\nsequence of decays into energetically more favorable meta-stable brane\nsystems. The reader may have noticed that we have so far limited\nourselves to the study of curved branes building irreducible\nrepresentations of their symmetry groups. This could seem at first to be\nan unjustified prejudice, but it turns out that such configurations are\nenergetically favored at equal values of @xmath . For example, for\n@xmath , an irreducible representation @xmath of dimension @xmath\ncontributes as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nper fuzzy 2-sphere, while a reducible representation @xmath of equal\ndimension @xmath would contribute as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThis is obviously a less negative number, especially for big values of\n@xmath . A similar conclusion was reached in [ 25 ] for the case of a\nEuclidean three-dimensional IIB matrix model with a Chern-Simons term\nand it seems to be a fairly general feature of matrix models admitting\nnon-trivial classical solutions. This property is particularly clear for\nlow-dimensional branes, since the classical energy is of order @xmath\nfor the @xmath fuzzy sphere, but it remains true for any fuzzy @xmath\n-sphere solution, whose energy is of order @xmath , which also shows\nthat low-dimensional configurations are favored. As hinted for in the\npreceding subsection, this latter fact can be physically understood by\nremarking that there are more irreps available for low-dimensional fuzzy\nspheres, which makes it easier for them to grow in radius through\nenergetically favorable configurations. A third obvious fact is that\nconfigurations described by representations of high dimensionality are\npreferred.\n\nPut together, these comparisons give us a possible picture for the brane\nnucleation process in this and similar matrix models. As they appear,\nconfigurations of all spacetime dimensions described by small\nrepresentations will be progressively absorbed by bigger representations\nto form irreducible ones, that will slowly grow in this way to bigger\nvalues of @xmath . Parallel to that, branes of higher dimensionalities\nwill tend to decay into a bunch of branes of smaller dimensionalities,\nfinally leaving only 2-spheres and noncommutative tori of growing radii.\nIf the size of the hermitian matrices is left open, as is usually the\ncase in completely reduced models, where the path integration contains a\nsum on that size, no configuration will be truly stable, since the size\nof the irreps will grow continuously.\n\nOf course, this is a relatively qualitative study, which could only be\nproven correct by a full quantum statistical study of the model.\nHowever, it seems to be an interesting proposal for the possible physics\nof such theories.\n\n#### 3.4.4 Supersymmetry\n\nWe next comment on the structure of the supersymmetry. The biggest\ndifference with the purely cubic supermatrix model, due to the addition\nof the mass term, is that this model is not invariant under the\ninhomogeneous supersymmetry\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.143)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhich is a translation of the fermionic field. However, this model has 2\nhomogeneous supersymmetries in ten dimensions, which are part of the\n@xmath symmetry:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.144)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhich transforms the bosonic and fermionic fields as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.145)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nIn the IIB matrix model, the supersymmetry has to balance between a\nquartic term @xmath and a trilinear contribution @xmath in the action (\n2.1 ), which implies that the supersymmetry transformation of the\nfermionic field has to be bilinear in the bosonic field. On the other\nhand, the homogeneous supersymmetries are all linear in the fields in\nthe purely cubic supermatrix model [ 26 , 27 ] . By incorporating the\nmass term, we are allowed to integrate out the rank-2 field @xmath by\nsolving the classical equation of motion iteratively as in [ 37 ] \u00b9\u00b3 \u00b9\u00b3\n13 The Yang-Mills-like structure of the homogeneous supersymmetry\ntransformation on the fermion comes from @xmath , which is a part of\n@xmath . The explicit form of the iterative solution of the equations of\nmotion ( 3.127 ) and ( 3.128 ) is\n\n@xmath @xmath @xmath @xmath\n\n.\n\nThanks to this procedure, the homogeneous SUSY transformation for the\nfermionic field becomes\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.146)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nwhile the transformation of the field @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.147)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nIn that sense, the mass term is essential to realize the Yang-Mills-like\nstructure for the homogeneous supersymmetries. On the other hand, if we\nwant to preserve the homogeneous supersymmetries, we cannot just put a\nmass term for @xmath by hand. The @xmath symmetry forces all fields to\nshare the same mass, since they all lie in the same multiplet. In\nparticular, we are forced to introduce a mass term for the fermions as\nwell, which breaks the inhomogeneous supersymmetries. In other words, it\nseems difficult to have super-Yang-Mills-type structure for both\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous supersymmetries in the context of\nsupermatrix models.\n\nIndeed, in contrast with the purely cubic supermatrix model [ 26 , 27 ]\n, which has twice as many supersymmetry parameters, the massive\nsupermatrix model has only @xmath supersymmetries in ten dimensions,\nbecause it lacks the inhomogeneous supersymmetries. In consequence, we\ncannot realize the translation of the vector field @xmath as a\ncommutator of two linear combinations of the homogeneous and\ninhomogeneous supersymmetries ( 3.145 ) as in the IIB matrix model,\nwhere it leads to the interpretation of the eigenvalues of @xmath as\nspacetime coordinates. On the contrary,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n     @xmath      (3.148)\n  -- -------- -- ---------\n\nvanishes up to an @xmath rotation. This problem is a serious obstacle\nfor the identification of the supersymmetry of this model with that of\nthe IIB matrix model. More analysis will be reported elsewhere.\n\n### 3.5 Other related studies\n\nWe have so far gone over the author\u2019s works [ 26 , 46 ] concerning the\nsupermatrix models. We conclude this section by touching on other\nrelated studies. In [ 37 ] , Bagnoud, Carlevaro and Bilal discussed the\n@xmath supermatrix model in the twelve-dimensional and the\neleven-dimensional contexts. Especially, they indicated how to perform\nthe infinite momentum frame limit and used the matrix version of the\nT-duality to obtain a supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics. They\nintroduced the quadratic terms as in Sec. 3.4 , and resorted to the\nperturbative technique that led to an infinite tower of the higher-order\ninteraction among the physical fields. On the other hand, the\nlower-order term reproduced the BFSS model with an additional mass term\ntogether with interaction terms involving the five-brane degrees of\nfreedom.\n\nOther attempts for a background-independent matrix models have been\nachieved by the cubic action of the exceptional Jordan algebra. Firstly,\nL. Smolin proposed a matrix model based on the exceptional Jordan\nalgebra whose automorphism group is @xmath (in this sense, we refer to\nthis model as \u201dthe @xmath model\u201d here). The exceptional Jordan algebra\nis related to the octonion, and gives a theory that has a\ncompactification which reduces to the matrix string theory [ 6 ] . Its\ncomplex extension has been proposed in [ 35 ] . The @xmath exceptional\nLie algebra is known to be the automorphism of the complexification.\nTherefore, the @xmath matrix model has twice as many degrees of freedom\nas the @xmath model, and derived the effective action of the matrix\nstring type.\n\n## 4 Matrix model with manifest general coordinate invariance\n\nIn the pervious section, we have investigated various aspects of the\nsupermatrix models based on the @xmath super Lie algebra. This extension\nof the IIB matrix model poses a lot of interesting questions.\nEspecially, in Sec. 3.3 , we have investigated the gauged @xmath model\nas a candidate for the extension of the IIB matrix model equipped with\nthe local Lorentz invariance. The key idea is to render the parameter of\nthe @xmath Lorentz transformation dependent on the @xmath matrices in a\nnontrivial manner. This is an essential alteration from the IIB matrix\nmodel, since the spacetime is interpreted as being immersed in the\neigenvalues of the bosonic matrices @xmath . In addition, the @xmath\n(and its analytic connection @xmath ) supermatrix model incorporates the\nhigher-rank tensor field. Especially, the rank-3 field has a possibility\nto be identified with the spin connection in the quantum field theory on\nthe curved spacetime.\n\nIn this section, we review the author\u2019s work [ 38 ] that inherits the\nabove idea. The most serious obstacle of the @xmath supermatrix model is\nthat the effective action reduced to the ten dimensions by the\nWigner-In\u00f6n\u00fc contraction finally vanishes. This is ascribed to the fact\nthat the element of @xmath of all ranks are allocated for both the\nmatter fields and the parameter of the local Lorentz transformation.\nThese two elements had to be mixed in the eleven-dimensional theory, due\nto the self-duality condition of the gamma matrices ( A.11 ). Namely,\neven when the rank-6 fields come in the local Lorentz parameter due to\nthe rule ( 3.67 ), this is identified with the rank-5 fields due to the\nself-duality rule ( A.11 ). By the same token, the rank-7 matter fields\ncoming from ( LABEL:higheroddgauged ) are tantamount to the rank-4\nfields.\n\nIn [ 38 ] , we address the above approach in a different angle without\nthe supermatrix model. We start from the ten-dimensional action from the\noutset, without the reduction from the eleven-dimensional model. Since\nwe start from the ten-dimensional field theory, we can separate the\nmatter fields and the local Lorentz parameter. We allocate the odd-rank\nfields for the matter fields, and the even-rank fields go for the local\nLorentz parameter. In addition, we explicitly give an expansion of the\nmatrices with the differential operators, to embody the idea of the\nidentification of the matrices and the differential operators. In these\nsenses, the work [ 38 ] gives a clearly different angle from our\nprevious work in Sec. 3.3 .\n\n### 4.1 Bosonic part of the matrix model\n\nThis time, we start from the following action, defined in the\nten-dimensional spacetime from the outset:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe uppercase @xmath and the lowercase @xmath denote the trace for the\n@xmath and @xmath matrices, respectively. The indices @xmath and @xmath\nboth run over @xmath .The former is allocated for the flat Minkowskian\nspacetime, and the latter is for the curved spacetime. @xmath is some\nfunction determined later, and @xmath consists of the odd-rank fields:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, @xmath ( @xmath ) are all hermitian matrices, and this satisfies\n@xmath . In this sense, our action is shown to be hermitian as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, we exclude the odd-power of @xmath in the action, because @xmath\nall consists of the odd-rank gamma matrices and thus couple the fermions\nof the different chirality.\n\n#### 4.1.1 Identification of large @xmath matrices with differential\noperators\n\nWe identify the space of the large- @xmath matrices with that of the\ndifferential operators. By this identification, we can describe the\ndifferential operators on an arbitrary spin bundle over an arbitrary\nmanifold in the continuum limit simultaneously, because they are\nembedded in the space of large @xmath matrices, as is depicted in Fig. 8\n.\n\nTo illustrate this idea, we visit several simple examples on the\ndifferential operators of the scalar fields on two different bundle over\nthe @xmath circle (see Fig. 9 ).\n\nWe first consider the trivial bundle with the periodic condition @xmath\n. We discritize the region @xmath into small slices of spacing @xmath .\nThen, the differential operator is approximated by the finite difference\nas\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nDue to the periodic condition, this finite difference is expressed by\nthe large @xmath matrix as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nWe next consider the similar problem with respect to the @xmath -twisted\nbundle, in which the antiperiodic condition @xmath is imposed. Paying\nattention to this antiperiodicity, we understand that the finite\ndifference in the discritized space is expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn the following, from the big space of large @xmath matrices, we pick\nup a subspace consisting of the differential operators over one\nmanifold. We regard @xmath as the differential operators over this\nmanifold. Then, we analyze the effective theory of the fields appearing\nin the expansion of the differential operators (the explicit form is\ngiven later).\n\nThe space of the differential operator is infinite-dimensional. The\ntrace @xmath for this space is generally divergent. However, we can\nrender this trace finite by choosing the function @xmath damping\nrapidly. We would like to identify this matrix @xmath with the Dirac\noperator in the curved spacetime. Clearly, the Dirac operator has a\ndimensionality [(length) @xmath ], while @xmath is a dimensionless\nquantity. Then, we introduce a constant @xmath with the dimensionality\n[(length) @xmath ], and express @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nHere, @xmath and @xmath are matrices of dimensionality [(length) @xmath\n]. @xmath is similar to the Regge slope @xmath in string theory, and is\nintroduced as a reference scale. This parameter @xmath is not a cut-off\nparameter. @xmath is an exponentially decreasing function, and the\ndamping factor is supplied by the action itself. Since @xmath is a\nfunction of the dimensionless quantity @xmath , @xmath represents a\ndamping scale. When we approximate the differential operators by finite\n@xmath matrices, an @xmath -dependent ultraviolet cut-off naturally\nappears. When we take @xmath to infinity, this cut-off becomes\ninfinitely small. But the scale @xmath is completely independent of this\nultraviolet cut-off, and takes a constant value even in the large @xmath\nlimit. Thus, we can fairly take @xmath to infinity and identify the\nlarge @xmath matrices with the differential operators, at least when we\ninvestigate the effective theory at tree level. In this sense, our model\ndiffers from the induced gravity.\n\nThe matrices @xmath are expanded by the number of the derivatives. The\nhermiticity of @xmath leads us to expand it by the anti-commutator of\nthe derivatives as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, the indices @xmath are symmetric, while the indices @xmath are\nanti-symmetric. Since we identify @xmath with the extension of the Dirac\noperator in the curved spacetime, we find it natural to identify the\ncoefficients @xmath with the vielbein of the background metric. A simple\ndimensional analysis immediately indicates that the coefficients @xmath\nhas a dimensionality [(length) @xmath ]. Then, @xmath is identified with\nthe Dirac operator in the curved space as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n#### 4.1.2 Local Lorentz invariance\n\nWe next clarify that our matrix model is invariant under the local\nLorentz transformation. Here, the local Lorentz transformation is given\nby\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.10)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\n@xmath is the parameter of the local Lorentz transformation, and it\nsatisfies @xmath . The coefficients @xmath are all hermitian matrices.\nThe discussion in ( 3.67 ) immediately indicates that the closure of the\nalgebra of the local Lorentz transformation necessitates all the\neven-rank fields. The invariance of the action is verified as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath denotes @xmath . The vanishing of ( 4.11 ) can be verified\nby noting the cyclic rule of the trace @xmath . Since we are now\ndiscussing the space of the infinite-dimensional space, it is not\nnecessarily trivial whether the trace satisfies the cyclic rule.\nHowever, the cyclic rule holds when the coefficients @xmath damps\nrapidly. The only nontrivial part for the cyclic rule is the commutator\nbetween the derivative and the fields\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHowever, this surface term does not contribute when the coefficients\n@xmath damp rapidly.\n\n#### 4.1.3 Determination of @xmath\n\nWe next determine the function @xmath . We require that the action ( 4.1\n) should have the flat metric @xmath as a classical background. However,\nthis turns out to be a draconian constraint on @xmath . The bosonic part\nis expressed by the heat-kernel expansion. We delegate the details of\nthe heat-kernel expansion to Appendix B . We find it more convenient to\nexpress @xmath in terms of its Laplace transformation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nin order to see a more transparent correspondence with the heat kernel.\nThen, the action is now expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath are the Seeley-de-Witt coefficients of the heat kernel\n@xmath , namely\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (4.14)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath runs all the integers. We can show that the half-integer\n@xmath can be excluded in the following way. The coefficients @xmath has\na dimensionality [(length) @xmath ]. On the other hand the terms @xmath\nhas a dimensionality @xmath . Therefore, this belongs to the\ncoefficients @xmath . On the other hand, this term has @xmath indices,\nwhich is equal to @xmath modulo 2. Therefore, when @xmath is odd, these\nterms cannot contract the indices, and thus cannot survive in the\naction. If such terms existed, they would no longer be a scalar and thus\nwould violate the Lorentz invariance of the action. In this way, we\neliminate the contribution of the half-integer @xmath .\n\nThen, let us think about the condition for @xmath to be a classical\nsolution. To this end, the linear terms of all the fluctuations must\nvanish in the action. Now, only the scalar fields can contribute to the\naction, we have only to consider the linear terms @xmath (for @xmath ).\nSince @xmath is identified with the vielbein, its cancellation means the\ncancellation of the cosmological constant. This amounts to the\ncancellation of the Seeley-de-Witt coefficient @xmath . We disregard the\nderivative terms @xmath , because these can be eliminated by the partial\nintegration. Since the fields @xmath has a dimensionality [(length)\n@xmath ], it belongs to the Seeley-de-Witt coefficient @xmath .\nTherefore, we generally demand that the coefficients @xmath for @xmath\nshould all cancel.\n\nHowever, it turns out that this imposes a demanding condition on the\nfunction @xmath . The above condition is translated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis condition can further be rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfor @xmath . One example for such a function is the following:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe can show that the function ( 4.17 ) satisfies the condition ( 4.16 )\nas follows [ 71 ] . Firstly, we note the following integral\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is a real number when @xmath is a multiple of 4. Taking the\nimaginary part of the both hand sides, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe make a substitution @xmath and perform the partial integration to\nobtain the solution ( 4.17 ) \u00b9\u2074 \u00b9\u2074 14 This is the famous counter-example\nagainst Hausdorff\u2019s moment problem when we replace the finite integral\nwith the infinite integral. When the function @xmath satisfies\n\n@xmath\n\nThe function @xmath must be zero constantly. This problem is called\n\u201dHausdorff\u2019s moment problem\u201d [ 71 ] . However, this is not the case with\n( 4.16 ) because we are considering the infinite integral. .\n\nWe then derive the Einstein gravity in the low energy limit, from this\nbosonic part. The linear term of the vielbein @xmath is eliminated, and\nthus the graviton is now massless since the mass term vanishes due to\nthe general coordinate invariance. When we retain the curved-space Dirac\noperator in the expansion ( 4.9 ), the Seeley-de-Witt expansion is now\nobtained by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis term should be clearly allocated for the coefficient @xmath .\n\nWe next give a qualitative argument for the mass and the kinetic terms\nof the matter fields. While the explicit heat-kernel expansion of ( 4.9\n) entails an involved calculation, it is easy to estimate which\ncoefficient @xmath the mass term and the kinetic term belong to via the\ndimensional analysis. Since the coefficients @xmath and @xmath\nrespectively have the dimensionality [(length) @xmath ] and [(length)\n@xmath ], we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.21)\n     @xmath      (4.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath must be an even number. Firstly, the mass term and the\nkinetic terms of the fields @xmath belong to @xmath and @xmath ,\nrespectively. The explicit heat-kernel calculation reveals that the\nrelevant mass terms are given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (4.23)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nWe give the derivation of this result in Appendix. B . Thus, the fields\n@xmath for @xmath are clearly massive. While ( 4.23 ) cancels the mass\nterm @xmath , the field @xmath is also presumably massive because there\nis no reason to prohibit the cross terms @xmath .\n\nNext, we consider the fields @xmath . Especially the fields @xmath (with\n@xmath ) are identified with the anti-symmetric tensor fields in the\ntype IIB supergravity. Their mass terms are included in @xmath , while\nthe kinetic terms reside in @xmath . These fields are therefore regarded\nas massless. This observation augurs well for the matrix model which\nreduces to the type IIB supergravity.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether the higher-spin fields @xmath ( @xmath\n) are massive, since the mass terms and the kinetic terms belong to the\ncoefficients @xmath and @xmath respectively and both of them vanish in\nthe action.\n\n### 4.2 Supersymmetric action\n\nIn the previous section, we have discerned that the bosonic part of the\nmatrix model reduces to the Einstein gravity in the low energy limit.\nOur goal is to establish the extension of the IIB matrix model that\nreduces to the type IIB supergravity in the low energy limit. This leads\nus to scrutinize the fermionic part. We pay attention of the\ncorrespondence of the supersymmetry.\n\nWe start from the following action:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath is defined in the same way as in the bosonic model. @xmath\nis a Weyl fermion. However, the crucial difference from the IIB matrix\nmodel is that we abstain its Majorana property. Namely, we abstain its\nhermiticity. It is extremely difficult to build a matrix model that\ncloses with respect to the local Lorentz transformation @xmath . That is\nwhy we abandon the hermiticity and define the local Lorentz\ntransformation as @xmath . The fermionic field is also expanded by the\nnumber of the derivatives as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nClearly, the fields @xmath has the dimensionality [(length) @xmath ]. We\nput the damping factor @xmath , so that the action @xmath should be\nfinite. We choose this power in accordance with the function ( 4.17 ),\nwhich leads us to set @xmath .\n\n#### 4.2.1 Local Lorentz invariance\n\nWe discuss its local Lorentz invariance, which is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is defined in ( 4.10 ). @xmath is transformed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe action is transformed by this local Lorentz transformation as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis holds true when the coefficients @xmath and @xmath damp rapidly in\nthe infinite distance.\n\n#### 4.2.2 Determination of @xmath\n\nWe next discuss the determination of the function @xmath . Here, we do\nnot give a specific form of @xmath and we just list up the conditions\nfor @xmath .\n\nFirstly, the flat background @xmath must be a classical solution. As we\nhave seen in the bosonic case, this imposes a strict condition on the\nfunction @xmath ; namely this must satisfy the criterion ( 4.16 ).\n\nSecondly, this model must retain the even-rank anti-symmetric tensor\nfields @xmath @xmath . The action @xmath must be determined so that\nthese fields should be massless and thus be bequeathed in the low-energy\nlimit.\n\nIt is not clear whether the function ( 4.17 ) satisfies the latter\ncondition, since we have yet to elucidate the mass of the higher-spin\nfields.\n\n#### 4.2.3 Supersymmetry\n\nWe next discuss its supersymmetry. We define the supersymmetric\ntransformation as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath . Now, we assume that the function @xmath can be expanded\naround @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore, the following argument does not apply to the function ( 4.17\n), because it is not possible to expand this around the origin @xmath .\nThe supersymmetry transformation of @xmath is derived as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThen, the supersymmetry invariance of the action can be easily verified\nas\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.32)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe next analyse the commutation relation of the supersymmetry\ntransformation. This is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.33)\n     @xmath      (4.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith the help of the equation of motion\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (4.35)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nThis can be verified by taking the difference of the two\ntransformations, as we did for the IIB matrix model or the supermatrix\nmodel. For the boson, we compare the following two transformation:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nFor the fermion, we compare the following two paths:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nIn order to see the structure of the supersymmetry transformation of the\n@xmath supersymmetry. Since we now abstain the hermiticity of the\nfermion, we separate the fermions into the real part and the imaginary\npart as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are Majorana-Weyl fermions. Now, we assume that\nthe supersymmetry parameters are proportional to the unit matrix for\nbrevity, namely\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (4.37)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are real Grassmann-odd c-numbers. Another\nassumption is that the background metric is flat.\n\nFirstly, the transformation of the bosonic field is calculated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (4.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe focus on the supersymmetry transformation of the vector field @xmath\n. The commutator @xmath represents the translation and the gauge\ntransformation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore, the commutator of the bosonic fields represents the right\ntranslation of the vector fields. However, this does not hold true of\nthe fermionic fields. The commutator is computed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nWe have a closer look at the term @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the omission of the non-linear terms of the fields.\nTherefore, each fermionic field is subject to the following\ntransformation:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore, the fermionic fields are not subject to the translation by\nthe commutator of the supersymmetry.\n\nHowever, the argument in this section is only applicable to the function\n@xmath that can be expanded around @xmath , and does not hold true of\nthe function ( 4.17 ). We speculate that we may find a right\nsupersymmetry for such functions.\n\nWe surmise that the fermionic fields @xmath and @xmath , which are\nrespectively identified with the dilatino and the gravitino, would be\nmassless due to the supersymmetry, when the even-rank fields @xmath are\nmassless. It is an intriguing future problem to seek such an action more\nrigorously.\n\n## 5 Monte Carlo simulation of the fuzzy sphere solutions\n\nWe have seen several generalizations of the IIB matrix model to\naccommodate the curved-space classical background in Sec. 2.4 . We have\nreviewed the author\u2019s work [ 46 ] in Sec. 3.4 about the curved-space\nbackground in the context of the supermatrix model.\n\nIn this section, we address the stability of the curved-space background\nin the quantum sense, based on the author\u2019s work [ 60 ] . It has been a\nconundrum to discuss the stability of the fuzzy sphere in the quantum\nsense. There have been hitherto several attempts for the quantum\nstability. In [ 25 ] , the quantum stability has been discussed in terms\nof the one-loop effective action. In [ 51 , 55 , 59 ] , they performed\nthe two-loop perturbative calculation of the Feynman diagram, to unravel\nthe stability of the fuzzy sphere and other backgrounds. Another attempt\nis to investigate the quantum stability via the Gaussian expansion, and\nthe first-order calculation is given in [ 52 ] .\n\nHere, we address the quantum stability of the fuzzy sphere via the heat\nbath algorithm of the Monte Carlo simulation, whose detail we delegate\nto Appendix C . Our approach is totally different from these foregoing\nworks [ 25 , 51 , 52 , 55 , 59 ] , in the sense that we discuss the\nstability nonperturbatively via the numerical simulation. The Monte\nCarlo simulation has played a pivotal role in elucidating the\nnonperturbative aspects of the lattice gauge theory. By the same token,\nthe application of the Monte Carlo simulation to the IIB matrix model\nhas given us many interesting nonperturbative insights. In [ 13 ] , the\nbosonic IIB matrix model has been scrutinized nonperturbatively via the\nMonte Carlo simulation. This analysis [ 13 ] was followed by the\nsupersymmetric extension [ 20 , 22 ] via the hybrid Monte Carlo\nsimulation.\n\nHere, we scrutinize the simplest case for the matrix model with the\ncurved-space classical solution. Namely, we concentrate on the\nthree-dimensional bosonic IIB matrix model with the Chern-Simons term\nwhich incorporates the @xmath fuzzy sphere solution:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe notation is the same as that in Sec. 2.4.1 , except we set @xmath in\nthis section. We delegate the miscellaneous properties of the @xmath\nfuzzy sphere classical solution @xmath to Sec. 2.4.1 .\n\n### 5.1 Nonperturbative studies of the fuzzy sphere initial condition\n\nWe start with the Monte Carlo simulation for the initial condition of\nthe irreducible representation of the @xmath fuzzy sphere classical\nsolution:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nStarting from this initial condition, we see whether or not the fuzzy\nsphere decays due to the quantum effect of the matrix model. Especially,\nthe histogram of the eigenvalues of the Casimir operator\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\ndescribes the fuzzy sphere\u2019s stability visually. In the following,\n@xmath denotes the eigenvalues of @xmath , and @xmath denotes the\neigenvalue distribution function normalized as @xmath . At the initial\nstate, the histogram is peaked at @xmath , because the Casimir is\nproportional to the unit matrix for the fuzzy sphere. If the fuzzy\nsphere is stable in the quantum sense, the histogram does not decay\ngreatly from the peaked distribution. On the other hand, if the fuzzy\nsphere is unstable, the histogram undergoes a drastic deformation.\n\n#### 5.1.1 Nonperturbative stability of the fuzzy sphere\n\nWe first investigate the @xmath and @xmath case starting from the\ninitial condition ( 5.2 ). We see a clear difference between the @xmath\nand the @xmath case.\n\nWe see from Fig. 10 the instability of the fuzzy sphere at @xmath . The\nvertical lines in the histogram denote the radius-square of the fuzzy\nsphere classical solution @xmath . Now, this value is @xmath for @xmath\n, and the eigenvalues of @xmath were originally peaked there. This fuzzy\nsphere decays due to the quantum effect and the eigenvalues are\nconcentrated far away from the original fuzzy sphere configuration.\n\nHowever, this situation changes for @xmath . Fig. 10 indicates that the\neigenvalue distribution constitutes only one lump in the vicinity of the\nclassical value of the radius-square (which is @xmath and @xmath for\n@xmath and @xmath respectively), and that the eigenvalues are not\ndissipated otherwise at all. This implies that the eigenvalues remain\nconstituting a thin sphere shell near its original fuzzy sphere\nconfiguration. In this sense, we regard the fuzzy sphere classical\nsolution as stable. This stability is also reconfirmed in Section 5.3.1\n, by demonstrating the dynamical evolution of the single fuzzy sphere\nstate from the initial condition @xmath .\n\n#### 5.1.2 First-order phase transition\n\nIn the previous section, we have discerned that the fuzzy sphere\nsolution. In this section, we deepen the above observation and\ndemonstrate the first-order transition of the matrix model ( 5.1 ).\n\nFirstly, we ascribe the above stability of the fuzzy sphere to the\nmeager quantum effect of the model. The effective action @xmath of this\nmatrix model is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe effect of the classical fuzzy sphere solution is of the order @xmath\n, as one can easily verify by plugging the fuzzy sphere solution ( 2.78\n) into the action ( 5.1 ). On the other hand, the effect of the path\nintegral measure is of the order @xmath . This comparison leads to the\nobservation that the matrix model receives only a small quantum effect\nat\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (5.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTo elaborate on this observation, we next calculate the following\nquantities, for @xmath with the fuzzy sphere initial condition ( 5.2 ).\n\n1.  The action @xmath : This quantity gives the energy of the numerical\n    configuration.\n\n2.  The spacetime extent @xmath : This provides us with the information\n    of the eigenvalue distribution, and hence the stability of the fuzzy\n    sphere.\n\n3.  The Yang-Mills term: @xmath : This quantity, as well as the\n    spacetime extent, have been already investigated in the bosonic IIB\n    matrix model without the Chern-Simons term (this amounts to the\n    @xmath case) in [ 13 ] . For the bosonic IIB matrix model, both are\n    shown to behave at the order @xmath . It is interesting to compare\n    the behavior of this quantity with that of the bosonic IIB matrix\n    model.\n\n4.  We derive the following exact result from the Schwinger-Dyson\n    equation of the matrix model:\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (5.6)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\n    Here, @xmath ( @xmath ) are the basis of the @xmath Lie algebra, and\n    the matrices @xmath are expanded as @xmath . The Schwinger-Dyson\n    equation ( 5.6 ) gives\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (5.7)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\n    as we prove explicitly in Appendix C.4 . While @xmath is given\n    analytically, the numerical computation of its vacuum expectation\n    @xmath is significant for the legitimacy of the algorithm.\n\n5.  The Chern-Simons term:\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (5.8)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\n    We have obtained the analytical result @xmath , which amounts to\n\n      -- -------- -- -------\n         @xmath      (5.9)\n      -- -------- -- -------\n\n    While @xmath itself obviously behaves as @xmath , it is interesting\n    to discern the behavior of each of the separate terms @xmath , as\n    well as @xmath .\n\nWe postpone the plot of @xmath later, and plot the other four\nquantities. The above power-counting observation for the quantum effect\nmotivates us to plot these quantities against @xmath , instead of @xmath\n. For the fuzzy sphere classical solution, they respectively scale as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (5.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis leads us to plot the quantities @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath\nagainst @xmath in Fig. 11 .\n\nThis plotting poses a serious consequence. This matrix model has the\nfirst-order phase transition with the change of the parameter @xmath .\nIn the above four cases, we see a discontinuity at the critical point\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe also find that this discontinuity is steeper for the larger @xmath .\nThis indicates that there is a first-order phase transition between the\ntwo phases.\n\nWe call the phase at @xmath the \u201dYang-Mills phase\u201d. In this phase, the\nquantum effect of the matrix model becomes strong, and thus the fuzzy\nsphere classical solution is no longer stable. Rather, the behavior for\nthis phase has a similarity to that of the bosonic IIB matrix model\nwithout the Chern-Simons term. Fig. 11 clearly indicates that this model\nundergoes a smooth transition from @xmath (the bosonic IIB matrix model\nitself) to the small @xmath . The vacuum expectation values of @xmath\nand @xmath have been analyzed in [ 13 ] , where they are shown to behave\nat @xmath . This behavior is inherited in the Yang-Mills phase. We\nelaborate on this phase more closely in Section 5.2.1 .\n\nWe call the phase at @xmath the \u201dfuzzy sphere phase\u201d, where the quantum\neffect is so small that the classical fuzzy sphere is stable. Now, we\ndiscern that the fuzzy sphere is stable at @xmath , @xmath , because the\nsystem is in the fuzzy sphere phase in this case. They are scaled as (\n5.10 ), and this behavior is totally different from that of the\nYang-Mills phase.\n\nThis first-order phase translation is a product of the the Monte Carlo\nsimulation, which could not be seen by the perturbative approaches. In\nthis sense, we accentuate that this first-order phase transition is a\nnonperturbative phenomenon.\n\nWe next exhibit the corresponding plot of the quantity @xmath in Fig. 12\n. In the Yang-Mills phase, the observables @xmath and @xmath behave as\n@xmath , similarly to the bosonic IIB matrix model. The fluctuation of\n@xmath is thus small in the Yang-Mills phase.\n\nOn the other hand, @xmath and @xmath both behave as @xmath in the fuzzy\nsphere phase. Nevertheless, the quantity @xmath is of the order @xmath ,\nas is analytically verified. This is ascribed to the huge cancellation\nbetween these two terms in the fuzzy sphere phase. Therefore, the\nfluctuation of @xmath is naturally bigger in the fuzzy sphere phase than\nin the bosonic Yang-Mills phase.\n\n#### 5.1.3 One-loop dominance in the fuzzy sphere phase\n\nThe behavior of these four quantities in the fuzzy sphere phase gives an\neven more striking consequence. The numerical value of these four\nquantities coincides their one-loop results. The one-loop vacuum\nexpectation values are calculated in the large- @xmath limit as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe delegate the derivation of these results to the appendices of [ 60 ]\n. The first term comes from the classical effect, while the one-loop\ncorrection comes in the second term of each quantity. The dotted lines\nin the graphs denote these one-loop result of these quantities \u00b9\u2075 \u00b9\u2075 15\nFor @xmath , we omit the dotted line, because it is not subject to the\none-loop correction. . The coincidence of the numerical values of these\nobservables with the one-loop result suggests the higher-loop effects\nare suppressed in the large- @xmath limit and hence that the one-loop\neffect is dominant in the matrix model ( 5.1 ).\n\n#### 5.1.4 Width of the eigenvalue distribution\n\nWe next discuss the dependence of the width of the lump in the histogram\nof the Casimir @xmath on the parameter @xmath and @xmath . We define the\nwidth @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere, @xmath are the eigenvalues of @xmath . The above three expressions\nare all tautological. For the convenience of comparing the histograms\nfor different @xmath and @xmath , we plot the eigenvalue distribution\nagainst the @xmath in Fig. 13 , instead of the usual argument @xmath ,\nwhere @xmath are the mean of the observed eigenvalues for a particular\n@xmath and @xmath and are functions of @xmath and @xmath .\n\nThe overlapping of the different @xmath histograms for a particular\n@xmath shows that the width of the eigenvalue distribution does not\ndepend on @xmath . We also observe that the width of the distributions\nfor different @xmath has a linear dependence on @xmath in Fig. 14 . The\nwidth @xmath turns out to behave as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is in agreement with the one-loop calculation @xmath , which is\nalso derived in the appendices of [ 60 ] .\n\n### 5.2 Analysis of the Yang-Mills phase\n\nWe have so far investigated the numerical simulation starting from the\nfuzzy sphere initial condition ( 5.2 ). We have found that there is a\nphase transition between the Yang-Mills phase and the fuzzy sphere phase\nat @xmath (namely, @xmath ). In this section, we elaborate on the\nbehavior of the Yang-Mills phase, and we launch the Monte Carlo\nsimulation from the initial condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### 5.2.1 Eigenvalue distribution in the Yang-Mills phase\n\nWe start with discussing the eigenvalue distribution of the Casimir\n@xmath , for @xmath with @xmath to indicate the @xmath dependence and\n@xmath with @xmath to indicate the @xmath dependence. Here, we plot the\neigenvalue density @xmath against @xmath in Fig. 15 .\n\nThis @xmath trivially represents the distance from the origin. @xmath is\ndefined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nso that this may represent the eigenvalue density. @xmath is normalized\nso that @xmath .\n\nThe histogram for @xmath is devoid of the eigenvalue in the vicinity of\nthe origin, and the histogram soars around the radius 0.8. In this\nsense, there is an ultraviolet cutoff in the eigenvalue distribution.\nThis phenomenon is interpreted in the following way. If a certain state\nis an eigenstate of the Casimir @xmath with almost zero eigenvalues,\nthis implies that the same state is almost an eigenstate of @xmath ,\n@xmath and @xmath individually with almost zero eigenvalues. However,\nthis violates the uncertainty principle, because a generic configuration\nof @xmath do not commute with each other. In the bosonic IIB matrix\nmodel [ 13 ] , the vacuum expectation value @xmath is of the order\n@xmath . Therefore, the scale of the uncertainty @xmath is also of the\norder @xmath . The above histogram is consistent with this\nconsideration.\n\nThe histogram for @xmath with @xmath demonstrates that the eigenvalue\ndistribution undergoes a gradual change as we vary @xmath within the\nYang-Mills phase.\n\n#### 5.2.2 Phase transition and the hysteresis\n\nWe next investigate the phase transition of the simulation initiated\nfrom ( 5.15 ). We find that the critical point differs in the initial\ncondition ( 5.15 ) from that for the fuzzy sphere initial condition (\n5.2 ). When we initiate the simulation from @xmath , the critical point\nis found at\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe plot @xmath for @xmath with the two initial condition ( 5.2 ) and (\n5.15 ) in Fig. 16 .\n\nThe important difference in the Yang-Mills phase is that the critical\npoint @xmath is independent of @xmath . Since the critical point @xmath\nis larger than that for the fuzzy sphere initial condition @xmath for\nthe sufficiently large @xmath , we call the critical point for the\nYang-Mills (fuzzy sphere) phase \u2019the upper (lower) critical point\u2019\nrespectively. The above hysteresis cycle is realized for the\nsufficiently large @xmath . For the @xmath case, the lower critical\npoint is approximately @xmath , which is larger than @xmath . In this\ncase, the hysteresis disappears, as is discerned from Fig. 16 . On the\nother hand, this is not the case with @xmath in which the hysteresis\ncycle is realized.\n\n### 5.3 Metastability of the multi-sphere solutions\n\nIn this section, we investigate the multi-fuzzy-sphere solution of the\nmatrix model ( 5.1 ). It accommodates the following multi-fuzzy-sphere\nsolution\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath is the @xmath -dimensional irreducible representation of\nthe @xmath Lie algebra. The whole size of the matrices @xmath is @xmath\n. For this multi-fuzzy-sphere solution, the eigenvalue distribution of\n@xmath is peaked at\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe classical value of the action is easily calculated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe value of the action ( 5.20 ) for the multi-fuzzy-sphere condition is\nbigger than that for the single fuzzy sphere state (namely, @xmath ).\nTherefore, the multi-fuzzy-sphere state can be realized as a metastable\nstate. In the following, we report the results of the simulations to\nunravel this metastability.\n\n#### 5.3.1 Evolution of the multi-fuzzy-sphere solution\n\nFirstly, we report the simulation with the initial condition ( 5.15 ),\nand observe how the fuzzy sphere state evolves. Here, we focus on the\nlarge- @xmath case in the fuzzy sphere phase @xmath and @xmath . We plot\nthe history of the vacuum expectation value of the action @xmath , and\nthe eigenvalues of @xmath against the sweeping time in Fig. 17 .\n\nThis indicates the process in which the multi-fuzzy-sphere state is\ngenerated dynamically. Firstly, we start to see a tiny plateau in the\ngraph of @xmath corresponding to the multi-fuzzy-sphere state @xmath .\nWhen we further undergo the sweeps, this multi-fuzzy-sphere state falls\ninto the lower-energy state @xmath . In this way, the state falls off to\nthe lower-energy state @xmath .\n\nFinally the system arrives at the one-fuzzy-sphere irreducible\nrepresentation @xmath . Namely, the one-fuzzy-sphere state is\ndynamically generated in the course of the thermalization. When we\nfurther undergo the sweeps, the system is stuck in this one-fuzzy-sphere\nrepresentation, and never falls off to the other state any more. This\nobservation reinforces the stability of the one-fuzzy-sphere state in\nthe fuzzy sphere phase.\n\n#### 5.3.2 Metastability of the fuzzy sphere solution\n\nIn this section, we obtain an insight into the metastability of the\nfuzzy sphere state, by focusing on the dependence on @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath . We adopt the initial condition of the @xmath case in ( 5.18 )\nfor brevity. Namely, we initiate the simulation from the\nmulti-fuzzy-sphere state\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe have observed in the previous section that the multi-fuzzy-sphere\nstate falls into the lower-energy state in the course of the\nthermalization of the system. Firstly, we observe how the\nmulti-fuzzy-sphere classical solution ( 5.21 ) decays, for @xmath ,\n@xmath and @xmath in Fig. 18 .\n\nThis indicates that the multi-fuzzy-sphere state ( 5.21 ) decays faster\nfor larger @xmath (namely, for the smaller representation of the size\n@xmath ). This is a natural result, and we elaborate on this dependence\non @xmath later.\n\nNextly, we show the first-order phase transition and the one-loop\ndominance of the @xmath reducible representation. The observables @xmath\n, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are calculated in the appendices of [ 60 ]\nas\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (5.22)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nfor the one-loop effect around the multi fuzzy sphere ( 5.18 ) with\n@xmath . We launch the simulation from the initial condition ( 5.21 )\nfor @xmath . We plot these four observables in Fig. 19 .\n\nWe have seen in Fig. 18 that the multi fuzzy sphere decays in the course\nof the thermalization. Here we undergo a sufficiently short sweep in the\nfuzzy sphere phase, such that the multi fuzzy sphere ( 5.21 ) may not\ndecay. In the @xmath multi fuzzy sphere, we find two consequenses\nsimilar to the @xmath irreducible representation. Firstly, we note that\nthere is a first-order phase transition. This time, the critical point\nlies at\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSecondly, the @xmath multi fuzzy sphere has the one-loop dominance in\nthe fuzzy sphere phase in the large- @xmath limit.\n\nWe can understand the critical point ( 5.23 ) from the one-loop\ndominance. In the fuzzy sphere phase, the spacetime extent @xmath\nbehaves at the one-loop level as @xmath in the fuzzy sphere phase. This\nis positive only when @xmath . In this sense, we obtain the lower bound\non the critical point from the one-loop dominance as @xmath . The\ncritical point ( 5.11 ) for @xmath and ( 5.23 ) for @xmath are\nconsistent with this observation.\n\nWe next discuss the sweeping time @xmath that takes for the initial\ncondition ( 5.21 ) to decay more qualitatively. To this end, we plot\n@xmath against @xmath for @xmath in Fig. 20 . This indicates that the\nsweeping time for the multi-fuzzy-sphere state to decay depends on\n@xmath and @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (5.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFig. 20 indicates that this power law is independent of the size of the\nmatrix @xmath .\n\nThis is in contrast to the intuitive observation that the decay\nprobability @xmath obeys @xmath ; namely the sweeping time for the decay\nis @xmath . It is interesting to ruminate on the reasoning for the\ndeviation from this intuitive observation.\n\n### 5.4 Miscellaneous future directions\n\nWe conclude this section by listing the future approaches to this work.\nThere are a lot of interesting future works in this direction. Firstly,\nthis toy model is expected to serve for the dynamical generation of the\ngauge group. As we have reviewed in Section 2.4.1 , the expansion around\nthe reducible representation ( 5.18 ) for @xmath gives the\nnoncommutative Yang-Mills theory with the @xmath gauge group. Iso and\nKawai [ 14 ] suggested that the dynamical generation of the gauge group\nis ascribed to the cluster distribution of the eigenvalues. By examining\nthe eigenvalue distribution of this model, we may gain insight into the\ndynamical generation of the gauge group.\n\nSecondly, it is also exciting to extend our analysis to the\nsupersymmetric case. For the simplest case, we start with the\nfour-dimensional supersymmetric model with the three-dimensional\nChern-Simons term \u00b9\u2076 \u00b9\u2076 16 Austing and Wheater [ 57 ] corroborated that\nthe three-dimensional action ( 2.76 ) has a divergent path-integral.\nTherefore, the numerical simulation of the three-dimensional model is\nnot possible. . It is intriguing to investigate how the supersymmetry\naffects the results we have obtained for the bosonic case.\n\nThirdly, the extension to the higher-dimensional extension is also an\nintriguing issue. We can extend our analysis to the higher-dimensional\nfuzzy sphere, as we have reviewed in Section 2.4.2 . There has been\nhitherto no works which discuss the quantum stability of the\nhigher-dimensional fuzzy sphere @xmath , since it is much more\nmathematically involved than the simplest @xmath fuzzy sphere. On the\nother hand, it is easy to extend the algorithm for the matrix model with\nthe three-dimensional Chern-Simons term to the higher dimension. We\nexpect that the Monte Carlo simulation may open the door to the study of\nthe higher-dimensional fuzzy sphere.\n\nThe fourth future direction is to extend our analysis to the general\nhomogeneous space, which is proposed by Kitazawa in [ 44 ] . By\ninvestigating several homogeneous spaces (such as @xmath ), we may be\nable to understand which homogeneous space is the most favored in the\nquantum sense. We expect that this direction may give us a clue to the\ncompactification of the spacetime.\n\nIn this way, the Monte Carlo simulation we have described here gives us\na lot of exciting prospects.\n\n## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this thesis, we have reviewed the author\u2019s works [ 26 , 38 , 46 , 60\n] about the relation between the gravitational interaction and the\nmatrix model. Now, it is believed that the \u2019Theory of Everything\u2019, which\nunifies all the interactions in the nature, is realized by the\nsuperstring theory. The large- @xmath reduced model is now regarded as\nthe promising candidate for the nonperturbative formulation of the\nsuperstring theory. If we build the nonperturbative formulation of the\nsuperstring theory, this will be the right framework to unify all\ninteractions. Then, we will be able to solve all the riddles of the\nStandard Model, such as the dimensionality of our spacetime, the\ngeneration of the quark, the gauge group and the eighteen parameters of\nthe Standard Model, from the parameterless theory.\n\nIn order to arrive at this ultimate goal, it is an important step to see\nthe correspondence between the matrix model and the gravitational\ninteraction. In the future, it is indispensable to elucidate the more\nmanifest correspondence with the gravitational interaction. For example,\nit is interesting to pursue the matrix model that is equipped with the\nlocal Lorentz symmetry and reduces to the supergravity in the low-energy\nlimit, by inheriting the idea we described in Section 4. If we find such\na matrix model, it will be certainly a better extension of the IIB\nmatrix model, in the sense that it has clearer relation to the\ngravitational interaction. In addition, it is also interesting how the\nmatrix model realizes the curved-space background. The curved spacetime\nis also an essential feature of the general relativity. So far, it is\nknown that the IIB matrix model, per se, realizes the curved-space\nbackground through the condensation of the graviton. In addition,\nseveral alterations of the IIB matrix model have been advocated, so that\nthey may be equipped with the curved-space manifold. On the other hand,\nthe alterations of the IIB matrix model is merely limited to the simple\nmanifolds; such as the @xmath fuzzy sphere, fuzzy torus or @xmath\nmanifold. It is exciting to pursue how the matrix model realizes the\ngeneral curved spacetime more manifestly.\n\nWe finally mention the relation between the IIB matrix model and its\nmiscellaneous extensions. In the quantum field theory, some different\nmodels which share the same symmetry are equivalent in the continuum\nlimit, known as universality. We expect that the similar mechanism may\nhold true of the matrix models and hence that various matrix models may\nhave the same large @xmath limit. Thus, there is a possibility that\nthese new extensions are equivalent to the IIB matrix model. We can\nexpect that both the IIB matrix model and the new extensions are equally\nauthentic constructive definition of superstring theory in the large\n@xmath limit. It is an intriguing future work to elaborate on this\nconjecture of the universality.\n\nMankind has yet to grasp what is the true \u2019Theory of Everything\u2019. We\nmust exert more effort to arrive at the answer to this ultimate and most\ndifficult question of the elementary particle physics.\n\n##### Acknowledgment\n\nIt is my great pleasure to acknowledge the collaboration and the advice\nto complete the present work.\n\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to my immediate supervisor\nProf. Hikaru Kawai.

Throughout this\nthesis, the metric of the Minkowskian spacetime is taken so that the\ntime component should be minus and the space components should be plus.\nNamely, the metric is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe gamma matrices are defined so that it may comply with the following\nClifford algebra:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, the gamma matrices @xmath are the @xmath real matrices and the\nindices @xmath run over @xmath . The explicit components are given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere, @xmath are the nine-dimensional (and thus @xmath ) gamma matrices,\nand obey the Clifford algebra for the nine-dimensional Euclidean\nspacetime @xmath , where @xmath run over @xmath .\n\nThe transpose of the gamma matrices are given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe chirality matrices @xmath are defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor the indices @xmath in the eleven-dimensional Minkowski spacetime,\nthe gamma matrices comply with the Clifford algebra @xmath .\n\nNext, we define the charge conjugation matrix @xmath . @xmath should\nsatisfy the conditions\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn our case, @xmath is identical to @xmath .\n\nThe anti-symmetrized gamma matrices are abbreviated as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, @xmath is the set of the permutation of the integers @xmath .\n\n#### a.1.1 Chirality of the Weyl fermion\n\nWe summarize the notation for the chirality of the fermion. The\nleft-hand (right-hand) fermion is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe left-handed (right-handed) fermions satisfy the following identities\nfor the ten-dimensional gamma matrices:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (A.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nHere, we prove only @xmath , so that the rest can be verified likewise.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.9)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\n#### a.1.2 Epsilon tensors and the duality of the matrices\n\nHere, we define the anti-symmetric epsilon tensors as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis definition leads the duality relations of the gamma matrices\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### a.1.3 Multiplication law of the gamma matrices\n\nThe anti-symmetrized gamma matrices obey the following formula of the\nproduct.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\n#### a.1.4 Flipping property of the Majorana fermions\n\nHere, we introduce a useful formula for the flipping of the Majorana\nfermion. The gamma matrices has the following property:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis leads to the following relation:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.14)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThen, the Majorana fermions are flipped as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.15)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nNamely, the sign is minus for @xmath , and plus for @xmath .\n\n#### a.1.5 Proof of the Fierz identity (LABEL:AZM31fierz) and (2.87)\n\nWe give a proof of the formula of the Fierz identity ( LABEL:AZM31fierz\n) and ( 2.87 ), which contributes to the proof of the supersymmetry\nalgebra of the matrix model.\n\nWe start with the ten-dimensional formula ( LABEL:AZM31fierz ). The\nfermions @xmath and @xmath are Majorana-Weyl fermions, and effectively\nact on the @xmath space of the gamma matrices. The left hand side is\nwritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, the minus sign emerges because we have flipped the order of the\nGrassmann odd fermions. The matrix @xmath can be decomposed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.17)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nSince the fermions @xmath and @xmath have the same chirality, the terms\nof the even rank vanish due to the relation ( A.7 ). We ignore the\nrank-3 term because we are interested in the difference @xmath , and the\nrank-3 term does not contribute due to the relation ( A.15 ). This leads\nus to focus only on the rank-1,5 terms. The relevant gamma matrices are\ncomputed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.18)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.19)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nWhen we substitute ( A.17 ), ( A.18 ) and ( A.19 ) into ( A.16 ), the\ncomputation of the Fierz transformation goes as follows:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.20)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nWe next go to the proof of ( 2.87 ) for the three-dimensional spacetime.\nThis time, the fermions are Majorana ones. The proof goes in the same\nway as for ( LABEL:AZM31fierz ). Here, we note that the @xmath matrices\n@xmath are decomposed by the Paulian matrices as @xmath Then, the Fierz\ndecomposition is verified as follows:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere, we drop the contribution of the rank-0 term @xmath , because we\nare interested in the difference @xmath and the rank-0 term cancels.\nLikewise, the latter formula is rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe relevant Paulian matrices are calculated as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.23)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.24)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nPlugging ( A.23 ) and ( A.24 ) into ( LABEL:fierz3dimint1 ) and (\nLABEL:fierz3dimint2 ), we complete the proof of the Fierz identity (\n2.87 ).\n\n#### a.1.6 Proof of the Fierz identity (2.10)\n\nWe next verify the Fierz identity ( 2.10 ). This formula plays an\nimportant role in the supersymmetry of the super Yang-Mills theory or\nthe Green-Schwarz action of the superstring. This holds only for the\nfollowing cases:\n\n1.  @xmath , and @xmath are Majorana.\n\n2.  @xmath , and @xmath are Majorana or Weyl.\n\n3.  @xmath , and @xmath are Weyl.\n\n4.  @xmath , and @xmath are Majorana-Weyl.\n\nTo substantiate this relation, we carry out the following decomposition.\n\n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n           @xmath            (A.25)\n           @xmath   @xmath   \n           @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n\nNamely, our job reduces to verifying the vanishing of the following\nquantity:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe multiply @xmath and @xmath with ( A.26 ) to obtain \u00b9\u2077 \u00b9\u2077 17 The\nflipping property @xmath holds true only for the Majorana fermion ,\nbecause @xmath holds only for the Majorana fermions. However, the\nproperty @xmath holds true without assuming the Majorana fermion.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe verify the vanishing of ( A.27 ) by decomposing them by the gamma\nmatrices. For example, the @xmath matrices for the ten-dimensional case\nare decomposed in the same way as ( A.17 ). This leads us to verify the\nvanishing for the components of each rank.\n\nFor @xmath of the first term, it is trivial that only the rank-1\ncomponents contribute. For the second and third terms which entail the\nfermions @xmath , we can limit the argument at most to the rank-5\ncomponents. We note that the rank-0,3,4 components do not contribute\nbecause of the anti-symmetry of @xmath (for @xmath ). The even-rank\ncomponents do not contribute for the Weyl fermion either, because of the\nWeyl projection. We list up which rank we should consider in the\nfollowing:\n\n1.  For @xmath Majorana case, only the rank-1 matrices may contribute.\n\n2.  For @xmath Majorana case, only the rank-1,2 components may survive.\n    For the Weyl case, only the rank-1 may survive.\n\n3.  For the @xmath Weyl case, we consider the rank-1 components.\n\n4.  For the @xmath Majorana-Weyl case, we consider the rank-1,5\n    components.\n\nFor the rank-1 case, we multiply @xmath , and we find that this quantity\nvanishes:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n@xmath is the size of the gamma matrices, and @xmath is the spacetime\ndimensionality. Here, we utilize the following formula for the general\nrank- @xmath gamma matrices @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (A.28)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe rank-1 terms cancel for @xmath , where @xmath respectively.\n\nNext, we go on to the generic rank- @xmath ( @xmath ) case. We multiply\n@xmath to obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nDue to the formula of the gamma matrices ( A.28 ), these contributions\nactually vanish for @xmath for @xmath respectively.\n\n### a.2 Supermatrices\n\nThis section is devoted to introducing the definitions of the notion of\nsupermatrices. In treating supermatrices, there are many points we\nshould be meticulous about, because what holds true of ordinary matrices\nis not applicable to the supermatrices.\n\n#### a.2.1 Transpose\n\nWe first introduce a notion of the transpose, emphasizing on the\ndifference from the ordinary matrices. In considering such objects, it\nis extremely important to settle the starting point, because the other\nnotions are defined so that they are consistent with this starting\npoint.\n\n##### Transpose of Vector\n\nThe guiding principle in considering the transpose of the supermatrices\nis the transpose of the vector .\n\n-   The guiding principle is that the transpose of a vector is defined\n    as\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (A.30)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    We denote @xmath as the components of @xmath , and these components\n    mean both bosons and fermions .\n\n-   We define the vector as @xmath where @xmath and @xmath are fermionic\n    and bosonic real fields respectively.\n\n##### Transpose of Supermatrices\n\nThe transpose of supermatrices must be defined so that the definition is\nconsistent with the transpose of a vector. Therefore the transpose of a\nsupermatrix must satisfy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a supermatrix and @xmath is a vector. Following this\nrule, the transpose of a supermatrix is defined as follows:\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (A.32)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\n-   @xmath and @xmath are bosonic (i.e. Grassmann even) @xmath and\n    @xmath matrices, respectively.\n\n-   @xmath and @xmath are @xmath and @xmath fermionic (i.e. Grassmann\n    odd) matrices, respectively.\n\n-   @xmath ( @xmath ) denote the upper @xmath (lower @xmath )\n    bosonic(fermionic) components of the supervector respectively.\n\n(Proof) This can be verified using the very definition of the transpose.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen the transpose of this vector is by definition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.34)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe point is that the sign of @xmath has changed because these are\nGrassmann odd. Noting this fact, we can read off the result ( A.32 ).\n(Q.E.D.)\n\nWe have one caution about the transpose of the supermatrix. The\ntranspose of the transpose does not give an original matrix. This\n\u2019anomalous\u2019 property can be immediately read off from the definition of\nthe supermatrix ( A.32 ):\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n##### Transpose of Transverse Vector\n\nWe have seen an important fact that the transpose of the transpose of a\nsupermatrix does not give the original supermatrix. In fact, the same\nholds true of the transpose of the transpose of a vector. Conclusion\ncoming first, the definition is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe confirm that this is actually a well-defined settlement. This notion\nis defined so that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a transverse vector @xmath and @xmath is a supermatrix\n@xmath . We compute both the L.H.S and the R.H.S and verify that they\nactually match if we follow the above definition.\n\n-   L.H.S. : @xmath .\n    We have used the fact that in the transpose of @xmath , we must\n    multiply @xmath because a fermion jumps over another fermion.\n\n-   R.H.S. : @xmath .\n\nThus we have verified that the above definition of the transpose is\nconsistent with the condition @xmath . As we have mentioned before, the\ntranspose of the transpose of a vector does not give the original\nvector, because\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n#### a.2.2 Hermitian Conjugate\n\nWe introduce a notion of hermitian conjugate of the supermatrix. This\nnotion is much simpler than the transpose, and we do not see anomalous\nproperties as emerged in the transpose. The starting point of this\nnotion is\n\n-   For a fermionic number @xmath , the complex conjugate is @xmath .\n\n-   For a vector @xmath , the complex conjugate is @xmath .\n\nUnder this definition, the hermitian conjugate of a supermatrix is\ndefined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.39)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n(Proof) The guiding principle to determine the hermitian conjugate of a\nsupermatrix is the condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.40)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor @xmath and @xmath , @xmath is computed to be, utilizing the\ndefinition for the vector,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.41)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe explicit form of the hermitian conjugate of a supermatrix can be\nread off from ( A.41 ), and this completes the proof. (Q.E.D.)\n\nThe definition of the hermitian conjugate of a transverse vector is now\nstraightforward. This is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.42)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that this definition is consistent with\nthe guiding principle\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.43)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nbecause @xmath .\n\n#### a.2.3 Complex Conjugate\n\nWe define a notion of complex conjugate for a supermatrix. The guiding\nprinciple to define the complex conjugate is to require the matrices and\nthe vectors to satisfy the condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.44)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn order to satisfy this condition, we define the complex conjugate of\nthe vectors and the matrices as follows \u00b9\u2078 \u00b9\u2078 18 Be careful about the\nfact that @xmath is different from @xmath . They are computed to be\n@xmath , @xmath and @xmath and these are not the complex conjugate of\nthe vectors or the matrices. .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that this definition is consistent with\nthe guiding principle ( A.44 ).\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.46)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nCombining the results obtained in the previous section, the explicit\nform of the complex conjugate of the vectors and the matrices are\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis is clearly consistent with the guiding principle @xmath because\n@xmath .\n\nWe have following properties which relates the transpose, hermitian\nconjugate and the complex conjugate.\n\n(Prop) (1) @xmath , (2) @xmath .\n\n(Proof) These properties can be verified by noting that the hermitian\nconjugate of the hermitian conjugate gives back the original quantity,\nwhich can be readily verified by definition.\n\n1.  @xmath .\n\n2.  @xmath . In the last equality, we have utilized the fact that, for a\n    supermatrix, @xmath , which can be readily verified from the\n    explicit form of the complex conjugate ( A.47 ).\n\nThis completes the proof of the above properties. (Q.E.D.)\n\nNow we are ready to answer the question : what do we mean by \u2019a\nsupermatrix is real ?\u2019 . In considering physics, we must take into\naccount the reality condition. We utilize supermatrices in the context\nof expressing the action of superstring theory, the action must be real,\nand we are required to solidify the definition of the reality of a\nsupermatrix.\n\n(Def) A supermatrix @xmath is real @xmath @xmath is a mapping from a\nreal vector to a real vector .\n\nThis statement is equivalent to, for the above definition of complex\nconjugate,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis can be verified by noting the starting guiding principle that\n@xmath is designed to satisfy @xmath . If @xmath is satisfied, @xmath is\na real vector if @xmath is real, because\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (A.49)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe relationship ( A.48 ) tells us the conditions for the components of\n@xmath to satisfy. Noting the explicit form of complex conjugate ( A.47\n), we can derive @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , id est,\n\n-   @xmath should be real.\n\n-   @xmath should be pure imaginary.\n\n## Appendix B Calculation of the Seeley-de-Witt coefficients\n\nThis appendix is devoted to introducing the basic technique of computing\nthe Seeley-de-Witt coefficients in the heat kernel expansion. There are\na number of ways to compute the coefficients, and here we focus on the\ncalculation based on the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula. We consider\nthe general elliptic differential operator\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn this section, we consider the @xmath -dimensional spacetime, and the\nindices @xmath run over @xmath . These indices are allocated for the\ncurved spacetime.\n\nWe consider the trace of the large @xmath matrices in terms of the heat\nkernel. The trace of the operators are expressed using the complete\nsystem as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere the bracket @xmath and @xmath satisfies @xmath . However, it is\ndifficult to consider the trace of a general operator, and we regard the\noperator as the sum of the first term of ( B.1 ) and the perturbation\naround it. This is a famous procedure, and the perturbation is expressed\nin terms of the Seeley-de-Witt coefficients.\n\nIt is well known that the Green function is computed to be\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTherefore, its trace is easily derived as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nOn the other hand, the heat kernel expansion of the general elliptic\noperator ( B.1 ) is expanded as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThese coefficients @xmath are called \u201dthe Seeley-de-Witt coefficients\u201d.\n( B.4 ) trivially gives @xmath . However, the other coefficients give\nnontrivial results. In the following, we derive the first order @xmath\nfor the general elliptic operator ( B.1 ).\n\nTo this end, we divide @xmath as @xmath , where\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.6)\n     @xmath      (B.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFrom now on, we compute the exponential @xmath via the\nCampbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula, while the computation is rather\ninvolved:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (B.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nSince we know that @xmath , the quantity in question is computed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nBefore we enter the computation of the quantity @xmath , we summarize\nthe formula of the differentiation of @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.10)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.11)\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.12)\n                                @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.13)\n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\n##### Computation of @xmath\n\nWe start with the computation of the easiest case:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nTherefore, the trace is obtained by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n##### Computation of @xmath\n\nWe next go on to a bit more complicated case, and we compute the\noperator @xmath itself:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.16)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nTherefore, the trace is computed to be, with the help of the formulae (\nB.13 ),\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n                 @xmath   \n        @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n\n##### Computation of @xmath\n\nWe compute the operator @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      \n     @xmath      (B.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTherefore, the trace is computed as\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n                 @xmath   \n        @xmath   @xmath   \n                 @xmath   \n                 @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --\n\n##### Computation of @xmath\n\nThe next job is the computation of the term @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.20)\n                                @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe trace is thus\n\n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n           @xmath            (B.21)\n           @xmath   @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n\n##### Computation of @xmath\n\nWe next compute the commutator @xmath . From now on, the computation\nbecomes more complicated than before, and we give only the trace:\n\n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n           @xmath            (B.22)\n           @xmath   @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n\n##### Computation of @xmath\n\n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n           @xmath            (B.23)\n           @xmath   @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n\n##### Computation of @xmath\n\n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n           @xmath            (B.24)\n           @xmath   @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n                    @xmath   \n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n\nSumming up these terms altogether, we obtain the general form of the\nfirst-order coefficient @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.25)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nEspecially, the Seeley-de-Witt coefficient of the Laplace Beltrami\noperator\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.26)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nis important on the practical ground. This amounts to @xmath and @xmath\n, in the general form ( B.1 ). Plugging this into the general formula of\n@xmath ( B.25 ), we obtain the following important result:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (B.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the Ricci scalar of the spacetime metric. This result is\nused in the context of the superstring theory in deriving the Weyl\nanomaly and the corresponding Liouville action.\n\n##### Derivation of (4.23)\n\nWith the above idea in mind, let us derive the result ( 4.23 ) for the\nsimplest example of the calculation in our case. We expand the\ndifferential operator @xmath given by ( LABEL:AZ2expansionD ) around\n@xmath . Namely, we express @xmath as @xmath , and perform a\nperturbative expansion around @xmath . The heat kernel for @xmath is\ngiven by @xmath . Here, we identify the field @xmath with the vielbein,\nand we expand this around the flat background metric as @xmath , where\n@xmath . Then, @xmath is more explicitly expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nNow, we are interested in the mass term of the vector fields @xmath . In\nthe Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula ( LABEL:cbh ), only the terms\n@xmath and @xmath contribute to their mass terms. Now, we have a close\nlook at these two contribution.\n\nFor @xmath , only the elements of the rank-0 gamma matrices contribute\nto the heat kernel, because the trace @xmath for the @xmath gamma\nmatrices projects out the higher-rank gamma matrices. Therefore, the\ncontribution to the mass term is clearly\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.29)\n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere the constant @xmath comes from the trace @xmath . We next compute\nthe effect of @xmath . This time, the higher-rank terms of @xmath\ncontribute, because the product of the gamma matrices survives. The\nrelevant terms are as follows:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the omission of the irrelevant terms. This gives\nthe contribution\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (B.30)\n                                @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere we have utilized the formula ( B.11 ) for @xmath . We obtain the\nmass term ( 4.23 ) in question by the sum of ( B.29 ) and ( B.30 ).\n\n## Appendix C Basic knowledge for the numerical simulation of the matrix\nmodel\n\nThis appendix is devoted to introducing the basic knowledge of the Monte\nCarlo simulation of the matrix model. While the following ideas can be\nreadily applied to the QCD, the programming for the matrix model is much\nsimpler than for the quantum field theory.\n\n### c.1 Review of the Monte Carlo simulation\n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation plays an extremely important role in the\nnumerical simulation. In many cases, the analytical computation may be\ntoo complicated to handle. Let us think about the four-dimensional\n10,000-site lattice gauge theory. This system has 40,000 sites.\nTherefore, even for the simplest @xmath gauge theory, we have to compute\nthe sum of the @xmath configurations. The analytical computation of the\npartition function is almost impossible and this leads us to resort to\nthe numerical treatment.\n\nTo put it simply, the fundamental idea of the Monte Carlo simulation is\nto produce the equilibrium ensemble artificially. In the case of the\nmatrix model, the state @xmath is identified with the element of the\n@xmath matrices; namely\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor the quantum field theory, @xmath of course corresponds to the gauge\nfield configuration @xmath . Since the sequential integral is\nrepresented as @xmath , the partition function is rewritten as @xmath .\nIn the Monte Carlo simulation, we derive the configuration @xmath that\ncomplies with the Boltzmann probability\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nTo this end, we consider the following Markov process. Namely, the\nprobability to transform from the configuration @xmath to the new one\n@xmath depends only on the state @xmath and @xmath . This probability\nnever depends on the previous history @xmath . In this sense, this\nprobability is denoted as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nsince the probability is the function of only @xmath and @xmath . The\nfollowing \u201ddetailed balance condition\u201d is a vital constraint on the\nBoltzmann distribution:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor the transformation complying with the detailed balance condition, we\nhave the following two crucial properties:\n\n1.  An equilibrium sequence of the state transforms into another\n    equilibrium state.\n\n2.  A nonequilibrium sequence approaches to the equilibrium state.\n\nIt is easy to prove the first statement. While it is trivial, we recall\nthe following properties of the probabilities. Firstly, @xmath .\nSecondly, when @xmath is obtained from @xmath through the Markov process\nand @xmath is the probability for the ensemble @xmath , we have @xmath .\nThe first property is verified by taking the sum of the both hand sides\nof ( C.4 ) with respect to @xmath . Now, the previous state @xmath\ncomplies with the Boltzmann distribution @xmath . Then, we have\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThus, the newly emerging state also complies with the Boltzmann\ndistribution.\n\nThe second property is substantiated by defining the distance of the two\nensembles @xmath and @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThen, the distance from the Boltzmann distribution is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.7)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nThis implies that the distance from the Boltzmann state is smaller as we\niterate the Markov process obeying the detailed balance condition.\n\nThere are two major algorithms that satisfy the detailed balance\ncondition. One is the heat bath algorithm. The heat bath algorithm is\nused when we have a clear correspondence between the uniform random\nnumber and the configuration of the fields. In this case, the\nprobability to transform to the configuration @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (C.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIn this process, the probability @xmath depends only on the new\nconfiguration, and does not even depend on the previous state. It is\ntrivial that this satisfies the detailed balance condition. In analyzing\nthe matrix model, we resort to the heat bath algorithm. We postpone the\nexplicit example to the subsequent sections for the matrix model\nsimulation.\n\nThe other is the Metropolis algorithm. Firstly, we choose the\nconfiguration @xmath at random. Then, we compute the difference @xmath .\nWe adopt the new state at the probability @xmath . Namely, the\nprobability is given by\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (C.9)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nWe take a uniform random number @xmath . When @xmath we adopt the new\nconfiguration @xmath , and otherwise we jettison the new configuration\n@xmath and keep the status quo. It is easy to verify that the Metropolis\nalgorithm also satisfies the detailed balance condition, by noting that\nthe probability for the inverse transformation is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe advantage of the Metropolis algorithm is that it can be applied to\nmore various systems. When it is impossible to build the heat bath\nalgorithm, the Metropolis algorithm is here to stay. A good example is\nthe supersymmetric matrix model. When the model has fermions, we often\nuse the hybrid Monte Carlo simulation. It is impossible to handle the\nGrassmann numbers numerically. Therefore, if we are to treat the model\nequipped with the fermion, we must integrate out the fermion\nanalytically. Then, we evaluate the Pfaffian composed of the bosonic\nfields with the numerical method.\n\n### c.2 Simulation of the quadratic matrix model\n\nWe first start with the simplest example of the matrix model. While it\nis a very simple toy model, we scrutinize this case in full detail\nbecause this is the heart of the heat bath algorithm of the more\ncomplicated matrix models. We deal with the following quadratic matrix\nmodel:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath is an @xmath hermitian matrix, and this model is invariant\nunder the @xmath unitary transformation. Its path integral is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAnalytically, the propagator of this matrix model is evaluated as\nfollows \u00b9\u2079 \u00b9\u2079 19 The result ( C.13 ) is applicable to the case @xmath .\nHere, we touch on the propagator for the @xmath case. This can be\nderived from ( C.13 ) by subtracting the trace part. Namely, we replace\n@xmath with @xmath . The propagator @xmath is computed as\n\n@xmath\n\nTherefore, the Feynman rule is replaced for @xmath case by\n\n@xmath\n\n:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe proof of this propagator goes as follows. We note that, due to the\nhermiticity of @xmath , the trace is written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe separate @xmath into the real and the imaginary part as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath and @xmath are real c-number. The diagonal parts are real\nnumbers, and they are rewritten using the real numbers @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThen, the quadratic term is written as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe derivation of the propagator reduces to the simple Gaussian\nintegral:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n-   @xmath survives only for @xmath .\n\n-   For @xmath ( @xmath ), we note the following two results. Firstly,\n    @xmath is shown to vanish as\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (C.19)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    Here, (*) does not contribute ab initio, since this is a linear term\n    of each @xmath and @xmath . Secondly, we note that\n\n      -- -------- -- --------\n         @xmath      (C.20)\n      -- -------- -- --------\n\n    survives (namely when @xmath ).\n\nThis completes the proof of the Feynman rule ( C.13 ).\n\nUsing the Feynman rule ( C.13 ), we can easily derive the following\nvacuum expectation values:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe next go into the numerical treatment of this matrix model, by means\nof the heat bath algorithm. The rewriting of the action ( C.17 ) plays a\ncrucial role in the analysis. The advantage is that all @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath are decoupled. Therefore, in the heat bath algorithm, we can\nupdate each of these real numbers independently. Recall that, in the\nheat bath algorithm ( C.8 ), the probability for the new configuration\ndepends only on the new configuration. Now, the partition function is\nrewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThus, for example, the new configuration of @xmath complies with the\nfollowing probability distribution.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is normalized so that @xmath . Namely, the updating of the\nquantities @xmath all reduces to the Gaussian distribution. The process\nof updating the matrix elements can be divided into the following three\nsteps.\n\n##### Generation of the uniform random number\n\nFirstly, we introduce the numerical method to generate the sequence of\nthe pseudo-random number. A simple way is the \u201dcongruence method\u201d. We\ngenerate the sequence of the random numbers @xmath by the following\nrecursive formula:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe initial term @xmath should be given by hand as a random seed. When\nwe normalize this sequence as @xmath , we obtain a uniform pseudo-random\nnumber [0,1]. Especially, it is known that we obtain a sensible\npseudo-random sequence by taking @xmath and @xmath . The drawback of the\ncongruence method is the price of its simplicity. This random sequence\nhas too short a cycle. However, this is not so problematic so long as we\nundergo the simulation of the matrix model, while this is a serious\nproblem for the QCD simulation.\n\n##### Generation of the Gaussian distribution\n\nWe next introduce the way to generate the Gaussian distribution from the\nuniform random numbers, generated in the previous step. We take two\nindependent uniform random numbers @xmath . Then, we introduce the\nquantity @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe probability distribution of @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe next introduce the quantities @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe discern that this complies with the Gaussian distribution as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEspecially when @xmath , @xmath and @xmath obey the normal Gaussian\ndistribution.\n\n##### Updating of the matrix elements\n\nNow that we introduce the random number complying the Gaussian\ndistribution, we update each of the matrix elements @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath by the Gaussian distribution. When we finish updating all of them\nonce, this means that we have completed one sweep. Then, we reiterate\nthe sweeps until the system is sufficiently thermalized.\n\n### c.3 Simulation of the quartic matrix model\n\nWe next investigate the @xmath matrix model. This model has a lot of\nlessons in treating the IIB matrix model and its extensions. The action\nis defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn order to perform the heat bath algorithm of this matrix model, we\nintroduce the auxiliary field @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath and the auxiliary field @xmath is an @xmath hermitian\nmatrix. It is easy to verify that the action ( C.30 ) reduces to ( C.29\n) by integrating out @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe idea to update the quantities @xmath and @xmath is similar to that\nof the quadratic case, and we proceed rather quickly. We rewrite the\nelements of @xmath as\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (C.31)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nIn this way, the action @xmath is written as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nIn the following, @xmath @xmath , @xmath and @xmath @xmath denote the\nreal c-numbers that obey the normal Gaussian distribution.\n\nWe next update the elements of the matrix @xmath . To this end, we\nextract the dependence of @xmath on each component @xmath . Firstly, the\ndependence on the diagonal part @xmath is extracted as follows. In the\nfollowing (up to ( C.47 )), we sometimes do not take a summation with\nrespect to the duplicate indices.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      \n              @xmath   @xmath      \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath      (C.32)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -- --------\n\nThe @xmath denotes the terms independent of @xmath . We omit them\nbecause these do not concern the updating of @xmath Therefore, the\ndiagonal parts @xmath are updated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.33)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe next go on to the updating of @xmath , whose dependence is extracted\nas\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.34)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThis leads us to update the nondiagonal parts @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.35)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis completes the algorithm of updating the matrix elements. However,\nwe must recall that this matrix model is unbounded below. The\neigenvalues near the origin is stable only for the large- @xmath limit,\nand only metastable for the finite @xmath .\n\nThe function @xmath has extrema at @xmath , at which @xmath . Therefore,\nthe origin is barriered by the potential with the height @xmath . For\nthe large- @xmath limit, this barrier prevents the eigenvalues from\ndissipating outside the potential, and the system is kept finite. In [\n61 ] , the following vacuum expectation value is computed analytically\nin the large- @xmath limit for @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.36)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, the parameter @xmath gives the support of the eigenvalue\ndistribution. Namely, the eigenvalues are distributed only in the region\n@xmath . More accurately, the eigenvalue distribution is also derived as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.37)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is normalized as @xmath . We delegate the detailed\nderivation to [ 61 ] .\n\nHowever, for the finite @xmath , the height of the potential barrier is\nalso finite, thus we see the divergence in the course of updating the\neigenvalues.\n\nNamely, when the eigenvalues surpass the potential barrier, we see an\navalanche of the eigenvalues rolling off and off the potential. This is\nwhat happens in the course of the divergence of the system. In order to\nevade the divergence, we need some regularization. Here, we utilize the\nsame regularization trick as for the research of the Weingarten model [\n64 ] . Namely, when any one of the eigenvalues surpasses the potential\nbarrier @xmath , we take back the whole system several @xmath steps.\n\nIn explicitly writing our code, we store the history of several previous\nsteps for the matrix elements of @xmath . When the eigenvalues happen to\ncordon the potential barrier, we recall the record of the history, and\ntake back several steps (practically, around @xmath steps). In this way,\nwe evade the divergence for finite @xmath . Here, we plot the numerical\nresult based on the heat bath algorithm for the quantity @xmath for\n@xmath .\n\n### c.4 Simulation of the bosonic IIB matrix model with the Chern-Simons\nterm\n\nWe next introduce the algorithm for the IIB matrix model with the\nChern-Simons term. In this section, we define the action as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.38)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNamely, we take the @xmath in the action ( 2.111 ) to be @xmath . When\nwe set @xmath , this is of course identical to the bosonic IIB matrix\nmodel, which has been scrutinized in [ 13 ] . There is not so big a\ndifference from the bosonic IIB matrix model, because the Chern-Simons\nterm is nothing but a linear term with respect to each @xmath .\n\nWe define this matrix model in the @xmath -dimensional Euclidean space,\nand the indices @xmath run over @xmath . The following argument is\napplicable to the bosonic IIB matrix model without the Chern-Simons term\n(namely when @xmath ) for an arbitrary dimensions @xmath (the even\n@xmath is also acceptable) \u00b2\u2070 \u00b2\u2070 20 The path integral of the\ntwo-dimensional bosonic IIB matrix model (without the Chern-Simons term)\n\n@xmath\n\nis easily shown to diverge [ 24 ] for any size of the matrices @xmath .\nWhen we diagonalize @xmath as @xmath , the diagonal parts of @xmath\nclearly do not contribute to the action. However, in the measure of the\npath integral\n\n@xmath\n\nthe integral for the diagonal parts of @xmath runs vacuously. This\ncauses the divergence of the path integral. . For the bosonic IIB matrix\nmodel without the Chern-Simons term, the readers are to ignore the\nChern-Simons term in the following argument.\n\nThe action ( C.38 ) is also analyzed via the heat bath algorithm.\nFirstly, we note that the quartic commutator in ( C.38 ) is rewritten as\n\n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n           @xmath            (C.39)\n           @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -- -- -------- -------- --------\n\nwhere @xmath , and these are hermitian matrices because these are\nanti-commutators of @xmath . This leads us to introduce the auxiliary\nfields @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHere, @xmath are hermitian matrices, and satisfy @xmath . @xmath is\ndefined only for @xmath . Of course, the action ( LABEL:IIBfspaux ) is\nequivalent to ( C.38 ) after we integrate out @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nTherefore, the matrices @xmath are updated as\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (C.41)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nWe next update the matrices @xmath . To this end, we extract the\ndependence of the action ( LABEL:IIBfspaux ) on each component of @xmath\n. To this end, we rewrite the action ( LABEL:IIBfspaux ) as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.42)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.43)\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe difference between the pure bosonic IIB matrix model and the model\nwith the Chern-Simons term only comes in the definition of @xmath .\nOtherwise, both cases go totally in the same way.\n\nUsing the rewriting ( C.42 ), we first update the diagonal part @xmath .\n( C.42 ) is further rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.44)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nTherefore, the diagonal parts @xmath are updated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.45)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe next update the nondiagonal parts @xmath , whose dependence is now\nextracted as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.46)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                                @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nTherefore, the nondiagonal part @xmath is updated as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.47)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis completes the algorithm for the heat bath algorithm for the bosonic\nIIB matrix model with the Chern-Simons term. In order to corroborate the\nlegitimacy of the code, it is useful to exploit the following relation\ncoming from the Schwinger-Dyson equation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.48)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nHere, @xmath is the basis of the @xmath Lie algebra and satisfies the\nfollowing identities:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.49)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe matrices @xmath are expanded in terms of @xmath as @xmath . This\nleads to the following identities:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.50)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nAt the last equality, we utilize the tracelessness of the @xmath Lie\nalgebra (namely, @xmath ).\n\nRecalling the fact that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwe rewrite the Schwinger-Dyson equation ( C.48 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThis implies that the vacuum expectation value of the following quantity\nis analytically computed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.52)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n### c.5 Jackknife (binning) method\n\nFinally, we introduce the jackknife method to estimate the errorbar of\nthe quantities obtained by the numerical simulation. Now, we have a\nsample of independent measurements of a primary quantity @xmath . The\nmeasured samples are\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.53)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe sample average is simply defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.54)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNext, we define the jackknife average . We exclude one of the sets\n@xmath in taking the average:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.55)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe variance of the jackknife estimators can be obtained as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.56)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that the average @xmath is trivially equivalent to the average\n@xmath . We can verify @xmath in the following way.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.57)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nNow, @xmath is an unbiased estimator of the variance :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.58)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNext, we explain the jackknife binning. This method is utilized when\n@xmath \u2019s have correlations. Especially, the configurations generated by\nthe Markov process are not statistically independent. This poses the\nproblem of the \u201dautocorrelation\u201d. In coping with this problem, we use\nthe jackknife binning. We consider the following bins:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.59)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSuppose one bin contains @xmath elements, and there are @xmath bins.\nThen, we take the average for each bin as follows:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.60)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath runs over @xmath . We take the variance for these @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.61)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nNote that @xmath . This variance depends on the number of the elements\nin one bin @xmath , and this variance increases with @xmath and we\nfinally see the plateau.\n\nTo illustrate this process, let us take one simple example. We have the\ndata\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (C.62)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nand we construct the bin as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (C.63)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nIn this case, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . Namely, we define the average\nfor each bin as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --\n\nThe average is of course @xmath . The variance is computed as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (C.64)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nThe process in taking the plateau is too delicate to delegate to a\ncomputer, and we usually judge the plateau by hand.","output":["The large-N reduced models have been proposed as the nonperturbative\nformulation of the superstring theory. One of the most promising candidates is\nthe IIB matrix model. While there have been a lot of interesting discoveries of\nthe IIB matrix model in relation to the gravity, we have a lot of problems to\nsurmount, if a large-N reduced model is to be an eligible framework to unify\nthe gravitational interaction. Firstly, it is still an enigma how we can\nrealize the local Lorentz invariant matrix model. In addition, we need to\nunderstand how we can describe the curved spacetime more manifestly, in terms\nof a large-N reduced model.\n  This thesis discusses several attempts to address these issues concerning the\ngravitational interaction. This thesis is based on the following author's works\nhep-th\/0102168, hep-th\/0204078, hep-th\/0209057 and hep-th\/0401038.","The superstring theory is now regarded as the most promising candidate\nfor the unification of the Standard Model and gravity, and this field\nhas been rigorously investigated. However, we have seen a setback of the\nperturbative analysis of the superstring theory, because it has so many\nvacua that we have no way to determine which are the true ones. In order\nto remedy this problem and thus for the superstring theory to have a\npower to predict our real four-dimensional world, we need the\nnonperturbative formulation of the superstring theory.\n\nIn the late 1990\u2019s, our understanding of the nonperturbative aspects of\nthe superstring theory have been greatly deepened. Especially, the\nlarge- @xmath ( @xmath is the size of the matrices) reduced models have\nbeen proposed as the nonperturbative formulation of the superstring\ntheory. One of the most promising candidates is the IIB matrix model,\nwhich is defined by the dimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional\n@xmath super-Yang-Mills theory to zero dimension. It has been\nconjectured that this model resurrects the behavior of the string theory\nat the large- @xmath limit. There have been a lot of interesting\ndiscoveries of the IIB matrix model, such as the dynamical generation of\nthe four-dimensional spacetime and the interpretation of the\ndiffeomorphism invariance.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of problems to surmount, if a large-\n@xmath reduced model is to be an eligible framework to unify the\ngravitational interaction. Firstly, it is still an enigma how we can\nrealize the local Lorentz invariant matrix model. In addition, we need\nto understand how we can describe the curved spacetime more manifestly,\nin terms of a large- @xmath reduced model.\n\nThis thesis discusses several attempts to address these issues\nconcerning the gravitational interaction.\n"]}
{"input":"## Motivation and introduction\n\nTwistor geometry\n\nIn 1967, Penrose [ 189 ] introduced the foundations of twistor geometry.\nThe corner stone of twistor geometry is the substitution of space-time\nas background for physical processes by some new background manifold \u2013\ncalled twistor space, and furthermore the reinterpretation of physical\ntheories on this new space. As originally proposed, twistor space, or\nrather the projectivization thereof, which is associated with\ncomplexified four-dimensional Minkowski space, is the complex projective\nspace @xmath . Geometrically, this space parametrizes all isotropic\ntwo-planes in complexified Minkowski space. Upon this correspondence, it\nis possible to reinterpret solutions to zero rest mass free field\nequations on Minkowski space in terms of certain cohomology groups on\ntwistor space [ 189 ] \u2013 [ 192 ] . For instance, if @xmath is some open\nsubset in complexified Minkowski space and if @xmath denotes the sheaf\nof solutions to the helicity @xmath zero rest mass field equations, then\nthere is an isomorphism between the two cohomology groups @xmath and\n@xmath , where @xmath is an appropriate region on twistor space related\nto @xmath . Here, @xmath is the sheaf of sections of a certain\nholomorphic line bundle (over @xmath ) having first Chern class @xmath .\nThe map between representatives of these cohomology groups has been\ntermed Penrose transform. Putting it differently, any solution to zero\nrest mass free field equations can be represented by certain holomorphic\n\u201cfunctions\u201d on twistor space, which are \u201cfree\u201d of differential\nconstraints. For a detailed discussion of this correspondence in terms\nof \u010cech cohomology, we refer the reader to [ 89 ] . Let us mention in\npassing that, as was shown by Eastwood in [ 90 ] , it is also possible\nto generalize this description to the case of massive free fields.\n\nBesides giving insights into the geometric nature of solutions to linear\nfield equations, the ideas of twistor geometry turned out to be\nextremely powerful for studying various nonlinear classical field\nequations. Twistor methods have successfully been applied to subclasses\nof the Einstein\u2019s equations of General Relativity and of the (super)\nYang-Mills equations, to name just the most prominent ones. Indeed, it\nis possible to associate with any self-dual oriented Riemannian\nfour-dimensional manifold @xmath , that is, a manifold with self-dual\nWeyl tensor, a complex three-dimensional twistor space [ 193 , 20 ] .\nAll the information about the conformal structure of @xmath is encoded\nin the complex structure of this \u201ccurved\u201d twistor space. Some additional\ndata then allows for the construction of self-dual metrics and conformal\nstructures on @xmath . Among such metrics, there are interesting\nsubclasses as, e.g., self-dual Einstein metrics, K\u00e4hler metrics with\nvanishing scalar curvature and Ricci-flat self-dual metrics. For\nconstructions, see Refs. [ 252 , 242 , 253 , 195 , 114 , 115 , 129 , 116\n, 267 , 96 , 144 , 243 , 117 , 172 , 147 ] , for instance. Furthermore,\nthe question when such a twistor space is in addition K\u00e4hler was\nanswered by Hitchin [ 112 ] . He showed that given a compact oriented\nself-dual Riemannian four-dimensional manifold @xmath , the\ncorresponding twistor space admits a K\u00e4hler structure if and only if\n@xmath is conformally equivalent to either @xmath or @xmath . Besides\nquestions related to Einstein\u2019s equations, twistor theory has given\nstriking advances in our understanding of the properties of gauge\ntheories. In an important paper [ 251 ] , Ward has proven a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between gauge equivalence classes of self-dual Yang-Mills\nfields on complexified four-dimensional space-time and equivalence\nclasses of holomorphic vector bundles over twistor space which obey\ncertain triviality conditions. Upon imposing additional conditions on\nthe bundles over twistor space, one may also reduce the structure group\nof the bundles on space-time to some real form of the general linear\ngroup and in addition, the discussion to, for instance, an Euclidean\nsetting. Furthermore, replacing twistor space by ambitwistor space \u2013 the\nspace of complex light rays (null lines) in complexified\nfour-dimensional Minkowski space \u2013 one can discuss general Yang-Mills\nfields, as well. In fact, Isenberg et al. [ 124 ] and Witten [ 262 ]\nshowed that it is possible to represent gauge equivalence classes of\nsolutions to the full Yang-Mills equations in terms of equivalence\nclasses of certain holomorphic vector bundles on formal neighborhoods of\nambitwistor space. Khenkin et al. [ 133 ] discussed a generalization\nthereof by giving an interpretation in terms of certain cohomology\ngroups. A detailed discussion of the cohomology interpretation of\nsolutions to the full Yang-Mills equations can be found in [ 63 , 201 ]\n. Of course, the discussion can also be reduced to real Yang-Mills\nfields and to, e.g., Minkowski space-time. A map between gauge\nequivalence classes of solutions to Yang-Mills equations on some\nspace-time and equivalence classes of holomorphic vector bundles over a\ntwistor space associated with the space-time under consideration is\ncalled a Penrose-Ward transform [ 171 ] .\n\nFurthermore, in this respect it is also worth mentioning that, by\nconsidering the space of all complex null geodesics of some general\nfour-dimensional complex space-time, one can generalize ambitwistor\nspace to a curved setting. As was shown by LeBrun [ 142 ] , this\n\u201ccurved\u201d ambitwistor space is a five-dimensional complex manifold.\nMoreover, this construction then forms the basis for a twistorial\ndescription of four-dimensional conformal gravity [ 25 , 145 ] .\n\nBesides Penrose-Ward transforms involving the already mentioned twistor\nand ambitwistor spaces, one may establish such correspondences on quite\ngeneric ground. This was considered, e.g., by Eastwood [ 91 ] . In fact,\nsuppose we are given three complex manifolds @xmath , @xmath and @xmath\n, where @xmath is simultaneously fibered over @xmath and @xmath , that\nis, we consider a double fibration of the form\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\ntogether with two suitable holomorphic projections @xmath . Here and in\nthe following, we shall refer to @xmath as space-time, to @xmath as\ncorrespondence space and to @xmath as twistor space, respectively.\nClearly, such a double fibration induces a correspondence between @xmath\nand @xmath , that is, there is a relation between points and subsets in\neither manifold. In particular, a point @xmath gives a submanifold\n@xmath , and conversely a point in twistor space, @xmath , yields a\nsubmanifold @xmath embedded into space-time @xmath . In addition, this\ncorrespondence can be used to transfer data given on @xmath to data on\n@xmath and vice versa. Indeed, given some analytic object, Ob @xmath ,\non twistor space (e.g., certain cohomology classes or holomorphic vector\nbundles), one may relate it to some object Ob @xmath on space-time. The\nlatter will be constrained by certain partial differential equations\nsince by definition, the pull-back @xmath Ob @xmath must be constant\nalong the fibers of @xmath . Under suitable topological conditions, the\nmaps\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ndefine a bijection between equivalence classes @xmath Ob @xmath and\n@xmath Ob @xmath (in general, the objects under consideration will only\nbe defined up to equivalence). The correspondence thus established gives\na way of studying objects on space-time obeying differential equations\nin terms of objects on twistor space which are \u201cfree\u201d of such\ndifferential constraints. As before, we shall refer to such a map as\nPenrose-Ward transform.\n\nSuppose now that the objects in question are holomorphic vector bundles.\nIf we let @xmath be the sheaf of relative differential one-forms on the\ncorrespondence space, i.e., the dual of the vertical tangent vectors\nspanning the tangent spaces of @xmath , we have the following theorem [\n91 ] :\n\nTheorem. Suppose the fibers of @xmath are simply connected and @xmath is\ncompact and connected for all @xmath . If in addition @xmath , then\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of\nholomorphic vector bundles @xmath being holomorphically trivial on any\n@xmath , equivalence classes of holomorphic vector bundles on @xmath\nequipped with flat relative connection and equivalence classes of\nholomorphic vector bundles @xmath equipped with a connection flat on\neach @xmath for @xmath .\nIn particular, if @xmath is twistor space then @xmath and the\nsubmanifolds @xmath represent isotropic two-planes in complexified\nMinkowski space. In case of ambitwistor space, one has @xmath and @xmath\nare complex light rays. To jump ahead of our story a bit, such double\nfibrations and correspondences between vector bundles will play the\nbasis of all the discussion presented in this thesis.\n\nThe twistor approach to field theories also provides a suitable\nframework for studying certain supersymmetric field theories. One simply\nneeds to replace the manifolds appearing in double fibrations like the\none discussed above, by so-called supermanifolds. Originally, the\nconcept of supermanifolds goes back to the work by Berezin, Kostant and\nLeites [ 44 , 137 , 156 ] . The idea is basically to define a\nsupermanifold as a particular ringed space @xmath , that is, a\ntopological space @xmath together with a sheaf of supercommutative rings\n@xmath (the structure sheaf) obeying certain local properties. A\nthorough description of supermanifolds, as proposed by the above\nauthors, has been developed by Manin [ 166 ] . In our subsequent\ndiscussion, we shall adopt this approach to supermanifolds. Let us also\nmention that there are alternative ways to introduce supermanifolds. For\ninstance, a different one has been given by DeWitt [ 77 ] . \u00b9 \u00b9 1 There\nis another, third approach due to Rogers [ 217 ] . It is based on the\nconcept of supernumbers which are elements of a certain Gra\u00dfmann\nalgebra. We refer also to the book by Bartocci et al. [ 24 ] (and\nreferences therein), where all existing approaches are described and\ncompared among each other.\n\nAs indicated above, the twistor approach facilitates the studies of\nsupersymmetric field theories. For instance, by combining the ideas of\nformal neighborhoods with those of supermanifolds, Witten has shown [\n262 ] that it is possible to recover the full @xmath super Yang-Mills\ntheory in four dimensions by discussing holomorphic vector bundles over\na certain superambitwistor space, which we shall denote by @xmath . In\nfact, @xmath is the space of super light rays @xmath in complexified\n@xmath Minkowski superspace @xmath . Furthermore, it can be viewed as a\ncertain degree two hypersurface in the direct product @xmath . In this\nrespect, it is also important to stress that the @xmath and @xmath\ntheories are physically equivalent. The only thing appearing to be\ndifferent is that the @xmath formulation makes only the @xmath subgroup\nof the R-symmetry group @xmath manifest. In this sense, Witten\u2019s\napproach can be understood as a twistorial formulation of @xmath super\nYang-Mills theory. Furthermore, Manin [ 166 ] generalized Witten\u2019s\ndiscussion to theories with less supersymmetry. In particular, he\nestablished a Penrose-Ward transform between solutions to the @xmath\n-extended super Yang-Mills equations and holomorphic vector bundles over\n@xmath -extended superambitwistor space \u2013 the space parametrizing super\nlight rays @xmath in @xmath \u2013 which admit an extension to a @xmath -th\nformal neighborhood in superambitwistor space.\n\nThe twistor string\n\nWithin the last three years, the twistorial studies of supersymmetric\nfield theories received a somewhat unexpected renaissance due to string\ntheory. In 2003, Witten [ 266 ] proposed a string theory whose target\nmanifold is the supertwistor space @xmath . His idea is based on three\nfacts: i) holomorphic vector bundles over twistor space and similarly\nover supertwistor space are related to gauge and, respectively, super\ngauge theories on four-dimensional space-time, ii) supertwistor space\n@xmath is a Calabi-Yau supermanifold, that is, its first Chern class\nvanishes and in addition it admits a Ricci-flat metric and iii) the\nexistence of a string theory \u2013 the open topological B model \u2013 whose\nspace-time effective action is holomorphic Chern-Simons theory [ 264 ] .\nMore specifically, Witten showed that the open topological B model on\nsupertwistor space @xmath with a stack of @xmath D5-branes \u00b2 \u00b2 2 These\nD5-branes are not quite space-filling and defined by the condition that\nall open string vertex operators do not depend on antiholomorphic\nGra\u00dfmann coordinates on @xmath . is equivalent to holomorphic\nChern-Simons theory on the same space. This theory describes holomorphic\nstructures on a rank @xmath complex vector bundle @xmath over @xmath\nwhich are given by the (0,1) part @xmath of a connection one-form @xmath\non @xmath . The components of @xmath appear as the excitations of open\nstrings ending on the D5-branes. Furthermore, the spectrum of physical\nstates contained in @xmath is the same as that of @xmath super\nYang-Mills theory, but the interactions of both theories differ. In\nfact, by analyzing the linearized [ 266 ] and the full [ 207 ] field\nequations, it was shown that holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on @xmath\nis equivalent to @xmath self-dual super Yang-Mills theory in four\ndimensions as introduced by Siegel [ 232 ] . Note that this theory can\nbe considered as a truncation of the full @xmath super Yang-Mills\ntheory.\n\nIt was conjectured by Witten that perturbative amplitudes of full @xmath\nsuper Yang-Mills theory are recovered by including into the B model\nso-called D-instantons which wrap certain holomorphic curves in\nsupertwistor space. The presence of these D1-branes leads to additional\nfermionic states from the strings stretching between the D5- and\nD1-branes. Scattering amplitudes are then computed in terms of currents\nconstructed from these additional fields, which localize on the\nD1-branes, by integrating certain correlation functions over the moduli\nspace of these D1-branes in @xmath . This proposal generalizes an\nearlier construction of maximally helicity-violating amplitudes by Nair\n[ 185 ] . Thus, by incorporating D1-branes into the topological B model,\none can complement @xmath self-dual super Yang-Mills theory to the full\ntheory. However, soon after this proposal it was realized that this\nconstruction works only at tree-level, as already at one-loop level\namplitudes of super Yang-Mills theory mix with those of conformal\nsupergravity [ 49 ] . Recently, Boels et al. [ 57 ] proposed a twistor\napproach to @xmath super Yang-Mills theory which reproduces perturbative\nYang-Mills theory without conformal supergravity. \u00b3 \u00b3 3 In [ 6 ] , a\nfamily of twistor string theories has been constructed yielding Einstein\nsupergravity coupled to super Yang-Mills theory on space-time. For\nrelated papers regarding twistor actions, see also Refs. [ 173 , 174 ] .\nAfter all, twistor string theory resulted in striking advances in\ncomputing gauge theory scattering amplitudes \u2013 even beyond tree-level,\nas powerful methods inspired by the twistor string have been developed;\nsee, e.g., Ref. [ 65 , 272 ] for reviews and also [ 159 ] for more\nreferences.\n\nIn addition to twistor string theory on supertwistor space, Witten [ 266\n] also mentioned the possibility of formulating a twistor string theory,\ni.e., the open topological B model on the superambitwistor space which\nis associated with @xmath complexified Minkowski superspace. Within such\na formulation, no D-instantons would be needed as already at classical\nlevel, holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on superambitwistor space gives\nthe full @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) super Yang-Mills theory in four\ndimensions [ 262 ] . Therefore, the mechanism for reproducing\nperturbative super Yang-Mills theory would be completely different\ncompared to the supertwistor space approach. However, even though this\nparticular superambitwistor space is a Calabi-Yau supermanifold, it is\nnot entirely clear how to formulate the B model on it. This is basically\nbecause of the difficulty in making sense of an appropriate measure on\nthis space. Only recently, some progress in this direction has been made\nby Mason et al. [ 174 ] . Therein, the authors formulated a Chern-Simons\ntype theory (whose interpretation on four-dimensional space-time is\nsuper Yang-Mills theory) on a certain codimension @xmath Cauchy-Riemann\nsubmanifold in superambitwistor space. Their description is based on\nEuclidean signature (instead of Minkowski signature) but as far as\nperturbation theory is concerned, this would not be of importance.\n\nSince Witten\u2019s proposal, a variety of questions associated with\nsupertwistor theory and twistor string theory has been investigated. For\ninstance, an interesting property of Calabi-Yau supermanifolds is that\nYau\u2019s theorem does not apply, that is, a K\u00e4hler supermanifold with\nvanishing first Chern class does not automatically admit a Ricci-flat\nmetric. This fact was already observed by Sethi [ 229 ] and after\nWitten\u2019s paper explored in more detail by the authors of [ 215 , 274 ,\n216 , 222 , 157 ] . Another direction triggered by twistor string theory\nis the discussion of mirror symmetry between Calabi-Yau supermanifolds.\nFor instance, it has been argued that for a certain limit of the K\u00e4hler\nmoduli, supertwistor space @xmath and superambitwistor space @xmath are\nmirror manifolds [ 186 , 7 ] . For further surveys on this material, we\nrefer to [ 140 , 8 , 34 , 199 , 214 , 141 ] . Furthermore, various other\ntarget spaces for twistor string theory have been discussed by the\nauthors of [ 208 , 222 , 188 , 103 , 73 , 223 , 74 , 210 , 155 ] leading\nto, e.g., certain dimensional reductions of self-dual super Yang-Mills\nand full super Yang-Mills theories. Moreover, alternative formulations\nof twistor string theories have been proposed in Refs. [ 47 , 48 , 234 ,\n154 , 22 ] . In addition, issues related to gravity were investigated,\nas well. See, e.g., [ 102 , 9 , 10 , 28 , 56 , 2 , 5 , 6 ] . For other\naspects, see also Refs. [ 1 , 235 , 139 , 227 , 225 , 228 ] .\n\nIntegrability\n\nBesides twistor string theory, @xmath super Yang-Mills theory appears to\nbe connected with another string theory. Approximately ten years ago, a\ncorrespondence \u2013 nowadays known as AdS\/CFT correspondence \u2013 was\ndiscovered. Maldacena conjectured an equivalence between @xmath super\nYang-Mills theory in four dimensions and type IIB superstring theory on\nthe curved background AdS @xmath [ 164 , 106 , 265 ] . Besides matching\nof global symmetries, this conjecture claims full dynamical agreement of\nboth theories. For instance, one of the statements is that the spectrum\nof the scaling dimensions of the gauge theory should coincide with the\nenergy spectrum of the string states. However, due to the weak-strong\nnature of this correspondence, that is, the weak coupling regime of\neither theory gets mapped to the strong coupling regime of the other, it\nis extremely difficult to test or rather prove this conjecture.\nTherefore, one is searching for appropriate tools which may help to\nclarify this relation on general grounds.\n\nOne such tool which emerged in recent years is integrability. As already\nindicated, @xmath super Yang-Mills theory appears to be integrable at\nclassical level in the sense of admitting a certain twistor formulation\n(thus yielding a Lax pair formulation). Quantum integrable structures in\n@xmath super Yang-Mills theory have first been discovered by Minahan et\nal. [ 182 ] being inspired by the work of Berenstein et al. [ 42 ] . \u2074 \u2074\n4 For an ealier account of integrable structures in QCD, see, e.g.,\nRefs. [ 158 , 94 , 35 , 61 , 36 , 37 ] . They found that the planar\ndilatation operator, which measures the planar scaling dimension of\nlocal operators, in a certain sector of the theory can be interpreted at\none-loop level as Hamiltonian of an integrable quantum spin chain. Based\non this observation, it has then been shown that it is indeed possible\nto interpret the complete one-loop dilatation operator as Hamiltonian of\nan integrable quantum spin chain; see, e.g., [ 30 , 38 ] and references\ntherein. For discussions beyond leading order, see also [ 29 , 39 , 236\n, 32 , 175 , 197 , 43 , 33 , 275 , 99 , 93 , 40 ] . Another development\npointing towards integrable structures was initiated by Bena et al. [ 41\n] . Their investigation is based on the observation that the\nGreen-Schwarz formulation of the superstring on AdS @xmath can be\ninterpreted as a coset theory, where the fields take values in the\nsupercoset space\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n[ 181 , 132 , 218 ] . Although this is not a symmetric space (the\ndenominator group is too small) [ 165 ] , this coset theory admits an\ninfinite set of conserved nonlocal charges, quite similar to those that\nexist in two-dimensional field theories. \u2075 \u2075 5 These charges were also\nindependently found by Polyakov [ 200 ] . For the construction of\nnonlocal conserved charges in two-dimensional sigma models, we refer to\n[ 161 , 162 ] . Such charges are in turn related to Kac-Moody algebras [\n80 , 82 , 230 ] and generate Yangian algebras [ 78 , 79 ] as has been\ndiscussed, e.g., in [ 51 ] . For reviews of Yangian algebras see Refs. [\n52 , 163 ] . Some time later, the construction of an analogous set of\nnonlocal conserved charges using the pure spinor formulation of the\nsuperstring [ 45 , 46 , 246 ] on AdS @xmath was given in [ 247 ] . For\nfurther developments, we refer the reader to Refs. [ 11 , 18 , 119 , 19\n, 110 , 50 , 238 , 31 , 12 , 273 , 72 , 97 , 98 , 13 , 167 , 131 , 111 ,\n219 , 55 ] , for example. \u2076 \u2076 6 See also Refs. [ 100 , 60 , 136 , 237 ]\n. Clearly, the question that arises of what could be the charges in\nsuper Yang-Mills theory. Within the spin chain approach, Dolan et al. [\n83 , 84 , 85 ] related these nonlocal charges for the superstring to a\ncorresponding set of nonlocal charges in the superconformal gauge theory\nin the extreme weak coupling limit (see also [ 17 , 15 , 183 , 16 ] ).\n\nOutline and main results\n\nThis thesis is devoted to studying different questions related to\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. The main tool we shall be using is\ntwistor theory.\n\nIn the first chapter, we begin by reviewing some of the basic aspects\nand properties of twistor spaces which correspond to flat space-times.\nNo prior knowledge of twistor geometry is assumed. The unifying\nframework for our discussion is complex flag manifolds, which are\nnatural generalizations of complex projective spaces. Furthermore, after\nhaving presented the concepts of supermanifolds, supervector bundles,\netc., we explain the extension of twistor geometry to supertwistor\ngeometry. As otherwise it would carry us too far afield from the main\nthread of development, we present the material only to that extent which\nis of need in later applications. For detailed expositions on the\nsubject, we refer to the books [ 121 , 166 , 171 , 196 , 259 ] .\n\nIn the second chapter, we give a first application by discussing\nself-dual super Yang-Mills theory and some related self-dual models. In\nparticular, we start by describing the equivalence of the \u010cech and\nDolbeault approaches to holomorphic vector bundles over supermanifolds.\nThis lies somehow in the heart of the twistor approach to gauge\ntheories. After that, we give a detailed explanation of the Penrose-Ward\ntransform for @xmath -extended self-dual super Yang-Mills theory\nincluding appropriate superfield expansions, etc. By replacing\nsupertwistor space by certain weighted projective superspaces, we\ndevelop Penrose-Ward transforms for truncations of self-dual super\nYang-Mills theories. As the spaces under consideration will always be\nCalabi-Yau supermanifolds, we are also able to write down appropriate\naction principles. The discussion of the second part of this chapter is\nbased on the work done together with Alexander Popov [ 208 ] .\n\nThe third chapter is devoted to the twistor construction of certain\nsupersymmetric Bogomolny models in three space-time dimensions. In [ 73\n] , it was shown that scattering amplitudes of @xmath super Yang-Mills\ntheory which are localized on holomorphic curves in supertwistor space\ncan be reduced to amplitudes of @xmath super Yang-Mills theory in three\ndimensions which are localized on holomorphic curves in a supersymmetric\nextension of mini-twistor space. Note that the simplest of such curves\nin mini-twistor space is the Riemann sphere which coincides with the\nspectral curve of the BPS @xmath monopole. Note also that every static\n@xmath monopole of charge @xmath may be constructed from an algebraic\ncurve in mini-twistor space [ 113 ] , and an @xmath monopole is defined\nby @xmath such holomorphic curves [ 184 ] . The corresponding string\ntheory after this reduction is the topological B model on\nmini-supertwistor space with @xmath not quite space-filling D3-branes\n(defined analogously to the D5-branes in the six-dimensional case) and\nadditional D1-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles in mini-supertwistor\nspace. It is reasonable to assume that the latter correspond to\nmonopoles and substitute the D-instantons in the case of supertwistor\nspace. In [ 73 ] , also a twistor string theory corresponding to a\ncertain massive super Yang-Mills theory in three dimensions was\ndescribed. The target space of the underlying B model is a Calabi-Yau\nsupermanifold obtained from mini-supertwistor space by a deformation of\nits complex structure. The goal of this chapter is to complement the\ndiscussion given in [ 73 ] . In particular, we show that the B model\nwith only the D3-branes included corresponds to a field theory on\nmini-supertwistor space obtained by a reduction of holomorphic\nChern-Simons theory on supertwistor space. We show that this field\ntheory is a holomorphic BF-type theory \u2077 \u2077 7 These theories were\nintroduced in [ 206 ] and considered, e.g., in [ 126 , 27 ] . which in\nturn is equivalent to a supersymmetric Bogomolny model. This model can\nbe understood as the BPS equations of @xmath super Yang-Mills theory in\nthree dimensions. The action functional of holomorphic BF theory on\nmini-supertwistor space is not of Chern-Simons type, but one can\nintroduce a Chern-Simons type action on the correspondence space of\nmini-supertwistor space. This space admits a so-called Cauchy-Riemann\nstructure. After enlarging the integrable distribution defining this\nCauchy-Riemann structure by one real direction to a distribution @xmath\n, one is led to the notion of @xmath -flat vector bundles over the\ncorrespondence space. These bundles take over the role of holomorphic\nvector bundles, and they can be defined by a @xmath -flat connection\none-form @xmath [ 213 ] . The condition of @xmath -flatness of @xmath\ncan be derived as the equations of motion of a theory we shall call\npartially holomorphic Chern-Simons theory. This theory can be obtained\nby a dimensional reduction of holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on\nsupertwistor space. We prove that there are one-to-one correspondences\nbetween equivalence classes of holomorphic vector bundles subject to\ncertain triviality conditions over mini-supertwistor space, equivalence\nclasses of @xmath -flat vector bundles over the correspondence space and\ngauge equivalence classes of solutions to supersymmetric Bogomolny\nequations in three dimensions. In other words, the moduli spaces of all\nthree theories are bijective. By deforming the complex structure on\nmini-supertwistor space, which in turn induces a deformation of the\nCauchy-Riemann structure on the correspondence space, we obtain a\nsimilar correspondence but with additional mass terms for fermions and\nscalars in the supersymmetric Bogomolny equations. The twistorial\ndescription of the supersymmetric Bogomolny equations has the nice\nfeature of yielding novel methods for constructing explicit solutions.\nFor simplicity, we restrict our discussion to solutions where only\nfields with helicity @xmath and a Higgs field are nontrivial. The\ncorresponding Abelian configurations give rise to the Dirac\nmonopole-antimonopole systems. For the non-Abelian case, we present two\nways of constructing solutions: first, by using a dressed version of the\nPenrose transform and second, by considering a nilpotent deformation of\nthe holomorphic vector bundle corresponding to an arbitrary seed\nsolution of the ordinary Bogomolny equations. The third chapter is based\non the work done together with Alexander Popov and Christian S\u00e4mann [\n210 ] .\n\nThe fourth chapter deals with a discussion of full super Yang-Mills\ntheories on four-dimensional space-time. In particular, we review\nWitten\u2019s [ 262 ] and Manin\u2019s [ 166 ] constructions of Penrose-Ward\ntransforms relating gauge equivalence classes of solutions to the @xmath\n-extended super Yang-Mills equations to certain equivalence classes of\nholomorphic vector bundles over superambitwistor space which admit an\nextension to a @xmath -th order formal neighborhood.\n\nAs indicated above, there exist infinitely many nonlocal conserved\ncharges in @xmath super Yang-Mills theory. So far, they have been\nformulated within the spin chain approach [ 83 , 84 , 85 ] which is\nperturbative in nature. Note that field theoretic expressions for these\ncharges at zero \u2019t Hooft coupling are known and were also given in [ 83\n, 84 ] . It is therefore reasonable to consider the problem of\nconstructing such charges from first principles. As a modest step, one\nmay first study a simplification of the theory \u2013 namely its self-dual\ntruncation. It will be the purpose of the fifth chapter to use twistor\ntheory for studying infinite-dimensional algebras of hidden symmetries\nin @xmath -extended self-dual super Yang-Mills theories. Here, we\ngeneralize the results known for the self-dual Yang-Mills equations [\n198 , 69 , 70 , 71 , 244 , 81 , 75 , 202 , 204 , 205 , 125 , 171 ] . In\nparticular, we will first consider deformation theory of holomorphic\nvector bundles over supertwistor space. Using the Penrose-Ward\ntransform, we relate these infinitesimal deformations to symmetries of\nthe self-dual super Yang-Mills equations. After some general words on\nRiemann-Hilbert problems, hidden symmetries and related algebras and\nusing also a cohomological classification, we exemplify our discussion\nby constructing Kac-Moody symmetries which come from affine extensions\nof the gauge algebra. In addition, we consider affine extensions of the\nsuperconformal algebra to obtain super Kac-Moody-Virasoro-type\nsymmetries. The existence of such algebras originates from the fact that\nthe full group of continuous transformations acting on the space of\nholomorphic vector bundles over supertwistor space is a semi-direct\nproduct of the group of local holomorphic automorphisms of the\nsupertwistor space and of the group of one-cochains with respect to a\ncertain covering with values in the sheaf of holomorphic maps of\nsupertwistor space into the gauge group. See [ 204 ] for a discussion in\nthe purely bosonic setting. By focusing on a certain Abelian subalgebra\nof the affinely extended superconformal algebra, we introduce a family\nof generalized supertwistor spaces. These manifolds, being parametrized\nby certain integers, then allow us to introduce truncated self-dual\nsuper Yang-Mills hierarchies. Such a hierarchy consists of a finite\nsystem of partial differential equations, where the self-dual super\nYang-Mills equations are embedded in. The lowest level flows of such a\nhierarchy represent space-time translations. Furthermore, one may also\nconsider the asymptotic limit to obtain the full hierarchy. Indeed, the\nexistence of such a hierarchy allows us to embed a given solution into\nan infinite-parameter family of new solutions. This generalizes the\nresults known for the self-dual Yang-Mills equations [ 169 , 241 , 170 ,\n4 , 127 , 171 ] . We remark that such symmetries of the latter equations\nare intimately connected with one-loop maximally helicity violating\namplitudes [ 23 , 66 , 67 , 220 , 104 ] . As for certain values of the\nparameters the generalized supertwistor spaces become Calabi-Yau, we are\nalso able to give action principles for the truncated hierarchies. In\naddition, we also construct infinitely many nonlocal conservation laws\nin self-dual super Yang-Mills theory which are associated with the\nsymmetries in question (see [ 4 ] in the context of the self-dual\nYang-Mills hierarchy). The discussion of the fifth chapter is based on [\n269 , 270 ] .\n\nFinally, we give a short summary of the results derived in this thesis\nand close with an outlook.\n\nConventions\n\nIn the sequel, we shall be using the standard abbreviations YM theory\nand SYM theory for Yang-Mills theory and super Yang-Mills theory,\nrespectively. We also abbreviate holomorphic Chern-Simons theory by hCS\ntheory. In addition, the reader may find a list with symbols which are\nmost frequently used throughout this work at the end of this thesis.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nI apologize in advance to those people whose names were either mentioned\nincorrectly or not mentioned at all.

The material is presented only to that extent\nwhich is needed in later applications. For pedagogical reasons, we begin\nwith ordinary twistor geometry. As we will be discussing the twistorial\napproach to supersymmetric field theories, we need to generalize this\nframework to also include so-called supermanifolds \u2013 manifolds\nparametrized by @xmath -graded coordinates. We will shortly realize,\nhowever, that for developing these generalizations, it is necessary to\nwork in a bit more abstract mathematical setting. In due course, we\ntherefore also present some definitions and notions to simplify\nunderstanding. The reader unfamiliar with the underlying mathematics may\nconsult, e.g., Refs. [ 24 , 105 , 166 , 260 ] . A thorough introduction\ninto twistor geometry can be found in the books [ 121 , 166 , 171 , 196\n, 259 ] .\n\n### 1 Twistor spaces\n\n#### Flag manifolds.\n\nLet us begin by recalling the definition of a flag manifold. Consider\nthe complex space @xmath . Then we define its flag manifolds by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .1)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere the @xmath s are subspaces of @xmath . Typical examples of such\nflag manifolds are the projective space @xmath and the Gra\u00dfmannian\n@xmath . Note that all of these manifolds are compact complex manifolds.\nMoreover, they have an equivalent representation as homogeneous spaces.\nThat is, consider the decomposition\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nof @xmath . The subgroup of @xmath which preserves this decomposition is\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand hence we may give an equivalent definition by the quotient\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .2)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nFrom this it rather straightforwardly follows that their dimensionality\nis given by the formula\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n#### Twistor space.\n\nWe now want to use the notion of flag manifolds to introduce fundamental\ncomplex manifolds considered in twistor geometry. In order to describe\nfield theories in four dimensions, we restrict ourselves to four\ndimensions. So, let @xmath be a fixed complex four-dimensional vector\nspace which we call twistor space. In due course, we shall also endow\n@xmath with various real structures. Furthermore, we have a natural\nfibration in terms of flag manifolds\n\n  -- -- -- -------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .3)\n  -- -- -- -------------------\n\ntogether with the canonical projections @xmath for @xmath . In fact, the\ndouble fibration ( \\thechapter .3 ) is the first in a row of important\ndouble fibrations in twistor geometry we will encounter throughout this\nthesis. We shall now develop some of its basic properties. We follow the\nliterature and define\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .4)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------------------\n\nand call them projective twistor space, compactified complexified\nfour-dimensional space-time and correspondence space, respectively. At\nthis point we stress that Minkowski and Euclidean spaces can naturally\nbe realized as four-dimensional subsets of the complex four-dimensional\nmanifold @xmath (see Ref. [ 259 ] for a detailed discussion). By virtue\nof the double fibration ( \\thechapter .3 ), geometric data is\ntransferred from @xmath to @xmath and vice versa according to the\nsubsequent proposition (see, e.g., [ 259 ] ):\n\n###### Proposition \\thechapter.1.\n\nThere is the following correspondence between points and subsets:\n\n  (i)    point in @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n  ------ ----------------- -------- -----------------\n  (ii)   @xmath            @xmath   point in @xmath\n\n#### Local coordinates.\n\nNext we introduce local coordinates. For this, we let\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .5)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nbe a coordinate mapping for @xmath . The brackets denote, as usual, the\nspan. Then we define a coordinate chart on @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .6)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nWe call @xmath affine complexified four-dimensional space-time. Note\nthat it is simply one of six possible choices of standard coordinate\ncharts for @xmath . Using the projections @xmath , we may naturally\ndefine the affine parts of @xmath and @xmath according to\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .7)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nThen we have\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .8)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nTo see this, let @xmath be homogeneous coordinates on @xmath and @xmath\nas above. Then consider the mapping\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath            \n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nwhich in fact proves ( \\thechapter .8 ).\n\nIt then follows by our above discussion that the projection @xmath is\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .9)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nTherefore, in terms of these coordinates our double fibration (\n\\thechapter .3 ) takes the following form:\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .10)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nAltogether, these considerations allow us to introduce affine\ncoordinates according to:\n\n-   @xmath : @xmath ,\n\n-   @xmath : @xmath and @xmath with @xmath on @xmath , where @xmath\n    denotes the canonical covering of @xmath ,\n\n-   @xmath : @xmath and @xmath ; @xmath , with @xmath and @xmath .\n\nThe last point deserves a little more attention. Let us denote the\ncovering of @xmath by @xmath . On the intersection @xmath the\ncoordinates @xmath satisfy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .11)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHence, the twistor space \u2078 \u2078 8 By a slight abuse of terminology, we\nshall also refer to @xmath as the twistor space. @xmath is a rank two\nholomorphic vector bundle over the Riemann sphere. In more details, it\nis the total space of\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .12)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the hyperplane line bundle (the dual of the\ntautological line bundle) over @xmath . Moreover, the equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .13)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nare also called incidence relations. In a given trivialization,\nholomorphic sections of the bundle @xmath are of the form ( \\thechapter\n.13 ) and are parametrized by the moduli @xmath . In other words, Eqs. (\n\\thechapter .13 ) make Prop. \\thechapter .1. transparent: a fixed point\n@xmath corresponds to a null two-plane @xmath and furthermore, a fixed\npoint @xmath corresponds to a holomorphic embedding of a rational degree\none curve @xmath . To see that these two-planes are indeed null, we\nsolve ( \\thechapter .13 ) for a generic @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .14)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is arbitrary. Here, @xmath denotes a particular solution to\n( \\thechapter .13 ). By recalling that any null four-vector @xmath can\nbe decomposed as @xmath for two generic commuting spinors @xmath and\n@xmath , we have thus shown that @xmath is totally null. Hence, @xmath\nis the space of all null two-planes in @xmath .\n\n#### Remark.\n\nTwo remarks are in order. By definition, the projective twistor space\n@xmath is the same as @xmath . On this space we may introduce\nhomogeneous coordinates @xmath Then consider @xmath , where @xmath is\ndefined by setting @xmath and @xmath . We can cover @xmath by two\ncoordinate patches, say @xmath and @xmath , for which @xmath and @xmath\n, respectively, and introduce the coordinates\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .15)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhich are related on @xmath by ( \\thechapter .11 ). This shows that\n@xmath is biholomorphic to @xmath .\n\nThere is yet another interpretation of @xmath . The Riemann sphere\n@xmath can be emdedded into @xmath . The normal bundle of @xmath inside\n@xmath is @xmath . Kodaira\u2019s theorem on relative deformation theory [\n134 , 135 ] states that if @xmath is a compact complex submanifold of a\ncomplex manifold \u2013 not necessarily compact, and if @xmath , where @xmath\nis the normal sheaf of @xmath in @xmath , then there exists a @xmath\n-parameter family of deformations of @xmath inside @xmath , where @xmath\n. In our example,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand @xmath . \u2079 \u2079 9 We shall often denote a vector bundle and the\ncorresponding sheaf of sections by the same letter; cf. also footnote 12\n. In addition, we shall sometimes write @xmath instead of @xmath .\n\n#### Two other twistor spaces.\n\nAbove, we have introduced (projective) twistor space in terms of a\nparticular double fibration. However, this is not the only possibility\nas there is a variety of other twistor spaces which turn out to be\nextremely important in later applications. In the remainder of this\nsection, we pick two examples which again are based on flag manifolds.\nLet us consider the following two correspondences:\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .16)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nThe space @xmath is, of course, compactified complexified\nfour-dimensional space-time. Note that the space @xmath , that is, the\nspace of all three-dimensional subspaces in @xmath , is naturally dual\nto @xmath as we have a natural duality between lines and hyperplanes in\na vector space. For that reason we call @xmath dual projective twistor\nspace and denote it by @xmath , in the following. The twistor manifold\n@xmath is called projective ambitwistor space as it inherits aspects of\nthe projective and the dual projective twistor spaces. We shall denote\nit by @xmath . Then one can prove the following proposition:\n\n###### Proposition \\thechapter.2.\n\nThere are the following correspondences:\n\n  ----- ------ ----------------- -------- -----------------\n  (a)   (i)    point in @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n        (ii)   @xmath            @xmath   point in @xmath\n  (b)   (i)    point in @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n        (ii)   @xmath            @xmath   point in @xmath\n  ----- ------ ----------------- -------- -----------------\n\nNote that for all these manifolds we have coordinate representations\nsimilar to ( \\thechapter .5 ), and we shall develop a suitable notation\nfor these coordinates as they are needed. We want to conclude this\nsection by stressing that ambitwistor space @xmath can be regarded as a\nsubmanifold in @xmath as there is an embedding\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .17)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nIn fact, @xmath is a degree two hypersurface in @xmath since this\nembedding is given by the zero locus\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .18)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath are homogeneous coordinates on @xmath and @xmath on @xmath\n, respectively. Eq. ( \\thechapter .18 ) is just the orthogonality\nrelation between the vectors characterizing @xmath and the ones\ncharacterizing @xmath , the latters being normal vectors to the\nhyperplanes. The minus sign in ( \\thechapter .18 ) has been chosen for\nconvenience.\n\n### 2 Supermanifolds\n\nSo far, we have discussed twistor spaces in the purely even (bosonic)\nsetting. In the sequel, we extend the discussion to supertwistor spaces.\nTo do this, let us first present some preliminaries.\n\n#### Graded rings and modules.\n\nThe first notions we need are @xmath -rings and modules and some\nrelations among them. So, let @xmath be a @xmath -graded ring, that is,\n@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . We call elements of @xmath even\nand elements of @xmath odd. An element of @xmath is said to be\nhomogeneous if it is either even or odd. The degree (or parity) of a\nhomogeneous element is defined to be zero if it is even and one if it is\nodd, respectively. We denote the degree of a homogeneous element @xmath\nby @xmath ( @xmath for parity). We define the supercommutator, @xmath ,\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .19)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor all homogeneous elements @xmath . The ring @xmath is called\nsupercommutative if the supercommutator vanishes for all of the ring\u2019s\nelements. An important example of such @xmath -graded rings is the\nGra\u00dfmann algebra over @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .20)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwith the @xmath -grading being\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .21)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nAn @xmath -module @xmath is a @xmath -graded bimodule which satisfies\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .22)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor all homogeneous @xmath , @xmath , with @xmath . An additive mapping\nof @xmath -modules, @xmath , is called an even morphism if it preserves\nthe grading and is @xmath -linear. We denote the group of such morphisms\nby @xmath . On the other hand, we call an additive mapping of @xmath\n-modules odd if it reverses the grading, @xmath , and is @xmath -linear,\nthat is, @xmath and @xmath . The group of such morphisms is denoted by\n@xmath . Then we set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand it can be given an @xmath -module structure.\n\nFurthermore, there is a natural mapping @xmath \u2013 called the parity map \u2013\ndefined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .23)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand by requiring that i) addition in @xmath is the same as in @xmath ,\nii) right multiplication by @xmath is the same as in @xmath and iii)\nleft multiplication differs by a sign, i.e., @xmath for @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath . Corresponding to the morphism @xmath , we let @xmath be the\nmorphism which agrees with @xmath as a mapping of sets. Moreover,\ncorresponding to the morphism @xmath , we can find morphisms\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .24)\n              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand hence @xmath . We stress that @xmath is an @xmath -module itself,\nand as such @xmath is, as well. However, @xmath is no longer a @xmath\n-graded ring since @xmath , for instance.\n\nNext we need the notion of free @xmath -modules. A free @xmath -module\nof rank @xmath is defined to be an @xmath -module isomorphic to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .25)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThis has a free system of generators, @xmath of which are even and\n@xmath of which are odd, respectively. We stress that the decomposition\nof @xmath into @xmath and @xmath has, in general, no invariant meaning\nand does not coincide with the decomposition into even and odd parts,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nOnly when @xmath , these decompositions are the same.\n\n#### Supermatrices, supertranspose, supertrace and superdeterminant.\n\nLet @xmath be a supercommutative ring and @xmath be a freely generated\n@xmath -module. Just as in the commutative case, morphisms between free\n@xmath -modules can be given by matrices. The standard matrix format is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .26)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is said to be even (respectively, odd) if @xmath and @xmath\nare filled with even (respectively, odd) elements of the ring while\n@xmath and @xmath are filled with odd (respectively, even) elements.\nFurthermore, @xmath is a @xmath -, @xmath a @xmath -, @xmath a @xmath -\nand @xmath a @xmath -matrix. The set of matrices in standard format with\nelements in @xmath is denoted by @xmath . It forms a @xmath -graded\nmodule which, with the usual matrix multiplication, is naturally\nisomorphic to @xmath . We denote by @xmath the even invertible\nautomorphisms of @xmath .\n\nThe supertranspose of @xmath is defined according to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .27)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the superscript \u201ct\u201d denotes the usual transpose. The\nsupertransposition satisfies @xmath and @xmath .\n\nWe shall use the following definition of the supertrace of @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .28)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nClearly, the supertrace of the supercommutator vanishes and the\nsupertrace of a supertransposed matrix is the same as the supertrace of\nthe matrix one has started with.\n\nFinally, let @xmath . The superdeterminant is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .29)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the right-hand side is well-defined for @xmath and @xmath .\nFurthermore, it belongs to @xmath , that is, to @xmath . The\nsuperdeterminant satisfies also the usual rules,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nfor @xmath .\n\n#### Supermanifolds.\n\nWe have now all necessary ingredients to give the definition of a\nsupermanifold. As it will be most convenient for us, we shall follow\nManin [ 166 ] and consider the graded space approach to supermanifolds.\n\u00b9\u2070 \u00b9\u2070 10 We note that the systematic theory of smooth supermanifolds\ngoes back to the work by Kostant [ 137 ] and Leites [ 156 ] . The idea\nis roughly to extend the structure sheaf of a manifold to a sheaf of\nsupercommutative rings. However, note that there are other approaches\nas, e.g., the one by DeWitt [ 77 , 24 ] (see also [ 68 ] for a review).\nFurthermore, we stress in advance that the subsequent definition will\nnot be the most generic one. For a more general discussion, we refer the\ninterested reader to Ref. [ 166 ] .\n\n###### Definition \\thechapter.1.\n\nA complex supermanifold of complex dimension @xmath is a ringed space\n@xmath , where @xmath is a topological space of real dimension @xmath ,\nand @xmath is a sheaf of supercommutative rings on @xmath such that, if\nwe let @xmath be the ideal subsheaf in @xmath of all nilpotent elements\nin @xmath , the following is fulfilled:\n\n-   @xmath is a complex manifold. \u00b9\u00b9 \u00b9\u00b9 11 Recall that a ringed space\n    @xmath with the property that for each @xmath there is a\n    neighborhood @xmath such that there is a ringed space isomorphism\n    @xmath , where @xmath and @xmath is the sheaf of holomorphic\n    functions on @xmath can be given the structure of a complex\n    manifold. Moreover, any complex manifold arises in this manner.\n\n-    For each point @xmath there is a neighborhood @xmath such that\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n    where @xmath is a locally free sheaf of @xmath -modules of purely\n    even rank @xmath on @xmath and @xmath denotes the exterior algebra,\n    i.e., the tensor algebra modulo the ideal generated by the\n    superanticommutator.\n\nWe shall call @xmath the body of @xmath . If no confusion arises, we\nwill not mention the sheaf @xmath explicitly. The latter is also called\nthe sheaf of holomorphic superfunctions on @xmath or simply structure\nsheaf of the supermanifold. Note that a similar definition can also be\ngiven for differentiable supermanifolds. Furthermore, as for purely even\ncomplex manifolds, it will turn out to be useful to consider the sheaf\n@xmath of smooth complex-valued superfunctions on @xmath , which is\ndefined in a similar fashion. Clearly, @xmath is a subsheaf of @xmath .\nIn the sequel, we shall loosely speak of functions but always mean\nsuperfunctions. Moreover, we will often suppress the explicit appearance\nof the dimensionality and simply write @xmath instead of @xmath .\n\nLet @xmath be local coordinates on @xmath and @xmath be basis sections\nof @xmath . Then @xmath is an even-odd system of coordinates for the\nspace @xmath . Any @xmath can thus be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .30)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is a multiindex and the @xmath s are local functions on\n@xmath .\n\nLet us give a first example of a supermanifold: let @xmath be a rank\n@xmath holomorphic vector bundle over an ordinary complex manifold\n@xmath and @xmath the sheaf of sections of @xmath . @xmath Then @xmath\nis a supermanifold by the very definition, since @xmath is locally free.\nSuch a supermanifold is called globally split. A particular example is\n@xmath defined by @xmath . Note that due to a theorem by Batchelor [ 26\n] , any differentiable supermanifold is globally split. This is\nbasically because of the existence of a partition of unity. The reader\nshould be warned that, in general, complex supermanifolds are not\nglobally split.\n\n#### Vector bundles.\n\nAs for ordinary manifolds, we need the notions of tangent and cotangent\nbundles. Since these are just special vector bundles and in view of our\nlater discussion it is certainly worth stating some more general words\non vector bundles. The idea to define a holomorphic supervector bundle\nover a complex supermanifold @xmath is to use the notion of a locally\nfree sheaf of rank @xmath , which is defined to be a sheaf of @xmath\n-modules locally isomorphic to @xmath . \u00b9\u00b2 \u00b9\u00b2 12 Remember the following\nfact: Let @xmath be a purely even complex manifold. Then there is a\none-to-one correspondence between rank @xmath locally free sheaves\n@xmath of @xmath -modules on @xmath and rank @xmath holomorphic vector\nbundles @xmath over @xmath . In fact, if @xmath is an open covering of\n@xmath and if @xmath trivializes @xmath , then the group of holomorphic\nsections of @xmath over @xmath is @xmath . Conversely, if @xmath is a\nlocally free sheaf of @xmath -modules and if @xmath is the explicit\nisomorphism, then on any @xmath we may define @xmath matrices of\nholomorphic functions according to @xmath which give the transition\nfunctions of a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath . In the following, we\nshall suppress the prefix super: thus, vector bundle means supervector\nbundle. Next let @xmath be a holomorphic mapping of complex\nsupermanifolds, that is, @xmath is defined to be the pair @xmath , where\n@xmath is a continuous mapping of topological spaces and @xmath is a\nmorphism of sheaves of rings: for any open subset @xmath in @xmath there\nis a morphism @xmath . Note that @xmath is also called the zeroth direct\nimage sheaf of the sheaf @xmath . By the pull-back via @xmath of a\nvector bundle @xmath over @xmath , we mean the locally free sheaf of\n@xmath -modules\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .31)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) denotes the topological inverse\nsheaf of @xmath (respectively, of @xmath ). For instance, @xmath is the\nsheaf on @xmath defined by the presheaf\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwith the obvious restriction mappings. It is characterized by the\nproperty that the stalk @xmath for all @xmath . For a complex vector\nbundle, replace @xmath by @xmath .\n\nThe tangent sheaf @xmath of a complex supermanifold @xmath is then the\nsheaf of local vector fields, that is, the superderivations of the ring\nof functions. It is locally free \u2013 in fact, it is a locally free sheaf\nof @xmath -modules \u2013 and of rank equal to the dimension of @xmath . Let\n@xmath be local coordinates on @xmath . Then @xmath is freely generated\nby its sections @xmath . The cotangent sheaf @xmath is defined to be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .32)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is the sheaf of local morphisms from @xmath . There is also\nan obvious differential @xmath with the property @xmath for @xmath .\n\n#### Remark.\n\nIn the sequel, we shall only be dealing with locally free sheaves.\nTherefore, we will often not make any notational distinction between\nsuch sheaves and the vector bundles corresponding to them, and we also\nuse the two objects interchangeably.\n\n### 3 Supertwistor spaces\n\nNow we want to use the above machinery for generalizing the twistor\nspaces of Sec. 1 to supertwistor spaces.\n\n#### Flag supermanifolds.\n\nFor the sake of concreteness, let us consider @xmath . Then we define\nthe flag superspace \u00b9\u00b3 \u00b9\u00b3 13 See also Ref. [ 120 ] . @xmath to be the\nset of all @xmath -tuples @xmath of free submodules of @xmath satisfying\n@xmath and @xmath . This naturally generalizes our definition (\n\\thechapter .1 ). In fact, one can also introduce suitable coordinate\nsystems and thus a suitable structure sheaf which makes this set into a\ncomplex supermanifold. As in the purely even setting, we can give an\nequivalent definition by considering the decomposition\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nof @xmath , where @xmath . Let now @xmath be the unitary automorphisms\nof @xmath . \u00b9\u2074 \u00b9\u2074 14 Hermitian conjugation is defined by composing\nsupertransposition and complex conjugation. The subgroup of @xmath which\npreserves this decomposition is\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand hence we may write the quotient\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .33)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nOne can actually show that @xmath has real dimension @xmath . Then it is\na rather straightforward exercise to determine the dimension of a flag\nsupermanifold. So, we leave it to the interested reader. Note that flag\nsupermanifolds are, in general, not globally split [ 166 ] .\n\n#### Supertwistor space.\n\nSimilarly to our discussion in Sec. 1 , we let @xmath be of the form\n@xmath . We call this space @xmath -extended supertwistor space [ 95 ] .\nThen we introduce\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .34)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThis time we call them projective supertwistor space, compactified\ncomplexified four-dimensional antichiral superspace-time and\ncorrespondence space, respectively. Therefore, the double fibration (\n\\thechapter .3 ) becomes:\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .35)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nNote that @xmath where @xmath is the tautological sheaf on @xmath .\nFurthermore, Prop. \\thechapter .1. generalizes accordingly.\n\n###### Proposition \\thechapter.3.\n\nThere is the following geometric correspondence:\n\n  (i)    point in @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n  ------ ----------------- -------- -----------------\n  (ii)   @xmath            @xmath   point in @xmath\n\nIn the following, we shall abbreviate @xmath for any ordinary manifold\n@xmath . As before, we may introduce local coordinates. Eventually, one\nfinds\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .36)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\ntogether with\n\n-   @xmath : @xmath and @xmath , where @xmath ,\n\n-   @xmath : @xmath , @xmath and @xmath with @xmath on @xmath , where\n    @xmath denotes again the canonical covering of @xmath ,\n\n-   @xmath : @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ; @xmath , with @xmath and\n    @xmath .\n\nAgain, the last point shows that @xmath is a rank @xmath holomorphic\nvector bundle\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .37)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nMoreover, the relations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .38)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nexplicitly say that a fixed point @xmath corresponds to a null @xmath\n-dimensional subspace of @xmath . By analogy with the purely even\nsetting, we shall refer to those as super null planes of dimension\n@xmath in @xmath . Hence, @xmath is the space of super null planes of\n@xmath . On the other hand, a fixed point @xmath corresponds to a\nholomorphic embedding of a rational curve @xmath . Before closing this\nparagraph, we would like to stress that the argumentation of 1 also\napplies here.\n\n#### Two other supertwistor spaces.\n\nAbove, we have introduced the (projective) supertwistor space. Let us\nnow also generalize the other two twistor spaces given in 1 : the dual\nprojective supertwistor space and the projective superambitwistor space,\nrespectively. So, let us consider the following two double fibrations:\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .39)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nThe space @xmath is compactified complexified four-dimensional chiral\nsuperspace-time, which is naturally dual to @xmath . Note also that the\nspace @xmath is naturally dual to @xmath . For that reason we call\n@xmath dual projective supertwistor space and denote it by @xmath .\nFurthermore, @xmath is compactified complexified superspace-time and\nobviously, we have the natural fibration:\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .40)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nThe manifold @xmath is called projective superambitwistor space and we\nshall denote it by @xmath . Then one can show:\n\n###### Proposition \\thechapter.4.\n\nThere are the following correspondences:\n\n  ----- ------ ----------------- -------- -----------------\n  (a)   (i)    point in @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n        (ii)   @xmath            @xmath   point in @xmath\n  (b)   (i)    point in @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n        (ii)   @xmath            @xmath   point in @xmath\n  ----- ------ ----------------- -------- -----------------\n\nNote that for all these manifolds we can construct coordinate\nrepresentations similar to those given in 3 . As before, we shall\ndevelop suitable notation for these coordinates as we need them.\n\nFinally, we want to stress that also the projective superambitwistor\nspace @xmath can be viewed as a degree two hypersurface in @xmath . In\nfact, if we let @xmath be homogeneous coordinates on @xmath and @xmath\non @xmath , respectively, then @xmath is given by @xmath , with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .41)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand @xmath is the ideal subsheaf in @xmath given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .42)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFurthermore, we have abbreviated\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .43)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath , respectively.\n\n### 4 Connections and curvature\n\nSo far, we have been dealing with just supermanifolds and vector\nbundles. Next we want to introduce some additional geometric structure,\nsuch as connections. This will then allow us to talk about curvature and\ncharacteristic classes.\n\n#### Connections and curvature.\n\nAs we have already mentioned in 2 , the notion of a holomorphic vector\nbundle over a complex supermanifold @xmath is equivalent to the notion\nof a locally free sheaf @xmath of @xmath -modules. Then a connection\n@xmath is an even morphism of sheaves\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .44)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nsatisfying the Leibniz formula\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .45)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is a local holomorphic function on @xmath and @xmath is a\nlocal section of @xmath . Let @xmath be local coordinates on @xmath and\n@xmath be generated by @xmath . Therefore,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .46)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand ( \\thechapter .45 ) reads as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .47)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nLocally, @xmath has the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .48)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath .\n\nAs usual, @xmath induces the curvature\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .49)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the exterior algebra, i.e., it is the tensor\nalgebra modulo the ideal generated by the superanticommutator. Here, we\nhave just introduced one version of a holomorphic de Rham complex on\nsupermanifolds. There are other possible ways; see, e.g., Ref. [ 166 ]\nfor details. Note that the above definitions carry naturally over to\ncomplex vector bundles.\n\n#### Integral forms and Berezin integral.\n\nIn the purely even setting, differential forms are objects which can be\nintegrated over. However, in the case of supermanifolds, the situation\nis more subtle. First, let us introduce the holomorphic Berezinian. Let\n@xmath be a complex supermanifold with tangent sheaf @xmath . The\nholomorphic Berezinian line bundle, @xmath , or holomorphic Berezinian\nfor short, is defined to be the line bundle over @xmath having\nholomorphic super Jacobians as transition functions. Thus, it can be\nconsidered as the natural extension of the canonical sheaf (sheaf of\nsections of the canonicle bundle) on a purely even complex manifold.\nThen integral forms are defined to be sections of the sheaf\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .50)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThus, @xmath and if @xmath is @xmath dimensional with local coordinates\n@xmath , then @xmath is locally of the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .51)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is some local section of @xmath . Sections of @xmath are\nalso called holomorphic volume forms. A complexification @xmath of\n@xmath splits into a direct sum @xmath . Clearly, this then implies that\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .52)\n                       @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nLet now @xmath be a differentiable supermanifold with local coordinates\n@xmath . Furthermore, suppose that @xmath is connected and given an\norientation. Let @xmath , that is, the volume forms with compact\nsupport. Then @xmath is locally\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .53)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere the @xmath s are local functions on @xmath . We define the Berezin\nintegral as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .54)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFor a more general volume form with compact support, we define the\nintegral by using a partition of unity and the additivity property of\nthe integral. Furthermore, if we let @xmath be the integral @xmath\n-forms with compact support, then such a form can be hooked into a\ndifferential @xmath -form with compact support, i.e., an element of\n@xmath , to give an element of @xmath which, by virtue of the above\nformula, can be integrated over @xmath .\n\n#### Remark.\n\nTwo things are worth mentioning. First of all, integral forms can be\ngiven the structure of a complex, since one may introduce a mapping\n@xmath with @xmath . Therefore, one can discuss cohomology of integral\nforms [ 166 ] . Another issue concerns the integration theory on\nsupermanifolds. In general, one is interested in objects which can be\nintegrated over immersed sub(super)manifolds @xmath of some\nsupermanifold @xmath . One way of doing this is to introduce so-called\n@xmath -densities. They are sections of @xmath , where @xmath is the\ntautological sheaf on the relative Gra\u00dfmannian @xmath . Then if @xmath\nis an immersion of supermanifolds and @xmath a density on @xmath , one\ncan canonically define a volume form @xmath on @xmath . We shall not go\ninto further details at this point and refer the reader to the book by\nManin [ 166 ] for a nice discussion of these aspects. We also refer to\nthe work by Bernstein and Leites [ 53 , 54 ] who generalized the\nintegration theory of volume forms for the first time.\n\n#### Formal Calabi-Yau supermanifolds.\n\nGiven a rank @xmath complex vector bundle @xmath over a complex\nsupermanifold @xmath , we define the @xmath -th Chern class of @xmath to\nbe\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .55)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is (up to an overall factor) the curvature of @xmath . The\nfirst few Chern classes are given by:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .56)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThe total Chern class is then @xmath . Note that in a similar fashion,\none may also introduce the @xmath -th Chern character according to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .57)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nAs in the purely even setting, one may prove the following useful\nresult: for a short exact sequence of complex vector bundles over @xmath\n,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .58)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwe have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .59)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIn particular, this formula yields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .60)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nMore details about Chern classes, Chern characters, etc. can be found,\ne.g., in the book by Bartocci et al. [ 24 ] .\n\nFurthermore, the total Chern class of a complex supermanifold @xmath is\ndefined to be the total Chern class of @xmath . In this case, we shall\nsimply write @xmath . In the purely even case, we have a relation\nbetween the first Chern class of a vector bundle and its determinant\nline bundle. In fact, both agree (up to a sign). The question is whether\nwe have an extension of this relation to our present setting. The analog\nof the determinant line bundle is, as we have already seen above, the\nsuperdeterminant line bundle \u2013 the Berezinian line bundle. Using\nsplitting principle arguments, one may indeed deduce that the first\nChern class of @xmath for some vector bundle @xmath coincides, again up\nto a sign, with the first Chern class of @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .61)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the sign depends on whether @xmath is of rank @xmath or @xmath ,\nrespectively. When talking about @xmath , we shall use our old notation\n@xmath .\n\n###### Definition \\thechapter.2.\n\nLet @xmath be a complex supermanifold. Then @xmath is called a formal\nCalabi-Yau supermanifold if it fulfills the following equivalent\nconditions:\n\n-    The first Chern class of @xmath vanishes.\n\n-    The holomorphic Berezinian of @xmath is trivial.\n\n-    There exists a globally defined and nowhere vanishing holomorphic\n    volume form.\n\nBefore we will discuss some examples, let us point out an important\nissue: in contrast to ordinary Calabi-Yau manifolds, formal Calabi-Yau\nsupermanifolds do not necessarily admit Ricci-flat metrics \u2013 even if one\nassumes compactness. For some expositions on this issue, see Refs. [ 229\n] and [ 215 , 274 , 216 , 222 , 157 ] .\n\nLet us now discuss some examples. First, consider the projective\nsuperspace @xmath with @xmath . To compute the total Chern class @xmath\n, we use the short exact sequence\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .62)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nas we have to take equivalence classes with respect to overall\nrescalings. Here, @xmath denotes the dual tautological sheaf on @xmath .\nNote that the above sequence is nothing but a @xmath -graded extension\nof the Euler sequence. \u00b9\u2075 \u00b9\u2075 15 The proof of ( \\thechapter .62 ) is a\nstraightforward extension of the one given in the purely even setting.\nThe proof of the Euler sequence for @xmath can be found in, e.g., [ 105\n] . Using our relations given in 4 , we find\n\n  -- -- --\n        \n  -- -- --\n\nwhich immediately implies\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand hence\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .63)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath . Thus, we may conclude that our supertwistor space @xmath\nbecomes a formal Calabi-Yau supermanifold if and only if @xmath .\n\nA similar argumentation can be given for superambitwistor space @xmath\nas introduced in 3 . There, it was shown that @xmath can be realized as\na hypersurface in @xmath . Thus, we have a short exact sequence of\nsheaves\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .64)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is the normal sheaf of @xmath in @xmath . In fact, @xmath ,\nwhere @xmath is the ideal subsheaf ( \\thechapter .42 ). \u00b9\u2076 \u00b9\u2076 16 See\nalso our discussion given in 15 . Then a short calculation reveals that\n( \\thechapter .64 ) implies\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .65)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Hence, @xmath is a formal\nCalabi-Yau supermanifold. Furthermore, it has been shown [ 186 , 7 ]\nthat @xmath and @xmath are related in some sense by mirror symmetry. For\nrelated aspects of mirror symmetry see also Refs. [ 140 , 8 , 34 , 199 ,\n214 , 141 ] .\n\nBefore coming to our next topic, let us illustrate a final example given\nby LeBrun [ 146 ] . Let @xmath be some ordinary complex manifold. As we\nhave seen in 2 , @xmath is a complex supermanifold, where @xmath is a\nrank @xmath locally free sheaf of @xmath -modules. The holomorphic\nBerezinian of @xmath is then given by @xmath where @xmath is the\ncanonical sheaf (sheaf of sections of the canonical bundle) on @xmath .\nNext one can show that there is a short exact sequence of @xmath\n-modules on @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .66)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is the sheaf of first-order jets for @xmath . \u00b9\u2077 \u00b9\u2077 17 For\na proof, see, e.g., Ref. [ 166 ] . Let now @xmath be some complex\nthree-dimensional manifold which admits a spin structure. Then @xmath\ncan be extended to a formal Calabi-Yau supermanifold of dimension @xmath\nby setting @xmath since from the above sequence we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nand hence @xmath is trivial. Therefore, we can conclude that @xmath is a\nformal Calabi-Yau supermanifold. For instance, the supertwistor space\n@xmath fits into this construction scheme, since @xmath and hence @xmath\n, as can most easily be deduced from the Euler sequence ( \\thechapter\n.62 ).\n\n### 5 Real structures\n\nUp to now, we have only dealt with complex (super)twistor spaces. In\norder to discuss real gauge theories, that is, gauge theories living on\neither Euclidean or Minkowski spaces (or conformal compactifications\nthereof) with some unitary group as gauge group, we need to put certain\nreal structures on the supertwistor space @xmath and its dual @xmath .\nThis in turn induces real structures on all the supermanifolds appearing\nin our double fibrations. Therefore, our first goal is to choose proper\ncoordinates on @xmath and @xmath as well as on the supermanifolds\nparticipating in ( \\thechapter .40 ). Recall that in 3 and 3 we have\nalready given partial results on this matter.\n\n#### Local coordinates.\n\nIn 3 , we have denoted the coordinates on @xmath by @xmath and on @xmath\nby @xmath , respectively. \u00b9\u2078 \u00b9\u2078 18 In fact, they are just homogeneous\ncoordinates for the projectivized versions. Furthermore, in the same\nparagraph we also discussed the canonical bilinear form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .67)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nas an element of @xmath . Consider the double fibration ( \\thechapter\n.40 ),\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .68)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nand recall that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath . According to 3 , local\ncoordinates on @xmath are @xmath . In a similar fashion, one may take\n@xmath as local coordinates on @xmath . A @xmath -flag in @xmath is the\nsame thing as a pair of @xmath -dimensional subspaces in @xmath and\n@xmath , orthogonal with respect to the bilinear form ( \\thechapter .67\n). Making use of the identifications\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .69)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nas discussed in 3 in the case of the supertwistor space together with\nthe orthogonality relation induced by ( \\thechapter .67 ), we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .70)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere summation over repeated indices is implied. This equation can\ngenerically be solved by, e.g., putting\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .71)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nWe may thus take @xmath as local coordinates on @xmath , with the\nobvious projections @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .72)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nClearly, by virtue of the discussion given in 3 and of the double\nfibration ( \\thechapter .68 ), @xmath are defined on @xmath .\n\n#### Euclidean signature.\n\nAs we shall see in the next chapter, the supertwistor space will play a\nkey role in discussing self-dual SYM theories. As the corresponding\nequations of motion are natural extensions of the self-dual YM\nequations, we are interested in their formulation in an Euclidean\nsetting. Though not being subject of the present discussion, it is also\npossible to formulate them in the case of split signature. For details\nsee, e.g., [ 207 ] .\n\nLet us introduce the @xmath -tensors according to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .73)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich satisfy @xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, define\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .74)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFor the choice @xmath (the most interesting one for our purposes),\nEuclidean signature will be induced by the antiholomorphic involution\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .75)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor the coordinates @xmath on @xmath . Here, summation over repeated\nindices is implied and bar denotes complex conjugation. Note that\nreality of the odd coordinates for Euclidean signature can only be\nimposed if @xmath is even [ 138 , 160 ] ; the @xmath and @xmath cases\nare obtained by suitable truncations of the @xmath case. Furthermore, we\nadopt the convention\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .76)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath are any of the coordinates @xmath . The extension of the\ninvolution @xmath to any holomorphic function @xmath is defined to be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .77)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nUsing ( \\thechapter .75 ) together with the incidence relations (\n\\thechapter .69 ), we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .78)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor the local coordinates @xmath on @xmath . The fixed point set of\nthese involutions then defines antichiral Euclidean superspace @xmath\nwith @xmath . One may choose the following parametrization:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .79)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwith real @xmath . Hence, the metric is of Euclidean type. Note that\nlater on, we shall also choose parametrizations different from (\n\\thechapter .79 ).\n\n#### Minkowski signature.\n\nBesides self-dual SYM theories, we are also interested in full SYM\ntheories which are most interesting when considered on Minkowski\nspace-time. In this situation, the superambitwistor space plays the\ncentral role in the discussion.\n\nMinkowski signature is induced by the antiholomorphic involution\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .80)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\non @xmath , where bar denotes, as before, complex conjugation. This\ntime, however, we choose\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .81)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath are any of the coordinates on @xmath . The extension to\nholomorphic functions is then given analogously as for @xmath .\n\nNext using Eqs. ( \\thechapter .69 ) together with the conditions (\n\\thechapter .71 ), we immediately arrive at\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .82)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe fixed point set\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .83)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\ntogether with the parametrization\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .84)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor real @xmath , yields a metric of Minkowski signature, that is,\n@xmath .\n\n## Chapter \\thechapter Self-dual super gauge theory\n\nA fter these introductory words on (super)twistor spaces, we shall now\ndiscuss a first application. In the introduction we have already seen\nthat the twistor approach to gauge theory involves certain holomorphic\nvector bundles over spaces appearing in a double fibration like (\n\\thechapter .35 ). As is well known, holomorphic vector bundles can be\ndescribed within two different approaches: the \u010cech and the Dolbeault\npictures. Both pictures, however, turn out to be equivalent -- and each\nof it has its own advantages and disadvantages. In the sequel, we shall\nbe using both on equal footing. Therefore, we first describe the\nequivalence of both pictures in a more general setting and then discuss\nas a first example self-dual SYM theory \u00b9\u2079 \u00b9\u2079 19 See Ref. [ 231 , 248 ,\n249 , 250 ] for an earlier account on self-dual SYM theory. and some\nrelated models.\n\n### 6 \u010cech-Dolbeault correspondence\n\n#### \u010cech cochains, cocycles and cohomology.\n\nLet us recall some basic definitions already adopted to complex\nsupermanifolds. Consider a complex supermanifold @xmath with an open\ncovering @xmath . Furthermore, we are interested in smooth maps from\nopen subsets of @xmath into some Lie (super)group @xmath as well as in a\nsheaf @xmath of such @xmath -valued functions. A @xmath -cochain of the\ncovering @xmath with values in @xmath is a collection @xmath of sections\nof the sheaf @xmath over nonempty intersections @xmath . We will denote\nthe set of such @xmath -cochains by @xmath . We stress that it has a\ngroup structure, where the multiplication is just pointwise\nmultiplication.\n\nWe may define the subsets of cocycles @xmath . For example, for @xmath\nthey are given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .1)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------------------\n\nThese sets will be of particular interest. We remark that from the first\nof these two definitions it follows that @xmath coincides with the group\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich is the group of global sections of the sheaf @xmath . Note that in\ngeneral the subset @xmath is not a subgroup of the group @xmath .\n\nWe say that two cocycles @xmath are equivalent if @xmath for some @xmath\n. The set of equivalence classes induced by this equivalence relation is\nthe first (pointed) \u010cech cohomology set and denoted by @xmath . If the\n@xmath s are all Stein \u2013 in case of supermanifolds @xmath we need @xmath\nto be covered by Stein manifolds \u2013 we have the bijection\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .2)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\notherwise one takes the inductive limit. To sum up, we see that, for\ninstance, the elements of @xmath with @xmath classify rank @xmath\nlocally free sheaves of @xmath -modules up to isomorphism. Hence, @xmath\nis the moduli space of holomorphic vector bundles over @xmath with\ncomplex rank @xmath .\n\n#### Dolbeault cohomology.\n\nLet @xmath be a complex supermanifold and consider a rank @xmath complex\nvector bundle @xmath . Furthermore, we let\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .3)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nbe the differential @xmath -forms on @xmath . In spirit of our\ndiscussion given in 4 , we have a natural antiholomorphic exterior\nderivative @xmath . A @xmath -connection on @xmath is defined by a\ncovariant differential\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .4)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nsatisfying the Leibniz formula; see also Eq. ( \\thechapter .45 ).\nLocally, it is of the form\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .5)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath . The complex vector bundle @xmath is said to be\nholomorphic if the @xmath -connection is flat, that is, if the\ncorresponding curvature vanishes,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .6)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nIn other words, @xmath defines a holomorphic structure on @xmath . Note\nthat ( \\thechapter .6 ) is also called equation of motion of holomorphic\nChern-Simons (hCS) theory.\n\nLet @xmath be the sheaf of solutions to ( \\thechapter .6 ). The group\n@xmath , where @xmath , is acting on @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .7)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath , and without changing the holomorphic structure on @xmath\n. Therefore, the Dolbeault cohomology set\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .8)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nparametrizes all different holomorphic structures on the complex vector\nbundle @xmath .\n\n#### Equivalence of \u010cech and Dolbeault pictures.\n\nLet us now show that the above approaches to holomorphic vector bundles\nare actually equivalent. This fact may be understood as a non-Abelian\ngeneralization of Dolbeault\u2019s theorem.\n\n###### Theorem \\thechapter.1.\n\nLet @xmath be a complex supermanifold with an open Stein covering @xmath\nand @xmath be a rank @xmath complex vector bundle over @xmath . Then\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between @xmath and the subset of\n@xmath consisting of those elements of @xmath representing vector\nbundles which are smoothly equivalent to @xmath , i.e.,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath for some @xmath .\n\nProof: Let @xmath be a rank @xmath complex vector bundle represented by\n@xmath . Furthermore, consider the subset of @xmath consisting of those\nelements @xmath obeying\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\non @xmath . Due to Eq. ( \\thechapter .6 ), elements @xmath of @xmath are\nlocally of the form @xmath and glued together according to the above\nformula. Hence, @xmath determines a zero-cochain @xmath with the above\nproperty. This @xmath can in turn be used to define the transition\nfunctions of a rank @xmath holomorphic vector bundle @xmath by setting\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nthat is, @xmath . Clearly, the bundle @xmath defined by this @xmath is\nsmoothly equivalent to @xmath . Conversely, given @xmath as transition\nfunctions of a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath which is smoothly\nequivalent to @xmath , the @xmath s can always be written in the above\nform and hence, one can reconstruct a differential @xmath -form @xmath\nsuch that @xmath .\n\nBijectivity is shown by virtue of a short exact sequence of sheaves\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is defined on any open subset @xmath on @xmath by @xmath\nwith @xmath . The map @xmath sends @xmath to @xmath which by\nconstruction vanishes. The above sequence induces an exact sequence of\ncohomology sets\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nBy definition, @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) parametrizes holomorphic\n(respectively, smooth) vector bundles over @xmath . The kernel of @xmath\ncoincides with the subset of @xmath whose elements are mapped into the\nclass of @xmath representing holomorphic vector bundles which are\nsmoothly equivalent to @xmath . By virtue of the exactness of the\ncohomology sequence, we find\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n@xmath\n\n#### Remark.\n\nIn the following, we shall mostly be interested in complex vector\nbundles which are trivial as smooth bundles. Furthermore, we also\nrestrict our discussion to rank @xmath complex vector bundles, although\nit straightforwardly generalizes to rank @xmath .\n\n### 7 Self-dual super Yang-Mills theory\n\nSubject of this section is the discussion of @xmath -extended self-dual\nSYM theory. We first present the \u010cech approach to holomorphic vector\nbundles over supertwistor space and derive in this setting the field\nequations of self-dual SYM theory on four-dimensional space-time.\nSecond, we reconsider the whole discussion in the Dolbeault picture. The\nlatter then also allows us to formulate appropriate action principles\nfor both, hCS theory on supertwistor space and self-dual SYM theory on\nEuclidean four-dimensional space in the case of maximal supersymmetry,\nthat is, for @xmath .\n\n#### Penrose-Ward transform.\n\nLet us consider the double fibration ( \\thechapter .36 ) and recall that\n@xmath , i.e.,\n\n  -- -- -- -------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .9)\n  -- -- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is the supertwistor space given by ( \\thechapter .37 ) and\n@xmath . Recall also the form of the two projections @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .10)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nWe denote the coverings of @xmath and @xmath by @xmath and @xmath ,\nrespectively. Consider a rank @xmath holomorphic vector bundle @xmath\nand its pull-pack @xmath as defined in 2 . These bundles are\ncharacterized by the transition functions @xmath on the intersection\n@xmath and @xmath on @xmath . For notational simplicity, we shall use\nthe same letter, @xmath , for the transition functions of both bundles\nin the following course of discussion. By definition of a pull-back,\n@xmath is constant along @xmath . The relative tangent sheaf \u00b2\u2070 \u00b2\u2070 20 If\none has a fibration @xmath , the relative tangent sheaf @xmath (sheaf of\nvertical vector fields) is defined by the following short exact\nsequence: @xmath @xmath is of rank @xmath and freely generated by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .11)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHere, we have again abbreviated @xmath and @xmath . In the sequel, we\nshall write @xmath . \u00b2\u00b9 \u00b2\u00b9 21 Here, we have just introduced the letter\n@xmath as abbreviation for the relative tangent sheaf. However, it can\nbe put in a general context of integrable distributions as subsheaves of\nthe tangent sheaf. See 10 for details. Therefore, the transition\nfunctions of @xmath are annihilated by the vector fields ( \\thechapter\n.11 ). Letting @xmath and @xmath be the anti-holomorphic parts of the\nexterior derivatives on the supertwistor space and its correspondence\nspace, respectively, we have @xmath . Hence, the transition functions of\n@xmath are also annihilated by @xmath .\n\nAs indicated, we assume that the bundle @xmath is smoothly trivial and\nmoreover @xmath -trivial, that is, holomorphically trivial when\nrestricted to any projective line @xmath . These conditions imply that\nthere exists some smooth @xmath -valued functions @xmath , which define\ntrivializations of @xmath over @xmath , such that @xmath can be\ndecomposed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .12)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .13)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNote that in particular this formula implies that the @xmath s depend\nholomorphically on @xmath . Applying the vector fields ( \\thechapter .11\n) to ( \\thechapter .12 ), we realize that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nmust be \u2013 by an extension of Liouville\u2019s theorem \u2013 at most linear in\n@xmath . Therefore, we may introduce a Lie-algebra valued one-form\n@xmath which has components only along @xmath , such that\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .14)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nIn fact, @xmath defines a relative connection\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .15)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich is flat. Here, @xmath are the relative differential one-forms on\nthe correspondence space.\n\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .14 ) can be rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .16)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThe compatibility conditions for this linear system read as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .17)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere we have defined the covariant derivatives\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .18)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .17 ) are the constraint equations of @xmath\n-extended self-dual SYM theory. Note that the first of those equations\nrepresents the self-duality equation for the gauge potential @xmath ,\nsince\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .19)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) is symmetric in its indices.\nFurthermore, @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) represents the\nanti-self-dual (respectively, the self-dual) part of the field strength.\nBy virtue of ( \\thechapter .17 ), the anti-self-dual part is put to\nzero.\n\nNext let us briefly discuss how to obtain the functions @xmath in (\n\\thechapter .16 ) from a given gauge potential. Formally, a solution is\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .20)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHere, \u201c @xmath \u201d denotes the path-ordering symbol and\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .21)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe contour @xmath is any real curve within an isotropic two-plane\n@xmath from a point @xmath to a point @xmath , with\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .22)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nfor @xmath ; the choice of the contour plays no role, since the\ncurvature is zero when restricted to the two-plane. Furthermore, @xmath\nare some free parameters.\n\nIn 5 , we introduced an antiholomorphic involution @xmath corresponding\nto Euclidean signature. Upon extending this involution to @xmath , that\nis, upon requiring\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .23)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere dagger denotes Hermitian conjugation, one ends up with real\nself-dual SYM fields. In particular, one finds\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .24)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath has been defined in ( \\thechapter .74 ). This reduces the\ngauge group @xmath to the unitary group @xmath . Unless otherwise\nstated, we shall implicitly assume that ( \\thechapter .23 ) has been\nimposed. If one in addition requires that @xmath , the structure group\nis reduced further to @xmath .\n\nBefore we are discussing the field expansions of the superfields @xmath\nand @xmath , let us give some integral formulas\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .25)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the contour @xmath encircles @xmath . In fact, these contour\nintegrals give the explicit form of the Penrose-Ward transform.\n\n#### Field expansions, field equations and action functional.\n\nLet us stick to the @xmath case. The others are then obtained by\nsuitable truncations. Recall that the field content of @xmath self-dual\nSYM theory consists of a (self-dual) gauge potential @xmath , four\npositive chirality spinors @xmath , six scalars @xmath , four negative\nchirality spinors @xmath and an anti-self-dual two-form @xmath , all in\nthe adjoint representation of @xmath . The circle refers to the lowest\ncomponent in the superfield expansions of the corresponding superfields\n@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , respectively. The\nconstraint equations ( \\thechapter .17 ) can formally be solved by\nsetting\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .26)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nUsing Bianchi identities, we find the remaining fields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .27)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nrespectively. Here, we introduced the common abbreviation @xmath and\nparentheses mean normalized symmetrization. Next we follow the\nliterature [ 107 , 108 , 76 ] and impose the transversal gauge,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .28)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nin order to remove the superfluous gauge degrees of freedom associated\nwith the odd coordinates @xmath . \u00b2\u00b2 \u00b2\u00b2 22 See also Ref. [ 14 ] for a\nmore general setting. Putting it differently, this reduces the allowed\ngauge transformations to ordinary gauge transformations. Furthermore,\nthis leads to the recursion operator @xmath given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .29)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nAgain by virtue of Bianchi identities, one arrives after a somewhat\nlengthy calculation at the following set of recursion relations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .30)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere, as before, parentheses mean normalized symmetrization while the\nbrackets denote normalized antisymmetrization of the enclosed indices.\n\u00b2\u00b3 \u00b2\u00b3 23 Note that these equations resemble the supersymmetry\ntransformations, but nevertheless they should not be confused with them.\nThese equations determine all superfields to @xmath -st order, provided\none knows them to @xmath -th order in the odd coordinates. At this\npoint, it is helpful to present some formulas which simplify this\nargumentation a lot. Consider some generic superfield @xmath . Its\nexplicit @xmath -expansion looks as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .31)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFurthermore, we have @xmath , where the bracket @xmath is a composite\nexpression of some superfields. For example, we have @xmath , with\n@xmath . Let now\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .32)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThen we find by induction\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .33)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIn case the recursion relation of @xmath was given by @xmath , as it\nhappens to be for @xmath , then @xmath and the superfield expansion is\nof the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .34)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nUsing these expressions, one obtains the following results for the\nsuperfields @xmath and @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .35)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nUpon substituting the superfield expansions ( \\thechapter .35 ) into the\nconstraint equations ( \\thechapter .17 ), we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .36)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhich are the @xmath self-dual SYM equations. The equations for less\nsupersymmetry are obtained from those by suitable truncations. We have\nalso introduced the abbreviation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .37)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nWe stress that Eqs. ( \\thechapter .36 ) represent the field equations to\nlowest order in the superfield expansions. With the help of the\nrecursion operator ( \\thechapter .29 ), one may verify that they are in\none-to-one correspondence with the constraint equations ( \\thechapter\n.17 ); see also Ref. [ 76 ] for a detailed discussion.\n\nFurthermore, one easily checks that the above field equations can be\nderived from the following action functional:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .38)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich has first been introduced by Siegel [ 232 ] .\n\n#### HCS theory on @xmath.\n\nLet us now try to understand the twistor analog of the action functional\n( \\thechapter .38 ). So far, we have worked in the \u010cech approach to\nholomorphic vector bundles. In particular, we started with a smoothly\ntrivial holomorphic vector bundle @xmath over supertwistor space and\nadditionally required holomorphic triviality along any @xmath ; for the\nsake of concreteness, we again stick to the @xmath case. As we have\nlearned in the previous section, there is another equivalent approach \u2013\nthe Dolbeault approach. To switch to this picture, we need to find\n@xmath , since @xmath is assumed to be smoothly trivial. Moreover,\nwithin this approach we shall be able to write down an action functional\non supertwistor space yielding the functional ( \\thechapter .38 ) after\nperforming suitable integrations. Up to now, it is not known how to\nformulate an appropriate action principle within the \u010cech approach. This\nis mainly due to the fact that the \u010cech approach makes the construction\nmanifestly on-shell: certain holomorphic functions (the transition\nfunctions) on supertwistor space yield solutions to the equations of\nmotion of @xmath SYM theory via contour integrals of the form (\n\\thechapter .25 ).\n\nFirst, let us make a more careful analysis of the real structure @xmath\nas introduced in 5 . There we have seen that the fixed point set @xmath\n\u2013 cf. also Eqs. ( \\thechapter .78 ) \u2013 is a real slice @xmath\ncorresponding to Euclidean superspace. When restricting to @xmath , we\nhave the diffeomorphisms\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .39)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIn fact, the map from @xmath with coordinates @xmath to @xmath with\ncoordinates @xmath is explicitly given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .40)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .41)\n              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThese relations define a (smooth) projection\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .42)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nTherefore, we may conclude that in the Euclidean setting no double\nfibration like ( \\thechapter .9 ) is needed. It is rather enough to\nrestrict the discussion to the nonholomorphic fibration ( \\thechapter\n.42 ). This, however, is a very special feature of the present setting\nand we shall find other examples where double fibrations \u2013 even if\nreality conditions are imposed \u2013 are inevitable.\n\nLet us continue with the fibration ( \\thechapter .42 ). The vector\nfields ( \\thechapter .11 ) which generate the relative tangent sheaf\n@xmath do now, together with @xmath , generate the antiholomorphic\ntangent sheaf @xmath , since @xmath , @xmath and @xmath can be rewritten\naccording to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .43)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere we have defined\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .44)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .45)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThis makes it obvious that @xmath . The matrix @xmath has been defined\nin ( \\thechapter .74 ). A short calculation reveals that the sheaf of\ndifferential @xmath -forms on @xmath is, for instance, freely generated\nby the sections\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .46)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich, in fact, are dual to @xmath . Here, we have introduced\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .47)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThus, @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .48)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere, as before, @xmath are the two sets covering the supertwistor\nspace.\n\nAfter this digression, we can now proceed as in 7 and discuss\nholomorphic vector bundles @xmath over @xmath which are smoothly trivial\nand in addition @xmath -trivial. Eventually, one again finds a linear\nsystem of the form ( \\thechapter .16 ), that is,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .49)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath . But this time, @xmath and @xmath (and, of course, @xmath\n, which is absent in the present gauge) are interpreted as components of\na differential @xmath -form @xmath , where the bundle @xmath is smoothly\nequivalent to @xmath , i.e.,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThis is nothing but a special case of Thm. \\thechapter .1. Note that\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .50)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nby smooth triviality of @xmath . By following the analysis of 7 , one\nagain reproduces the equations of motion of @xmath self-dual SYM theory.\nSo, we do not repeat the argumentation at this point.\n\nInstead, we shall now change the trivialization of @xmath . In fact,\nthere exist matrix-valued functions @xmath such that \u00b2\u2074 \u00b2\u2074 24 Recall\nthat @xmath .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .51)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFrom ( \\thechapter .51 ) it then follows that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .52)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nis a globally well-defined matrix-valued function generating a gauge\ntransformation\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            @xmath            ( \\thechapter .53)\n              @xmath   @xmath            @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath            @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath            @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThus, we end up with\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .54)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhich is gauge equivalent to ( \\thechapter .49 ).\n\nThe compatibility conditions of the linear system ( \\thechapter .54 )\nare, of course, the field equations of hCS theory on the supertwistor\nspace @xmath . On @xmath , they read as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .55)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nAs in 7 , we now have to find the explicit superfield expansions of the\ncomponents @xmath and @xmath , respectively. However, their form is\nfixed by the geometry of supertwistor space. Recall that @xmath and\n@xmath are @xmath - and @xmath -valued. Together with the fact that the\n@xmath s take values in the bundle @xmath , this determines the\ndependence of @xmath and @xmath on @xmath and @xmath [ 207 ] ,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .56)\n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nHere, @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath is again the field\ncontent of @xmath self-dual SYM theory. Note that, of course, the above\nexpansions are unique only up to gauge transformations generated by\ngroup-valued functions which may depend on @xmath and @xmath . Also the\nabsence of terms to zeroth and first order in @xmath in the expansion of\n@xmath is due to the existence of a gauge in which @xmath vanishes\nidentically. Moreover, not all coefficient fields are independent\ndegrees of freedom. Some of them are composite expressions,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .57)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich follow upon substituting the field expansions ( \\thechapter .56 )\ninto the second equation of ( \\thechapter .55 ). Again we have\nabbreviated @xmath . The field expansions ( \\thechapter .56 ) together\nwith the first equation of ( \\thechapter .55 ) eventually reproduce (\n\\thechapter .36 ).\n\nNow we have all ingredients to give the twistor analog of the action\nfunctional ( \\thechapter .38 ). In fact, we have just seen that the\nequations of motion of hCS theory,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nreproduce the equations of motion of @xmath self-dual SYM theory.\nLuckily, as was discussed in 4 of the previous chapter, the supertwistor\nspace @xmath is a formal Calabi-Yau supermanifold. In particular, this\nmeans that it admits a globally defined nowhere vanishing holomorphic\nvolume form @xmath . On the patches @xmath of @xmath , it is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .58)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nAssuming that @xmath contains no antiholomorphic odd components and does\nnot depend on @xmath (see our above discussion), we may write down [ 264\n, 266 ]\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .59)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is the submanifold of @xmath constrained by @xmath . The\naction functional ( \\thechapter .59 ) of hCS theory represents the\ntwistor analog of ( \\thechapter .38 ) we were looking for. Upon\nsubstituting the field expansions ( \\thechapter .56 ) into ( \\thechapter\n.59 ), integrating over the odd coordinates and over the Riemann sphere,\nwe eventually end up with ( \\thechapter .38 ).\n\n#### Summary.\n\nEven though we have restricted our above discussion to the @xmath case,\none may equally well talk about the cases with less supersymmetry, i.e.,\nthe cases with @xmath . Of course, then the whole story is restricted to\nthe level of the equations of motion, as there are no appropriate action\nprinciples. Nevertheless, we may collect all the things said above and\nsummarize as follows:\n\n###### Theorem \\thechapter.2.\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between gauge equivalence classes\nof local solutions to the @xmath -extended self-dual SYM equations on\nfour-dimensional space-time and equivalence classes of holomorphic\nvector bundles @xmath over supertwistor space @xmath which are smoothly\ntrivial and holomorphically trivial on any projective line @xmath .\n\nPutting it differently, by Thm. \\thechapter .1. we let @xmath be the\nmoduli space of hCS theory on @xmath for vector bundles @xmath smoothly\nequivalent to @xmath . Furthermore, we denote by @xmath the moduli space\nof @xmath -extended self-dual SYM theory obtained from the solution\nspace by quotiening with respect to the group of gauge transformations.\nThen we have a bijection\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .60)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\n### 8 Other self-dual models in four dimensions\n\nAbove we have related @xmath -extended self-dual SYM theory to hCS\ntheory on supertwistor space @xmath . The @xmath case turned out to be\nvery special in the sense of allowing to write down action functionals\nfor self-dual SYM and hCS theories. Clearly, the reason is the formal\nCalabi-Yau property of @xmath . The natural question one may now pose is\nthat of extending the above approach to other geometries but at the same\ntime keeping the formal Calabi-Yau property. One such class of\ngeometries is weighted projective superspaces [ 266 , 208 ] . In fact,\nthey are natural extensions of the projective superspace @xmath . The\nfollowing discussion is based on the work done together with Alexander\nPopov [ 208 ] .\n\n#### Weighted projective superspaces.\n\nFirst, consider ordinary weighted projective spaces. They are defined by\nsome @xmath -action on the complex space @xmath . By letting @xmath be\ncoordinates on @xmath , we define the weighted projective space @xmath\nfor @xmath according to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .61)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the @xmath -action is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .62)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nClearly, what we have just defined is a toric variety and as such it\nneed not be a manifold. In general, there may be nontrivial fixed points\nunder coordinate identifications leading to singularities. However, we\nshall ignore this subtlety at this point and assume that the generic\nexpression ( \\thechapter .61 ) is a complex manifold. Anyhow, our later\ndiscussions will be unaffected by this issue since, in spirit of our\nabove discussion, we shall be considering only certain subsets which are\nalways manifolds.\n\nIn analogy to @xmath from Chap. \\thechapter , we define the weighted\nprojective superspace @xmath for @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .63)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nFurthermore, by extending the Euler sequence ( \\thechapter .62 ) to the\npresent setting (see, e.g., [ 122 ] for the purely even case), one may\nreadily deduce that the first Chern class is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .64)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath . Hence, for appropriate numbers @xmath and @xmath , the\nweighted projective superspace @xmath becomes a formal Calabi-Yau\nsupermanifold. Note also that with this definition, we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n#### HCS theory on @xmath.\n\nFor the sake of concreteness, let us now consider an open subset of\n@xmath defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .65)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThis space can be identified with\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .66)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nand as such, it can be covered by two patches, which we denote by @xmath\n. Obviously, for the particular combination @xmath , it becomes a formal\nCalabi-Yau supermanifold. In the following, we shall only be interested\nin this case. Let @xmath be homogeneous coordinates on @xmath . Since\nthe body of @xmath is the twistor space @xmath , we may take as local\ncoordinates ( \\thechapter .15 ) together with\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .67)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhich are related by @xmath and @xmath on the intersection @xmath . Note\nthat as even coordinates on @xmath either @xmath or @xmath can be used\nif proper reality conditions as those discussed in 5 and in 7 ,\nrespectively, have been imposed. Therefore, we can again take @xmath and\n@xmath of ( \\thechapter .44 ) as even generators of the antiholomorphic\ntangent sheaf @xmath .\n\nHaving given all the ingredients, we may now consider hCS theory on\n@xmath . Let @xmath be a smoothly trivial rank @xmath complex vector\nbundle over @xmath equipped with a holomorphic structure @xmath , that\nis, @xmath is subject to ( \\thechapter .6 ). Furthermore, by virtue of\nthe twistor approach, we shall assume that there exists a gauge in which\nthe component @xmath is zero. This corresponds to the holomorphic\ntriviality on any @xmath of the holomorphic vector bundle which is\nassociated to any solution of hCS theory. The equations of motion (\n\\thechapter .6 ) of hCS theory on the patches @xmath of @xmath are again\ngiven by ( \\thechapter .55 ), since there exists a gauge in which @xmath\ndoes neither contain antiholomorphic odd components nor depend on @xmath\n. Let us now discuss particular examples.\n\n#### HCS theory on @xmath.\n\nConsider the case @xmath and @xmath , where the fermionic coordinates\n@xmath and @xmath are @xmath - and @xmath -valued, respectively.\nTherefore, the components @xmath and @xmath of the @xmath -form @xmath\nare again @xmath - and @xmath -valued. As before, this fixes the\ndependence of @xmath and @xmath on @xmath and @xmath up to gauge\ntransformations. In particular, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .68)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath has been defined in ( \\thechapter .45 ). As before, not all\ncomponent fields are independent degrees of freedom. Upon substituting\nthe above expansions into ( \\thechapter .55 ), we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .69)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe field equations resulting from ( \\thechapter .55 ) are then easily\nobtained to be\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .70)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nAs one may check, these equations follow also from the action functional\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .71)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich can be obtained from ( \\thechapter .59 ) by integration over the\nodd coordinates and over the sphere @xmath . Note that this action has\nan obvious supersymmetry the transformation laws being\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .72)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is a constant (anticommuting) spinor. The action describes\na truncation of @xmath self-dual SYM theory for which all the scalars\nand three of the dotted and three of the undotted fermions are put to\nzero.\n\n#### HCS theory on @xmath.\n\nNow we consider the case @xmath , i.e., the odd coordinates @xmath take\nvalues in @xmath . The equations of motion of hCS theory on @xmath have\nthe same form ( \\thechapter .55 ). Again, the functional dependence on\n@xmath and @xmath is fixed up to gauge transformations by the geometry\nof @xmath . That is, this dependence has the form\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .73)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\ntogether with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .74)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe remaining nontrivial equations read\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .75)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath has been introduced in ( \\thechapter .37 ). The associated\naction functional is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .76)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand can be obtained from ( \\thechapter .59 ). Note that formally (\n\\thechapter .76 ) looks as the bosonic truncation of the self-dual\n@xmath SYM theory, i.e., all the spinors and four of the six scalars of\nself-dual @xmath SYM theory are put to zero. However, in ( \\thechapter\n.76 ) the parity of the scalars @xmath is different, as they are\nGra\u00dfmann odd. To understand their nature, note that in the expansions (\n\\thechapter .73 ) we have two Gra\u00dfmann odd vectors @xmath which satisfy\nthe equations\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .77)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nfollowing from ( \\thechapter .55 ). Solutions to these equations\ndescribe tangent vectors @xmath (with assigned odd parity) to the\nsolution space of the self-duality equations @xmath [ 263 , 245 ] .\nHowever, due to the first equation of ( \\thechapter .74 ) (which solves\nthe first equation of ( \\thechapter .77 ) and reduces the second to\n@xmath ), the @xmath s are projected to zero in the moduli space of\nsolutions to the equations @xmath .

Such fields\nare well known from topological YM theories [ 263 , 245 ] . In this\nrespect, the model ( \\thechapter .82 ), ( \\thechapter .83 ) can be\nunderstood as a truncated self-dual sector of these theories. One may,\nof course, also consider more than just two fermionic coordinates in\norder to enlarge the multiplet. This may lead to other truncations of\ntopological YM theories. We will come to related issues when dealing\nwith (truncated) self-dual SYM hierarchies in Chap. \\thechapter . Note\nthat the above constructions have been formalized in [ 222 ] in the\ncontext of exotic supermanifolds.\n\n## Chapter \\thechapter Supersymmetric Bogomolny monopole equations\n\nA pproximately two decades ago, it has been conjectured by Ward [ 256 ,\n257 , 258 ] that all integrable models in less than four space-time\ndimensions can be obtained from the self-dual YM equations in four\ndimensions. Typical examples of such systems are the nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, the sine-Gordon\nmodel, etc. All of these models follow from the self-dual YM equations\nby incorporating suitable algebraic ans\u00e4tze for the self-dual gauge\npotential followed by a dimensional reduction. Also the Bogomolny\nmonopole equations on @xmath , describing static Yang-Mills-Higgs\nmonopoles in the Prasad-Sommerfield limit, may be added to this list. In\nfact, Hitchin showed [ 113 ] that the Bogomolny monopole equations can\nbe described by using twistorial methods. He constructed a twistor space\n\u2013 the so-called mini-twistor space \u2013 corresponding to @xmath .\nGeometrically, it is the space of oriented lines in @xmath .\nFurthermore, he then gave the construction of a Penrose-Ward transform\nrelating equivalence classes of certain holomorphic vector bundles over\nmini-twistor space to gauge equivalence classes of solutions to the\nBogomolny monopole equations. Our subsequent discussion is devoted to an\nextension of Hitchin\u2019s approach to a supersymmetric setting. It is based\non the work done together with Alexander Popov and Christian S\u00e4mann [\n210 ] . We will obtain the mini-supertwistor space, which leads us to a\ntwistorial description of the supersymmetrized Bogomolny model. To jump\nahead of our story a bit the mini-supertwistor space can be considered\nas an open subset of the weighted projective superspace @xmath and as\nsuch it is a formally Calabi-Yau; cf. also 8 . Furthermore, on the way\nof our discussion we will meet with the notion of Cauchy-Riemann\nstructures (see, e.g., Ref. [ 143 ] for the purely even case) which\nnaturally generalize the notion of complex structures. This allows us to\nuse tools familiar from complex geometry.\n\n### 9 Cauchy-Riemann supermanifolds\n\nThe supersymmetric Bogomolny monopole equations we are interested in are\nobtained from the four-dimensional @xmath self-dual SYM equations by a\ndimensional reduction @xmath . In this section, we study in detail the\nmeaning of this reduction on the level of the supertwistor space. Note\nthat we shall always be working in the real setting as discussed in 7 .\nIn particular, we find that the supertwistor space @xmath , when\ninterpreted as the real manifold @xmath , reduces to the space @xmath .\nAs a complex manifold, however, @xmath reduces to the rank @xmath\nholomorphic vector bundle @xmath . Due to this difference, the twistor\ncorrespondence gets more involved. For instance, we need a double\nfibration. We also show that @xmath can be equipped with so-called\nCauchy-Riemann structures.\n\n#### Dimensional reduction @xmath.\n\nIt is well known that the Bogomolny equations on @xmath describing BPS\nmonopoles [ 58 , 212 ] can be obtained from the self-dual YM equations\non @xmath by demanding the components of a gauge potential to be\nindependent of @xmath and by putting the four-component of the gauge\npotential to be the Higgs field [ 168 , 113 , 21 ] . Obviously, one can\nsimilarly reduce the @xmath self-dual SYM equations ( \\thechapter .36 )\non @xmath by imposing the @xmath -invariance condition on all the fields\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nin the supermultiplet and obtain supersymmetric Bogomolny equations on\n@xmath . Recall that both @xmath self-dual SYM theory and @xmath SYM\ntheory have an @xmath R-symmetry group. In the case of the full @xmath\nSYM theory, the R-symmetry group and supersymmetry get enlarged to\n@xmath and @xmath supersymmetry by a reduction from four to three\ndimensions, cf. Ref. [ 73 ] . However, the situation in the\ndimensionally reduced @xmath self-dual SYM theory is more involved since\nthere is no parity symmetry interchanging left-handed and right-handed\nfields, and only the @xmath subgroup of @xmath is manifest as an\nR-symmetry of the Bogomolny model.\n\nRecall that on @xmath we may use the complex coordinates @xmath\nsatisfying the reality conditions induced by ( \\thechapter .78 ) or the\nreal coordinates @xmath defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .1)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nThis choice differs from the one given in ( \\thechapter .79 ) by a\nchange of coordinates. However, it is most convenient for our subsequent\ndiscussion. It will also yield a better comparability with related\nliterature.\n\nTranslations generated by the vector field @xmath are isometries of\n@xmath and by taking the quotient with respect to the action of the\nAbelian group\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .2)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\ngenerated by @xmath , we obtain the superspace @xmath . Recall that the\neight odd complex coordinates @xmath satisfy certain reality conditions\ninduced by ( \\thechapter .78 ). The vector field @xmath is trivially\nlifted to @xmath and therefore the supertwistor space, considered as the\nsmooth supermanifold @xmath , is reduced to @xmath . In other words,\nsmooth @xmath -invariant functions on @xmath can be considered as \u201cfree\u201d\nsmooth functions on the supermanifold @xmath .\n\nRecall that the rotation group @xmath of Euclidean four-dimensional\nspace is locally isomorphic to @xmath . Upon dimensional reduction to\nthree dimensions, the rotation group @xmath of @xmath with @xmath is\nlocally @xmath , which is the diagonal group @xmath . Therefore, the\ndistinction between undotted, i.e., @xmath , and dotted, i.e., @xmath ,\nindices disappears. This implies that one can relabel the bosonic\ncoordinates @xmath by @xmath and split them as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .3)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\ninto symmetric\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .4)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nand antisymmetric\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .5)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nparts. More abstractly, this splitting corresponds to the decomposition\n@xmath of the irreducible real vector representation @xmath of the group\n@xmath into two irreducible real representations @xmath and @xmath of\nthe group @xmath . For future use, we also introduce the derivations\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .6)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhich read explicitly as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .7)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nAltogether, we thus have\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .8)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\n#### Holomorphic reduction @xmath.\n\nThe vector field @xmath yields a free twistor space action of the\nAbelian group @xmath which is the real part of the holomorphic action of\nthe complex group @xmath . In other words, we have\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .9)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------------------\n\nin the coordinates @xmath for @xmath on @xmath , where\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .10)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nis a holomorphic vector field on @xmath . Similarly, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .11)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\non @xmath and @xmath on @xmath . For holomorphic functions @xmath on\n@xmath we clearly have @xmath , and therefore @xmath -invariant\nholomorphic functions on @xmath can be considered as \u201cfree\u201d holomorphic\nfunctions on a reduced space @xmath obtained as the quotient space of\n@xmath by the action of the complex Abelian group @xmath generated by\n@xmath .\n\nIn the purely even case, the space @xmath was called mini-twistor space\n[ 113 ] and we shall refer to @xmath as the mini-supertwistor space. To\nsum up, the reduction of the supertwistor correspondence induced by the\n@xmath -action is described by the following diagram:\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .12)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nHere, \u201c @xmath \u201d symbolizes projections generated by the action of the\ngroups @xmath or @xmath and @xmath is the canonical projection. The\nprojection @xmath will be described momentarily.\n\n#### Geometry of mini-supertwistor space.\n\nIt is not difficult to see that the functions\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .13)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nare constant along the @xmath -orbits in @xmath and thus descend to the\npatches @xmath covering the (orbit) space @xmath . On the overlap @xmath\n, we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .14)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich coincides with the transformation laws of canonical coordinates on\nthe total space\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .15)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nof the holomorphic vector bundle\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .16)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nClearly, this space is a formal Calabi-Yau supermanifold. Hence, it\ncomes with a globally well-defined nowhere vanishing holomorphic volume\nform\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .17)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe body of this supermanifold is the mini-twistor space [ 113 ]\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nNote that the space @xmath can be considered as an open subset of the\nweighted projective superspace @xmath .\n\nThe real structure @xmath (cf. our discussion given in 5 ) on @xmath\ninduces a real structure on @xmath acting on local coordinates by the\nformula\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .18)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the matrix @xmath has been defined in ( \\thechapter .74 ). From (\n\\thechapter .18 ), one sees that @xmath has no fixed points in @xmath\nbut leaves invariant projective lines @xmath defined by the equations\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            @xmath            ( \\thechapter .19)\n              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nfor fixed @xmath . Here, @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are coordinates on\n@xmath and @xmath denote again the canonical patches covering @xmath .\n\nBy using the coordinates ( \\thechapter .4 ), we can rewrite (\n\\thechapter .19 ) as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .20)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the explicit form of @xmath has been given in 1 . In fact, Eqs. (\n\\thechapter .20 ) are the incidence relations which lead to the double\nfibration\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .21)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath , @xmath is again the canonical projection onto @xmath and\nthe projection @xmath is defined by the formula\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .22)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath , and @xmath and @xmath are given in ( \\thechapter .20 ).\nThe diagram ( \\thechapter .21 ), which is a part of ( \\thechapter .12 ),\ndescribes the following proposition:\n\n###### Proposition \\thechapter.1.\n\nThere exist the following geometric correspondences:\n\n  ------ -------------------------- -------- ---------------------------\n  (i)    point @xmath in @xmath     @xmath   oriented @xmath in @xmath\n  (ii)   @xmath -invariant @xmath   @xmath   point @xmath in @xmath\n  ------ -------------------------- -------- ---------------------------\n\n#### Cauchy-Riemann supermanifolds.\n\nConsider the double fibration ( \\thechapter .21 ). The correspondence\nspace @xmath is the smooth @xmath -dimensional supermanifold. As it is\nof \u201cwrong\u201d dimensionality, it cannot be a complex supermanifold but it\ncan be understood as a so-called Cauchy-Riemann (CR) supermanifold,\ni.e., as a partially complex supermanifold. Recall that a CR structure\non a smooth supermanifold @xmath of real dimension @xmath is a locally\ndirect subsheaf @xmath of rank @xmath of the complexified tangent sheaf\n@xmath such that @xmath and @xmath is involutive (integrable), i.e.,\n@xmath is closed with respect to the Lie superbracket. Of course, the\ndistribution @xmath is integrable if @xmath is integrable. The pair\n@xmath is called a CR supermanifold of dimension @xmath , of rank @xmath\nand of codimension @xmath . In particular, a CR structure on @xmath in\nthe special case @xmath is a complex structure on @xmath . Thus, the\nnotion of CR supermanifolds generalizes that of complex supermanifolds.\n\nGiven a CR supermanifold @xmath , we let @xmath be the sheaf of\ncomplex-valued smooth differential @xmath -forms. Then we define locally\nfree subsheaves of @xmath -modules by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .23)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFurthermore, we set @xmath . Clearly, we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nWe now define complex-valued differential @xmath -forms @xmath on @xmath\naccording to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .24)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThen we can introduce a natural family of @xmath -operators, i.e.,\n@xmath by requiring that the diagrams\n\n  -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n                    @xmath            @xmath            \n                    @xmath            @xmath            \n  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n                    @xmath            @xmath            \n  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n                    @xmath            @xmath            \n  @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath\n                    @xmath            @xmath            \n                    @xmath            @xmath            \n  -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------\n\nshould commute.\n\n#### Cauchy-Riemann supertwistors.\n\nLet us now come back to our example ( \\thechapter .21 ). On the manifold\n@xmath , one can introduce several CR structures. For instance, we may\nchoose\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .25)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor the distribution\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .26)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nAnother one is obtained by setting\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .27)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\ni.e.,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .28)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIn the following, we shall suppress the explicit appearance of @xmath .\nIn spirit of LeBrun\u2019s [ 143 ] , we call @xmath the CR supertwistor\nspace. \u00b2\u2075 \u00b2\u2075 25 In the purely even case, a CR five-dimensional manifold\ncan be constructed as a sphere bundle over an arbitrary\nthree-dimensional manifold with conformal metric [ 143 ] . Clearly, all\nthe criteria for a CR structure are satisfied for our above two choices\nand moreover, in both cases the CR structures have rank @xmath .\n\nLet us denote the covering of @xmath by @xmath . Up to now, we have used\nthe coordinates @xmath or @xmath on the two patches @xmath . More\nappropriate for the distribution ( \\thechapter .28 ) are, however, the\ncoordinates ( \\thechapter .19 ) together with\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .29)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nIn terms of the coordinates ( \\thechapter .4 ) and @xmath , we can\nrewrite ( \\thechapter .19 ) and ( \\thechapter .29 ) concisely as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .30)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the factors @xmath have been given in ( \\thechapter .45 ). Note\nthat @xmath is real and all the other coordinates in ( \\thechapter .30 )\nare complex. The relations between the coordinates on @xmath follow\ndirectly from their definitions ( \\thechapter .30 ).\n\nThe coordinates @xmath and @xmath have already appeared in ( \\thechapter\n.20 ) since @xmath is a complex subsupermanifold of @xmath . Recall that\nformulas ( \\thechapter .22 ) together with ( \\thechapter .30 ) define a\nprojection\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .31)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nonto mini-supertwistor space @xmath . The fibers over points @xmath of\nthis projection are real one-dimensional spaces @xmath parametrized by\n@xmath . Note that the pull-back to @xmath of the real structure @xmath\non @xmath given in ( \\thechapter .18 ) reverses the orientation of each\nline @xmath , since @xmath .\n\nIn order to clarify the geometry of the fibration ( \\thechapter .31 ),\nwe note that the body @xmath of the supermanifold @xmath can be\nconsidered as the sphere bundle\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .32)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhose fibers at points @xmath are spheres of unit vectors in @xmath [\n113 ] . Since this bundle is trivial, its projection onto @xmath is\nobviously @xmath . Moreover, the complex two-dimensional mini-twistor\nspace @xmath can be described as the space of all oriented lines in\n@xmath . That is, any such line @xmath is defined by a unit vector\n@xmath in the direction of @xmath and a shortest vector @xmath from the\norigin in @xmath to @xmath , and one can show [ 113 ] that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .33)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe fibers of the projection @xmath are the orbits of the action of the\ngroup @xmath on @xmath given by @xmath for @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .34)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nRecall that @xmath is a (real) hypersurface in the twistor space @xmath\n. On the other hand, @xmath is a complex two-dimensional submanifold of\n@xmath and therefore\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nSimilarly, we have in the supertwistor case\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe formulas given in ( \\thechapter .19 ) and ( \\thechapter .29 ),\nrespectively, define a coordinate transformation @xmath on @xmath .

Thus, when working in the coordinates @xmath on @xmath ,\nwe will use the even vector fields @xmath with @xmath and the odd vector\nfields @xmath together with their complex conjugates @xmath and @xmath ,\nrespectively. Note that the vector field @xmath is real!\n\nHence, we learn that when using the coordinates @xmath , the CR tangent\nsheaf @xmath is freely generated by\n\n  -- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath            ( \\thechapter .37)\n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhile @xmath is generated by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .38)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIt is not too difficult to see that forms dual to the vector fields (\n\\thechapter .37 ) and ( \\thechapter .38 ) are\n\n  -- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath            ( \\thechapter .39)\n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .40)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath has been given in ( \\thechapter .74 ).

To homogenize the\nnotation later on, we shall also use @xmath and @xmath instead of @xmath\nand @xmath , respectively.\n\n### 10 Partially holomorphic Chern-Simons theory\n\nWe have discussed how mini-supertwistor and CR supertwistor spaces arise\nvia dimensional reductions from supertwistor space of four-dimensional\nspace-time. Subject of this section is the discussion of a\ngeneralization of Chern-Simons theory and its relatives to this setup.\nWe call the theory we are about to introduce partially holomorphic\nChern-Simons theory or phCS theory for short. Roughly speaking, this\ntheory is a mixture of Chern-Simons and holomorphic Chern-Simons (hCS)\ntheory on the CR supertwistor space @xmath which has one real and two\ncomplex even dimensions. This theory is a reduction of hCS theory on\n@xmath . As we will show below, there is a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween the moduli space of solutions to the equations of motion of phCS\ntheory on @xmath and the moduli space of solutions to the\nsupersymmetrized Bogomolny equations on @xmath , quite similar to Thm.\n\\thechapter .2. for @xmath -extended self-dual SYM theory.\n\n#### Partially flat connections.\n\nLet @xmath be a smooth supermanifold of real dimension @xmath and @xmath\nthe complexified tangent sheaf of @xmath .

Moreover, if @xmath is the integrable sheaf @xmath on\nsome complex supermanifold @xmath then the @xmath -flat complex vector\nbundle @xmath is a holomorphic bundle.\n\n#### Field equations on the CR supertwistor space.\n\nConsider the CR supertwistor space @xmath and a distribution @xmath\ngenerated by the vector fields @xmath , @xmath , @xmath from the CR\nstructure @xmath and @xmath . This distribution is integrable since all\nconditions described in 10 are satisfied, e.g., the only nonzero\ncommutator is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .49)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand therefore @xmath is closed under the Lie superbracket.

The vector field @xmath\nis a basis section for @xmath over the patches @xmath . Note that\nmini-supertwistor space @xmath is a subsupermanifold of @xmath\ntransversal to the leaves of @xmath and furthermore, @xmath . Thus, we\nhave an integrable distribution @xmath defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .51)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\non the CR supertwistor space @xmath and we will denote by @xmath its\npart generated by the even vector fields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .52)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nLet @xmath be a trivial rank @xmath complex vector bundle over @xmath\nand @xmath a @xmath -connection one-form on @xmath with @xmath given by\n( \\thechapter .51 ). Consider now the subspace @xmath of @xmath which is\nparametrized by the same even coordinates but only the holomorphic odd\ncoordinates of @xmath , i.e., on @xmath , all objects are holomorphic in\n@xmath . As it was already noted, the mini-supertwistor space is a\nformal Calabi-Yau supermanifold. In particular, this ensures the\nexistence of a holomorphic volume form on @xmath . Moreover, @xmath and\nthe pull-back @xmath of this form is globally defined on @xmath .\nLocally, on the patches @xmath , one obtains\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .53)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThis well-defined integral form allows us to integrate on @xmath by\npairing it with elements from @xmath . Assume that @xmath neither\ncontains antiholomorphic odd components nor depends on @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .54)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nthat is, @xmath . Now, we introduce a CS-type action functional\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .55)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .56)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nis the @xmath -part of the exterior derivative @xmath on @xmath .\n\nThe action ( \\thechapter .55 ) leads to the CS-type field equations\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .57)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich are the equations of motion of partially holomorphic Chern-Simons\n(phCS) theory. In the nonholonomic basis @xmath of the distribution\n@xmath over @xmath , these equations read as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .58)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere the components @xmath have been defined in ( \\thechapter .54 ).\n\n#### Equivalence to supersymmetric Bogomolny equations.\n\nNote that from ( \\thechapter .37 ) and ( \\thechapter .38 ), it follows\nthat\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .59)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand therefore @xmath , @xmath and @xmath take values in the bundles\n@xmath , @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Together with the definitions\n( \\thechapter .54 ) of @xmath and the fact that the @xmath s are @xmath\n-valued, this determines the dependence of @xmath on @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath to be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .60)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwith the abbreviation\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .61)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -- -------- -- --------------------\n        @xmath      ( \\thechapter .62)\n  -- -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe expansions ( \\thechapter .61 ) and ( \\thechapter .62 ) are defined\nup to gauge transformations generated by group-valued functions which\nmay depend on @xmath and @xmath . In particular, it is assumed in this\ntwistor correspondence that for solutions to ( \\thechapter .58 ), there\nexists a gauge in which terms of zeroth and first order in @xmath are\nabsent in @xmath . Recall that in the \u010cech approach, this corresponds to\nthe holomorphic triviality of the bundle defined by such solutions when\nrestricted to projective lines. Putting it differently, we consider a\nsubset in the set of all solutions of phCS theory on @xmath , and we\nwill always mean this subset when speaking about solutions to phCS\ntheory.\n\nNote that in ( \\thechapter .61 ) and ( \\thechapter .62 ), all\ncoefficient fields @xmath depend only on @xmath . Furthermore, not all\nof them represent independent degrees of freedom. Upon substituting the\nsuperfield expansions ( \\thechapter .61 ) and ( \\thechapter .62 ) into\nthe first two equations of ( \\thechapter .58 ), we find the relations\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .63)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nshowing that @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are composite fields.\nFurthermore, the field @xmath can be decomposed into its symmetric part,\ndenoted by @xmath , and its antisymmetric part, proportional to @xmath ,\nsuch that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .64)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHence, we have recovered the covariant derivative @xmath and the\n(scalar) Higgs field @xmath . Defining\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .65)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwe have thus obtained the supermultiplet in three dimensions:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nWe shall again abbreviate @xmath . Eqs. ( \\thechapter .58 ) together\nwith the field expansions ( \\thechapter .61 ) and ( \\thechapter .62 ),\nthe constraints ( \\thechapter .63 ) and the definitions ( \\thechapter\n.64 ) and ( \\thechapter .65 ) yield the maximally supersymmetrically\nextended Bogomolny monopole equations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .66)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhich can also be derived from Eqs. ( \\thechapter .36 ) by demanding\nthat all the fields in ( \\thechapter .36 ) are independent of the\ncoordinate @xmath . Here, we have introduced the abbreviation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .67)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNote that ( \\thechapter .53 ) can be rewritten as @xmath , where the\ndifferential one-forms @xmath have been given in ( \\thechapter .39 ).\nSubstituting this expression and the expansions ( \\thechapter .61 ) and\n( \\thechapter .61 ) into the action ( \\thechapter .55 ), we arrive after\na straightforward calculation at the action\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .68)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nproducing ( \\thechapter .66 ).\n\n#### PhCS theory in the \u010cech description.\n\nOur starting point in 10 was to consider a trivial complex vector bundle\n@xmath over @xmath endowed with a @xmath -connection. Such a @xmath\n-connection @xmath on @xmath is flat if @xmath solves Eqs. ( \\thechapter\n.57 ), and then @xmath is a @xmath -flat bundle in the Dolbeault\ndescription. As for holomorphic vector bundles (cf. Sec. 6 ), one may\nturn to the \u010cech description of @xmath -flat bundles in which the\nconnection one-form @xmath disappears and all the information is hidden\nin a transition function. In fact, let @xmath be a rank @xmath complex\nvector bundle over some smooth supermanifold @xmath and denote by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .69)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nthe moduli space of phCS theory, where @xmath is the sheaf of solutions\nto ( \\thechapter .57 ) and @xmath , as before. Furthermore, we shall\nneed the subsheaf @xmath of @xmath -functions on @xmath , that is,\n@xmath for @xmath as well as the sheaf @xmath . Quite generically, we\nmay then state the following theorem:\n\n###### Theorem \\thechapter.1.\n\nLet @xmath be a smooth supermanifold with an open Stein covering @xmath\nand @xmath be a rank @xmath complex vector bundle over @xmath . Then\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between @xmath and the subset of\n@xmath consisting of those elements of @xmath representing vector\nbundles which are smoothly equivalent to @xmath , i.e.,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath for some @xmath .\n\nThe proof is similar to the one of Thm. \\thechapter .1. For that reason,\nwe shall omit it here and instead continue with our example.\n\nConsider our smoothly trivial vector bundle @xmath from above. Since the\n@xmath -connection one-form @xmath is flat, it is given as a pure gauge\nconfiguration on each patch and we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .70)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\ntogether with the gluing condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .71)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor the trivial bundle @xmath . Therefore, we can define a @xmath -flat\ncomplex vector bundle @xmath with the canonical flat @xmath -connection\n@xmath and the transition function\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .72)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe condition @xmath reads explicitly as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .73)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nRecall that the vector fields appearing in the first line generate the\nantiholomorphic distribution @xmath , which is the chosen CR structure.\nIn other words, the bundle @xmath is holomorphic along the\nmini-supertwistor space @xmath and flat along the fibers of the\nprojection @xmath as follows directly from second line of ( \\thechapter\n.73 ). Let us now additionally assume that @xmath is @xmath -trivial,\nthat is, holomorphically trivial when restricted to any projective line\n@xmath given by ( \\thechapter .20 ). Recall that this assumption was\nalready used in ( \\thechapter .62 ). As before, this extra ingredient\nguarantees the existence of a gauge in which the component @xmath of\n@xmath vanishes. Hence, there exist @xmath -valued functions @xmath such\nthat\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .74)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .75)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nis a matrix-valued function generating a gauge transformation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .76)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich acts on the gauge potential according to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .77)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nIn this new gauge, one generically has @xmath .\n\nNote that ( \\thechapter .70 ) can be rewritten as the following linear\nsystem of differential equations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .78)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThe compatibility conditions of this linear system are Eqs. (\n\\thechapter .58 ). This means that for any solution @xmath to (\n\\thechapter .58 ), one can construct solutions @xmath to ( \\thechapter\n.78 ) and, conversely, for any given @xmath obtained via a splitting (\n\\thechapter .72 ) of a transition function @xmath , one can construct a\nsolution ( \\thechapter .70 ) to ( \\thechapter .58 ).\n\nSimilarly, Eqs. ( \\thechapter .77 ) can be rewritten as the gauge\nequivalent linear system\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .79)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nNote that due to the holomorphicity of @xmath in @xmath and the\ncondition @xmath on @xmath , the components @xmath , @xmath and @xmath\nmust take the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .80)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwith @xmath -independent superfields @xmath and @xmath . Introducing the\nfirst-order differential operators @xmath and @xmath , we arrive at the\nfollowing compatibility conditions of the linear system ( \\thechapter\n.79 ):\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --------------------\n        @xmath            ( \\thechapter .81)\n                 @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThese equations also follow from ( \\thechapter .57 ) after substituting\nthe expansions ( \\thechapter .80 ). These equations can be understood as\nthe constraint equations of our supersymmetric Bogomolny model. In fact,\nproceeding as in 7 , we can derive all the superfields together with\ntheir field expansions and the equations of motion they are subject to.\nEventually, one finds ( \\thechapter .66 ). So, let us only sketch this\nway.\n\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .81 ) can equivalently be rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .82)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath . Note that the first equation in ( \\thechapter\n.81 ) immediately shows that @xmath and thus the contraction of the\nfirst equation of ( \\thechapter .82 ) with @xmath gives @xmath . The\nBianchi identities for the differential operators @xmath and @xmath\nyield in a straightforward manner further field equations, which allow\nus to identify the superfields @xmath and @xmath with the spinors @xmath\nand the scalars @xmath , respectively. Moreover, @xmath is given by\n@xmath and @xmath is defined by @xmath . Collecting the above\ninformation, one obtains the equations of motion for the superfields\n@xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath which take the\nsame form as ( \\thechapter .66 ) but with all the fields now being\nsuperfields. Thus, the projection of the superfields onto the zeroth\norder components of their @xmath -expansions gives ( \\thechapter .66 ).\n\nTo extract the physical field content from the superfields, we need\ntheir explicit expansions in powers of @xmath . For this, one again\nimposes the transversal gauge condition ( \\thechapter .28 ). The\nconstraint equations ( \\thechapter .82 ) together with the Bianchi\nidentities yield the recursion relations analogously to Eqs. (\n\\thechapter .30 ). In fact, one simply needs to dimensionally reduce (\n\\thechapter .30 ) to obtain the recursion relations for the present\nsetting. Then by iterating the equations one may compute the superfield\nexpansions. Furthermore, as in 7 one deduces the one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the constraint equations ( \\thechapter .82 ) and\nthe field equations ( \\thechapter .66 ). We shall come back to this\nissue when dealing with explicit solution construction algorithms for\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .66 ) in Sec. 13 .\n\n### 11 Holomorphic BF theory\n\nIn the preceding section, we have defined a theory on the CR\nsupertwistor space @xmath entering into the double fibration (\n\\thechapter .21 ) which we called partially holomorphic Chern-Simons\ntheory. We have shown that this theory is equivalent to a supersymmetric\nBogomolny-type Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in three Euclidean dimensions.\nThe purpose of this section is to show, that one can also introduce a\ntheory (including an action functional) on mini-supertwistor space\n@xmath , which is equivalent to phCS theory on @xmath . Thus, one can\ndefine at each level of the double fibration ( \\thechapter .21 ) a\ntheory accompanied by a proper action functional and, moreover, these\nthree theories are all equivalent.\n\n#### Field equations of hBF theory on @xmath.\n\nConsider the mini-supertwistor space @xmath . Let @xmath be a trivial\nrank @xmath complex vector bundle over @xmath with a connection one-form\n@xmath . Assume that its @xmath -part @xmath contains no antiholomorphic\nodd components and does not depend on @xmath , that is, @xmath and\n@xmath . Recall that on @xmath we have a holomorphic volume form @xmath\nwhich is locally given by ( \\thechapter .17 ). Hence, we can define a\nholomorphic BF (hBF) type theory \u2013 as introduced and discussed in Refs.\n[ 206 , 126 , 128 , 27 ] \u2013 on @xmath with the action\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .83)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHere, @xmath is a scalar field in the adjoint representation of the\ngroup @xmath , @xmath is the antiholomorphic part of the exterior\nderivative on @xmath and @xmath the @xmath -part of the curvature\ntwo-form. The space @xmath is the subsupermanifold of @xmath constrained\nby @xmath .\n\nThe equations of motion following from the action functional (\n\\thechapter .83 ) are\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .84)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThese equations as well as the Lagrangian in ( \\thechapter .83 ) can be\nobtained from Eqs. ( \\thechapter .57 ) and the Lagrangian in (\n\\thechapter .55 ), respectively, by imposing the condition @xmath and\nidentifying\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .85)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNote that @xmath behaves on @xmath as a scalar. Thus, ( \\thechapter .84\n) can be obtained from ( \\thechapter .57 ) by demanding invariance of\nall fields under the action of the group @xmath from 9 such that @xmath\n.\n\n#### \u010cech description.\n\nWhen restricted to the patches @xmath , Eqs.

Recall that the transition functions of the bundle @xmath do\nnot depend on @xmath and therefore they can always be considered as the\npull-backs of transition functions of a bundle @xmath over @xmath .\n\n#### Moduli space.\n\nBy construction, @xmath is a @xmath -valued function generating trivial\ninfinitesimal gauge transformations of @xmath and therefore it does not\ncontain any physical degrees of freedom.

It was argued, that the mass terms in this theory\narise from coupling the R-symmetry current to a constant background\nfield when performing the dimensional reduction. In this section, we\nwant to study the analogous construction for the supersymmetric\nBogomolny model which we discussed in the previous sections. We focus on\nthe geometric origin of the additional mass terms by discussing the\nassociated twistor description. More explicitly, we establish a\ncorrespondence between holomorphic bundles over the deformed\nmini-supertwistor space introduced in [ 73 ] and solutions to massive\nsupersymmetric Bogomolny equations in three dimensions.\n\n#### Mini-supertwistor and CR supertwistor spaces as vector bundles.\n\nWe start from the observation that mini-supertwistor space @xmath can be\nconsidered as the total space of a rank @xmath holomorphic vector bundle\nover mini-twistor space @xmath , that is,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .97)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe mini-twistor space @xmath is covered by two patches, say @xmath ,\nwith coordinates @xmath and @xmath . The additional fiber coordinates in\nthe vector bundle @xmath over @xmath are the Gra\u00dfmann variables @xmath .\nFor later convenience, we rearrange them into the vector @xmath .

Note that our notation often does not\ndistinguish between objects on @xmath and their pull-backs to @xmath .\n\nThus, we arrive at the diagram\n\n  -- -- -- ---------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .103)\n  -- -- -- ---------------------\n\ncombining the double fibrations ( \\thechapter .21 ) and ( \\thechapter\n.101 ).\n\n#### Deformed mini-supertwistor and CR supertwistor spaces.\n\nLet us define a holomorphic vector bundle\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .104)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwith complex coordinates @xmath on the fibers over @xmath which are\nrelated by the transition function\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .105)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\non the intersection @xmath , i.e.,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .106)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nFor reasons which will become more transparent in the later discussion,\nwe demand that @xmath is traceless and Hermitian. It is also assumed\nthat @xmath is constant.\n\nThis supermanifold @xmath was introduced in [ 73 ] as the target space\nof twistor string theory \u00b2\u2076 \u00b2\u2076 26 For this, @xmath has to be a formal\nCalabi-Yau supermanifold, which is the reason underlying the above\nrestriction to @xmath . which corresponds by our subsequent discussion\nto a SYM theory in three dimensions with massive spinors and both\nmassive and massless scalar fields. In the following, we provide a\ntwistorial derivation of analogous mass terms in our supersymmetric\nBogomolny model and explain their geometric origin.\n\nConsider the rank @xmath holomorphic vector bundle ( \\thechapter .104 )\nand its pull-back\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .107)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nto the space @xmath from the double fibration ( \\thechapter .101 ). Note\nthat the supervector bundle @xmath is smoothly equivalent to the\nsupervector bundle @xmath since in the coordinates @xmath on @xmath ,\nthe pulled-back transition function @xmath can be split\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .108)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nHere,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .109)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nare matrix-valued functions well-defined on the patches @xmath and\n@xmath , respectively. Remember that @xmath and @xmath are related by (\n\\thechapter .106 ) and their pull-backs to @xmath (which we denote again\nby the same letter) are related by the transition function ( \\thechapter\n.108 ). Therefore, we have\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .110)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nFrom this we conclude that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .111)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere @xmath are the fiber coordinates of the bundle ( \\thechapter .100\n) related by ( \\thechapter .98 ) on the intersection @xmath .\n\nThe fibration @xmath can also be understood in the Dolbeault picture. It\nfollows from ( \\thechapter .111 ) that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .112)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nRecall that the vector fields @xmath generate an integrable distribution\n@xmath together with the operator\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .113)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhich annihilates the transition function ( \\thechapter .108 ) of the\nbundle ( \\thechapter .107 ). Due to formulas ( \\thechapter .108 ) and (\n\\thechapter .112 ), the vector bundle @xmath with canonical @xmath -flat\nconnection @xmath is diffeomorphic to the vector bundle @xmath with the\n@xmath -flat connection @xmath the components @xmath of which are given\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .114)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nIn other words, we have an equivalence of the following data:\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .115)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nBy construction, the connection one-form @xmath , given explicitly in (\n\\thechapter .114 ), is a solution to the field equations\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .116)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nof phCS theory on @xmath , which are equivalent via the arguments of 10\nto the Bogomolny equations on @xmath .

By repeating the discussion of Sec. 11 , one\ncan now show the equivalence of the data\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .124)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhich extends the equivalences described in ( \\thechapter .119 ).\n\n#### The deformed CR supertwistor space as a supermanifold.\n\nFor developing a twistor correspondence involving the deformed CR\nsupertwistor space @xmath , the description of @xmath as a rank @xmath\ncomplex vector bundle with a constant gauge potential ( \\thechapter .114\n) which twists the direct product of even and odd spaces is not\nsufficient. We rather have to interpret the total space of @xmath as a\nsupermanifold with deformed CR structure and deformed distribution\n@xmath .\n\nLet us begin with the vector fields on @xmath . Remember that a\ncovariant derivative along a vector field on the base space of a bundle\ncan be lifted to a vector field on the total space of the bundle. In our\ncase of the bundle ( \\thechapter .107 ), the lift of ( \\thechapter .112\n) reads as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .125)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nTo see the explicit form of the vector fields corresponding to the\nintegrable distribution\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .126)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\non @xmath , it is convenient to switch to the coordinates @xmath by the\nformulas\n\n  -- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath            ( \\thechapter .127)\n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nBy a straightforward calculation, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .128)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .129)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nand @xmath and @xmath were given in ( \\thechapter .37 )\u2013( \\thechapter\n.40 ) and @xmath . Actually, the formulas ( \\thechapter .127 ) and their\ninverses define a diffeomorphism between the supermanifolds @xmath and\n@xmath which have different integrable distributions @xmath and @xmath\n(and different CR structures).\n\nNext we need the vector fields on @xmath . In the above discussion, we\nused a transformation from the coordinates @xmath to the coordinates\n@xmath on @xmath , which are (pulled-back) sections of @xmath . The\ncorresponding splitting of the transition function was given in (\n\\thechapter .108 )\u2013( \\thechapter .110 ). One can find a similar\nsplitting of the transition function ( \\thechapter .105 ) also on the\ncomplex supermanifold @xmath and obtain new coordinates @xmath , which\nare sections of @xmath , as well. Explicitly, we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich yields the formulas\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .130)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nFrom this and ( \\thechapter .106 ) it follows that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .131)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand these coordinates have the desired property. Furthermore, in the\n@xmath -part of the differential\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .132)\n                       @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere we introduced @xmath for clarity, we see explicitly the\ndeformation of the complex structure from @xmath to @xmath . Note that\nthe coordinates @xmath can be pulled-back to @xmath , and there they are\nrelated to the coordinates @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .133)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\n#### Mass-deformed Bogomolny equations from phCS theory on @xmath.\n\nNow we have all ingredients for discussing phCS theory on deformed CR\nsupertwistor space @xmath . The deformed mini-supertwistor space @xmath\nfits into a double fibration\n\n  -- -- -- ---------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .134)\n  -- -- -- ---------------------\n\nsimilarly to the undeformed case @xmath . Recall that we had a\nholomorphic integral form on @xmath locally defined by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .135)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nOne can extend @xmath to a nonvanishing holomorphic volume form\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .136)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\non @xmath if and only if @xmath [ 73 ] . This is the reason why we\nimposed this condition from the very beginning. Similarly to the\ndiscussion of phCS theory on @xmath in Sec. 11 , we consider a\nsubsupermanifold @xmath of @xmath which is defined by the constraints\n@xmath . Clearly, the latter equations are equivalent to @xmath and\ntherefore @xmath is diffeomorphic to @xmath . Note that the pull-back of\nthe holomorphic integral form ( \\thechapter .136 ) to @xmath coincides\nwith @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .137)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhich is due to ( \\thechapter .111 ) and the tracelessness of @xmath .\n\nFrom here on, we proceed as in Sec. 11 and consider a trivial rank\n@xmath complex vector bundle over the CR supertwistor space @xmath with\na connection @xmath along the integrable distribution @xmath defined in\n( \\thechapter .126 ) and ( \\thechapter .128 ). By assuming that @xmath\nand @xmath , we may define the action functional\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .138)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nof deformed phCS theory. The equations of motion keep the form (\n\\thechapter .57 ) up to relabeling @xmath by @xmath and in components\n@xmath , we have\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .139)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere the vector fields ( \\thechapter .129 ) have already been\nsubstituted. The dependence of the components @xmath on @xmath and\n@xmath is of the same form as the one given in ( \\thechapter .61 ) but\nwith coefficient functions obeying @xmath -deformed equations.\n\nSubstituting the expansions of the form ( \\thechapter .61 ) for @xmath\nand our vector fields @xmath into ( \\thechapter .139 ), we obtain\nmass-deformed supersymmetric Bogomolny equations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .140)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .139 ) show that, as in the undeformed case (\n\\thechapter .58 ), some of the fields appearing in the expansions of\n@xmath are not independent degrees of freedom but composite fields. In\nfact, we find\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .141)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nFinally, upon substituting our superfield expansions for @xmath into the\naction ( \\thechapter .138 ) and integrating over the odd coordinates and\nover the Riemann sphere, we end up with\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .142)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is the action functional for the massless supersymmetric\nBogomolny equations as given by ( \\thechapter .68 ).\n\n#### Summary.\n\nWe have described a one-to-one correspondence between gauge equivalence\nclasses of local solutions to the supersymmetric Bogomolny equations\nwith massive fermions and scalar fields and equivalence classes of\n@xmath -flat bundles over the CR supertwistor space @xmath which are\nholomorphically trivial on each @xmath . We have also described a\none-to-one correspondence between the equivalence classes of @xmath\n-flat complex vector bundles over @xmath and of holomorphic vector\nbundles over the deformed mini-supertwistor space @xmath . The\nassumption that these bundles become holomorphically trivial on\nprojective lines translates in the Dolbeault description into a\none-to-one correspondence between gauge equivalence classes of solutions\nto the field equations of i) hBF theory on the deformed\nmini-supertwistor space @xmath , ii) phCS theory on the CR supertwistor\nspace @xmath and iii) massive supersymmetric Bogomolny model on\nEuclidean three-dimensional space @xmath .\n\nIn fact, this section\u2019s discussion can be understood as a corollary of\nThm. \\thechapter .2. : complex structure deformations on the\nmini-supertwistor space induce, for appropriately chosen CR structures,\nCR structure deformations on the CR supertwistor space and, of course,\nvice versa. Our above discussion is the translation of Thm. \\thechapter\n.2. to this deformed setting.\n\n### 13 Solution generating techniques\n\nIn the preceding sections, we have presented in detail the relations\nbetween supersymmetric Bogomolny monopole equations on the Euclidean\nspace @xmath and field equations of phCS theory on the CR supertwistor\nspace @xmath as well as hBF theory on the mini-supertwistor space @xmath\n. We have shown that the moduli spaces of solutions to the field\nequations of these three theories are bijective. Furthermore, we\nintroduced mass-deformed versions of these field theories. In this\nsection, we want to show how the twistor correspondences described in\nthe previous sections can be used for constructing explicit solutions to\nthe supersymmetric Bogomolny equations. In fact, any solution to the\nstandard Bogomolny equations given as a pair @xmath of a gauge potential\nand a Higgs field can be extended to a solution including the remaining\nfields of the supersymmetrically extended Bogomolny equations in a\nnontrivial fashion. The subsequent discussion is devoted to this issue.\nHowever, we are not considering this task in full generality but merely\ngive some flavor of how the algorithms work. For simplicity, we also\nrestrict ourselves to the case when only the fields @xmath and @xmath\nare non-zero. In this case, the supersymmetric Bogomolny equations (\n\\thechapter .66 ) simplify to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .143)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nFirst, we discuss Abelian solutions to these equations, which correspond\nto Dirac monopole-antimonopole systems. After this, we present two\nalgorithms which generate non-Abelian solutions.\n\n#### Abelian solutions.\n\nIn the Abelian case, the system ( \\thechapter .143 ) simplifies further\nto\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .144)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nIt is convenient to rewrite these equations in terms of the real\ncoordinates @xmath on @xmath with @xmath as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .145)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nFrom the second equation of ( \\thechapter .145 ), it follows that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .146)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand from third one, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .147)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere the sign in ( \\thechapter .147 ) was chosen to match the fact that\nin four dimensions, @xmath corresponds to an anti-self-dual two-form\nwith components @xmath and helicity @xmath , where @xmath are the \u2019t\nHooft tensors. Here, @xmath and @xmath are a vector and a scalar,\nrespectively. Therefore, Eqs. ( \\thechapter .145 ) can be rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .148)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nIt is well known that the first equation describes Dirac monopoles while\nthe second one Dirac antimonopoles (see, e.g., Atiyah et al. [ 21 ] and\nreferences therein). Thus, the action ( \\thechapter .68 ) with only the\nfields @xmath , @xmath and @xmath being non-zero can be considered as a\nproper action for the description of monopole-antimonopole systems.\n\nLet us consider a configuration of @xmath Dirac monopoles and @xmath\nantimonopoles located at points @xmath with @xmath and @xmath ,\nrespectively. Moreover, we assume for simplicity that @xmath for @xmath\n. Such a configuration is then described by the fields\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .149)\n              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath with\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .150)\n              @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .151)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nHere, @xmath and @xmath denote the following two regions in @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath               ( \\thechapter .152)\n              @xmath      \n  -- -------- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand bar stands for complex conjugation. Note that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .153)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand the configuration ( \\thechapter .149 ), ( \\thechapter .150 ) has\ndelta-function sources at the points @xmath with @xmath .\n\n#### Non-Abelian solutions via a contour integral.\n\nFor the gauge group @xmath , one can consider the Wu-Yang point monopole\n[ 271 ] and its generalizations to configurations describing @xmath\nmonopoles and @xmath antimonopoles [ 209 ] . This solution, which is\nsingular at points @xmath , @xmath , is a solution to Eqs. ( \\thechapter\n.143 ) for @xmath -valued fields. However, it is just an Abelian\nconfiguration in disguise, as it is equivalent to the multi-monopole\nconfiguration ( \\thechapter .149 ), ( \\thechapter .150 ) [ 209 ] .\n\nOne can construct true non-Abelian solutions to ( \\thechapter .143 ) as\nfollows. Let us first consider a configuration @xmath and @xmath . Then\nfrom ( \\thechapter .143 ) one obtains the equation\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .154)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nAll solutions to this equation can be described in the twistor approach\n[ 194 ] via a contour integral\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .155)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is a Lie-algebra valued meromorphic function of @xmath and\n@xmath holomorphic in the vicinity of the curve @xmath . From (\n\\thechapter .155 ) it follows that nontrivial contributions to @xmath\nare only given by those @xmath which define elements of the cohomology\ngroup @xmath . It is easy to see that ( \\thechapter .155 ) satisfies (\n\\thechapter .154 ) due to the identity\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich appears after pulling the derivatives @xmath under the integral.\n\nConsider now a fixed solution @xmath of the Bogomolny equations given by\nthe first line of ( \\thechapter .143 ). One may take, e.g., the @xmath\nBPS monopole [ 212 , 58 ] . In the twistor approach, we can find\nfunctions @xmath solving the linear system\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .156)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhich is equivalent to the linear system of phCS theory. These @xmath\nare known explicitly for many cases, e.g., for our chosen example of the\n@xmath BPS monopole, they have been given by Ward in [ 254 , 255 ] .\nUsing @xmath , we can introduce dressed fields @xmath by the formula\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .157)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is chosen as above. One can straightforwardly check that\nwith this choice,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .158)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand therefore the configuration @xmath satisfies ( \\thechapter .143 ).\nThe explicit form of a @xmath for a given @xmath and @xmath is obtained\nby performing the contour integral ( \\thechapter .157 ) along @xmath\nafter a proper choice of the Lie-algebra valued function @xmath . Recall\nthat the configuration @xmath will be real, i.e., the fields will take\nvalues in the Lie algebra @xmath , if the matrix-valued functions @xmath\nin ( \\thechapter .156 ) satisfy the reality condition as the one induced\nby ( \\thechapter .23 ) and @xmath . Imposing a proper reality condition\non the function @xmath will ensure the skew-Hermiticity of @xmath .\n\n#### Solutions via nilpotent dressing transformations in the \u010cech\napproach.\n\nIn this section, we will present a novel algorithm for constructing\nsolutions to Eqs. ( \\thechapter .143 ) based on the twistor description\nof hidden symmetry algebras in the self-dual SYM theory in four\ndimensions [ 269 ] \u2013 cf. our discussion presented in Chap. \\thechapter .\nRecall that we have described a one-to-one correspondence between\nequivalence classes of transition functions of @xmath -flat vector\nbundles over the CR supertwistor space @xmath obeying certain triviality\nconditions and gauge equivalence classes of solutions to the\nsupersymmetric Bogomolny equations on @xmath . We can, however,\nassociate with any open subset @xmath an infinite number of classes of\ntransition functions, which in turn yield an infinite number of gauge\nequivalence classes of solutions to the supersymmetric Bogomolny\nequations. Therefore, one naturally meets with a possibility of\nconstructing new solutions from a given one, that is, with dressing\ntransformations. In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss a\nparticular example of such a construction but first we briefly introduce\nsome necessary background material. At this stage, we present the latter\nin a more applied formulation and without precise mathematical\nterminology. For a more thorough exposition, we refer to Chap.\n\\thechapter , where also a \u010cech cohomological interpretation of the\nunderlying structure is given.\n\nWe consider the linear system ( \\thechapter .79 ), which can be\nrewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .159)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere we have defined\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .160)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nas before. \u00b2\u2078 \u00b2\u2078 28 Note that the first and third equations of (\n\\thechapter .79 ) are equivalent to\n\n@xmath\n\nrespectively, which together imply @xmath . From arguments similar to\nthose used subsequent to ( \\thechapter .79 ), we have @xmath and @xmath\nwith @xmath -independent superfields @xmath and @xmath . The\ncompatibility conditions for the linear system ( \\thechapter .159 ) are\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .81 ). From this linear system one also derives that\n@xmath is @xmath -flat, i.e.,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .161)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nThe key idea is to study infinitesimal deformations of the transition\nfunction @xmath of the @xmath -flat vector bundle preserving (\n\\thechapter .161 ) and the triviality properties discussed above. More\nexplicitly, given such a function @xmath (with @xmath ), we consider\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .162)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere @xmath represents some generic infinitesimal deformation. Note\nthat any infinitesimal @xmath -flat deformation (that is, preserving (\n\\thechapter .161 )) is allowed since for small perturbations, the\ntrivializability property of the bundle @xmath on the holomorphic curves\n@xmath is preserved (cf. Chap. \\thechapter ). Upon introducing the\nLie-algebra valued function\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .163)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand linearizing ( \\thechapter .162 ), we have to find a splitting\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .164)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere the Lie-algebra valued functions @xmath can be extended to\nholomorphic functions in @xmath , which yields\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .165)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nTo find these @xmath from @xmath means to solve the infinitesimal\nRiemann-Hilbert problem. Clearly, such solutions are not unique, as we\nhave the freedom\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .166)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwith @xmath , where the function @xmath is independent of @xmath . This\nfreedom can be used to preserve the transversal gauge condition (\n\\thechapter .28 ). The preservation of this gauge is in fact needed in\norder to compare the deformed superfields and the ones one has started\nwith as one wishes to derive the induced transformations of the\ncomponent fields.\n\nLinearizing ( \\thechapter .159 ), we get\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .167)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere we have introduced the operators @xmath and @xmath . From (\n\\thechapter .159 ), ( \\thechapter .161 ) and ( \\thechapter .162 ) it\nfollows that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .168)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand we eventually arrive at the formulas\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .169)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere the contour is @xmath . Thus, the consideration of infinitesimal\ndeformations of the transition function of some @xmath -flat vector\nbundle over the CR supertwistor space @xmath obeying certain triviality\nconditions gives by virtue of the integral formulas ( \\thechapter .169 )\ninfinitesimal deformations of the components @xmath and @xmath , which\nsatisfy \u2013 by construction \u2013 the linearized constraint equations (\n\\thechapter .82 ) and thus the supersymmetric Bogomolny equations (\n\\thechapter .66 ). Once again, we have a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween equivalence classes of local solutions, with equivalence induced\non the gauge theory side by infinitesimal gauge transformations and on\nthe twistor side by transformations of the form @xmath , where the\n@xmath s are functions globally defined on @xmath and annihilated by all\nvector fields from the distribution @xmath . Putting it differently, we\nhave just presented the \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d version of Thm. \\thechapter .2.\n.\n\nLet us now exemplify our discussion by describing how to construct\nexplicit solutions to ( \\thechapter .143 ). Consider a @xmath -flat\nvector bundle @xmath of rank @xmath which is holomorphically trivial\nwhen restricted to any projective line @xmath . Assume further that a\ntransition function @xmath of @xmath is chosen such that all the fields\n@xmath , @xmath , @xmath and @xmath vanish identically, i.e., we start\nwith the field equation\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .170)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that the transition function\nof @xmath can be split as @xmath , where the @xmath s do not depend on\nthe fermionic coordinates @xmath .\n\nSuppose now that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .171)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere @xmath . Considering vector bundles subject to the reality\nconditions induced by ( \\thechapter .23 ), one restricts the\nperturbations to those preserving these conditions. In our example, they\nread explicitly as\n\n  -- -- -- ---------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .172)\n  -- -- -- ---------------------\n\nwith @xmath . For illustrating reasons and to simplify equations, we\nshall be continuing with ( \\thechapter .171 ). Then a short calculation\nreveals that any splitting ( \\thechapter .164 ) is of the form\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .173)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwith @xmath . Introducing the shorthand notation\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .174)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwe find\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .175)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere we have used the fact that @xmath is totally symmetric. In\naddition, we defined\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .176)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nThe functions @xmath can be Laurent-expanded as ( @xmath )\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .177)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwith\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .178)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nCombining the expansion\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .179)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwith ( \\thechapter .173 )\u2013( \\thechapter .178 ), we therefore find\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .180)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand a similar expression for @xmath .\n\nAt this point, we have to choose an @xmath to preserve the transversal\ngauge. Explicitly, a possible @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .181)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nLet us justify this result. In ( \\thechapter .166 ), we noticed a\nfreedom in splitting the Lie-algebra valued function @xmath and we\nclaimed that it can be used to guarantee the transversal gauge condition\n( \\thechapter .28 ) which, of course, translates to the requirement\n@xmath . In fact, from the second equation of ( \\thechapter .167 ), we\nobtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .182)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere we have inserted ( \\thechapter .179 ). The contraction of these\nequations with @xmath yields the constraints\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .183)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nHere, we used the fact that @xmath and @xmath , respectively, and\nrecalled the definition @xmath . Thus, a splitting ( \\thechapter .166 )\nwith an @xmath satisfying ( \\thechapter .183 ) yields a deformation of\nthe gauge potential which respects the transversal gauge condition. In\nour present example, Eqs. ( \\thechapter .183 ) simplify to\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .184)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nSince our particular deformation ( \\thechapter .171 ) is of fourth order\nin the odd coordinates, we may assume that @xmath . Then, after some\nalgebraic manipulations, the expansions of @xmath given by ( \\thechapter\n.180 ) together with ( \\thechapter .184 ) and the ansatz for @xmath lead\nto ( \\thechapter .181 ).\n\nThe perturbations @xmath and @xmath are obtained from Eqs. ( \\thechapter\n.169 ) according to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .185)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .186)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nRemember that @xmath . Consider now the expansions\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .187)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere the brackets @xmath are composite expressions of some superfields,\ncf.\u00a0also our discussion given in 7 . Since our particular deformation of\nthe transition function implies that @xmath , the resulting deformations\nof @xmath and @xmath are of the form @xmath and @xmath , respectively.\nIn transversal gauge, the explicit superfield expansions of @xmath and\n@xmath show that @xmath . Together with the recursion relations (\n\\thechapter .30 ) (of course, applied to the present setting obtained\nvia dimensional reduction), they moreover imply that the variation of\nall higher order terms than of fourth (respectively, of third) order of\n@xmath (respectively, of @xmath ) in the @xmath -expansions vanish.\nHence, from ( \\thechapter .187 ) we find\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .188)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nComparing these equations with ( \\thechapter .185 ) and the @xmath\n-expansions of @xmath , @xmath and @xmath given earlier, we arrive at\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .189)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\ntogether with the field equations\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .190)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nSince Eqs. ( \\thechapter .143 ) are linear in @xmath , we hence have\ngenerated a solution to ( \\thechapter .143 ) starting from a solution to\nthe first equation of ( \\thechapter .143 ), that is, we may identify\n@xmath with @xmath . Thus, knowing the explicit splitting @xmath , we\ncan define functions @xmath which then in turn yield @xmath .\n\n## Chapter \\thechapter Super Yang-Mills theory\n\nM ain subject of this chapter is the twistorial description of the\nmaximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in four space-time\ndimensions, that is, of @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) SYM theory [ 101\n, 62 ] . Notice that @xmath and @xmath SYM theories represent the same\nphysical theory. The only difference between both formulations lies in\nwhat part of the R-symmetry group is made manifest: for @xmath it is\n@xmath while for @xmath it is just the subgroup @xmath . The twistor\ndescription of @xmath SYM theory dates back to Witten\u2019s work [ 262 ]\ndone in the late 70ies of the last century. The idea is roughly to\ndiscuss equivalence classes of certain holomorphic vector bundles over\nsuperambitwistor space @xmath which in turn are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with gauge equivalence classes of solutions to the @xmath\nSYM equations. The superambitwistor description involving @xmath does\nnot yield the @xmath SYM equations directly. That is why we want to\nfocus on the @xmath formulation of @xmath SYM theory. Moreover, in this\nrespect it is worth mentioning that Manin [ 166 ] generalized the\ntheorems of Witten [ 262 ] and Isenberg et al. [ 124 ] by showing that\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of\ncertain holomorphic vector bundles over superambitwistor space @xmath \u2013\nfor @xmath \u2013 which admit an extension to a @xmath -th formal\nneighborhood of @xmath in @xmath and gauge equivalence classes of\nsolutions to the @xmath -extended SYM equations in four dimensions. We\nfirst discuss @xmath SYM theory and then briefly comment on SYM theories\nwith less supersymmetry.\n\n### 14 @xmath super Yang-Mills theory\n\nLet us begin our discussion by recalling that in 3 we have defined\nsuperambitwistor space @xmath in terms of flag supermanifolds. In\nparticular, @xmath is participating in the following double fibration:\n\n  -- -- -- -------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .1)\n  -- -- -- -------------------\n\nMoreover, we have shown that superambitwistor space can be viewed as a\nhypersurface in @xmath determined by the zero locus\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .2)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath are homogeneous coordinates on @xmath . In order to be able\nto continuing as in the preceding two chapters, we first need to give\nlocal coordinates at each stage of ( \\thechapter .1 ).\n\n#### Local coordinates.\n\nIn 5 , we have already introduced local coordinates on @xmath . In\nparticular, we had @xmath on @xmath . As in Chap. \\thechapter , we are\nnow making use of the two projections @xmath to introduce the affine\nparts of @xmath and @xmath according to\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .3)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nAnalogously to ( \\thechapter .8 ), one may show that\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .4)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nThis makes it obvious that @xmath can be covered by four coordinate\npatches which we denote by @xmath , with @xmath . Letting @xmath and\n@xmath be local coordinates on\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .5)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) are the canonical patches covering\n@xmath (respectively, @xmath ), we thus may take\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .6)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------------------\n\nIn the sequel, we shall collectively denote them by @xmath on the patch\n@xmath .\n\nNext we need coordinates on @xmath . By our above construction, @xmath\nis an open subset of @xmath and as such it can be viewed as a degree two\nhypersurface in @xmath \u2013 in fact, @xmath . Here, @xmath represents the\nsupertwistor space as given in ( \\thechapter .37 ) and @xmath is the\ndual supertwistor space\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .7)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nAs before, we denote the covering of @xmath by @xmath and moreover, that\nof @xmath by @xmath . Then the product @xmath is covered by four patches\naccording to\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .8)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nand we may set\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .9)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nLet now @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) be local coordinates on @xmath\n(respectively, on @xmath ), that is, we take\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .10)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .11)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThe induced coordinates on @xmath are then given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            @xmath            ( \\thechapter .12)\n              @xmath   @xmath            @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath            @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath            @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhich are transformed on nonempty intersections @xmath in an obvious way\nwhich is obtained from the transformation laws on @xmath and @xmath ,\nrespectively. Of course, these coordinates are not independent as they\nare subject to (cf. Eq. ( \\thechapter .2 ))\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .13)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , @xmath together with @xmath , @xmath\nand @xmath , @xmath . Note that there is no summation over @xmath .\n\nAltogether, we therefore obtain the following double fibration\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .14)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\ntogether with the two holomorphic projections\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .15)\n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\ncf. also our discussion presented in 1 , 3 and 5 . In these equations,\nwe have used the notation @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , @xmath .\n\nIn fact, Eqs. ( \\thechapter .15 ) illustrate Prop. \\thechapter .4. : a\nfixed point @xmath corresponds to a super null line @xmath and\nfurthermore, a fixed point @xmath corresponds to a holomorphic embedding\nof @xmath . To see that @xmath is null, we solve\n\n  -- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath            ( \\thechapter .16)\n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nfor a generic @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath            ( \\thechapter .17)\n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath , @xmath and @xmath are arbitrary. Here, @xmath denotes a\nparticular solution to ( \\thechapter .16 ). This shows that @xmath is\nnull. Hence, @xmath is the space of all super null lines in @xmath .\n\n#### Remark.\n\nThough we are mainly interested in @xmath , let us again stick to\ngeneric values of @xmath . In Secs. 1 and 3 , we have seen that the\nsupertwistor space @xmath is an open subset in @xmath describing small\ndeformations of the Riemann sphere @xmath inside @xmath . In fact, a\nsimilar argument can be given for @xmath . Let us consider the following\nsequence of embeddings:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .18)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThen we have an exact sequence\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .19)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is the normal sheaf of @xmath in @xmath and @xmath that of\n@xmath in @xmath . In particular, we have\n\n  -- -------- -------- --\n     @xmath   @xmath   \n     @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- --\n\nHere, pr @xmath are again the two projections from @xmath to the first\nand second factors and @xmath is the sheaf of sections of the divisor\nline bundle of the diagonal @xmath . Thus, @xmath denotes the normal\nsheaf of @xmath in @xmath . In fact, @xmath is a rank @xmath holomorphic\nvector bundle over @xmath and moreover, @xmath . Hence,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .20)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe sequence ( \\thechapter .20 ) induces a long exact cohomology\nsequence\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .21)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nAs before, we let @xmath and @xmath be homogeneous coordinates on @xmath\n. An element of @xmath is described by a @xmath -tuple @xmath , where\n@xmath and @xmath are even homogeneous bidegree @xmath respectively,\nbidegree @xmath polynomials in @xmath while @xmath and @xmath are odd\npolynomials of bidegree @xmath and @xmath , respectively. The map\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nis then given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .22)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nClearly, this mapping is surjective. Hence, the sequence ( \\thechapter\n.21 ) splits to give a short exact sequence\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .23)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nUsing K\u00fcnneth\u2019s formula \u00b2\u2079 \u00b2\u2079 29 Recall the following fact. Let @xmath\nbe a holomorphic vector bundle over @xmath for @xmath . Furthermore,\ndenote the two projections from @xmath to @xmath by pr @xmath and\nconsider the bundle @xmath . K\u00fcnneth\u2019s formula then says:\n\n@xmath\n\n, one readily verifies that\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .24)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nfor @xmath . By virtue of ( \\thechapter .23 ), we therefore find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .25)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nSimilarly, one may show that @xmath (cf. Eqs ( \\thechapter .24 )).\n\n#### Penrose-Ward transform.\n\nAfter having presented the setup, we shall now come to the description\nof @xmath SYM theory. For this, we consider the double fibration (\n\\thechapter .14 ) together with a rank @xmath holomorphic vector bundle\n@xmath which is characterized by the transition functions @xmath and its\npull-back @xmath to the supermanifold @xmath . We denote again the\npulled-back transition functions by the same letter @xmath . By\ndefinition of a pull-back, the transition functions @xmath are constant\nalong @xmath . The relative tangent sheaf @xmath is of rank @xmath and\nfreely generated by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .26)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .27)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwith @xmath and @xmath . Hence, the transition functions of @xmath are\nannihilated by the vector fields ( \\thechapter .26 ). Clearly, they are\nalso annihilated by @xmath .\n\nNext we want to assume that the vector bundle @xmath is smoothly trivial\nand in addition @xmath -trivial, i.e., holomorphically trivial when\nrestricted to any submanifold \u00b3\u2070 \u00b3\u2070 30 See also Prop. \\thechapter .4.\n@xmath . Together, these conditions imply that there exist some @xmath ,\nwhich define trivializations of @xmath , such that @xmath can be\ndecomposed as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .28)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .29)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIn particular, @xmath depends holomorphically on @xmath and @xmath .\nApplying the vector fields ( \\thechapter .26 ) to ( \\thechapter .28 ),\nwe realize that by virtue of an extension of Liouville\u2019s theorem to\n@xmath , the expressions\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nmust be at most linear in @xmath and @xmath . Therefore, we may\nintroduce a relative connection one-form @xmath such that\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .30)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand hence\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .31)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThe compatibility conditions for the linear system ( \\thechapter .31 )\nread as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .32)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere we have introduced\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .33)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .32 ) are the constraint equations of @xmath SYM\ntheory.\n\nNext let us discuss how to obtain the functions @xmath in ( \\thechapter\n.31 ) from a given gauge potential. Formally, a solution is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .34)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHere, \u201c @xmath \u201d denotes the path-ordering symbol and\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .35)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the basis @xmath is dual to @xmath . It is explicitly given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .36)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe contour @xmath is a any real curve within a super light ray @xmath\nfrom a point @xmath to a point @xmath , with\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .37)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nfor @xmath ; the choice of the contour plays no role, since the\ncurvature is zero when restricted to the super light ray. Furthermore,\n@xmath are some free parameters.\n\nBefore discussing the superfield expansions of the above gauge\npotentials, let us say a few words about reality conditions. So far, we\nhave entirely worked in a complex setting. However, we eventually want\nto discuss real @xmath SYM theory on Minkowski space. In order to\nachieve this, we need to extend our in 5 introduced antiholomorphic\ninvolution @xmath to @xmath , that is, we have to require\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .38)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\non appropriate intersections. In these equations, we have used the\nshorthand notation @xmath . Upon imposing ( \\thechapter .38 ), we find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .39)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nand hence,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .40)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nas desired. In this case, the gauge group @xmath is reduced to the\nunitary group @xmath and as we have seen in 7 , the additional\nrequirement @xmath yields @xmath .\n\n#### Remark.\n\nIf @xmath is independent of say @xmath then one may assume without loss\nof generality that @xmath and @xmath [ 239 ] . All other transition\nfunctions are obtained from those by virtue of the cocycle conditions.\nIn this case, the linear system ( \\thechapter .31 ) reduces to that of\nself-dual SYM theory given in ( \\thechapter .16 ). Hence, by assuming\nthat all transition function are independent of @xmath , one ends up\nwith self-dual SYM theory. Similarly, by imposing independence of @xmath\n, one eventually obtains the anti-self-dual SYM equations.\n\n#### Field expansions, field equations and action functional.\n\nLet us now show that the constraint equations ( \\thechapter .32 ) imply\nthe equations of motion of @xmath SYM theory (and vice versa). The\nanalysis is, however, basically the same as the one given in 7 , for\ninstance. Therefore, we shall be rather brief and merely quote results.\nMore details about the derivation can be found in Harnad et al. [ 107 ,\n108 , 109 ] .\n\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .32 ) can be formally solved according to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .41)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nIt follows then from Bianchi identities that the odd spinor superfields\nare given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .42)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nAs before, one imposes the transversal gauge condition\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .43)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nto remove superfluous gauge degrees of freedom associated with the odd\ncoordinates. This time, the recursion operator takes the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .44)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nWith the help of Bianchi identities one may prove the following\nrecursion relations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .45)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere again @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) represents the self-dual\n(respectively, anti-self-dual) part of the field strength. Note that\nthese equations resemble the supersymmetry transformations, but\nnevertheless they should not be confused with them. Now one can start to\niterate these equations to obtain all the superfields order by order in\nthe odd coordinates. Using formulas similar to Eqs. ( \\thechapter .33 )\nand ( \\thechapter .34 ), one eventually finds:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .46)\n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nUpon substituting these expansions into the constraint equations (\n\\thechapter .41 ), we obtain the equations of motion of @xmath SYM\ntheory\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .47)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere we have defined\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .48)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIt can now be shown by induction and with the help of the recursion\noperator @xmath that Eqs. ( \\thechapter .47 ) are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the constraint equations ( \\thechapter .41 ). For\ndetails, see [ 107 , 108 , 109 ] .\n\nFinally, it remains to give an appropriate action functional producing\nthe equations of motion ( \\thechapter .47 ). A straightforward\ncalculation reveals that they can be obtained by varying\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .49)\n                       @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\n#### HCS theory on @xmath.\n\nUsing the Dolbeault approach to holomorphic vector bundles, we gave the\ntwistor interpretation of Siegel\u2019s action functional of @xmath self-dual\nSYM theory in 7 . It turned out to be the action functional of hCS\ntheory on supertwistor space @xmath . The existence of an appropriate\naction principle on @xmath was due to the formal Calabi-Yau property of\nthe latter. As we have seen, also superambitwistor space @xmath is a\nformal Calabi-Yau supermanifold. Thus, there is a globally well-defined\nnowhere vanishing holomorphic volume form. On the patch @xmath , it is\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .50)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is any contour encircling @xmath and @xmath , etc. The\nproblem which prevents us from writing down an action functional like (\n\\thechapter .59 ) is the \u201cwrong\u201d dimensionality of superambitwistor\nspace: the holomorphic volume form ( \\thechapter .26 ) is a form of type\n@xmath while the Chern-Simons form is of type @xmath , as one is again\ninterested in a subsupermanifold @xmath determined by @xmath . Thus, in\ntotal one obtains a form of type @xmath which, of course, cannot be\nintegrated over @xmath .\n\nIn order to circumvent this problem, Mason et al. [ 174 ] (cf. also Ref.\n[ 173 ] ) proposed to instead consider a real codimension @xmath CR\nsupermanifold \u00b3\u00b9 \u00b3\u00b9 31 For a definition of a CR supermanifold, see Sec.\n9 . in superambitwistor space. Their construction is based on an\nEuclidean signature as for Minkowski signature the CR supermanifold\nunder consideration will no longer be smooth but have singularities. In\nthis setting it is, however, possible to use the holomorphic volume form\n( \\thechapter .50 ) to give an action functional for phCS theory (see\nalso our discussion given in Sec. 10 ) reproducing the action functional\nof @xmath SYM theory. Though their construction works for an Euclidean\nsetting, it remains an open question to find an appropriate twistor\ninterpretation of ( \\thechapter .49 ) in the case of Minkowski\nsignature.\n\n#### Summary.\n\nLet us now summarize:\n\n###### Theorem \\thechapter.1.\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between gauge equivalence classes\nof local solutions to the @xmath SYM equations on four-dimensional\nMinkowski space and equivalence classes of holomorphic vector bundles\n@xmath over superambitwistor space @xmath which are smoothly trivial and\nholomorphically trivial on any submanifold @xmath .\n\nIf we let @xmath be the moduli space of hCS theory on @xmath for vector\nbundles @xmath smoothly equivalent to @xmath , we may equivalently write\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .51)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath denotes the moduli space of @xmath SYM theory. The latter\nis obtained from the solution space by quotiening with respect to the\ngroup of gauge transformations.\n\n#### Remark.\n\nIn Chap. \\thechapter , we have described the dimensional reduction of\nthe supertwistor space and obtained the mini-supertwistor space. In this\nsetting, we established a correspondence between hBF theory on\nmini-supertwistor space and a supersymmetric Bogomolny model in three\ndimensions. As for this model, which was obtained by a dimensional\nreduction of @xmath self-dual SYM theory, one can establish a twistor\ncorrespondence for the full @xmath (respectively, @xmath ) SYM theory in\nthree dimensions by using a dimensional reduction of @xmath . In fact,\none can establish:\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .52)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nThe details about this correspondence, the construction of the field\nequations, etc. can be found in [ 223 , 224 ] .\n\n### 15 Thickenings and @xmath super Yang-Mills theory\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we shall now briefly talk about SYM\ntheories with less supersymmetry, that is, for @xmath . In order to\ndiscuss them, we first need the notion of formal neighborhoods. This\nwill then allow us to provide a twistor formulation of these theories.\nHowever, we stress in advance that we will not prove any of the\nsubsequent statements but rather quote results.\n\n#### Formal neighborhoods.\n\nLet @xmath be a complex supermanifold and @xmath a sub(super)manifold.\nFurthermore, let @xmath be the ideal subsheaf of all holomorphic\nfunctions in @xmath which vanish on @xmath . Then we have a short exact\nsequence of sheaves\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .53)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\non @xmath . The sheaf @xmath can then be identified with @xmath .\nGenerally speaking, there is an isomorphism\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .54)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\ngiven by the Taylor expansion of a germ of @xmath at any point of @xmath\n. Note that @xmath can be identified with the conormal sheaf of @xmath\nin @xmath .\n\nNext we define\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .55)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThen @xmath is called the @xmath -th formal neighborhood of @xmath in\n@xmath . Note that @xmath can be expanded according to\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .56)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nPutting it differently, the @xmath -th formal neighborhood contains\nformal Taylor expansions in the normal sheaf direction up to order\n@xmath .\n\n#### Manin\u2019s theorem for @xmath SYM theory.\n\nLet us consider the double fibration\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .57)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nas introduced in 3 . Then we may state the following theorem [ 166 ] :\n\n###### Theorem \\thechapter.2.\n\nLet @xmath be an open subset of @xmath such that any null line\nintersects @xmath in a simply connected set. Then there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between equivalence classes of @xmath -trivial\nholomorphic vector bundles which admit an extension to a @xmath -th\nformal neighborhood of @xmath in @xmath and gauge equivalence classes of\nsolutions to the @xmath -extended SYM equations on @xmath .\n\nDetails about the proof can be found in [ 166 ] . Furthermore, related\naspects such as superfield expansions, etc., are discussed in Refs. [ 92\n, 109 ] .\n\n## Chapter \\thechapter Hidden symmetries in self-dual super Yang-Mills\ntheory\n\nT he purpose of this chapter is the discussion of hidden\ninfinite-dimensional symmetry algebras in @xmath -extended self-dual SYM\ntheory. The main tools we shall be using are built upon the twistor\ncorrespondence, which we established in Chap. \\thechapter .\n\nSince Pohlmeyer\u2019s work [ 198 ] , it has been known that self-dual YM\ntheory possess infinitely many hidden nonlocal symmetries and hence\ninfinitely many conserved nonlocal charges. As was shown in [ 69 , 70 ,\n71 , 244 , 81 , 75 ] , these symmetries are affine extensions of\ninternal symmetries with an underlying Kac-Moody structure. For a review\non that matter, we refer also to [ 82 ] . Furthermore, in [ 202 ] affine\nextensions of conformal symmetries have been found. As a result, certain\nKac-Moody-Virasoro-type algebras associated with space-time symmetries\nwere obtained. A systematic investigation of symmetries based on twistor\ntheory and on \u010cech and Dolbeault cohomology methods was performed in [\n204 ] (see also Refs. [ 205 , 125 ] and the book [ 171 ] ). Therein, all\nsymmetries of the self-dual YM equations were derived.\n\nOne of the goals of this chapter is a generalization of the above\nsymmetries to the self-dual SYM equations. The subsequent discussion is\nbased on [ 269 , 270 ] . In particular, we will consider perturbations\nof transition functions of holomorphic vector bundles over supertwistor\nspace. Using the Penrose-Ward transform, we relate these perturbations\nto symmetries of @xmath -extended self-dual SYM theory. After some\ngeneral words on hidden symmetry algebras, we exemplify our discussion\nby constructing Kac-Moody symmetries which come from affine extensions\nof internal symmetries. Furthermore, we also consider affine extensions\nof the superconformal algebra resulting in super Kac-Moody-Virasoro-type\nsymmetries. Moreover, by focussing on certain Abelian subalgebras of the\naffinely extended superconformal algebra, we introduce supermanifolds\nwhich we call generalized supertwistor spaces. These spaces then allow\nus to introduce so-called hierarchies which describe sets of graded\nAbelian symmetries. This generalizes the results known for self-dual YM\ntheory [ 169 , 241 , 170 , 4 , 171 , 127 ] . We remark that such\nsymmetries of the latter theory are intimately connected with one-loop\nmaximally helicity violating amplitudes [ 23 , 66 , 67 , 220 , 104 ] .\n\n### 16 Holomorphicity and symmetries\n\nAs indicated, the key idea for studying symmetries within the\nsupertwistor framework is, for a given Stein covering @xmath of\nsupertwistor space @xmath , to consider infinitesimal deformations of\nthe transition functions @xmath of some smoothly trivial rank @xmath\nholomorphic vector bundle @xmath over @xmath which in addition is @xmath\n- (respectively, @xmath -) trivial. \u00b3\u00b2 \u00b3\u00b2 32 In 13 , we have already\nused the idea of infinitesimal deformations for the construction of\nsolutions to the equations of motion of the supersymmetrized Bogomolny\nmodel. Here, we are going to formalize the things used in that\nparagraph. Recall that @xmath . Generically, an infinitesimal\ndeformation looks as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .1)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nClearly, such perturbations have to obey certain criteria:\n\n-   They must be holomorphic and moreover preserve the cocycle\n    conditions, that is, @xmath .\n\n-   They must preserve the holomorphic triviality on any @xmath .\n\n-   In case one is interested in real YM fields, they must in addition\n    respect the reality conditions induced by the antiholomorphic\n    involution @xmath introduced in 5 .\n\nThe first point is not really a restriction. Remember that in Chaps.\n\\thechapter and \\thechapter we have seen that there exists a two-set\nStein covering of @xmath . Therefore, no cocycle conditions appear when\nworking with this covering. \u00b3\u00b3 \u00b3\u00b3 33 In principle, there are\ntransformations which can change the covering. Then one needs to\nconsider the common refinement. For details, see [ 204 ] . In the\nsequel, we shall only be interested in deformations which preserve the\nchosen covering. The second point deserves some discussion. Besides\n@xmath , consider the Abelian group (by addition) @xmath , where @xmath\n. This group parametrizes infinitesimal deformations of the trivial\nbundle @xmath . \u00b3\u2074 \u00b3\u2074 34 Note that infinitesimal deformations of an\narbitrary holomorphic vector bundle @xmath are parametrized by @xmath .\nFurthermore, @xmath , that is, in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of\nthe trivial bundle @xmath there exists an infinite number of\nholomorphically nontrivial bundles @xmath . If we let @xmath be the\nrestriction of the cohomology group @xmath to @xmath for some fixed\n@xmath , then @xmath parametrizes infinitesimal deformations of @xmath\nrestricted to @xmath . However,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich follows from the vanishing of @xmath . This in turn implies that\nsmall enough deformations do not change the trivializability of @xmath\nover @xmath . In fact, this is a version of the\nKodaira-Spencer-Nirenberg theorem [ 135 ] . Therefore, point two from\nthe above list is likewise no restriction on the allowed perturbations.\nAltogether, any infinitesimal holomorphic deformation is allowed. The\nonly restriction one has to implement is point three from the above\nlist. If not otherwise stated, we shall always assume that our\ndeformations are compatible with the reality conditions.\n\n#### Kac-Moody symmetries.\n\nLet us consider the nonholomorphic fibration @xmath given by (\n\\thechapter .42 ). Choose again the canonical covering @xmath of the\nsupertwistor space. Given a smoothly and @xmath -trivial rank @xmath\nholomorphic vector bundle @xmath , we define an action of the\none-cochain group @xmath on @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .2)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath . Obviously, the group @xmath acts transitively\non @xmath , since for an arbitrary \u010cech one-cocycle @xmath one can find\nan @xmath such that @xmath and @xmath . The stabilizer of the trivial\n\u010cech one-cocycle, given by @xmath , is the subgroup\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .3)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nimplying that @xmath can be identified with the coset\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .4)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nThen the moduli space @xmath is given by a double coset space\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .5)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere the zero-cochain group acts according to\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .6)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwith @xmath .\n\nLet us now study infinitesimal deformations of the transition function\n@xmath . Recalling the definition @xmath , we introduce the subsheaves\n@xmath and @xmath consisting of those @xmath -valued, respectively,\n@xmath -valued smooth functions which are holomorphic in @xmath . We\nhave a natural infinitesimal action of the group @xmath on the space\n@xmath which is induced by the linearization of ( \\thechapter .2 ). That\nis, we get\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .7)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath . Then we introduce a @xmath -valued function\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .8)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath , as before. From Eq. ( \\thechapter .7 ) it is\nthen immediate that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nMoreover, @xmath is annihilated by the vector field @xmath . Thus, it\ndefines an element @xmath . However, any one-cocycle with values in the\nsheaf @xmath is a one-coboundary since @xmath . This is an immediate\nconsequence of the vanishing of @xmath and of the acyclicity of the\nsheaf @xmath . Therefore, we have\n\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .9)\n  -- -------- -- -------------------\n\nwhere @xmath . Linearizing @xmath , we obtain\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand hence by virtue of Eqs. ( \\thechapter .8 ) and ( \\thechapter .9 ) we\nfind\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .10)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIn summary, given some @xmath one derives via ( \\thechapter .7 )\u2013(\n\\thechapter .9 ) the perturbations @xmath . Moreover, we point out that\nfinding such @xmath means to solve the infinitesimal variant of the\nRiemann-Hilbert problem. Obviously, the splitting ( \\thechapter .9 ), (\n\\thechapter .10 ) and hence solutions to the Riemann-Hilbert problem are\nnot unique, as we certainly have the freedom to consider a new @xmath\nshifted by functions @xmath , @xmath , such that @xmath on the\nintersection @xmath , that is, @xmath .\n\nFurthermore, infinitesimal variations of the linear system ( \\thechapter\n.49 ) yield\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .11)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nSubstituting ( \\thechapter .10 ) into these equations, we arrive at\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .12)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHere, we have introduced the definitions\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .13)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNote that ( \\thechapter .13 ) acts adjointly in ( \\thechapter .12 ).\nTherefore, ( \\thechapter .12 ) together with ( \\thechapter .9 ) imply\nthat\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .14)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nOne may easily check that the choice @xmath , where @xmath , implies\n@xmath and @xmath , respectively. Hence, such @xmath define trivial\nperturbations. On the other hand, infinitesimal gauge transformations of\nthe form\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath is some smooth @xmath -valued function on @xmath , imply\n(for irreducible gauge potentials) that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nHence, such @xmath do not depend on @xmath . In particular, we have\n@xmath and hence @xmath .\n\nFinally, we obtain the formulas\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .15)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the contour @xmath encircles @xmath . We see that generically the\noutcome of the transformation @xmath is a highly nonlocal expression\ndepending on @xmath , i.e., we may write @xmath , where @xmath is a\nfunctional whose explicit form is determined by @xmath .\n\nSummarizing, to any infinitesimal deformation, @xmath , of the\ntransition function @xmath we have associated a symmetry transformation\n@xmath , that is, solutions to the linearized @xmath -extended self-dual\nSYM equations. In fact, we have obtained a one-to-one correspondence\nbetween equivalence classes of deformations of holomorphic vector\nbundles over supertwistor space which are subject to certain triviality\nconditions and gauge equivalence classes of solutions to the linearized\nfield equations of @xmath -extended SYM theory. Putting it differently,\nour above discussion represents the \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d version of Thm.\n\\thechapter .2.\n\n#### Virasoro-type symmetries.\n\nAbove we have introduced Kac-Moody symmetries which were generated by\nthe algebra @xmath . In this paragraph we focus on symmetries, which are\nrelated to the group of local biholomorphisms of supertwistor space\n@xmath . We shall only be interested in this subgroup of the\ndiffeomorphism group of @xmath as generic local diffeomorphisms would\nchange the complex structure of the supertwistor space. However, this in\nturn would induce a change of the conformal structure and a metric on\n@xmath as was demonstrated in the purely even setting by Penrose [ 193 ]\nand Atiyah et al. [ 20 ] . As we want to discuss symmetries of the\nself-dual SYM equations on @xmath , we need to consider those\ndiffeomorphisms which preserve the complex structure, that is,\nbiholomorphisms. Let us denote the group of local biholomorphisms by\n@xmath . Furthermore, we are again choosing the canonical covering\n@xmath of @xmath together with the coordinates @xmath . On the\nintersection @xmath , they are related by transition functions @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .16)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nTo @xmath one associates the algebra @xmath of zero-cochains on @xmath\nwith values in the tangent sheaf @xmath of supertwistor space. In order\nto define an appropriate action of @xmath , let us first consider the\nalgebra @xmath whose elements are collections of vector fields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .17)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere we have abbreviated @xmath . In particular, @xmath and @xmath are\nelements of the algebra @xmath of holomorphic vector fields on the\nintersection @xmath . Thus, @xmath can be decomposed according to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .18)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nKodaira-Spencer deformation theory [ 135 ] then tells us that the\nalgebra @xmath acts on the transition functions @xmath according to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .19)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich can equivalently be rewritten as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .20)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nConsider a subalgebra\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .21)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nof the algebra @xmath . Then the space\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .22)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nis given by the quotient\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .23)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nWe stress that the transformations ( \\thechapter .19 ) change the\ncomplex structure of @xmath if @xmath , where @xmath . Therefore,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .24)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nis the tangent space (at a chosen complex structure) of the moduli space\nof deformations of the complex structure on @xmath .\n\nAccording to ( \\thechapter .20 ), we may define an action of the algebra\n@xmath on the transition functions @xmath of holomorphic vector bundles\nover supertwistor space by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .25)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHowever, as we have just seen, such transformations may change the\ncomplex structure on @xmath . Therefore, we let the algebra @xmath act\non @xmath and @xmath via\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .26)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\ntogether with Eqs. ( \\thechapter .20 ) and ( \\thechapter .25 ), i.e.,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .27)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nThese transformations do preserve the complex structure on supertwistor\nspace.\n\nAfter this digression, we may now follow the lines presented in 16 to\narrive at the formulas ( \\thechapter .15 ) for symmetries. We shall not\nrepeat the argumentation at this point. We refer to symmetries obtained\nin this way as Virasoro-type symmetries since they are associated with\nthe group of local biholomorphisms.\n\n#### All symmetries.\n\nWith the help of \u010cech cohomology and the Penrose-Ward transform, we have\nshown how Kac-Moody and Virasoro-type symmetries in @xmath -extended\nself-dual SYM theory arise. In the next paragraph, we will make the\nsymmetry algebras more transparent by proving a theorem relating certain\ndeformation algebras on the twistor side to symmetry algebras on the\nself-dual SYM side. Furthermore, in Sec. 17 we then give explicit\nexamples of symmetry transformations and corresponding symmetry\nalgebras. Before dealing with these issues, however, let us summarize\nour preceding discussion. In fact, above we have given all possible\ncontinuous symmetry transformations acting on the solution space of the\nequations of motion of self-dual SYM theory. If we let @xmath be the\ncanonical covering of the supertwistor space @xmath , @xmath and @xmath\nbe the group of local biholomorphisms of @xmath associated with the\nalgebra @xmath , we may state the following result:\n\n###### Theorem \\thechapter.1.\n\nThe full group of continuous (symmetry) transformations acting on the\nspace @xmath of smoothly and @xmath -trivial holomorphic vector bundles\n@xmath of rank @xmath is a semidirect product\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nBy virtue of the Penrose-Ward transform, one obtains a corresponding\ngroup action on the solution space of @xmath -extended self-dual SYM\ntheory in four dimensions.\n\nA proof of this theorem (for @xmath ) can be found in Ref. [ 204 ] . The\nargumentation for @xmath goes along similar lines.\n\n#### General symmetry algebras.\n\nSo far, we have worked within a quite abstract scheme. Let us now\npresent a more concrete relationship between certain deformation\nalgebras and hidden symmetry algebras [ 270 ] . Suppose we are given\nsome indexed set @xmath of infinitesimal variations @xmath of the\ntransition function @xmath of our holomorphic vector bundle @xmath over\nsupertwistor space. Suppose further that the @xmath s satisfy a\ndeformation algebra of the form\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .28)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere generically @xmath , with\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand @xmath denotes the supercommutator.\n\n###### Theorem \\thechapter.2.\n\nGiven a deformation algebra of the form ( \\thechapter .28 ) with\nconstant @xmath , the corresponding symmetry algebra on the gauge theory\nside has exactly the same form modulo possible gauge transformations.\n\nPutting it differently, the linearized Penrose-Ward transform is,\nbesides being an isomorphism between the tangent spaces of the moduli\nspaces @xmath and @xmath (see also Thm. \\thechapter .2. ), a Lie algebra\nhomomorphism. Let us now prove the theorem.\n\nProof: Let @xmath be a smoothly and @xmath -trivial holomorphic vector\nbundle of rank @xmath . Recall that the transition function @xmath can\nbe split according to @xmath , with @xmath . Consider\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the infinitesimal parameters of the\ntransformations @xmath and @xmath , respectively. By virtue of (\n\\thechapter .12 ), we may write\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath stands symbolically for both components @xmath and @xmath .\nThen one easily checks that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath represents any of the covariant derivatives given in (\n\\thechapter .13 ). Note that we use the notation @xmath and similarly\nfor @xmath . Hence, @xmath . Next one considers the commutator\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nUsing definition ( \\thechapter .8 ) and the resulting splitting (\n\\thechapter .9 ) for the deformations @xmath , one obtains after some\ntedious but straightforward algebraic manipulations\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath has been introduced above. By assumption, it must also be\nequal to\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ni.e.,\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhere @xmath . By comparing this equation with the previously obtained\nresult for @xmath , we may conclude that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nsince by assumption @xmath . Here, @xmath (respectively, @xmath )\nbelongs to @xmath . Thus, by our above discussion, it represents an\ninfinitesimal gauge transformation. @xmath\n\nHence, any Lie-algebra type deformation algebra on the twistor side\nyields by virtue of the Penrose-Ward transform a symmetry algebra on the\ngauge theory side being of the same form. Furthermore, we also realize\nthat if @xmath , the algebra on the gauge theory side will generically\nno longer close because of the dependence of @xmath on @xmath through\n@xmath . In fact, in order to be able to compare @xmath with @xmath\n(which will no longer be given by @xmath ) from the above proof, one has\nto Laurent-expand @xmath in powers of @xmath . The resulting coefficient\nfunctions will solely depend on @xmath . Therefore, the space-time\nderivatives appearing in the transformations ( \\thechapter .12 ) will\ndestroy the \u201cwould be\u201d algebra on the self-dual SYM side. As a matter of\nfact, if one allows @xmath to depend only on @xmath , no such problems\nwill occur. That is, the algebra, though modified, will still close.\nMore details about these issues can be found in the next section when\nexplicitly dealing with affine extensions of superconformal symmetries.\n\n### 17 Explicit examples of hidden symmetry algebras\n\nBy now it is clear that self-dual SYM theory possesses\ninfinite-dimensional hidden symmetry algebras. To exemplify our\ndiscussion, let us now describe some explicit symmetry algebras. We\nbegin with affine extensions of internal symmetries and afterwards\ndiscuss affine extensions related to space-time symmetries. As before,\nwe consider a smoothly and @xmath -trivial rank @xmath holomorphic\nvector bundle @xmath over supertwistor space, the latter being covered\nby @xmath . The transition function of @xmath is again given by @xmath ,\nwith @xmath .\n\n#### Kac-Moody symmetries.\n\nThe prime example is Kac-Moody symmetries associated with internal\nsymmetries. Let @xmath be any generator of the gauge group @xmath with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .29)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the @xmath s are the structure constants of @xmath . Then we may\ndefine the following infinitesimal deformation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .30)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIt is clearly a holomorphic deformation and moreover, one may readily\ncheck that it preserves the reality condition ( \\thechapter .23 ).\nNotice that by comparing with Eq. ( \\thechapter .7 ), we see that\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ndefine one-cochains @xmath . For @xmath , the transformations of the\ncomponents of the gauge potential turn out to be (after properly fixing\nthe freedom in solving the infinitesimal Riemann-Hilbert problem; cf.\nEq. ( \\thechapter .37 ))\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .31)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThus, they represent an internal symmetry transformation. Then a short\ncalculation reveals that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .32)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich is the analytic half of a centerless Kac-Moody algebra @xmath .\nOne can bring ( \\thechapter .32 ) in a more familiar form as follows.\nDefine @xmath and @xmath . Furthermore, let\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .33)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwith some (real) coefficients @xmath to be determined. Next consider\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .34)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nthat is, the @xmath -th generator is recursively defined by @xmath -th\none. Then\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .35)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor all @xmath . In fact, this is a direct consequence of Eq. (\n\\thechapter .32 ) and can be proven by induction with the help of Jacobi\nidentity for the generators @xmath . As this is rather straightforward,\nwe leave the explicit verification to the interested reader.\n\nNext we need to find \u2013 by means of the discussion of the previous\nsection \u2013 the action of @xmath for @xmath on the components @xmath and\n@xmath of the gauge potential. Consider the function @xmath as defined\nin ( \\thechapter .8 ). We obtain\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .36)\n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere in the last step we have introduced the functions @xmath which are\nsolutions of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .37)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nAs the @xmath s are holomorphic and nonsingular in @xmath on their\nrespective domains, we expand them in powers of @xmath on the\nintersection @xmath according to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .38)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFurthermore, Eqs. ( \\thechapter .15 ) imply\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .39)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand similarly for @xmath .\n\nUpon substituting the expansions ( \\thechapter .38 ) into ( \\thechapter\n.36 ), we find the following splitting of @xmath into @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .40)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nRecall that solutions to the Riemann-Hilbert problem are not unique. For\ninstance, we could have added to @xmath any smooth function which does\nnot depend on @xmath . But at the same time we had to add the same\nfunction to @xmath , as well. However, we have learned that such shifts\nof \u201czero-modes\u201d will eventually result in gauge transformations. As we\nare not interested in such trivial symmetries, solution ( \\thechapter\n.40 ) turns out to be the appropriate choice. Note that for @xmath , Eq.\n( \\thechapter .40 ) is an identity. Expanding the functions @xmath in\npowers of @xmath , we obtain for @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .41)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNote that @xmath for all @xmath . Combining these expressions with the\ntransformation laws ( \\thechapter .39 ), we have thus given the action\nof @xmath on @xmath and @xmath , respectively. Furthermore, by Thm.\n\\thechapter .2. we know that the @xmath s satisfy\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .42)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nmodulo gauge transformations. For an explicit derivation, see also Ref.\n[ 269 ] . Following the discussion subsequent to ( \\thechapter .32 ), we\neventually arrive at\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .43)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor all @xmath modulo gauge transformations. Altogether, we have thus\nobtained an infinite-dimensional affine symmetry algebra in @xmath\n-extended self-dual SYM theory, which is the analytic half of the affine\nLie algebra @xmath .\n\n#### Virasoro-type symmetries.\n\nLet us now discuss affine extensions of superconformal symmetries.\nHowever, we first need some preliminaries. The superconformal group for\n@xmath is locally isomorphic to a real form of the super matrix group\n@xmath . In the case of maximal @xmath supersymmetries, the supergroup\n@xmath is not semi-simple and the superconformal group is considered to\nbe a real form of the semi-simple part @xmath . The generators of the\nsuperconformal group are the translation generators @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath , the dilatation generator @xmath , the generators of special\nconformal transformations @xmath , @xmath and @xmath , the rotation\ngenerators @xmath and @xmath , the generators @xmath of the R-symmetry\nand the generator of the axial symmetry @xmath . The latter one is\nabsent in the case of maximal @xmath supersymmetries. The superconformal\nalgebra then takes the following form:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .44)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere, as before, parentheses mean normalized symmetrization of the\nenclosed indices. As is well known, there is a representation of this\nalgebra in terms of vector fields on the anti-chiral superspace @xmath\naccording to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .45)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nInfinitesimal transformations of the components @xmath and @xmath of the\ngauge potential under the action of the superconformal group are given\nby\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .46)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is any generator of the superconformal group, and @xmath is\nthe Lie derivative \u00b3\u2075 \u00b3\u2075 35 Note that the Lie derivative is defined as\nin the purely even setting. In particular, @xmath and @xmath , where\n@xmath is some local function and @xmath are local vector fields.\nFurthermore, one requires that @xmath commutes with the contraction\noperator. For any differential one-form @xmath , one may readily verify\nthe following result:\n\n@xmath\n\nLetting @xmath be @xmath , one sets @xmath . The extra sign has been\nchosen for convenience. along the vector field @xmath . Explicitly, Eqs.\n( \\thechapter .46 ) read as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .47)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nIt is not too difficult to show that for any generator @xmath as given\nin ( \\thechapter .45 ), the transformations ( \\thechapter .46 ) together\nwith ( \\thechapter .47 ) give a symmetry of the @xmath -extended\nself-dual SYM equations ( \\thechapter .17 ).\n\nSo far, we have given the action of the superconformal group on the\ncomponents of the gauge potential on Euclidean superspace. The linear\nsystem ( \\thechapter .49 ) is, however, defined on the supertwistor\nspace @xmath . Therefore, the question is how to lift the action of the\nsuperconformal group to supertwistor space but at the same time\npreserving the linear system ( \\thechapter .49 ). The answer is at hand.\nBy our discussion given in Sec. 16 , we have to preserve the complex\nstructure on @xmath . Recall the diffeomorphism @xmath . Complex\nstructures on the body @xmath of @xmath are parametrized by a two-sphere\n@xmath . The latter can be viewed as the complex projective line @xmath\nparametrized by the coordinates @xmath . Then a complex structure @xmath\non @xmath , compatible with ( \\thechapter .75 ) and ( \\thechapter .79 ),\nis given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .48)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath . Notice that in the present case the corresponding K\u00e4hler\ntwo-form @xmath is anti-self-dual, i.e., its components are of the form\n@xmath . If we had chosen the @xmath -extended anti-self-dual SYM\nequations from the very beginning, the K\u00e4hler form would have been\nself-dual. On the two-sphere @xmath which parametrizes the different\ncomplex structures of @xmath , we introduce the standard complex\nstructure @xmath which, for instance, on the @xmath patch is given by\n@xmath . Thus, the complex structure on the body @xmath of supertwistor\nspace @xmath can be taken as @xmath .\n\nHaving introduced a complex structure on the even part @xmath of @xmath\n, we need to extend the above discussion to the full supertwistor space.\nIn order to define a complex structure on @xmath , recall that only an\neven amount of supersymmetries is possible, i.e., @xmath or @xmath . Our\nparticular choice of the symplectic Majorana condition induced by (\n\\thechapter .78 ) allows us to introduce a complex structure on the odd\npart @xmath similar to ( \\thechapter .48 ), that is,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .49)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nTherefore, @xmath will be the proper choice of a complex structure \u00b3\u2076 \u00b3\u2076\n36 Clearly, this choice of the complex structure does not exhaust the\nspace of all admissible complex structures. However, in the present case\nit is enough to restrict ourselves to this class of complex structures.\nFor more details, see [ 269 ] . on supertwistor space.\n\nWe can now answer the initial question: the generators @xmath given by (\n\\thechapter .45 ) of the superconformal group should be lifted to vector\nfields @xmath on supertwistor space such that the Lie derivative of the\ncomplex structure @xmath along the lifted vector fields @xmath vanishes,\ni.e.,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .50)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nLetting @xmath , we can write ( \\thechapter .50 ) explicitly as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .51)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhereas the equations involving @xmath imply that the components @xmath\nand @xmath are holomorphic in @xmath and @xmath , respectively. The\nfinal expressions for the generators ( \\thechapter .45 ) lifted to\nsupertwistor space @xmath and obeying ( \\thechapter .51 ) are\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .52)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .53)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNow we can give the infinitesimal transformation of @xmath which\nparticipates in ( \\thechapter .49 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .54)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is any of the generators given in ( \\thechapter .52 ). It\nis a straightforward exercise to verify explicitly that the linear\nsystem ( \\thechapter .49 ) is invariant under the transformations (\n\\thechapter .46 ) and ( \\thechapter .54 ).\n\nHaving collected all necessary ingredients, we can now start with\nconstructing affine symmetry algebras related to superconformal\nsymmetries. In order to keep formulas simple, we shall in the remainder\nof this section work in the complexified gauge algebra, that is, we drop\nthe last point from the list given at the beginning of Sec. 16 . It\nshould be stressed, however, that the subsequent derivation can be\nmodified for a real gauge algebra without any problems. Let @xmath be\nany vector field of ( \\thechapter .52 ), with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .55)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the @xmath s are the structure constants of the superconformal\ngroup. Then we define the following perturbation of @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .56)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNote that the antiholomorphic @xmath -derivative appearing in @xmath\ndrops out as @xmath is holomorphic. Therefore, Eq. ( \\thechapter .56 )\ndefines a zero-cochain @xmath given by \u00b3\u2077 \u00b3\u2077 37 Note that for a real\ngauge algebra, @xmath would not be zero but instead be given by @xmath ,\nwhere @xmath represents the antiholomorphic involution ( \\thechapter .75\n) corresponding to Euclidean signature.\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nFurthermore, one may readily check that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .57)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nupon action on @xmath . Here, we have introduced the shorthand notation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .58)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nGenerally speaking, ( \\thechapter .57 ) can be seen as a centerless\nKac-Moody-Virasoro-type algebra.\n\nNext we need to find the action of @xmath on the components @xmath and\n@xmath . The derivation ( \\thechapter .36 ) gets modified according to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .59)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere this time\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .60)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nClearly, the second term of this expression is @xmath -independent,\ni.e., it belongs to @xmath . In fact, we have simply shifted all the\n\u201czero-modes\u201d into @xmath . Recall that such shifts are always possible\nand eventually result in gauge transformations. Upon substituting (\n\\thechapter .60 ) into ( \\thechapter .15 ) and using Eq. ( \\thechapter\n.38 ), we find \u00b3\u2078 \u00b3\u2078 38 Note that @xmath is a composition of a\nsuperconformal and a particular gauge transformation.\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .61)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nsince @xmath . Similar expressions hold for @xmath . Eq. ( \\thechapter\n.59 ) yields, after expanding @xmath in powers of @xmath and comparing\nwith @xmath , the following coefficient functions:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .62)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNote that @xmath for @xmath . These coefficients together with the\nintegral formulas ( \\thechapter .15 ) give the action of @xmath on\n@xmath and @xmath according to\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .63)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand similarly for @xmath .\n\nNext we are interested in the underlying algebraic structure. Thm.\n\\thechapter .2. is not directly applicable, as we now have to deal with\nstructure functions. Recall that the @xmath s appearing in ( \\thechapter\n.57 ) are holomorphic functions on @xmath . However, there are only\nminor modifications to be made. In proving Thm. \\thechapter .2. , we\nhave introduced the functions @xmath . Their difference is now given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .64)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .65)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIn order to determine @xmath , one expands both sides of Eq. (\n\\thechapter .64 ) in powers of @xmath and compares coefficients. We are\nonly interested in @xmath and @xmath , as they determine the action of\n@xmath onto the components of the gauge potential. We find\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .66)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath has been inserted. Note that last term in the first line\nrepresents again a gauge transformation. It has been adjusted such that\n@xmath . By virtue of ( \\thechapter .15 ) and ( \\thechapter .62 ), we\nfinally arrive at\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .67)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand similarly for @xmath . In deriving this result, the explicit\ndependence of @xmath on @xmath and @xmath has been used. Obviously, the\nalgebra closes if and only if the coefficient functions are independent\nof @xmath \u2013 a fact which we have already encountered at the end of Sec.\n16 . Therefore, we are left with only a subalgebra of the superconformal\nalgebra. Indeed, we need to exclude the generators @xmath and @xmath of\nspecial conformal transformations. Let us consider the maximal\nsubalgebra of the superconformal algebra which contains neither @xmath\nnor @xmath . Furthermore, let @xmath denote the corresponding structure\nconstants. Then we end up with\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .68)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is the expansion of @xmath defined in ( \\thechapter .58 ).\n\n### 18 Hierarchies\n\nIn Refs. [ 169 , 241 , 170 , 4 , 171 , 127 ] it was shown that a\nsolution to the self-dual YM equations can be embedded into an\ninfinite-parameter family of new solutions by moving it along commuting\nflows of a so-called self-dual YM hierarchy. The lowest generators of\nthe latter are the generators of space-time translations. Putting it\ndifferently, the self-dual YM hierarchy describes infinitely many\nAbelian symmetries of the self-dual YM equations associated with\ntranslational symmetries. Our next topic is the generalization of these\nideas to the self-dual SYM equations. For the sake of clarity, we shall\nagain work in a complex setting, that is, we consider the double\nfibration ( \\thechapter .9 ). If desired, reality conditions can be\nimposed.\n\n#### Generalized supertwistor space.\n\nConsider the Abelian subalgebra of the superconformal algebra which is\nspanned by the translation generators @xmath and @xmath . On\nsupertwistor space, we may use the coordinates @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath . Expressing the generators @xmath and @xmath in terms of these\ncoordinates, we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .69)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhen acting on holomorphic functions of @xmath on @xmath . Then we may\ndefine local holomorphic vector fields @xmath and @xmath by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .70)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nfor @xmath . Clearly, the vector fields @xmath and @xmath are totally\nsymmetric under an exchange of their dotted indices. As before, we\ndefine a perturbation of the transition function @xmath of a smoothly\ntrivial holomorphic vector bundle @xmath which is trivial along @xmath\naccording to \u00b3\u2079 \u00b3\u2079 39 Clearly, such a deformation does not preserve the\nreality condition @xmath . See also footnote 37 .\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .71)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNext one could pull back @xmath to the correspondence space and solve\nthe corresponding infinitesimal Riemann-Hilbert problem (which we have\nalready done in the preceding section) to construct the symmetry\ntransformations of the components @xmath and @xmath of the gauge\npotential. We shall, however, proceed differently and instead consider\nthe following dynamical system:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .72)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are parameters. These equations can easily be\nsolved. In fact, the solution to ( \\thechapter .72 ) reads as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .73)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nNote that any point of @xmath can be obtained by a shift of the origin\nand hence we may put, without loss of generality, @xmath and @xmath to\nzero. Therefore, ( \\thechapter .73 ) simplifies to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .74)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhere now\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nare interpreted as coordinates on the anti-chiral superspace @xmath\nwhereas the others are additional moduli sometimes also referred to as\n\u201chigher times\u201d.\n\nFor finite sums in ( \\thechapter .74 ), @xmath , the polynomials\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .75)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\ncan be regarded as holomorphic sections of the bundle\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .76)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nIn the following, we shall call this space generalized supertwistor\nspace and denote it by @xmath . Note that it can be understood as an\nopen subset in the weighted projective superspace @xmath ,\n\n  -- -- -------- --\n        @xmath   \n        @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- --\n\nSee also our discussion presented in Sec. 8 . Thus, @xmath is a\ncompactified version of @xmath . Moreover, for the particular\ncombination\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nit becomes a formal Calabi-Yau supermanifold. As we shall discuss in\ndetail below, ( \\thechapter .74 ) can then be interpreted as transition\nfunction of a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath over @xmath .\n\n#### Penrose-Ward transform.\n\nLike supertwistor space, also generalized supertwistor space is a part\nof a double fibration. For notational convenience, let us denote the\ngeneralized supertwistor space by @xmath . Furthermore, @xmath , where\n@xmath and @xmath . Then we find\n\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n           ( \\thechapter .77)\n  -- -- -- --------------------\n\nwhere the correspondence space is again a direct product @xmath The\nnatural choice of coordinates on @xmath is\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .78)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nGeneralized supertwistor space @xmath can be covered by two coordinate\npatches, @xmath , and equipped with local coordinates @xmath . On the\nintersection @xmath , they are related by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .79)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nHence, the projections @xmath and @xmath in the fibration ( \\thechapter\n.77 ) act as follows:\n\n  -- -- -------- -------- --------------------\n        @xmath            ( \\thechapter .80)\n                 @xmath   \n                 @xmath   \n  -- -- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nBy virtue of these projections, we obtain the following proposition:\n\n###### Proposition \\thechapter.1.\n\nThere exist the following geometric correspondences:\n\n  (i)    point @xmath in @xmath   @xmath   @xmath in @xmath\n  ------ ------------------------ -------- ------------------------\n  (ii)   @xmath                   @xmath   point @xmath in @xmath\n\nLet @xmath be a rank @xmath holomorphic vector bundle over @xmath and\n@xmath be the pull-back of @xmath to the correspondence space @xmath .\nThe covering of the latter is denoted by @xmath . These bundles are\ndefined by transition functions \u2074\u2070 \u2074\u2070 40 Here, we again use the same\nletter @xmath for both bundles. @xmath which are annihilated by the\nvector fields\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .81)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nas they freely generate the relative tangent sheaf @xmath .

Therefore, we may introduce a Lie-algebra valued\none-form such that\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .84)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nand therefore\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .85)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nWe note that for @xmath this system reduces, of course, to the old one\ngiven by ( \\thechapter .16 ). Moreover, we have the following symmetry\nproperties\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .86)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe compatibility conditions for ( \\thechapter .85 ) read as\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .87)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nHere, we have defined the first order differential operators\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .88)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nWe remark that the components\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\ncoincide with the components @xmath and @xmath of the gauge potential on\n@xmath . In the sequel, we shall refer to ( \\thechapter .87 ) as the\ntruncated @xmath -extended self-dual SYM hierarchy of level @xmath . The\nfull hierarchy is then obtained by taking the limit @xmath .\n\nFrom Eqs. ( \\thechapter .84 ) it follows that\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .89)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- --------------------\n\nwhere @xmath . As in the previous discussion, Eqs. ( \\thechapter .89 )\nmake the Penrose-Ward transform explicit.\n\n#### Field expansions and field equations.\n\nSo far, we have written down the truncated self-dual SYM hierarchies (\n\\thechapter .87 ) quite abstractly as compatibility conditions of a\nlinear system. The next step in our discussion is to construct the\nequations of motion on superfield level equivalent to ( \\thechapter .87\n). To do this, we need to identify the field content. At first sight, we\nexpect to find as fundamental field content (in a covariant formulation)\nthe field content of @xmath -extended self-dual SYM theory plus a tower\nof additional fields depending on the parameters @xmath and @xmath .\nHowever, as we shortly realize, this will not entirely be true. For\n@xmath , we instead find that certain combinations of @xmath play the\nrole of potentials for a lot of the naively expected fields, such that\nthose combinations should be regarded as fundamental fields.\n\nIn the remainder of this paragraph, we shall for simplicity consider the\ncase when @xmath and @xmath . To simplify the subsequent formulas, let\nus also introduce a shorthand index notation\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .90)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFirst, we point out that Eqs.

( \\thechapter .93 ) can be simplified further to\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .95)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nTherefore, the first equation of ( \\thechapter .92 ) implies that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .96)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nwhich are the first two of the superfield equations of motion. We point\nout that for the choice @xmath the set ( \\thechapter .96 ) represents\nnothing but the self-dual YM equations.\n\nNext we consider the Bianchi identity for the triple @xmath . We find\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .97)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nFrom this equation we deduce another two field equations,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .98)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nThe Bianchi identity for @xmath implies\n\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .99)\n  -- -------- -- --------------------\n\nApplying @xmath to ( \\thechapter .99 ), we obtain upon\n(anti)symmetrization the following two equations of motion:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .100)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nFurthermore, the Bianchi identity for the combination @xmath shows that\n@xmath determines a superfield which is totally antisymmetric in the\nindices @xmath , i.e.,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .101)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nUpon acting on both sides by @xmath and contracting the dotted indices,\nwe obtain the field equation for @xmath\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .102)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nThe application of @xmath to @xmath and symmetrization in @xmath and\n@xmath leads by virtue of ( \\thechapter .101 ) to a new superfield which\nis totally antisymmetric in @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .103)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nSome algebraic manipulations show that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .104)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere equation ( \\thechapter .101 ) and the definition ( \\thechapter\n.103 ) have been used. From this equation, the equation of motion for\nthe superfield @xmath can readily be derived. We obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .105)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nAs ( \\thechapter .101 ) implies the existence of the superfield @xmath ,\ndefinition ( \\thechapter .103 ) determines a new superfield @xmath being\ntotally antisymmetric in @xmath and totally symmetric in @xmath , i.e.,\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .106)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nIt is easily shown that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .107)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nAfter some tedious algebra, we obtain from ( \\thechapter .107 ) the\nformula\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .108)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere definition ( \\thechapter .106 ) has been substituted. This\nequation in turn implies the equation of motion for @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .109)\n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhich follows after a somewhat lengthy calculation.\n\nNow one can continue this procedure of defining superfields via the\naction of @xmath and of finding the corresponding equations of motion.\nGenerically, the number of fields one obtains in this way is determined\nby the parameter @xmath , i.e., the most one can get is\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich is, as before, totally antisymmetric in @xmath and totally\nsymmetric in @xmath .\n\nLet us collect the superfield equations of motion for the @xmath\n-extended self-dual truncated SYM hierarchy:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .110)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere the currents @xmath are determined in an obvious manner. Clearly,\nthe system ( \\thechapter .110 ) contains as a subset the @xmath\n-extended self-dual SYM equations. In particular, for the choice @xmath\nit reduces to the latter. Altogether, we have obtained the field content\nof @xmath -extended self-dual SYM theory plus a number of additional\nfields together with their superfield equations of motion.\n\nHowever, as we have already indicated, this is not the end of the story.\nThe system ( \\thechapter .110 ), though describing the truncated\nhierarchy, contains a lot of redundant information. For that reason, it\nshould not be regarded as the fundamental system displaying the\ntruncated hierarchy. In fact, the use of the shorthand index notation (\n\\thechapter .90 ) does not entirely reflect all of the possible index\nsymmetry properties of the appearing superfields. In order to\nincorporate all possibilities, we instead need to write out the explicit\nform of @xmath .\n\nAs before, let us impose the transversal gauge condition\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .111)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhich again reduces super gauge transformations to ordinary ones. Note\nthat in ( \\thechapter .111 ) only @xmath contributes, since the\nfermionic coordinates are totally symmetric under an exchange of their\ndotted indices. The condition ( \\thechapter .111 ) then allows to define\nthe recursion operator @xmath according to\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .112)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nThe third equation of ( \\thechapter .92 ) yields\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .113)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhich states that @xmath does not have a zeroth order component in the\n@xmath -expansion while @xmath does. Therefore, we obtain as a\nfundamental superfield\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .114)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nNote that as @xmath it defines for each @xmath a spin @xmath superfield\nof odd parity.\n\nThe second equation of ( \\thechapter .92 ) reads explicitly as\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nThe contraction with @xmath shows that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .115)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere the symmetrization is only meant between the @xmath . Therefore,\nthe superfield @xmath cannot be regarded as a fundamental field \u2013 the\nsuperfield ( \\thechapter .114 ) plays the role of a potential for the\nformer.\n\nNext we discuss the superfield @xmath . To decide which combinations of\nit are really fundamental, we need some preliminaries. Consider the\nindex set\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nwhich separately is totally symmetric in @xmath and @xmath ,\nrespectively. Then we have the useful formula\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .116)\n                       @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere the parentheses denote, as before, symmetrization of the enclosed\nindices and \u201ccontraction\u201d means antisymmetrization in the respective\nindex pair. The @xmath s for @xmath are combinatorial coefficients,\nwhose explicit form is not needed in the sequel. The proof of (\n\\thechapter .116 ) is quite similar to the one of the Wick theorem and\nwe thus leave it to the interested reader.\n\nThe third equation of ( \\thechapter .92 ) is explicitly given by\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nAfter contraction with @xmath we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .117)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere the definition ( \\thechapter .114 ) has been inserted. Contracting\nthis equation with @xmath , we get\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .118)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nThus, we conclude that @xmath is a composite field and hence not a\nfundamental one. Using formula ( \\thechapter .116 ), we may\nschematically write\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .119)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nThe contraction terms in ( \\thechapter .119 ), however, solely consist\nof composite expressions due to ( \\thechapter .118 ). Therefore, only\nthe superfield\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .120)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nis fundamental. For each combination @xmath it represents an even\nsuperfield with spin @xmath .\n\nNext we need to consider the superfield defined in ( \\thechapter .101 ),\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nBy extending the formula ( \\thechapter .116 ) to the index triple\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand by utilizing the symmetry properties of @xmath , one can show, by\nvirtue of the above arguments, that only the combination\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .121)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nof @xmath remains as a fundamental superfield. It defines for each\n@xmath an odd superfield with spin @xmath .\n\nRepeating this procedure, we deduce from the definition ( \\thechapter\n.103 ) that\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .122)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nis fundamental and it represents one \u2074\u00b9 \u2074\u00b9 41 Note that @xmath . spin\n@xmath superfield which is even. All higher order fields, such as (\n\\thechapter .106 ), yield no further fundamental fields due to the\nantisymmetrization of @xmath , etc. In summary, the fundamental field\ncontent of the truncated self-dual SYM hierarchies is given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath            ( \\thechapter .123)\n              @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere we assume that @xmath . \u2074\u00b2 \u2074\u00b2 42 For @xmath , the field @xmath\nmust be replaced by @xmath . All other naively expected fields, which\nfor instance appear in ( \\thechapter .110 ), are composite expressions\nof the above fields. Note that the field @xmath can be decomposed\naccording to\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .124)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nTherefore, @xmath can be interpreted as a gauge potential while @xmath\nrepresents a collection of Higgs fields.\n\nIt remains to find the superfield equations of motion for the fields (\n\\thechapter .123 ). This, however, is easily done since we have already\nderived ( \\thechapter .110 ). By following the lines which led to (\n\\thechapter .110 ) and by taking into account the definition (\n\\thechapter .114 ), the system ( \\thechapter .110 ) reduces for @xmath\nto\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .125)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nThese are the superfield equations of motion for the truncated @xmath\n-extended self-dual SYM hierarchy.\n\nAbove we have derived the superfield equations of motion. What remains\nis to show how the superfields ( \\thechapter .123 ) are expressed in\nterms of their zeroth order components\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .126)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nand furthermore that the field equations on @xmath (or on @xmath after\nreality conditions have been imposed), i.e., those equations which are\nobtained from the set ( \\thechapter .125 ) by projecting onto the zeroth\norder components ( \\thechapter .126 ) of the superfields ( \\thechapter\n.123 ), imply the compatibility conditions ( \\thechapter .91 ). We will,\nhowever, be not too explicit in showing this equivalence, since the\nargumentation goes along similar lines as those given for the @xmath\n-extended self-dual SYM equations. Here, we just want to give the\noutline.\n\nIn order to write down the superfield expansions, remember that we have\nimposed the gauge ( \\thechapter .111 ) which led to the recursion\noperator @xmath according to ( \\thechapter .112 ). Using the formulas (\n\\thechapter .92 ), ( \\thechapter .99 ), ( \\thechapter .101 ), (\n\\thechapter .103 ), ( \\thechapter .106 ) and ( \\thechapter .115 ), we\nobtain the following recursion relations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .127)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nAn explanation of these formulas is in order. The right hand sides of\nEqs. ( \\thechapter .127 ) depend not only on the fundamental fields (\n\\thechapter .123 ) but also on composite expressions of those fields:\nFor instance, consider the recursion relation of the field @xmath . The\nright hand side of this equation depends on the superfield @xmath .\nHowever, as we learned in ( \\thechapter .119 ), it can be rewritten as\nthe fundamental field @xmath plus contraction terms which are of the\nform ( \\thechapter .118 ). Similar arguments hold for the other\nrecursion relations. Therefore, the right hand sides of ( \\thechapter\n.127 ) can solely be written in terms of the fundamental fields.\nHowever, as these formulas in terms of the fundamental fields look\nrather messy, we refrain from writing them down. Note that the field\n@xmath appearing in the last recursion relation consists only of\ncomposite expressions of the fields ( \\thechapter .118 ). Using Eqs. (\n\\thechapter .127 ), one can now straightforwardly determine the\nsuperfield expansions by a successive application of the recursion\noperator @xmath , since if one knows the expansions to @xmath -th order\nin the fermionic coordinates, the recursions ( \\thechapter .127 ) yield\nthem to next order. But again, this procedure will lead to both\nunenlightening and complicated looking expressions, so we do not present\nthem here. Finally, the recursion operator can be used to show the\nequivalence between the field equations and the constraint equations (\n\\thechapter .87 ). This can be done inductively, i.e., one first assumes\nthat Eqs. ( \\thechapter .125 ) hold to @xmath -th order in the fermionic\ncoordinates, then one applies @xmath to ( \\thechapter .125 ), where\n@xmath is some properly chosen integer, and shows that they also hold to\n@xmath -th order. For more details, see Ref. [ 269 ] .\n\n#### Light-cone gauge.\n\nLet us now give an alternative interpretation of the hierarchy\nequations. First, we rewrite the constraint equations ( \\thechapter .17\n) of @xmath -extended self-dual SYM theory in light-cone gauge. One of\nthe interesting issues of this (non-covariant) gauge is that all the\nequations for all the fields reduce to equations on a single Lie-algebra\nvalued superfield @xmath .\n\nTo be explicit, assume the following expansion\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .128)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\non @xmath . Here, all @xmath -dependence has been made explicit, i.e.,\n@xmath is defined on @xmath . Note that the expansion ( \\thechapter .128\n) can be obtained from some general @xmath by performing the gauge\ntransformation @xmath . Upon substituting ( \\thechapter .128 ) into (\n\\thechapter .16 ), we obtain\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .129)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nPlugging ( \\thechapter .129 ) into the constraint equations (\n\\thechapter .17 ), we find the following set of equations:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .130)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nLet us now come back to the linear system ( \\thechapter .85 ) and the\nconstraint equations ( \\thechapter .87 ) of the truncated self-dual SYM\nhierarchy. Upon imposing light-cone gauge, that is, upon assuming an\nexpansion of the form\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .131)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere now @xmath is defined on @xmath , we find\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .132)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nTherefore, ( \\thechapter .87 ) turns into the following system:\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .133)\n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nClearly, if @xmath solely depends on space-time coordinates, i.e.,\n@xmath is independent of \u201chigher time moduli\u201d, all the extra fields\ndisappear and the above system reduces to ( \\thechapter .130 ).\n\nIf we define\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .134)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nthe system ( \\thechapter .133 ) implies\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .135)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nIf one differentiates these equations with respect to the space-time\ncoordinates, one realizes that the resulting equations coincide with the\nlinearized versions of ( \\thechapter .130 ). Putting it differently,\nsome equations of the self-dual SYM hierarchy can be interpreted as\nequations on symmetries for the self-dual SYM equations.\n\n#### Summary.\n\nAs for @xmath -extended self-dual SYM theory, we may now summarize the\nabove discussion as follows:\n\n###### Theorem \\thechapter.3.\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between gauge equivalence classes\nof local solutions to the truncated @xmath -extended self-dual SYM\nhierarchy of level @xmath on four-dimensional space-time and equivalence\nclasses of holomorphic vector bundles @xmath over generalized\nsupertwistor space @xmath which are smoothly trivial and holomorphically\ntrivial on any projective line @xmath .\n\n#### Example.\n\nLet us now give an explicit example of a truncated hierarchy which also\nmakes contact with our discussion presented in Sec. 8 . Consider the\ntruncated @xmath self-dual SYM hierarchy of level @xmath . Its field\nequations are given by\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .136)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nand follow from ( \\thechapter .125 ). The @xmath self-dual SYM\nequations, which are the first three equations of ( \\thechapter .36 )\n(with @xmath ), are by construction a \u201csubset\u201d of ( \\thechapter .136 ).\nThat is, we apply to the last equation of ( \\thechapter .136 ) the\noperator @xmath and contract with @xmath to obtain\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nEq. ( \\thechapter .115 ) together with\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nimply\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .137)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nThese equations reduce to the @xmath self-dual SYM equations when the\ndotted indices of @xmath and @xmath are chosen to be one. Note that as\n@xmath run only from one to two, the last equation of ( \\thechapter .136\n) can be rewritten in the form\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n     @xmath   @xmath            ( \\thechapter .138)\n              @xmath   @xmath   \n              @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- ---------------------\n\nwhere we have defined an anti-self-dual differential two-form according\nto @xmath . Note that these are exactly the field equations given in (\n\\thechapter .75 ). Hence, ( \\thechapter .75 ) can be interpreted to\ndescribe the @xmath hierarchy of @xmath self-dual SYM theory. Recall\nalso that in this case we have an appropriate action principle leading\nto ( \\thechapter .138 ). It is an interesting fact that even though it\nis not possible to write down an action functional of @xmath self-dual\nSYM theory ( @xmath is not formally Calabi-Yau), it is possible to find\none for a certain hierarchy thereof.\n\n### 19 Nonlocal conservation laws\n\nWhat remains is to give the nonlocal conservation laws associated with\nthe symmetry transformations discussed above. In what follows, we use\nthe ideas of [ 4 ] .\n\n#### Conserved nonlocal currents.\n\nThe compatibility conditions of the linear system ( \\thechapter .16 )\ncan equivalently be written as\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .139)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nRecall further that @xmath as given in ( \\thechapter .8 ) satisfies\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .140)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere the covariant derivatives act in the adjoint representation. Then\nwe may define\n\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n     @xmath      ( \\thechapter .141)\n  -- -------- -- ---------------------\n\nwhere @xmath is a symmetry of ( \\thechapter .139 ) given according to (\n\\thechapter .12 ). Here,\u201ctr\u201d denotes the matrix trace. Notice that this\nexpression is gauge invariant as both, @xmath and @xmath transform in\nthe adjoint representation.

In particular, we first\ngave a detailed twistor description of @xmath -extended self-dual SYM\ntheory. We in addition discussed some related self-dual models which\nfollow from self-dual SYM theory by suitable reductions. Their twistor\nformulation requires certain weighted projective superspaces as twistor\nmanifolds. As we have shown, all these manifolds are formally Calabi-Yau\nthus being naturally equipped with globally well-defined holomorphic\nvolume forms. This property enabled us to also present appropriate\naction functionals for these models. Besides four-dimensional self-dual\nmodels, we also discussed a dimensional reduction to three dimensions.\nAs a result, we obtained certain supersymmetric Bogomolny models. In\nfact, we generalized Hitchin\u2019s twistor construction of non-Abelian\nmonopoles to a (maximally) supersymmetric setting. In addition,\nappropriate action principles on mini-supertwistor space and\nCauchy-Riemann twistor space were given and shown to be equivalent to\nthe action functional reproducing the field equations of the Bogomolny\nmodel. In connection to this, we were naturally led to the notion of\nCauchy-Riemann supermanifolds and to partially hCS theory. Moreover, we\ndiscussed certain complex structure deformations on mini-supertwistor\nspace. As a result, we obtained a supersymmetric Bogomolny model in\nthree space-time dimensions with massive fermionic and scalar fields.\nSimilar to the massless case, we also derived appropriate action\nprinciples on the twistor manifolds in question. We furthermore\ndeveloped novel solution generating techniques by studying infinitesimal\ndeformations of vector bundles on mini-supertwistor and Cauchy-Riemann\ntwistor spaces, respectively. The algorithms were then exemplified in\nthe case where only fields with helicity @xmath and the Higgs field were\nnontrivial. As we argued, the corresponding Abelian configurations give\nrise to the Dirac monopole-antimonopole systems. The fifth chapter of\nthis thesis was devoted to the studies of hidden symmetries of @xmath\n-extended self-dual SYM theory. We first gave a detailed cohomological\ninterpretation of hidden symmetries of self-dual SYM theory. We saw how\ngeneral deformation algebras on the twistor side are mapped to\ncorresponding symmetry algebras in self-dual SYM theory. Kac-Moody\nalgebras as affine extensions of internal symmetries were constructed.\nIn addition, we discussed affine extensions of space-time symmetries,\nthat is, we obtained an affinization of the superconformal algebra. The\nalgebra in question turned out to be of Kac-Moody-Virasoro-type. As was\nargued, the existence of such infinite-dimensional algebras of hidden\nnonlocal symmetries originates from the fact that the full group of\ncontinuous transformations acting on the space of holomorphic vector\nbundles over supertwistor space is a semi-direct product of the group of\nlocal holomorphic automorphisms of the supertwistor space and of the\ngroup of one-cochains with respect to a certain covering with values in\nthe sheaf of holomorphic maps of supertwistor space into the gauge\ngroup. Besides symmetry algebras, we constructed certain self-dual SYM\nhierarchies. The basis of this construction was a generalization of\ntwistor space. As we saw, such a hierarchy consists of an infinite\nsystem of partial differential equations, where the self-dual SYM\nequations are embedded in. As was shown, the lowest level flows of the\nhierarchies in question represent supertranslations. Indeed, the\nexistence of such hierarchies allows us to embed a given solution into\nan infinite-parameter family of new solutions. Moreover, a detailed\nderivation of the field equations together with the corresponding\nsuperfield expansions for the truncated hierarchies was presented.\n\nHowever, there are certainly a lot of open issues and questions which\ndeserve further investigations:\n\n-   An obvious and challenging task is the generalization of the\n    constructions given in Chap. \\thechapter to the full SYM theory. In\n    Chap. \\thechapter , we saw how solutions to the field equations of\n    @xmath SYM theory are related to certain holomorphic vector bundles\n    over superambitwistor space @xmath . In principle, the algorithms\n    relating infinitesimal deformations of vector bundles over\n    supertwistor space to symmetries being developed for self-dual SYM\n    theory in Chap. \\thechapter can also be applied to full @xmath SYM\n    theory. This is basically because of the vanishing of appropriate\n    cohomology groups. Furthermore, as a matter of fact, Thm.\n    \\thechapter .2. also applies to the full case which is due to the\n    structural similarity of the corresponding linear system. Hence,\n    once given a suitable deformation algebra (of Lie-algebra type) on\n    the twistor side, one automatically has a hidden symmetry algebra in\n    full @xmath SYM theory. \u2074\u2074 \u2074\u2074 44 After having finished this thesis,\n    an alternative approach of discussing hidden symmetries of @xmath\n    SYM theory in terms of integrable hierarchies has been proposed in [\n    211 ] .\n\n-   Besides questions associated with symmetry transformations, etc.,\n    one in addition needs to write down the related conserved nonlocal\n    currents and charges \u2013 not only as superfields but also in\n    components. In Chap. \\thechapter , we considered particular nonlocal\n    conservation laws associated with any symmetry of the field\n    equations. It is desirable, to generalize such constructions to the\n    full @xmath theory. Presumably, the construction of fermionic\n    conserved currents \u2074\u2075 \u2074\u2075 45 See, e.g., [ 3 ] for such constructions\n    in ten-dimensional SYM theory. , that is, currents obeying equations\n    of the form @xmath will simplify the discussion, since with the help\n    of those one may derive conservation laws of the form @xmath by way\n    of\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n    However, to proceed further (also in view of passing to the quantum\n    theory) and to clarify the physical significance of such currents,\n    one clearly needs to find their superfield expansions. In addition,\n    one should then compute the classical Poisson brackets among the\n    corresponding charges. After passing to the quantum regime, a\n    challenging task will be to make contact with the quantum symmetry\n    algebras considered in [ 83 , 84 ] . Moreover, it would also be\n    interesting to see how such quantum symmetry algebras fit into the\n    context of twistor string theory [ 266 ] and how they can be\n    understood within the recently proposed twistor approach to @xmath\n    SYM theory [ 57 ] .\n\n-   Another issue also worthwhile to explore is the construction of\n    hidden symmetry algebras and hierarchies of gravity theories, in\n    particular of self-dual supergravity (see Ref. [ 233 ] for the case\n    of maximal @xmath supersymmetry). \u2074\u2076 \u2074\u2076 46 In [ 176 ] \u2013 [ 180 ] , an\n    extension of Penrose\u2019s nonlinear graviton construction [ 193 ] to a\n    supersymmetric setting has been discussed. By applying similar\n    techniques as those presented in Chap. \\thechapter , one will\n    eventually obtain hidden infinite-dimensional symmetry algebras of\n    the self-dual supergravity equations, generalizing the results known\n    for self-dual gravity. See Refs. [ 59 , 240 , 187 , 203 , 130 , 148\n    , 87 , 88 ] , for instance.\n\n-   Recall that it was conjectured by Ward [ 256 , 257 , 258 ] that all\n    integrable models in less than four space-time dimensions can be\n    obtained from self-dual YM theory in four dimensions. Examples are\n    the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation,\n    the sine-Gordon model, etc. In particular, they all follow from the\n    self-dual YM equations upon implementing suitable algebraic ans\u00e4tze\n    for the gauge potential followed by a dimensional reduction. In a\n    similar spirit, the Ward conjecture can be \u201csupersymmetrically\u201d\n    extended in order to derive the supersymmetric versions of the\n    above-mentioned models. Therefore, it would be of interest to take\n    the @xmath -extended self-dual SYM hierarchy presented in Chap.\n    \\thechapter and to derive the corresponding super hierarchies of\n    these integrable systems in less than four dimensions.\n\n-   Finally, we address additional points for further investigations\n    being related to noncommutative field theories. In [ 221 ] , we (in\n    collaboration with Christian S\u00e4mann) considered @xmath SYM theory on\n    a nonanticommutative superspace, that is, instead of @xmath we took\n    @xmath , where @xmath denotes the Clifford algebra of @xmath\n\n      -- -------- --\n         @xmath   \n      -- -------- --\n\n    Upon introducing an involution corresponding to Euclidean signature,\n    we derived the superfield expansions and the field equations of\n    deformed @xmath SYM theory to first order in the deformation\n    parameter @xmath . In showing this, we proposed an extension of the\n    Seiberg-Witten map [ 226 ] to superspace. Our derivation was based\n    on the @xmath formulation of the constraint system. Clearly, one may\n    straightforwardly translate our results into the @xmath formulation\n    of @xmath SYM theory. It would then be of interest to establish a\n    nonanticommutative version of the superambitwistor correspondence.\n    In particular, Eqs. ( \\thechapter .16 ) induce a nonanticommutative\n    structure on superambitwistor space. In addition, generalizing the\n    results of [ 174 ] , it should in principle be possible to derive a\n    corresponding action functional of deformed @xmath SYM theory which\n    is still lacking. Moreover, splitting and dressing methods obtained\n    from twistor theory have successfully been applied to the\n    construction of solitons and instantons in noncommutative field\n    theories. See, e.g., Refs. [ 149 , 150 , 151 , 268 , 118 , 123 , 152\n    , 153 , 86 , 261 ] . It would also be interesting to see how the\n    solution generating techniques as considered in, e.g., Chap.\n    \\thechapter need to be generalized to noncommutative field theories.\n    Partial results on that matter have already been given in [ 155 ] .\n    In addition, the methods used in this thesis might also shed light\n    on the question of hidden symmetries in\n    noncommutative\/nonanticommutative field theories.\n","output":["In this thesis, we report on different aspects of integrability in\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. The main tool of investigation is twistor\ngeometry. In trying to be self-contained, we first present a brief review about\nthe basics of twistor geometry. We then focus on the twistor description of\nvarious gauge theories in four and three space-time dimensions.

In particular, a\ndetailed twistor description of self-dual SYM theory is presented.\nFurthermore, we introduce certain self-dual models which are, in fact,\nobtainable from self-dual SYM theory by a suitable reduction. Some of\nthem can be interpreted within the context of topological field\ntheories. To provide a twistor description of these models, we propose\nweighted projective superspaces as twistor spaces. These spaces turn out\nto be Calabi-Yau supermanifolds. Therefore, it is possible to write down\nappropriate action principles, as well. In chapter three, we then deal\nwith the twistor formulation of a certain supersymmetric Bogomolny model\nin three space-time dimensions. The nonsupersymmetric version of this\nmodel describes static Yang-Mills-Higgs monopoles in the\nPrasad-Sommerfield limit. In particular, we consider a supersymmetric\nextension of mini-twistor space. This space is in turn a part of a\ncertain double fibration. It is then possible to formulate a\nChern-Simons type theory on the correspondence space of this fibration.\nAs we explain, this theory describes partially holomorphic vector\nbundles. It should be noticed that the correspondence space can be\nequipped with a Cauchy-Riemann structure. Moreover, we formulate\nholomorphic BF theory on mini-supertwistor space. We then prove that the\nmoduli spaces of all three theories are bijective. In addition, complex\nstructure deformations on mini-supertwistor space are investigated\neventually resulting in a twistor correspondence involving a\nsupersymmetric Bogomolny model with massive fields.

{"input":"### Chapter 1 Introduction\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly one of the greatest difficulties, if not the greatest of\nall, in the way of obtaining an understanding of the real distribution\nof the stars in space, lies in our uncertainty about the amount of loss\nsuffered by the light on its way to the observer.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn, 1909\n\n#### 1.1 Background\n\nQuasars are the most luminous and exotic objects known in the universe\nand are the only objects observable in large numbers at sizeable\nredshifts. The most distant quasars known at present have redshifts of\n@xmath , corresponding to epochs at which the universe was less than 10%\nof its present age. The standard model (Lynden-Bell, 1969) of a possible\nsupermassive ( @xmath ) black hole fueled by an accretion disk, provides\na laboratory for studying the physical processes of matter under extreme\nconditions.\n\nQuasars are of great importance in astronomy. The fact that they can be\nseen at early epochs in the universe provides constraints on models for\ngalaxy formation and evolution of the large scale structure. Recently,\nKatz @xmath (1994) have shown that the inferred quasar number density at\nhigh redshifts can be easily accommodated in hierarchical galaxy\nformation theories such as CDM in which galaxies form first followed by\nlarger scale structures. As shown by Loeb (1993), the existence of\nquasars at high redshift implies rapid collapse and very efficient\ncooling of high mass, dark matter haloes to form black holes on\nrelatively short timescales of @xmath Gyr.\n\nHigh redshift quasars provide background light sources to probe the\nnature and matter content of the intervening medium. This has been\nachieved through two means. First, the existence of galaxies,\nproto-galaxies and gas clouds absorb the light from background quasars\ngiving rise to absorption-line features in quasar spectra.\nAbsorption-line studies have provided important constraints on a wealth\nof physical parameters, including evolution of the neutral hydrogen\ncontent in the universe. Second, gravitational lensing of background\nquasars where light is deflected by intervening matter, can be used to\nprobe mass concentrations in galaxies, haloes and on galaxy cluster\nscales. Quasars therefore remain an important tool in cosmology for\nexamining the distribution and evolutionary history of matter in the\nuniverse.\n\nDespite recent attempts for improving selection techniques for finding\nquasa- rs, a majority of quasar surveys have been based on criteria\nwhich assume strong blue continua or a UV-excess (eg. Schmidt & Green,\n1983). Such surveys however are believed to be seriously incomplete as\nindicated by the increasing numbers of quasars being discovered in X-ray\nand radio surveys (see Crampton, 1991 for a review). Optical studies are\nbiased against quasars with weak optical continuum emission. Strong\nevidence for a population of optically-weak quasars has recently been\nprovided by optical follow-up observations of complete radio-selected\nsamples (eg. Kollgaard @xmath 1995 and references therein; Webster\n@xmath 1995). A significant proportion of these sources also have\noptical continuum slopes much redder than those quasars selected by\nstandard optical techniques. We hypothesise that the most probable\nexplanation is reddening by dust (Webster @xmath 1995).\n\nAny given amount of dust along the line-of-sight is expected to\ndrastically extinguish the observed UV-optical flux leading to a\nselection bias. Such dust may be located in the local quasar\nenvironment, somewhere along the line-of-sight; for example in\nintervening dusty galaxies, or a combination of both. If a majority of\nquasars are obscured by line-of-sight dust, say in intervening galaxies,\nthen studies which use bright optical quasars to detect absorption lines\nand gravitational lens systems will have underestimated their true\nabundance. Therefore, an understanding of the effects of dust on quasars\nis essential. Whatever the mechanism for the optical reddening, if the\nbulk of quasars remain undetected, then all statistical studies of\nevolution in the early universe may be seriously incomplete.\n\nIn this thesis, I will explore two issues: the problem of incompleteness\nin optical quasar surveys due to obscuration by dust, and the\ninterpretation of the relatively red optical continua observed in a\ncomplete sample of radio quasars (the \u2018Parkes sample\u2019). The amount of\ndust involved, both along the line-of-sight and in the quasar environs\nis investigated. A number of predictions of the dust reddening\nhypothesis for Parkes quasars are presented and compared with\nobservations. A more specific outline of the thesis follows.\n\n##### 1.1.1 Plan of this Thesis\n\nThis thesis is divided into two parts. Part I (Chapters 2, 3 and 4) is\nconcerned with the observational consequences of an intervening\ncosmological dust component and uses the Parkes sample to constrain the\namount of dust involved. Chapter 2 explores the dependence of the\nspatial extent of foreground dust distributions on obscuration of\nbackground sources. We show that \u2018large-scale\u2019 diffusely distributed\ndust (eg. on galaxy cluster scales) is more effective at obscuring\nbackground sources than dust confined to the visible extent of normal\ngalaxies. In Chapter 3, we simulate obscuration by dust located in\ngalaxies randomly distributed along the line-of-sight. We use a range of\nparameters that may describe the dust properties of galaxies to explore\nimplications on optical counts of quasars. In Chapter 4, we explore the\neffects of more complicated models of dusty line-of-sight galaxies where\nthe dust content evolves. Implications on quasar and absorption-line\nstatistics are investigated. We use the Parkes sample to constrain\nevolutionary and physical properties of dust in intervening systems. The\ncontribution of line-of-sight galactic dust to the reddening observed in\nthis sample is quantified.\n\nPart II (Chapters 5, 6 and 7) examines the continuum properties of\nParkes quasars in the framework of a number of absorption and emission\nmechanisms to assess the importance of extinction by dust. Chapter 5\nexplores two classes of theories to explain the reddening observed:\n\u2018intrinsically red\u2019 AGN emission models, and dust extinction models.\nSimple models are developed and tested against the available data. For\nthe dust model, we explore the effects of dust on soft X-rays and\ncompare our predictions with soft X-ray data for Parkes sources.\nPossible physical dust properties are also discussed. In Chapter 6, we\nconsider the possibility that a \u2018red\u2019 stellar component from the host\ngalaxies of Parkes quasars contributes to the observed reddening. We\nquantify this contribution using a new, unbiased spectral fitting\nmethod. In Chapter 7, we present a near-infrared polarisation study of\nParkes quasars to distinguish between two models for the reddening: the\nsynchrotron emission model and the dust model. Combined with spectral\nand photometric data, the observations are used to constrain various\nemission and dust absorption models.\n\nAll key results are summarised in Chapter 8. Some avenues for further\nresearch suggested from my work on Parkes quasars is also discussed.\n\n#### 1.2 The Study of Cosmic Dust\n\nThe first indications that photometric observations of astronomical\nobjects were affected by dust date back to the 1930s when stellar\nobservations by Trumpler (1930) and Stebbins @xmath (1934) showed that\ndistant parts of the galaxy were obscured by interstellar dust. Since\nthen, observations have established that dust is an important\nconstituent of galaxies. Its presence has significantly contributed to\nour understanding of star formation rates and on the evolution of galaxy\npopulations with cosmic time (Franceschini @xmath 1994; De Zotti @xmath\n1995). Recent observations of local galaxies that are suspected of\nhaving intense regions of star formation are also observed to be very\ndusty (see Rieke & Lebofsky, 1979 for a review). Dust is crucial in star\nforming regions in that it strongly absorbs the UV radiation responsible\nfor molecular dissociations and provides the site for the formation of\n@xmath - the most abundant molecule in star forming clouds. Dust also\ncontrols the temperature of the interstellar medium (ISM). The initial\ncooling of dense molecular clouds through dust-gas interactions enhances\ngravitational collapse allowing star formation to occur.\n\nThe main questions about dust refer generally to its composition, grain\nsize and temperature. Our knowledge primarily comes from observations of\nthe ISM of our Galaxy and simulations in the laboratory. The grains\nforming cosmic dust consist of silicates, graphite, dirty ices and heavy\nmetals and range in size from @xmath - @xmath m (Draine, 1981). Grains\ntypical of the ISM of our galaxy form from the condensation of heavy\nelements initially synthesised in supernovae and grow by accretion in\ndense molecular clouds, depending crucially on the environment in the\nISM. Grains are expected to be efficiently destroyed by supernova shocks\nin the ISM of galaxies (McKee @xmath 1987). Recently however, studies\nhave shown that molecular star forming clouds can supply the total ISM\ndust in less than @xmath years, at a rate faster than it is destroyed by\nsupernovae (Wang, 1991a and references therein).\n\nDust absorbs the UV-optical radiation in star-forming regions and\nre-radiates absorbed energy in the far-infrared part of the spectrum (\n@xmath m-1mm). Observations by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS)\nhave shown that radiation by dust from galaxies is comparable to what we\nsee in the visual band (Soifer, Houck & Neugebauer, 1986). Since dust in\nmostly made of heavy elements, its evolution is directly connected to\nchemical evolution in the ISM of galaxies. Consequently, observations at\ninfrared wavelengths have contributed significantly towards our\nunderstanding of the evolutionary properties of galaxies and their\ncontribution to the integrated background radiation (Wang 1991a; 1991b).\n\n#### 1.3 The Interaction of Radiation with Dust and Observational\nDiagnostics\n\nThe two major processes in which dust grains can alter the transmission\nof electromagnetic radiation are absorption and scattering. These\neffects, collectively referred to as extinction, are the best studied\nproperty of cosmic dust since they can be accurately determined over a\nrange of wavelengths. A determination of the extinction properties are\nessential for correcting astronomical measurements for the effects of\ndust. Other very important diagnostics of dust are its emission\nproperties, both in spectral features and continuum emission in the\ninfrared, and its polarisation properties. These properties are briefly\ndiscussed below. An excellent and thorough analysis of the physics can\nbe found in Hoyle & Wickramasinghe (1991).\n\n##### 1.3.1 Extinction\n\nExtinction of radiation at optical wavelengths by dust is largely due to\nscattering, with the effects of absorption becoming important at shorter\nwavelengths. Light from a source shining through dust along the\nline-of-sight has its flux reduced according to\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the flux that would be received at Earth in the absence\nof dust, @xmath is the actual flux observed and @xmath is defined as the\noptical depth at the wavelength observed. This is derived by solving the\nradiative transfer equation for a homogeneous slab of dust. The\nextinction in magnitudes is related to the optical depth by @xmath . The\nextinction law is defined by specified values of @xmath at a range of\nwavelengths and can generally be expressed as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath relates to the amount of dust and the function @xmath\ndepends on the optical properties of grains.\n\nExtinction laws in our galaxy are primarily determined from observations\nof stars by comparing the spectral energy distribution of a reddened\nstar with that of an unreddened star of similar spectral-type. The\ngalactic interstellar extinction laws of Savage & Mathis (1979) and\nSeaton (1979) are commonly used to model the effects of dust and correct\nastronomical observations. Pei (1992) has obtained excellent empirical\nfits for extinction curves derived from previous studies for the Milky\nWay, LMC and SMC. These are shown in Fig. 1.1 , where the extinction is\nmeasured relative to that observed in the @xmath -band, ie. @xmath . The\nstriking feature is the almost universal behaviour at wavelengths @xmath\n\u00c5 @xmath . The \u201cmean\u201d interstellar extinction curve derived in our\ngalaxy varies by a factor of @xmath in extinction over the range @xmath\nm and exhibits both continuous extinction and a strong feature known as\nthe \u201c2175\u00c5 @xmath bump\u201d over which the extinction varies appreciably.\nThis feature decreases in strength going from the Milky Way to the LMC\nand SMC. This bump is believed to be due to graphite, however its origin\nis not as yet well understood.\n\nIt is remarkable that a recent study by Calzetti @xmath (1994) finds no\nevidence for a 2175\u00c5 @xmath bump feature in the extinction curves of\nnearby galaxies (see dashed curve in Fig. 1.1 ). These authors also find\nthe extinction laws for a number of galaxies to be considerably flatter\nas a function of wavelength in the UV, with extinction measures smaller\nby factors of @xmath at @xmath \u00c5 @xmath than those in the Milky Way.\nThis behaviour is commonly referred to as \u201cgray extinction\u201d. They\nattribute the \u201cgrayness\u201d as being due to their method of derivation.\nTheir method relies on examining correlations between the Balmer line\nratio ( @xmath ; see section 5.5.3 ) and optical continuum reddening.\nEach of these quantities is expected to arise from different physical\nregions in the galaxies: the hydrogen lines from hot ionizing stars\nassociated with dusty regions, and the continuum from older stellar\npopulations which may have had time to drift away from the dustier\nregions. Thus, the continuum measurements may be weighted mostly by\nregions of lowest extinction. The absence of the 2175\u00c5 @xmath bump\nfeature has been interpreted as being either due to effects of\nscattering of light within extended dust-regions into the line-of-sight\n(therefore reducing the effective extinction in the UV), or to a\nchemical composition of grains different from that in the Milky Way.\n\nThere have been many efforts devoted to the understanding of the\ncomposition and optical properties of dust grains giving rise to the\nvarious extinction laws, in particular that of the Milky Way (Mathis,\nRumpl & Nordsiek, 1977; Drain & Lee, 1984). These authors have studied\ndifferent chemical mixtures to reproduce the Milky Way extinction law\nand as yet no definite agreement exists. Draine & Lee (1984) find that\nfor a @xmath graphite and silicate mixture, the extinction (or the\nfunction @xmath in Eqn. 1.2 ) at optical wavelengths varies as a\nfunction of wavelength as @xmath , where @xmath -2. This is derived\nusing the optical properties of grains and the theory of light\nscattering which involves a solution of Maxwell\u2019s equations. The index\n@xmath depends on the characteristic grain size \u201c @xmath \u201d, and its\ndependence has been studied via the extinction efficiencies @xmath of\nspherical dielectric grains (eg. Greenberg, 1968). In the\noptical\u2013to\u2013near-infrared, the extinction law in our galaxy approaches\nthe characteristic behaviour @xmath . This is expected when the sizes of\nindividual grains become comparable with the wavelength of light (\n@xmath ), where the extinction efficiency is given by @xmath . For\ncomparison, when the grain sizes are very small compared with the\nwavelength ( @xmath ), the extinction efficiency varies as @xmath ,\nknown as the Rayleigh scattering regime. When @xmath , @xmath levels off\nasymptotically to about twice the geometric cross-section of the grain.\nHence, larger grain sizes produce a flatter dependence with wavelength.\n\nApproaching higher energies such as X-rays, and depending on the grain\nsize, grains become somewhat transparent. Using graphite and silicate\nmixtures, Laor & Draine (1993) show that the extinction decreases by at\nleast two orders of magnitude from 0.1-10keV (see Fig. 5.9 ). At\nenergies @xmath keV, the dust extinction law becomes the same as if all\ngrains were composed of neutral atoms in the gas phase rather than\npossibly being ionized. In this case, atomic X-ray absorption will\ndominate the optical depth. At soft energies ( @xmath keV), the X-ray\nabsorption cross-section is dominated mostly by H and He which, given a\nlarge neutral fraction, can attenuate the X-ray flux by more than 80%,\neven for relatively low values of the hydrogen column density (ie.\n@xmath ). At @xmath keV however, absorption becomes dominated by metals\n(primarily the K-edges of oxygen and carbon and to a lesser extent Ne,\nMg, Si, S and Fe - Morrison & McCammon, 1983). See section 5.6.1 for\nmore details. Metals in dust grains can be shielded from the effects of\nX-ray absorption, however, modifications of only a few percent to their\nabsorption cross-section are expected, even at soft X-ray energies\n(Fireman, 1974).\n\n##### 1.3.2 Other Diagnostics\n\nIn addition to general extinction over a continuous wavelength range,\nthe presence of spectral absorption features can be used to confirm the\npresence of dust, and also provide information regarding the\ncompositions and nature of the grains. Apart from the 2175\u00c5 @xmath bump\nin our galaxy, strong @xmath m and @xmath m absorption\/emission features\nare almost always seen in our ISM and the ISM of a number of external\ngalaxies when the dust is optically thin to its own emission, ie. @xmath\n. These features have been attributed to silicate grains with sizes\n@xmath m (Laor & Draine, 1993). These authors also show that their\nabsence in the near-infrared spectra of active galaxies (including\nluminous quasars) provides important constraints on the chemical and\nphysical properties of dust in such sources (see section 1.5.2 for more\ndetails).\n\nInfrared (IR) continuum emission from dust grains can arise through two\nmeans. First, by absorption and heating by UV photons and subsequent\nre-radiation at infrared wavelengths and second, by steady state\nemission or fluorescence. The latter process occurs for far-infrared\nwavelengths, @xmath m. An important diagnostic of this emission is in\nthe determination of dust temperatures and\/or masses. These can be\ncalculated by assuming that dust grains are in thermal equilibrium with\ntheir surroundings so that the emission can be approximated as a\nblackbody. The blackbody radiation law can be written\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nGiven measurements of the infrared flux at two or more frequencies, the\ndust temperature @xmath can be determined by fitting equation 1.3. In\nthe determination of dust masses however, we define an additional\nquantity called the dust emissivity, @xmath , with units @xmath per gram\nof dust. From galactic observations at sub-mm wavelengths, @xmath (Chini\n& Kr\u00fcgel, 1994). As an example, let us consider an IR-source at some\nredshift @xmath , whose observed IR flux is due to thermal dust\nemission. The dust mass, assuming the dust is optically thin to its own\nemission with effective temperature @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath are the observed and rest frame frequencies\nrespectively, @xmath is the dust emissivity defined above, @xmath the\nluminosity distance and @xmath the observed flux. The factor @xmath is\ndue to the decrease in frequency bandpass in the observer\u2019s frame with\nincreasing redshift. Depending on the temperature @xmath and emission\nfrequency @xmath , there are two limiting behaviours for the blackbody\nradiation law (Eqn. 1.3 ) which are commonly used to simplify\ncalculations. One limit is the well known Rayleigh-Jean\u2019s law and is\napplicable in the low frequency limit:\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (1.5)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nIn the high frequency limit, we have Wien\u2019s law:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nAs a general rule, the blackbody law allows us to approximate the\neffective dust temperature through the relation:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (1.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the wavelength at which the emission peaks (ie. where\n@xmath is a maximum). If dust is to survive, it is estimated that grains\ncannot exceed a temperature of @xmath K after which evaporation or\nsublimation will occur. Thus, we expect dust to emit only at wavelengths\n@xmath m. Evidence for hot dust approaching the limiting temperature\n@xmath K is believed to exist in the environments of quasars and other\nactive galaxies, giving rise to the characteristic near-IR bump observed\nin the range @xmath m (Sanders @xmath 1989).\n\nPolarisation of radiation produced by scattering or transmission through\naligned dust particles provides a useful diagnostic for determining the\nsize distribution of dust grains, the conditions under which grains can\nbe aligned (eg. magnetic field geometry) and most importantly, the\ngeometry of scattering regions (Whittet, 1992 and references therein).\nIn the Milky Way, where the most accurate determinations of\ndust-polarisation have been made, the polarisation is of order a few\npercent. The polarisation properties of dust are less well determined\nthan those of extinction, however, optical polarisation coincident with\nextinction or IR emission may confirm that the latter processes are due\nto dust.\n\nTo summarise, the difficulties in drawing a consistent picture of the\ninteraction of dust grains with radiation lie in their chemical and\nphysical properties, such as composition and grain size distribution.\nThese properties, which are primarily determined from extinction\nmeasures, are very sensitive to the geometrical distribution of dust in\ngalaxies and hence subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\n#### 1.4 The Cosmological Distribution of Dust\n\nInfrared and optical studies of local galaxies have provided a good\ndescription of their dust content, however, the study of dust at high\nredshift has yet to produce conclusive results. Despite many efforts for\ndetecting high redshift ( @xmath ) galaxies in the optical, it is\nsuspected that large numbers are obscured by dust associated with\nintense star formation activity (Djorgovski @xmath 1993; Franceschini,\n1994). Our knowledge regarding high redshift dust (at @xmath ) has\nprimarily come from two sources. First, by direct imaging of\nintrinsically luminous, high redshift radio galaxies at far-IR to mm\nwavelengths, and second, from studies of QSO absorption line systems.\nThe observational status is given below.\n\n##### 1.4.1 Dust in Local Galaxies\n\nVarious morphological and spectral studies of nearby galaxies have\ndemonstrated that the bulk of their IR luminosity originates from\nextended emission by dust. The local far-infrared luminosity density is\nestimated to be about one-third of the optical luminosity density (eg.\nSaunders @xmath 1990). This emission has lead to estimates of galactic\ndust masses in the range @xmath - @xmath , ie. @xmath of the total mass\nin a typical galaxy (Rieke & Lebofsky, 1979). Furthermore, Zaritsky\n(1994a) has provided strong evidence for diffuse dust haloes extending\nto distances @xmath kpc from the centers of galaxies. This was provided\nby studies of the colours of distant galaxies seen through the haloes of\nnearby spirals, where background galaxies at smaller projected\nseparations were statistically redder than those in outer regions. If\nsuch a diffuse component proves to be common, then the local dust\ncontent is expected to be greater by almost an order of magnitude than\npreviously estimated using IR emission alone.\n\nIn cases where IR emission is not observed, measures of the dust optical\ndepth using surface photometry can provide a useful diagnostic for\ndetermining the dust content of galaxies. This method is based on\nstatistical studies of the dependence of optical surface brightness on\nthe viewing angle of a spiral disk. For a transparent disk, the surface\nbrightness depends sensitively on inclination, while for an opaque\n\u201cdusty\u201d disk it does not (Holmberg, 1958). This allows limits to be\nplaced on the dust optical depth. One caveat however is that this method\nis limited to galaxies of relatively high surface brightness. Recent\nstudies predict central @xmath -band optical depths for spiral galaxies\nin the range @xmath (Giovanelli @xmath 1994 and references therein). In\nE\/SO galaxies, extinction is not as well studied, though not believed to\nbe as large. Goudfrooij @xmath (1994a; 1994b; 1995) suggest there is a\ndiffuse component with @xmath . These optical depth properties still\nremain an open question.\n\n##### 1.4.2 High Redshift Dust and Evolution\n\nLuminous radio galaxies can be studied out to large cosmological\ndistances. Recently, a number of radio galaxies at redshifts @xmath have\nbeen observed to emit a strong far-IR to mm continuum. If the emission\nis assumed to be thermal emission from dust, then dust masses comparable\nto those of local galaxies are implied (Chini & Kr\u00fcgel, 1994 and\nreferences therein). The detection of dusty objects at @xmath is\npuzzling. One might expect that the majority of objects at high\nredshifts (corresponding to epochs only @xmath of the age of the\nuniverse) still contain a large reservoir of primordial gas. The\npresence of dust implies an early episode of star formation and provides\na step towards understanding the interstellar medium, and hence\nformation and evolution of galaxies at high redshift.\n\nStrong evidence for the existence of dust at high redshift is provided\nby studies of QSO absorption line systems. The highest neutral hydrogen\ncolumn density systems known as the damped Ly- @xmath absorbers are\nbelieved to be the progenitors of present day galactic disks.\nObservations of trace metals such as Ni, Cr and Zn in these systems have\nprovided an opportunity to study chemical and dust evolution in galaxies\nat high redshift (Meyer & Roth, 1990; Pettini @xmath 1994; 1997).\n\nThe relative strengths of various metal ions in the spectra of\nbackground quasars have been used to infer the amount of metal depletion\nin the gas phase and hence the amount of dust assuming depletion onto\ngrains. Recent studies of metal absorption line systems towards\nredshifts @xmath have indicated metallicities which are @xmath solar and\ndust-to-gas ratios less than @xmath of the galactic value (Meyer, Welty\nand York, 1989; Pettini @xmath 1994). This constraint on the dust-to-gas\nratio is also in agreement with studies by Fall @xmath (1989) who\ncompared the spectra of quasars that have damped Ly- @xmath with those\nthat do not. They found that quasars with damped Ly- @xmath absorption\nin their spectra had spectral slopes somewhat redder than those without\nabsorption.\n\nThe lower metal abundances in QSO absorption systems relative to those\nin the galaxy have been interpreted as evidence for less chemical\nenrichment at high @xmath . It is important to note however that such\nmeasurements may be subject to considerable observational bias. Existing\nobservations of QSOs with damped Ly- @xmath absorption lines are drawn\nmostly from optically-selected, magnitude-limited samples and hence, it\nis possible than an unrecognised population of highly reddened QSOs may\nescape detection due to heavy obscuration by dust in damped Ly- @xmath\nsystems. Thus, present QSO absorption line studies may only\npreferentially pick out chemically unevolved gas. Fall & Pei (1993) have\nattempted to correct for this bias, estimating that the true metal and\ndust content may be on average 2-3 times greater than that deduced\nobservationally.\n\nThere seems to be considerable difficulty in applying the results of QSO\nabsorption line studies and high redshift radio galaxy surveys to the\nstudy of primeval galaxies and evolution of their ISM. It may be some\ntime before large enough, complete statistical samples can be compiled\nso to obtain a consistent picture of chemical and dust evolution in the\nuniverse. At present, we must resort to dynamical modelling of stellar\nprocesses in galaxies to gain some insight into this problem (eg. Wang\n1991a and references therein).\n\n#### 1.5 Dust and Quasars\n\nIn my study of the effects of dust on the properties and identification\nof quasars in the optical, I shall investigate two possibilities for its\nlocation. First, I will consider extrinsic or line-of-sight dust\nassociated with foreground galaxies and second, intrinsic dust or dust\nphysically associated with the quasars themselves. A brief review of the\nstatus on each of these studies is given below.\n\n##### 1.5.1 Obscuration of Quasars by Intervening Dust\n\nStudies investigating the effects of intervening, cosmologically\ndistributed dust on background quasars were initially motivated by the\napparent lack of high redshift quasars in the optical (McKee &\nPetrosian, 1974; Cheney & Rowan-Robinson, 1981). Based on observations\nof individual quasar spectra, colours and counts as a function of\nredshift, it was concluded that uniformly distributed intergalactic dust\nas distinct from galactic dust was not likely to be a large source of\nextinction. From thereon, modelling of this problem assumed all dust to\nbe situated in clumps or hypothesised dusty galaxies along the\nline-of-sight.\n\nVarious theoretical studies by Ostriker & Heisler (1984); Heisler &\nOstriker (1988), Fall & Pei (1989, 1993) and Wright (1986, 1990)\nconclude that at least @xmath of bright quasars at redshifts @xmath may\nbe obscured by intervening galactic dust in the optical. A more refined\ntreatment was undertaken by Wright (1990) who stressed the importance of\ngalaxy \u201chardness\u201d on the properties of a quasar sample subject to both\nflux and colour selection effects. The term \u201chardness\u201d depends on the\nassumed spatial distribution for dust optical depth through an\nindividual galaxy. For optical depth profiles which are smooth or\n\u201cfuzzy\u201d around the edges (eg. an exponential or King model), the\n\u201chardness\u201d is defined by the magnitude of the central optical depth. For\ncentral @xmath -band optical depths @xmath , galaxies were defined as\nbeing \u201chard-edged\u201d up to a typical scale radius, while for @xmath ,\ngalaxies were defined as \u201csoft-edged\u201d. For \u201csharp-edged\u201d optical depth\nprofiles (eg. an optical depth which is uniform throughout a finite\nprojected area and zero outside - as considered by Ostriker & Heisler,\n1984), the hardness is defined by the magnitude of this optical depth.\nWright (1990) found that galaxies which are \u201csoft\u201d around the edges will\ncause many background quasars to \u2018appear\u2019 reddened without actually\nremoving them from a flux-limited sample.\n\nIt is important to note that these studies are extremely model\ndependent. The most crucial parameters are the number of absorbing\ngalaxies involved and their dust properties (eg. individual optical\ndepths and dust spatial extent). These parameters are presently known to\nwithin a factor of three. Further studies to determine these parameters\nare therefore necessary before plausible conclusions regarding the\neffects of foreground dust on optical observations of high redshift\nquasars can be made.\n\nIf published estimates of the effects of foreground dust on optical\nstudies of quasars are correct, then implications for present\ncosmological studies are immense. Studies which use bright optical\nquasars to count absorption line systems and gravitational lenses may\nhave severely underestimated their true abundance. Studies involving\ndamped Ly- @xmath absorption systems to determine a wealth of physical\nparameters such as chemical composition, dust and gas content, and star\nformation rates at high redshift, are also likely to be affected (Fall &\nPei, 1993; Pei & Fall, 1995). If substantial numbers of quasars remain\nundetected, then a significant fraction of the observed @xmath - and\nX-ray background may arise from dust obscured quasars (Heisler &\nOstriker, 1988). More importantly, these quasars would significantly\ncontribute to the UV photon density at high redshifts, thereby altering\nthe nature and physical state of the intergalactic medium at early\nepochs.\n\n##### 1.5.2 Dust in the Quasar Environment\n\nThere are two major lines of study investigating the existence and\nproperties of dust in the neighbourhood of quasars. The first class of\nstudies is based on the observed IR emission. It is suggested that the\nnear-IR \u201cbump\u201d at @xmath m and spectral turnover at @xmath m in a\nmajority of optically-selected quasars can be attributed to emission by\ndust (Neugebauer @xmath 1979; McAlary & Rieke, 1988; Sanders @xmath\n1989). In fact, about a third of the total luminosity from quasars is\nemitted in the @xmath m range (Sanders @xmath 1989). The most attractive\nexplanation for this emission is thermal radiation from dust heated by a\ncentral UV-optical continuum source. This is supported by a significant\nlack of variability and polarisation in the IR compared to the emission\nproperties at @xmath m (Sitko & Zhu, 1991). The IR continuum emission\ncan be fitted with a variety of models: optically thin dust in a\nspherical distribution (Barvainis, 1987), optically thick dust in a\ntorus with equatorial optical depths @xmath on scales less than a few\nhundred parsecs (Pier & Krolik, 1992), or dust in a highly warped disk\non much larger scales (Sanders @xmath 1989). These studies are\nconsistent with a significant number of quasars having their optical\nemission substantially reduced, preventing their detection in the\noptical.\n\nThe second class of studies involve searching for dust from differential\nextinction of emission lines in the optical-UV spectra of quasars\n(Draine & Bahcall, 1981; MacAlpine, 1985; Netzer & Laor, 1993).\nMacAlpine (1985) and Netzer & Laor (1993) conclude that much of the\nabsorbing dust is likely to be embedded within the narrow line emitting\ngas (the NLR) on scales no larger than about a kiloparsec, ie. on scales\na little larger than that of a possible dusty torus. Dust in the NLR is\nexpected to modify the physical conditions of the emitting gas and\nconsequently, the continuum spectral slope (see MacAlpine, 1985 for a\nreview).\n\nTogether with studies of the IR continuum, these studies have provided\nstrong constraints on the possible location for dust in quasars and\nother lower luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN). For quasars, it is\npredicted that dust grains are heated to high evaporation temperatures.\nBarvainis (1987) has estimated an \u201cevaporation radius\u201d greater than\n@xmath pc, ie. scales much larger than the hypothesised broad line\nemitting region (BLR). Furthermore, the characteristic turnover at\n@xmath m has been shown to imply that a significant fraction of the\nthermal IR radiation may be emitted from scales @xmath pc (Edelson,\nMalkan & Rieke, 1987). This leaves two possible options for the location\nof the dust: a torus and\/or NLR clouds, or the quasar host galaxy.\n\nThere is remarkable similarity between quasars and other nearby, less\nluminous AGN such as Seyferts. The growing importance of dust in Seyfert\ngalaxies may suggest that at least some quasars should also exhibit\nsimilar properties. Recently, optically thick dust with azimuthal\nsymmetry such as a torus, has been invoked to explain the difference\nbetween broad and narrow-line AGN in the framework of unified schemes\n(Antonucci, 1993). The distribution of this material in a torus can\nobscure the central UV-optical continuum source and BLR from direct\nview, while emission from the larger scale NLR is unaffected. This is\nsupported by spectropolarimetric observations showing broad emission\nlines in polarized light in narrow line (type-II) Seyfert galaxies.\nFurther evidence for a torus-shaped dust region is provided by the\nobservation of ionization cones in several Seyfert galaxies,\ndemonstrating that the gas in the host galaxy sees an anisotropic\nionizing source. Evidence for dust tori in high redshift quasars is\nscarce. However, spectropolarimetric observations revealing the presence\nof a hidden BLR, combined with a reddened UV-optical continuum has been\nfound in two quasars (Hines & Wills, 1992 and Wills @xmath 1992).\n\n##### 1.5.3 Optically Dust-Obscured Quasars\n\nOne drawback in the above studies investigating \u201cintrinsic\u201d dust, is\nthat almost all are based on optically-selected quasar samples. Optical\nstudies are expected to be heavily biased against significant extinction\nby dust. These inevitably show that dust is present and an important\nconstituent of quasars, however, it is possible that a large population\nremains undetected optically due to obscuration by dust. Evidence for\nsuch a population may be provided by studies at wavelengths where no\nbias against dust obscuration is expected. There are three possible\nwavelength regimes of interest: The infrared, X-rays and the radio. I\nshall consider each in turn below.\n\nNear or far-infrared surveys may provide a useful means of detecting\ndust obscured quasars. The ideal strategy is to look for intrinsically\nluminous point like sources in the IR. Follow-up IR-spectroscopy is then\nrequired for further identification of standard characteristics such as\nbroad emission lines. The ultraluminous infrared sources detected by the\nInfrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) are likely candidates for\ndust-obscured quasars. These sources have IR luminosities comparable to\nthose of quasars ( @xmath ) and there is debate about whether such\nobjects host buried quasars (Hines @xmath 1995 and references therein).\nEvidence for such a population has been presented by Hill @xmath (1987)\nand Sanders @xmath (1988). Moreover, a large abundance of faint,\npossibly dust-obscured quasars is suggested by the IRAS selected sample\nof Low @xmath (1989). In this study, FeII emission was shown to be\nprominent in quasars with strong IR luminosity relative to their optical\nemission, suggesting a medium significantly enriched in metals and dust.\nThrough an investigation of their radio properties, Lonsdale @xmath\n(1995) claim that it is physically plausible for dust enshrouded quasars\nto power the IR emission observed from IRAS sources.\n\nX-ray selected samples may provide stronger evidence for an optically\nobscured quasar population. Soft X-rays ( @xmath keV) are subject to\nconsiderable absorption by hydrogen and heavy metals (see section 5.6.1\n), and hence soft X-ray surveys are expected to be heavily biased. Hard\nX-rays ( @xmath keV) however penetrate the dust, and absorption may\nbecome significant only when the gas column density is sufficiently\nhigh, ie. @xmath (Awaki @xmath 1990). Stocke @xmath (1991) found a\nfactor of almost two orders of magnitude dispersion in the\nX-ray-to-optical ratios of an X-ray selected sample as compared to those\nselected optically. This scatter may be caused by variable dust\nextinction in the optical and in fact supports the claim by McDowell\n@xmath (1989) for a possible a correlation between X-ray-to-optical flux\nratio and @xmath colour.\n\nThere have been numerous X-ray spectroscopic studies claiming soft X-ray\nabsorption in excess of that expected from the galaxy in the spectra of\nradio-selected quasars (Madejski @xmath 1991; Wilkes @xmath 1992; Elvis\n@xmath 1994). Absorptions corresponding to @xmath atoms @xmath were\ndeduced in a majority of cases. These studies however failed to detect\nany associated extinction by dust in the optical. A correlation is\nexpected at some level, however as will be discussed in section 5.6.1 ,\nthese separate processes may critically depend on the physical\nconditions, locations and geometry of the absorbing gas and dust.\n\nOptical identification of radio-selected sources probably provides the\nbest technique for detecting dust-obscured quasars, being subject to\nfewer possible selection effects than surveys based at X-ray or IR\nwavelengths. Criteria for selecting quasars in the radio is primarily\nbased on their characteristic \u201cflat\u201d spectral energy distribution at GHz\nfrequencies; @xmath where @xmath . Most of the bright (ie. @xmath Jy)\nradio surveys based on this criterion have @xmath of sources identified\nwith quasars which have optical properties extremely similar to those\nselected optically. More than 10% also comprise sources which are highly\npolarised and strongly variable at radio to optical wavelengths. These\nsources belong to the \u201cBlazar\u201d class of AGN (Angel & Stockman, 1980).\nThere have been very few radio-surveys specifically aimed towards\nfinding quasars. Most surveys did not include criteria based on radio\nspectral-slope. Both steep and flat-spectrum sources were selected,\nwhere the former comprised the majority of sources and were usually\nidentified with galaxies. For instance, an optical study of a complete\nradio sample with @xmath Jy by Dunlop @xmath (1989) found a quasar\nfraction @xmath . Their spectroscopic identifications however are also\nsignificantly incomplete.\n\nRecently, the largest and most complete radio-selected quasar sample has\nbeen compiled by Drinkwater @xmath (1997), initially selected from the\nParkes Catalogue. All sources have flat radio spectra ( @xmath ) and\n2.7GHz fluxes @xmath Jy at the epoch of the Parkes survey. Based on a\nhigh identification rate in the optical and near-infrared, this study\nmay provide crucial evidence for a substantial population of\ndust-reddened quasars. A broad and flat distribution in\noptical\u2013to\u2013near-IR colour with @xmath as compared to @xmath for an\noptically selected sample was found (see Fig. 1.2 ). It is important to\nnote however that only @xmath of sources in optical-quasar surveys are\nradio-loud. It is uncertain then whether the distribution of reddening\nin this sample is applicable to samples of radio-quiet QSOs. If so, then\nthis sample predicts that existing optical quasar-samples may be only\n@xmath complete (Webster @xmath 1995).\n\n#### 1.6 Radio-Selected, Optically Reddened Quasars\n\nRadio-selected quasars have optical characteristics very similar to\nthose selected optically. Recent studies however have found one\nexception: as seen from Fig. 1.2 , the large spread in optical\u2013near-IR\ncolour suggests that not all quasars can be characterised by the lower\nenvelope cutoff of @xmath . This section gives a brief review of the\nprevious work aimed at disentangling the nature of this \u201cred\u201d\npopulation.\n\nIn previous studies, flat-spectrum radio sources where no optical\ncounterpart was detected were often classified as \u201cEmpty Fields\u201d. Deep\noptical and near-infrared observations in fact showed that many were\nvery red in optical\u2013near-IR colour. They were characterised by spectral\nindices, @xmath , where @xmath (Spinrad & Smith, 1975; Rieke, Lebofsky &\nKinman, 1979; Bregman @xmath 1981; Rieke @xmath 1982). For comparison,\noptically-selected quasars (see Fig. 1.2 ) are characterised by\noptical\u2013near-IR spectral indices @xmath .\n\nPossible causes for the relatively red optical\u2013to\u2013near-IR continua have\nbeen discussed, but no consensus exists. Some authors have claimed that\nsince a majority of these flat-spectrum radio sources were also\nassociated with \u201cblazar-like\u201d activity, the redness may be a\ncharacteristic of the synchrotron emission mechanism. (Cruz-Gonzalez &\nHuchra 1984; Bregman @xmath 1981; Rieke @xmath 1982). Other explanations\nsuch as optical continuum reddening by dust somewhere along the\nline-of-sight have been suggested, but evidence has been scarce. Some of\nthe observational tests (eg. Ledden & O\u2019Dell, 1983) included searching\nfor metal absorption-line systems, X-ray absorption, or effects of\ngravitational lensing if the absorbing material lies in an unrelated\nintervening system. In a study by Ledden & O\u2019Dell (1983) and more\nrecently by Kollgaard @xmath (1995), evidence for soft X-ray absorption\nwas presented for a few of the reddest sources. The numbers however were\ntoo low to draw any firm conclusion.\n\nThe difficulty in obtaining a self-consistent picture of radio-loud\noptically reddened quasars lies in the lack of sufficient knowledge of\nthe sources themselves. There appear to be no additional characteristics\nwhich correlate with optical reddening that may provide a hint about the\nphysics.\n\nMore than 40% of the 323 sources in the complete, flat spectrum radio\nsample of Drinkwater @xmath (1997) have optical\u2013near-IR colours @xmath .\nThis corresponds to optical\u2013near-IR spectral indices @xmath , very much\nredder than those of optically selected quasars where @xmath . At\npresent, it remains unclear whether these sources represent one extreme\nof the flat spectrum radio population or a fundamentally new class of\nAGN. Their faint identifications and red colours suggest that\nsignificant numbers of quasars may be severely under-represented in\ncurrent optical surveys. The last chapters of this thesis shall explore\npossible physical mechanisms to explain the anomalous properties of\nsources in this sample.\n\n## Part I Cosmologically Distributed Dust\n\n### Chapter 2 Diffuse versus Compact Dust Distributions\n\nWho can number the clouds by wisdom\nOr who can pour out the bottles of heaven,\nWhen the dust runneth into a mass,\nAnd the clods cleave fast together?\n\n\u2014 Job, 38:37\n\n#### 2.1 Introduction\n\nThere are number of studies claiming that dust in foreground galaxies\nhas a substantial effect on the colours and counts of optically selected\nquasars (Ostriker & Heisler, 1984; Heisler & Ostriker, 1988; Fall & Pei,\n1992 and Wright, 1990). It is estimated that more than 50% of bright\nquasars at a redshift of @xmath may be obscured by dust in intervening\ngalaxies and hence missing from optical samples. These studies assumed\nthat dust was confined only within the visible extent of normal massive\ngalaxies. However, distant populations such as faint field galaxies and\nquasars may also be observed through foreground diffuse dust\ndistributions. Such distributions may be associated with galaxy clusters\nand extended galactic haloes.\n\nA truly diffuse, intergalactic dust distribution is ruled out based on\nthe counts of quasars and reddening as a function of redshift (eg.\nRudnicki, 1986; Ostriker & Heisler, 1984). Such observations indicate\nthat if a significant amount of dust exists, it must be patchy and\ndiffuse with relatively low optical depth so that quasars will appear\nreddened without being removed from flux limited samples.\n\nGalaxy clusters provide a likely location for \u2018large-scale\u2019 diffusely\ndistributed dust. Indirect evidence is provided by several studies which\nreported large deficits of distant quasars or clusters of galaxies\nbehind nearby clusters (Boyle @xmath 1988; Romani & Maoz, 1992 and\nreferences therein). These studies propose that extinction by\nintracluster dust is the major cause. Additional evidence for diffuse\ndust distributions is provided by observations of massive local galaxies\nwhere in a few cases, dust haloes extending to scales @xmath kpc have\nbeen confirmed (Zaritsky, 1994 and Peletier @xmath 1995; see the review\nin section 1.4.1 ).\n\nIt is possible that a uniformly distributed dust component exists in the\nintergalactic medium (IGM). Galactic winds associated with prodigious\nstar formation activity at early epochs may have provided a likely\nsource of metal enrichment and hence dust for the IGM (eg. Nath &\nTrentham, 1997). Observations of metal lines in Ly @xmath absorption\nsystems of low column density ( @xmath ) indeed suggest that the IGM was\nenriched to about @xmath by redshift @xmath (Womble @xmath 1996;\nSongaila & Cowie, 1996). A source of diffuse dust may also have been\nprovided by an early generation of pre-galactic stars (ie. population\nIII stars) associated with the formation of galactic haloes (McDowell,\n1986). Later in this thesis, it will be shown that possible reddening\nfrom uniformly distributed IGM dust is limited by observations of\nradio-selected quasars. Since radio-selected quasars should have no bias\nagainst reddening by dust (see section 1.5.3 ), such a component must be\nof sufficiently low optical depth to avoid producing a large fraction of\n\u2018reddened\u2019 sources at high redshift (see Fig. 1.2 ).\n\nIn this chapter, we show that a given quantity of dust has a much\ngreater effect on the background universe when diffusely distributed. We\nshall investigate the effects of diffuse dust from, firstly, the\nexistence of a diffuse component in galaxy clusters and secondly, from a\nhypothesised uniformly distributed component in the IGM.\n\nThis chapter is organised as follows: in the next section, we explore\nthe dependence of background source counts observed through a given mass\nof dust on its spatial extent. In section 2.3 , we investigate the\nspatial distribution of dust optical depth through galaxy clusters and\nits effect on the counts and colours of background sources. Section 2.4\nexplores the consequences if all dust in the local universe were assumed\nuniformly distributed in the IGM. Further implications are discussed in\nsection 2.5 and all results are summarised in section 2.6 . All\ncalculations use a Friedmann cosmology with @xmath and Hubble parameter\n@xmath where @xmath .\n\n#### 2.2 Compact versus Diffuse Dust Distributions\n\nIn this section, we explore the dependence of obscuration of background\nsources on the spatial distribution of a given mass of dust. For\nsimplicity, we assume the dust to be associated with a cylindrical\nface-on disk with uniform spatial dust mass density. We quantify the\namount of obscuration by investigating the number of background sources\nbehind our absorber that are missed from an optical flux-limited sample.\n\nThe fraction of sources missing to some luminosity @xmath relative to\nthe case where there is no dust extinction is simply @xmath , where\n@xmath represents the observed number of sources in the presence of\ndust. For a uniform dust optical depth @xmath , @xmath . For simplicity,\nwe assume that background sources are described by a cumulative\nluminosity function that follows a power-law: @xmath , where @xmath is\nthe slope. With this assumption, the fraction of background sources\nmissing over a given area when viewed through our dusty absorber with\nuniform optical depth @xmath is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nIf the \u2018true\u2019 number of background sources per unit solid angle is\n@xmath , then the total number of background sources lost from a flux\nlimited sample within the projected radius @xmath of our absorber can be\nwritten:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the distance of the absorber from us.\n\nTo investigate the dependence of background source counts on the spatial\ndust distribution, we need to first determine the dependence of @xmath\nin Eqn. 2.2 on the spatial extent @xmath for a fixed mass of dust @xmath\n. This can be determined from the individual properties of grains as\nfollows. The extinction optical depth at a wavelength @xmath through a\nslab of dust composed of grains with uniform radius @xmath is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the extinction efficiency which depends on the grain\nsize and dielectric properties, @xmath is the number density of grains\nand @xmath is the length of the dust column along the line-of-sight.\nAssuming our cylindrical absorber (whose axis lies along the\nline-of-sight) has a uniform dust mass density: @xmath , where @xmath is\nits cross-sectional radius, we can write, @xmath , where @xmath is the\nmass density of an individual grain. We use the extinction efficiency\n@xmath in the @xmath -band as parameterised by Goudfrooij @xmath (1994)\nfor a graphite and silicate mixture (of equal abundances) with mean\ngrain size @xmath m characteristic of the galactic ISM. The value used\nis @xmath . We use a galactic extinction curve to convert to a @xmath\n-band extinction measure, where typically @xmath (eg. Pei, 1992).\nCombining these quantities, we find that the @xmath -band optical depth,\n@xmath , through our model absorber can be written in terms of its dust\nmass and cross-sectional radius as follows:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere we have scaled to a dust mass and radius typical of local massive\nspirals and ellipticals (eg. Zaritsky, 1994). This measure is consistent\nwith mean optical depths derived by other means (eg. Giovanelli @xmath\n1994 and references therein).\n\nFrom Eqn. 2.4 , we see that the dust optical depth through our model\nabsorber for a fixed dust mass varies in terms of its cross-sectional\nradius @xmath as @xmath . For the nominal dust parameters in Eqn. 2.4 ,\nthe number of sources missed behind our model absorber (Eqn. 2.2 ) can\nbe written\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath and\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nis the \u2018true\u2019 number of background sources falling within the projected\nscale radius @xmath kpc.\n\nFrom the functional forms of Eqns. 2.2 and 2.5 , there are two limiting\ncases:\n\n1.   For optical depths @xmath , the factor @xmath in Eqn. 2.2 is of\n    order unity. This corresponds to values of @xmath such that @xmath\n    for the nominal parameters in Eqn. 2.4 . For values of @xmath in\n    this range, we have @xmath and the obscuration of background sources\n    will depend most strongly on @xmath .\n\n2.   For @xmath or equivalently @xmath , @xmath will approach a constant\n    limiting value, independent of the dust extent @xmath . From Eqn.\n    2.5 , this limiting value can be shown to be @xmath .\n\nAs a simple illustration, we show in Fig. 2.1 the dependence of the\nnumber of background sources missing behind our model dust absorber on\n@xmath , for a fixed dust mass of @xmath as defined by Eqn. 2.5 . We\nassumed a cumulative luminosity function slope of @xmath , typical of\nthat for luminous galaxies and quasars. From the above discussion, we\nsee that when @xmath , ie. @xmath (or when @xmath ), the obscuration\nwill start to approach its maximum value and remain approximately\nconstant as @xmath .\n\nWe conclude that when dust becomes diffuse and extended on a scale such\nthat the mean optical depth @xmath through the distribution satisfies\n@xmath , where @xmath is the cumulative luminosity function slope of\nbackground sources, obscuration will start to be important and is\nmaximised for @xmath . The characteristic spatial scale at which this\noccurs will depend on the dust mass through Eqn. 2.4 . For the typical\ngrain values in Eqn. 2.4 , this characteristic radius is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe simple model in Fig. 2.1 shows that the obscuration of background\nsources due to a normal foreground galaxy will be most effective if dust\nis distributed over a region a few times its optical radius. This\nprediction may be difficult to confirm observationally due to possible\ncontamination from light in the galactic absorber. In the following\nsections, we explore two examples of possible diffuse dust distributions\non relatively large scales that can be explored observationally.\n\n#### 2.3 Diffuse Dust in Galaxy Clusters\n\nA number of studies have attributed the existence of large deficits of\nbackground sources behind nearby galaxy clusters as due to extinction by\ndust. Bogart & Wagner (1973) found that distant rich Abell clusters were\nanticorrelated on the sky with nearby ones. They argued for a mean\nextinction of @xmath mag extending to @xmath times the optical radii of\nthe nearby clusters. Boyle, Fong & Shanks (1988) however claimed a\n@xmath deficit of background quasars within @xmath of clusters\nconsisting of tens of galaxies. These authors attribute this to an\nextinction @xmath mag, and deduce a dust mass of @xmath within 0.5Mpc of\nthe clusters. Romani & Maoz (1992) found that optically-selected quasars\nfrom the V\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron (1989) catalogue avoid rich foreground\nAbell clusters. They also found deficits of @xmath out to radii @xmath\nfrom the clusters, and postulate a mean extinction, @xmath mag.\n\nThe numbers of background sources behind clusters is also expected to be\nmodified by gravitational lensing (GL) by the cluster potential.\nDepending on the intrinsic luminosity function of the background\npopulation, and the limiting magnitude to which the sources are\ndetected, GL can cause either an enhancement or a deficit in the number\nof background sources. The GL effect has been used to explain various\nreports of overdensities of both optically and radio-selected quasars\nbehind foreground clusters (Bartelmann & Schneider, 1993; Bartelmann\n@xmath 1994; Rodrigues-Williams & Hogan, 1994; Seitz & Schneider, 1995).\nThe reported overdensities for optically-selected QSOs are contrary to\nthe studies above where anticorrelations with foreground clusters are\nfound. These overdensities however are claimed on angular scales @xmath\nfrom the cluster centers, considerably larger than scales on which most\nof the underdensities have been claimed, which are of order a few\narcminutes. One interpretation is that dust obscuration bias may be\ngreater towards cluster centers due to the presence of greater\nquantities of dust. On the other hand, the reported anticorrelations on\nsmall angular scales can perhaps be explained by the optically crowded\nfields, where QSO identification may be difficult. At present, the\neffects of clusters on background source counts still remains\ncontroversial.\n\nMore direct evidence for the existence of intracluster dust was provided\nby Hu @xmath (1985) and Hu (1992) who compared the Ly- @xmath flux from\nemission line systems in \u201ccooling flow\u201d clusters with Balmer line fluxes\nat optical wavelengths. Extinctions of @xmath mag towards the cluster\ncenters were found, in good agreement with estimates from the quasar\ndeficits above. Intracluster dust has been predicted to give rise to\ndetectable diffuse IR emission (eg. Dwek @xmath 1990). The most\nextensive search was conducted by Wise @xmath (1993), who claimed to\nhave detected excess diffuse 60-100 @xmath m emission at the 2 @xmath\nlevel from a number of rich Abell clusters. They derived dust\ntemperatures in the range 24-34 K and dust masses @xmath within radii of\n@xmath Mpc. Recently, Allen (1995) detected strong X-ray absorption and\noptical reddening in ellipticals situated at the centers of rich cooling\nflow clusters, providing strong evidence for dust. These studies\nindicate that intracluster dust is certainly present, however, the\nmagnitude of its effect on producing background source deficits remains\na controversial issue.\n\nIn this section, we give some predictions that may be used to further\nconstrain cluster dust properties, or help determine the dominant\nmechanism (ie. GL or extinction) by which clusters affect background\nobservations.\n\n##### 2.3.1 Spatial Distribution of Cluster Dust?\n\nX-ray spectral measurements show the presence of hot, metal enriched gas\nin rich galaxy clusters with @xmath solar metallicity. This gas is\nbelieved to be both of galactic and primordial origin (ie. pre-existing\nIGM gas), with the bulk of metals being ejected from cluster galaxies\n(see Sarazin, 1986 for a review). Ejection from galaxies may occur\nabruptly through collisions between the cluster galaxies, \u2018sudden\u2019\nram-pressure ablation, or through continuous ram-pressure stripping by\nintracluster gas (eg. Takeda @xmath 1984). The lack of significant\namounts of dust (relative to what should have been produced by stellar\nevolution) and interstellar gas in cluster ellipticals provides evidence\nfor a mass loss process. On the other hand, in ellipticals that avoid\ndense cluster environments, significant quantities of neutral hydrogen,\nmolecular gas and dust have been detected (eg. Lees @xmath 1991).\n\nIf the dust-to-gas ratio of intracluster gas in rich clusters were\nsimilar to that of the Milky Way, then a radial gas column density of\ntypically @xmath with metallicity @xmath would produce an extinction\n@xmath mag. This however is much greater than the value observed. The\nlikely reason for the deficiency of dust in the intracluster medium is\nits destruction by thermal sputtering in the hot gas, a process which\noperates on timescales @xmath yr, where @xmath is the gas density and\n@xmath the grain radius (Draine & Salpeter, 1979). Dust injection\ntimescales from galaxies is typically of order a Hubble time (eg. Takeda\n@xmath 1984) and hence, grains are effectively destroyed, with only the\nmost recently injected still surviving and providing possibly some\nmeasurable extinction.\n\nThe spatial distribution in dust mass density remains a major\nuncertainty. A number of authors have shown that under a steady state of\ncontinuous injection from cluster galaxies, destruction by thermal\nsputtering at a constant rate, and assuming instantaneous mixing with\nthe hot gas, the resulting mass density in dust will be of order\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n(eg. Dwek @xmath 1990) where @xmath is the injected dust-to-gas mass\nratio, assumed to be equal to the mean value of the galactic ISM, @xmath\n(Pei, 1992). According to this simple model, the dust mass density is\nindependent of gas density and position in the cluster. If we relax the\nassumption of instantaneous mixing of dust with the hot gas however, so\nthat the spatial distribution of gas is different from that of the\ninjected dust, the radial distribution of dust can significantly differ\nfrom uniformity throughout a cluster. Such a non-uniform spatial dust\ndistribution may be found in clusters exhibiting cooling flows. If, as\nsuggested by Fabian @xmath (1991), most of the cooled gas remains cold\nand becomes molecular in cluster cores, then a relatively large amount\nof dust may also form, resulting in a dust distribution which peaks\nwithin the central regions.\n\nWe explore the radial dependence of extinction optical depth through a\ncluster, and the expected deficit in background sources by assuming that\ndust is diffusely distributed and follows a spatial density\ndistribution:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (2.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is a characteristic radius which we fix and @xmath is our\nfree parameter. Eqn. 2.9 with @xmath is the usual King profile which\nwith @xmath Mpc, represents a good approximation to the galaxy\ndistribution in clusters. Thus for simplicity, we keep @xmath fixed at\n@xmath Mpc and vary @xmath . To bracket the range of possibilities in\nthe distribution of intracluster dust, we shall consider the range\n@xmath . @xmath corresponds to the simple case where @xmath constant,\nwhich may describe a situation where injection of dust is balanced by\nits destruction by hot gas as discussed above. The value @xmath assumes\nthat dust follows the galaxy distribution. This profile may arise if\ngrain destruction by a similar distribution of hot gas were entirely\nabsent.\n\n##### 2.3.2 Spatial Distribution of Dust Optical Depth and Background\nSource Deficits\n\nTo model the spatial distribution of optical depth, we assume that\nintracluster dust is distributed within a sphere of radius @xmath . The\ncentral dust mass density @xmath in Eqn. 2.9 is fixed by assuming values\nfor the total dust mass @xmath and @xmath such that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe assume a cluster dust radius of @xmath Mpc, which represents a radius\ncontaining @xmath of the virial mass of a typical dense cluster\ncharacterised by galactic velocity dispersion @xmath (Sarazin, 1986 and\nreferences therein). We assume that the total dust mass within @xmath\nMpc is @xmath . This value is consistent with that derived from\nextinction measures by Hu, Cowie & Wang (1985), IR emission detections\nby Wise @xmath (1993) and theoretical estimates of the mean intracluster\ndust density as given by Eqn. 2.8 .\n\nUsing Eqn. 2.3 , the @xmath -band optical depth through our spherical\nintracluster dust distribution at some projected distance @xmath from\nits center can be written:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is our assumed radial density distribution (Eqn. 2.9 ) and\n@xmath the mass density of an individual dust grain. For a uniform dust\ndensity ( @xmath constant), and our assumed values of @xmath and @xmath\ngiven above, the radial dependence in dust optical depth can be written:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the optical depth through the center of our cluster,\nwhich with grain properties characteristic of the galactic ISM, will\nscale as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis value is about a factor three times lower than estimates of the\nmean extinction derived from the deficit of QSOs behind foreground\nclusters (eg. Boyle @xmath 1988), and that implied by the Balmer\ndecrements of Hu @xmath (1985). For a fixed dust mass of @xmath however,\nwe can achieve larger values for the central optical depth by steepening\nthe radial dust-density distribution profile, determined by the slope\n@xmath in Eqn. 2.9 .\n\nFig. 2.2 a shows the optical depth as a function of projected cluster\nradius for the cases @xmath , 0.5, 1, and 1.5. The case @xmath\napproximately corresponds to the model of Dwek @xmath (1990), which\nincluded effects of mild sputtering by hot gas in order to fit for the\nobserved IR emission from the Coma cluster. As shown, the case @xmath (\n@xmath constant) predicts that the dust optical depth should be almost\nindependent of projected radius @xmath . Within all projected radii, the\noptical depths predicted by our diffuse dust model lie in the range\n@xmath . Turning back to the discussion of section 2.2 where we show\nthat background obscuration by diffuse dust reaches its maximum for\n@xmath , these optical depths satisfy this condition for @xmath ,\ntypical of luminous background galaxies and quasars.\n\nWe now explore the effects of these models on background source counts\nas a function of projected cluster radius. We first give an estimate of\nthe projected radius at which the numbers of background sources lost\nfrom a flux-limited sample is expected to be a maximum. This is\ndetermined by investigating the dependence in the differential number of\nsources missing, @xmath , within an interval ( @xmath ) as a function of\nprojected radius @xmath . From Eqn. 2.2 , this differential number will\nscale as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is given by Eqn. 2.11 . Fig. 2.2 b plots @xmath as a\nfunction of @xmath for our various models, where we have assumed @xmath\n. Thus from observations, an identification of the projected radius at\nwhich the background source deficit peaks can be used to constrain the\nspatial distribution of intracluster dust.\n\nThe cumulative fraction of background sources missing within a projected\ncluster radius is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis fraction is shown in Fig. 2.2 c. As expected, the @xmath model\nwhich contains the largest amount of dust within the inner few hundred\nkiloparsecs predicts the strongest trend with @xmath , while the\nopposite is predicted if the dust density were completely uniform. These\npredictions can be compared with a number of existing studies of the\nobserved two-point angular correlation function between clusters and\noptically-selected QSOs. This function is usually defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the average number of observed cluster-QSO pairs within\nan angular radius @xmath and @xmath is that expected in a random\ndistribution. For our purposes, @xmath can be replaced by the \u201ctrue\u201d\nnumber of cluster-QSO pairs expected in the absence of dust, and hence,\nwe can re-write Eqn. 2.16 as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWe compare our models with a number of studies of @xmath for optically\nselected QSOs in Fig. 2.2 d. These studies considerably differ from each\nother in the selection of the QSO and cluster samples, and as seen, both\nanticorrelations and correlations on different angular scales are found.\nThe former have been interpreted in terms of extinction by intracluster\ndust, while the latter with the GL phenomenon. In most cases, the\nreported overdensities are too large to be consistent with GL models\ngiven our current knowledge of cluster masses and QSO distributions.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the studies which have reached the\nsmallest angular scales ( @xmath ) are also those in which\nanticorrelations between QSOs and foreground clusters have been\nreported. This can be understood in terms of a larger dust concentration\nand hence extinction towards cluster centers. These studies however may\nnot be free of selection effects, such as in the detection of QSOs from\nthe visual inspection of objective prism plates. From a\ncross-correlation analysis of galactic stars with their cluster sample\nhowever, Boyle @xmath (1988) found that such selection effects are\nminimal.\n\nThe maximum dust radial extent assumed in our models, @xmath Mpc,\ncorresponds to angular scales @xmath at the mean redshift of the\nclusters ( @xmath ) used in these studies. Thus, as shown in Fig. 2.2 d,\nour model predictions only extend to @xmath . As shown in this figure,\nthe @xmath model which corresponds to the case where the dust density is\nassumed to follow the galaxy distribution, provides the best fit to the\nBoyle @xmath (1988) data. We must note that this is the only existing\nstudy performed to angular scales @xmath with which we can compare our\nmodels. Further studies to such scales are necessary to confirm the\nBoyle @xmath result, and\/or provide a handle on any selection effects.\n\n##### 2.3.3 Summary\n\nTo summarise, we have shown that for a plausible value of the dust mass\nin a typical rich galaxy cluster, obscuration of background sources will\nbe most effective if dust is diffusely distributed on scales @xmath Mpc.\nThis conclusion is based on our predicted optical depths ( @xmath )\nsatisfying our condition for \u2018maximum\u2019 obscuration: @xmath (see section\n2.2 ), where typically @xmath for luminous background galaxies and QSOs.\n\nWe have explored the spatial distribution in dust optical depth and\nbackground source deficits expected through a typical rich cluster by\nassuming different radial dust density profiles. These predictions can\nbe used to constrain cluster dust properties. A dust density\ndistribution with @xmath (Eqn. 2.9 ) appears to best satisfy the \u2018small\nscale\u2019 cluster-QSO angular correlation study of Boyle @xmath (1988).\n\n#### 2.4 Diffuse Intergalactic Dust?\n\nThere have been a number of studies claiming that the bulk of metals in\nthe local universe had already formed by @xmath (eg. Lilly & Cowie,\n1987; White & Frenk, 1991; Fall & Pei, 1995). Similarly, models of dust\nevolution in the galaxy show that the bulk of its dust content was\nformed in the first few billion years (Wang, 1991). These studies\nsuggest that the global star formation rate peaked at epochs @xmath when\nthe bulk of galaxies were believed to have formed. Supernova-driven\nwinds at early epochs may thus have provided an effective mechanism by\nwhich chemically enriched material and dust were dispersed into the IGM.\nAs modelled by Babul & Rees (1992), such a mechanism is postulated to be\ncrucial in the evolution of the \u2018faint blue\u2019 galaxy population observed\nto magnitudes @xmath . Nath & Trentham (1997) also show that this\nmechanism could explain the recent detection of metallicities @xmath in\nlow density Ly @xmath absorption systems at @xmath . Another source of\ndiffuse IGM dust may have been provided from an epoch of population III\nstar formation associated with the formation of galactic haloes (eg.\nMcDowell, 1986).\n\nWhat are the effects expected on background sources if all dust formed\nto the present day was completely uniform and diffuse throughout the\nIGM? In this section, we show that such a component will have a low\noptical depth and have an insignificant effect on the colours of\nbackground sources, but will be high enough to significantly bias their\nnumber counts in the optical.\n\n##### 2.4.1 Comoving Dust Mass Density\n\nTo explore the effects of a diffuse intergalactic dust component, we\nneed to assume a value for the mean mass density in dust in the local\nuniverse. This density must not exceed the total mass density in heavy\nmetals at the present epoch. An upper bound for the local mass density\nin metals (hence dust) can be derived from the assumption that the mean\nmetallicity of the local universe is typically: @xmath (ie. the ratio of\nelements heavier than helium to total gas mass), as found from galactic\nchemical evolution models (eg. Tinsley, 1976) and abundance observations\n(Grevesse & Anders, 1988). Combining this with the upper bound in the\nbaryon density predicted from big-bang nucleosynthesis (Olive @xmath\n1990) where @xmath , it is apparent that\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nLet us now compute the total mass density in dust used in previous\nstudies that modelled the effects of dust in individual galaxies on\nbackground quasars. Both Heisler & Ostriker (1988) and Fall & Pei (1993)\nmodelled these effects by assuming that dust in each galaxy was\ndistributed as an exponential disk with scale radius @xmath kpc and\ncentral face-on optical depth, @xmath . The comoving mean mass density\nin dust (relative to the critical density) in these studies, given a\ncomoving galaxy number density @xmath , can be shown to be\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n(see section 4.2.1 ). This is consistent with the constraint in Eqn.\n2.18 . Thus, as a working measure, we assume the comoving mass density\ndefined by Eqn. 2.19 in the calculation that follows.\n\n##### 2.4.2 Obscuration by Diffuse Intergalactic Dust\n\nIf the dust mass density given by Eqn. 2.19 is assumed uniformly\ndistributed and constant on comoving scales to some redshift, the @xmath\n-band optical depth through a dust sheet of width d @xmath at redshift\n@xmath in an observer\u2019s frame can be written (see Eqn. 2.3 )\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere we have assumed dust properties characteristic of the galactic\nISM. The factor @xmath is due to our assumption of a @xmath dependence\nfor the dust extinction law. This arises from the fact that light\nreceived in the @xmath -band corresponds to light of wavelength @xmath\nat redshift @xmath , which consequently suffers greater extinction. With\n@xmath Mpc (for a @xmath and @xmath cosmology), the total mean optical\ndepth to some redshift in an observer\u2019s @xmath -band will scale as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis represents the total optical depth if all dust in the intervening\ngalaxy model of Heisler & Ostriker (1988) were assumed uniformly\ndistributed throughout the universe.\n\nAssuming dust is uniformly distributed to @xmath , the observed @xmath\n-band optical depth from Eqn. 2.21 will be of order\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing a galactic extinction law (Pei, 1992), this corresponds to an\nextinction in @xmath colour of @xmath mag. Thus, if background faint\nfield galaxies and QSOs are observed through a uniform intergalactic\ndust distribution, their observed colours are not expected to be\nsignificantly affected. We now show however that the numbers of sources\nmissing at such redshifts could be significantly greater than that\nclaimed by previous studies which assume all dust to be associated with\nmassive galaxies alone.\n\nIf dust to some distance @xmath covers an area of sky @xmath and hence,\nhas covering factor @xmath , the number of background sources lost from\na flux-limited sample can be estimated from Eqn. 2.2 . In general, the\nnumber of background sources at some redshift lost from an area of sky\nwith dust covering factor @xmath will scale as:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the fraction of sources missing per unit area. For a\ncompletely uniform dust distribution, @xmath , and to redshift @xmath ,\n@xmath for @xmath .\n\nIf dust were confined to individual galaxies along the line-of-sight\nhowever, their covering factor, assuming they follow a Poisson\ndistribution is typically @xmath , where @xmath is the mean number of\nabsorber intersections to redshift @xmath :\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n(see Appendix C). We have scaled to the nominal parameters assumed in\nthe intervening galaxy model of Heisler & Ostriker (1988) (hereafter\nHO). In this model, we find a covering factor of only @xmath to @xmath .\nWe can estimate the mean effective optical depth observed in the @xmath\n-band through an individual absorber to @xmath in the HO model by using\nthe formalism of section 2.2 . For a fixed mass of dust, Eqn. 2.4\nimplies that the product of the area (or covering factor) and optical\ndepth of a dust distribution: @xmath , is a constant, depending on grain\nproperties and dust mass alone. Using this relation, the observed\neffective absorber optical depth to @xmath in the HO model, @xmath , can\nbe estimated by scaling from our values of @xmath and @xmath above for\nuniformly distributed dust:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (2.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nUsing this value, the fraction of background sources missed by\nobscuration from an individual absorber is \u2018effectively\u2019 @xmath .\nCombining these results, we find using Eqn. 2.23 that the number of\nsources missing at @xmath due to a uniform foreground dust distribution\nto be greater by a factor of @xmath than that predicted by Heisler &\nOstriker (1988).\n\nWe must note that this estimate makes no allowance for possible\nevolution in dust content. Effects of foreground diffuse dust on source\ncounts at @xmath may be significantly reduced if appreciable evolution\nhas occured. Effects of models where the dust content evolves will be\nconsidered in Chapter 4.\n\n##### 2.4.3 Summary\n\nWe conclude that the existence of a significant amount of diffusely\ndistributed dust (eg. with mass density on comoving scales of order that\nobserved in local galaxies) can enhance the number of background sources\nmissing in optical samples. Due to its relatively large covering factor,\ndiffuse dust predicts a reduction in optical counts at @xmath about\nthree times greater than that claimed by previous studies.\n\nThe colours of background sources are not expected to be significantly\naffected. This implies that the use of background populations to measure\na diffuse IGM dust component will be extremely difficult.\n\n#### 2.5 Discussion\n\nIn this section, we discuss some further uncertainties and implications\nregarding the existence of diffuse dust in the universe.\n\nFirst, the effects of intracluster dust on background sources critically\ndepends on the amount of dust present, and its spatial distribution.\nRegardless of the mechanism by which grains are injected into the\nintracluster medium from galaxies, it is possible that a significant\nfraction are destroyed in the injection process. Significant amounts of\nhot gas are also believed to exist in the ISM of cluster ellipticals\n(eg. Forman @xmath 1985). This gas is expected to destroy grains on\ntimescales @xmath yr (Draine & Salpeter, 1979), much shorter than\ninjection timescales. Such destruction mechanisms can thus prevent the\nformation of significant quantities of dust.\n\nIt is possible that the spatial distribution of intracluster dust is not\n\u2018diffuse\u2019 and uniformly distributed, but inhomogeneous. For example,\nFabian @xmath (1991) propose that if most of the cooled gas resulting\nfrom cluster cooling flows remains cold and becomes molecular, then this\nmay provide suitable conditions for large amounts of dust to form. A\nclumpy dust distribution that follows cooling flow filaments may result,\nreducing the effective dust covering factor and hence background source\ndeficit. These issues need to be addressed before attributing such\ndeficits to extinction by dust.\n\nThe existence of a smooth IGM dust component also remains a major\nuncertainty. Due to their deep gravitational potential, Margolis &\nSchramm (1977) showed that it is unlikely for supernovae-driven winds to\nexpel significant quantities of dust from a massive galaxy to large\nscales. For low mass galaxies however (eg. dwarfs), Babul & Rees (1992)\nshow that this mechanism can be effective. Such systems are believed to\ncomprise a majority of the \u2018faint-blue population\u2019 which show an excess\n@xmath times that predicted from non-evolving galaxy models for @xmath\n(eg. Tyson, 1988). Simulations based on star-formation rates that assume\nyields in metallicity from local observations, predict that the amount\nof metals (and hence dust, assuming a fixed fraction of metals condense\ninto grains at a constant rate) produced from such a population will be\nsmaller than local estimates by an order of magnitude (eg. White &\nFrenk, 1991). If the only source of IGM dust was from these \u2018low-mass\u2019\ngalaxies, then the total optical depth to @xmath would be insignificant,\nand effects on the background universe would be minimal.\n\n#### 2.6 Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter, we have shown that dust is more effective at obscuring\nbackground sources when diffuse or extended. We find that obscuration of\nbackground sources by a given dust distribution with optical depth\n@xmath will be most effective when @xmath , where @xmath is the\ncumulative luminosity function slope of the sources.\n\nWe have explored the effects of diffuse dust from, firstly, galaxy\nclusters and secondly, from a hypothesised uniform IGM component. By\nassuming different radial dust density profiles in a typical rich\ncluster, we have predicted the optical depth and background source\ndeficit as a function of projected cluster radius. These predictions can\nbe compared with future observations to constrain the properties of\nintracluster dust. Our predicted optical depth measures ( @xmath )\nsatisfy the above criterion ( @xmath ) for background luminous QSOs and\ngalaxies. Existing studies claiming anticorrelations in the distribution\nof QSOs with foreground clusters down to scales @xmath are consistent\nwith a dust density profile that follows the galaxy distribution.\n\nAs a further illustration, we have explored the effects of a diffuse IGM\ndust component with cosmic mass density equal to that observed in local\ngalaxies. Assuming this density is constant on comoving scales to @xmath\n, we find a deficit in background sources about three times greater than\nthat predicted assuming dust in normal galaxies alone.\n\nThe \u2018diffuseness\u2019 of the dust is the key parameter which we claim\ndetermines the effectiveness of obscuration of the background universe.\nAlthough such dust distributions may be difficult to detect, we must not\nneglect their possible presence. Further studies of spatial dust\ndistributions, preferably via the counts and colours of background\nsources will be essential in confirming our predictions.\n\n### Chapter 3 Modelling the Obscuration of Quasars by Foreground Dusty\nGalaxies\n\nImages of broken light which dance before me\nLike a million eyes,\n\u2026They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.\n\n\u2014 Across the Universe,\n\nJohn Lennon & Paul McCartney, 1970\n\n#### 3.1 Introduction\n\nAs early as 1930, Trumpler showed that optical observations of distant\nstellar clusters were affected by dust, which he suggested was in a thin\nabsorbing layer in the galactic plane. Similarly, sources at large\nredshift might be severely affected by dust in intervening galaxies,\nthus biasing our knowledge of the distant universe. An historical review\nof cosmological studies of obscuration by dust is given by Rudnicki\n(1986).\n\nWe are motivated by recent observations of a large radio-selected sample\nof quasars (Drinkwater @xmath 1997), which is optimal for the study of\nthe effects of dust. A large fraction of the sources have\noptical\u2013to\u2013near-infrared colours and optical continuum slopes much\nredder than is characteristically assumed in optical searches for\nquasars. Webster @xmath (1995) have argued that the reddening is due to\ndust, although the location of the dust is uncertain. There are two\nobvious possibilities: either the dust is in the local quasar\nenvironment or else it is extrinsic and lies along the line-of-sight. In\nthis and the following chapter, we investigate the effects of an\nintervening dust component which is located in galaxies along the\nline-of-sight.\n\nThe effect of intergalactic dust on observations of objects at\ncosmological distances has been discussed by Ostriker & Heisler (1984);\nHeisler & Ostriker (1988); Fall & Pei (1989; 1992) and Wright (1986;\n1990). These authors show that the line-of-sight to a high-redshift\nquasar has a high probability of intercepting a galaxy disk,\nparticularly if the dusty disk is larger than the optical radius of the\ngalaxy. The principle issue in these calculations is that realistic dust\ndistributions, which are \u201csoft\u201d around the edges, will cause many\nquasars to \u2018appear\u2019 reddened without actually removing them from a flux\nlimited sample. There has been little evidence for a population of\nreddened quasars in the past. This has been considered a strong\nconstraint on models postulating that dust might obscure a large\nfraction of the high-redshift universe. The new observations of\nDrinkwater @xmath (1997) remove this constraint, and will provide a\ndistribution of reddening as a function of redshift against which\nintervening models can be measured.\n\nOstriker & Heisler (1984) and Heisler & Ostriker (1988), have suggested\nthat intervening dusty galaxies would individually produce enough\nextinction to remove background quasars from a flux-limited sample. In\norder to avoid the problem of generating too many (unobserved) reddened\nquasars, these authors suggest that the dusty regions are \u2018hard-edged\u2019:\neither a quasar is reddened out of the sample or it is not reddened at\nall. They find that existing quasar observations (at optical, X-ray and\nradio wavelengths) are consistent with significant obscuration setting\nin by @xmath . They estimate that more than @xmath of bright quasars at\nthis redshift may be obscured by dust in intervening galaxies and hence\nmissing in optically-selected samples.\n\nSimilar conclusions were reached by Fall & Pei (1989; 1992) who modelled\nthe obscuration of quasars by dust in damped Ly- @xmath absorption\nsystems. These intervening systems have column densities of neutral\nhydrogen in excess of @xmath and are believed to be the progenitors of\npresent day galactic disks. Fall & Pei (1992) estimate that @xmath -\n@xmath of bright quasars at @xmath are obscured by dust in damped Ly-\n@xmath systems. They find that the \u2018true\u2019 comoving density of bright\nquasars can exceed the observed comoving density by factors of up to 4\nat @xmath and by more than an order of magnitude at @xmath .\n\nWright (1986) has described a numerical method to compute the total\noptical depth in intervening dusty galaxies. In a later paper, Wright\n(1990) examined the relationship between the reddening observed in the\ncolours of optically-selected quasars and total @xmath -band optical\ndepth along the line-of-sight. He finds that individual galaxies with\n\u201csoft\u201d edges and large central optical depths (compared to those\npreviously assumed) are required to satisfy the range of colours\nobserved. This model also predicts a reduction in the numbers of quasars\nin optical flux-limited samples similar to that previously claimed.\n\nIn almost all of the studies above, only a relatively small region of\nparameter space defining the dust properties of galaxies has been\nexplored. Most of the parameters assumed describe galaxies which are\ndustier than those observed locally (eg. Giovanelli @xmath 1994; Byun\n1993). In this chapter, we repeat these calculations using a range of\nparameters that may describe the dust properties of galaxies. We modify\na statistical method introduced by Wright (1986) to calculate the\ndistribution in net optical depth in dust as a function of redshift.\nImplications of the results of our simulations on optical QSO number\ncounts, and on the recently detected reddening in the radio-quasar\nsample of Drinkwater @xmath (1997) are explored.\n\nThis chapter is organised as follows: in section 3.2 , we describe the\nmethod used to compute the optical depth distribution. Section 3.3\npresents the galaxy parameters for four different models and the results\nof our calculations. Section 3.4 investigates the effects of intervening\ngalactic dust on the counts of quasars in the optical. We also quantify\nthe bias introduced from using \u2018optically-selected\u2019 quasars to infer the\namount of dust reddening in the line-of-sight. A comparison of our\npredictions with observations in the radio sample of Drinkwater @xmath\n(1997) is given in section 3.5 . All results are summarised in section\n3.6 . Throughout, all calculations assume a Friedmann cosmology with\n@xmath and Hubble parameter @xmath where @xmath .\n\n#### 3.2 Optical Depth Distribution\n\nWe explore the effect of dust in intervening galaxies on quasar\nobservations by computing the probability distribution of optical depth\n@xmath as a function of redshift along any random line-of-sight. The\noptical depth for photons emitted at a redshift @xmath is the sum of\noptical depths from all galaxies intercepted to redshift @xmath . We\ndefine @xmath to be the total optical depth that is encountered by the\nemitted photons which are observed at @xmath in the @xmath -passband (\n@xmath \u00c5).\n\nThe method used is based on Wright (1986). We initially follow Wright by\nmodelling the universe as a series of concentric thin shells. The\nobserved extinction @xmath between redshifts 0 and @xmath can be\nrepresented as a sum of extinctions over intermediate redshifts,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFor a uniform dust distribution, the @xmath \u2019s in each redshift bin are\nall definite numbers, but if the absorption is due to dusty galaxies\nthen each @xmath is treated as an independent random variable. The\nprobability density function @xmath for optical depth @xmath over some\nredshift range @xmath can thus be written as a repeated convolution of\nprobabilities @xmath over the intermediate redshift bins:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath represents convolution. A Fourier transform method can then\nbe used to calculate @xmath in terms of model dependent galaxy\nparameters to be discussed later. We wish to obtain an explicit\nexpression for @xmath that may be computed for any set of model\nparameters. Details of the derivation are as follows.\n\nIf we denote @xmath as the probability density that a photon passing\nthrough the @xmath shell encounters an optical depth @xmath , then the\nFourier transform, @xmath of @xmath is defined\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.3)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nBy convolving the @xmath thin shells as in Eqn. 3.2 and taking the\nFourier transform of this convolution, we have the following\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nSince the shells are considered to be thin ( @xmath ), the probability\nthat the optical depth @xmath within any one shell is nonzero is small.\nHence for the @xmath shell we have\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThus we may write using Eqn. 3.4 ,\n\n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n     @xmath   @xmath   @xmath            (3.7)\n                                         \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n                       @xmath   @xmath   \n  -- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------\n\nTaking the limit where the shell size reduces to zero ( @xmath and hence\n@xmath ) we have from Eqn. 3.7 ,\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe function @xmath in the integrand of Eqn. 3.8 gives the probability\ndensity distribution for @xmath for some interval @xmath . Thus, the\nquantity @xmath gives the probability that the optical depth @xmath lies\nwithin the range @xmath for the interval @xmath .\n\nOur method for calculating the final result @xmath now differs from\nWright (1986). We wish to express @xmath in Eqn. 3.8 in terms of\nobservables, such as the mean number and optical depth of individual\ngalaxies within any interval @xmath . We can do this by noting that the\nmean optical depth for the interval @xmath in which @xmath lies within\n@xmath can be written\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (3.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nWe can also write this mean optical depth in terms of the mean galaxy\nnumber, @xmath , within @xmath and their individual optical depths.\nAssuming each galaxy within @xmath has a uniform dust distribution with\noptical depth @xmath , so that @xmath , we have\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe mean number of galaxies, @xmath , along a line of sight at some\nredshift within the range @xmath , is defined by (Weinberg, 1972)\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the cross-sectional area of a typical face-on galaxy,\nand @xmath the local comoving number density of galaxies which is\nassumed to be constant. In other words we will assume a non-evolving\ngalaxy population. Combining Eqns. 3.9 , 3.10 and 3.11 we have, for any\ninterval @xmath ,\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nSubstituting Eqn. 3.12 into Eqn. 3.8 and evaluating the integral with\nrespect to @xmath , we arrive at\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquation 3.13 holds for the case of uniform galactic disks where the\noptical depth of an individual galaxy, @xmath , is constant throughout\nthe disk. Note that @xmath in Eqn. 3.13 is a function of redshift @xmath\n. This is a consequence of the increase in absorber rest-frame frequency\nwith increasing redshift. The observed optical depth in a fixed bandpass\nwill therefore have a redshift dependence that exactly corresponds to\nthe frequency dependence of dust extinction in the absorber frame.\n\nFor galaxies with a non-uniform dust distribution, the optical depth is\na function of the impact parameter @xmath , so that @xmath in Eqn. 3.13\nis replaced by @xmath , where @xmath is the distance from the galaxy\u2019s\ncenter. Following Wright (1986) and as confirmed observationally by\nZaritsky (1994), we will model the absorbers as exponential galactic\ndisks, where the optical depth through a face-on disk decreases\nexponentially with distance @xmath from the center;\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.14)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is a characteristic galactic radius and @xmath , now, is\nthe value of @xmath through the centre of the galaxy @xmath . This\nprofile is supported by similar observations for the light distribution\nin nearby spirals (Freeman, 1970), and the existence of near-exponential\nradial metallicity gradients (Vila-Costas & Edmunds, 1992; Oey &\nKennicutt, 1993). Given the exponential profile (Eqn. 3.14 ), the\ncross-section @xmath in Eqn. 3.13 is replaced by an integral over @xmath\n. Making these replacements, Eqn. 3.13 becomes\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFurthermore, we will allow the disks of galaxies to be tilted with\nrespect to the line of sight by some random inclination angle @xmath (\n@xmath being the angle between the plane of the disk and the plane of\nthe sky). To introduce tilts we will need to consider a random\ninclination factor @xmath , where\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nAs a consequence, optical depths @xmath , will be increased by this\nfactor and cross-sectional areas, @xmath , decreased by the same amount.\nThus with the substitutions:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\nand averaging over @xmath where @xmath is randomly distributed between 0\nand 1, Eqn. 3.15 becomes\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWith the change of variables @xmath and @xmath and rearranging terms, we\nreach the final expression\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the constant @xmath defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis a model dependent parameter discussed in the next section and\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nis a standard mathematical function termed the \u201cExponential Integral\u201d.\n\nEquation 3.18 can be calculated numerically and the inverse Fourier\ntransform of @xmath gives the required probability density distribution\nfunction for the optical depth, @xmath , as a function of @xmath , i.e.\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nTo summarise, we have followed Wright (1986) (Eqns. 3.1 - 3.7 ) by\ndividing the universe into a series of concentric shells, each with a\ndistribution of galaxies. Using a Fourier transform method and\nconvolving the effect due to each shell, we have obtained the\nprobability density function for the total optical depth @xmath due to\nintervening galaxies in the range @xmath . Once the probability\ndistribution function @xmath is calculated from Eqns. 3.18 - 3.21 (for\nsome set of galaxy parameters), we can then determine the probability\nthat the total optical depth is some given value @xmath along any\nline-of-sight to redshift @xmath .\n\n#### 3.3 Model Parameters and Results\n\nOur model depends on three parameters which describe the characteristics\nof the intervening galaxies. @xmath and @xmath are included in @xmath\n(Eqn. 3.19 ), which gives the average number of intersections in a\nHubble length of a light ray within @xmath of a galaxy\u2019s centre. The\nthird parameter, @xmath , is the dust opacity at the center of an\nindividual absorber. In this work we assume the optical depth follows a\nsimple linear dependence on frequency, thus\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the @xmath -band optical depth at the center of a local\ngalaxy ( @xmath ) and @xmath . More complex models where the extinction\ncurve includes a @xmath \u00c5\u00a0 bump, as in the Milky Way are considered by\nHeisler & Ostriker (1988). However recent work (Calzetti @xmath 1994)\nfinds no evidence of such a feature in the extinction curves of nearby\ngalaxies.\n\nTable 3.1 gives the values of three parameters for each of four models\nto be considered. Model 1 uses the values of Heisler & Ostriker (1988).\nTheir value of @xmath was chosen to yield a sky covering fraction of\ngalaxies which is consistent with the percentage of quasars detected\nwith damped Ly- @xmath absorption systems along the line-of-sight. For\nthe nominal value @xmath , they find (from Eqn. 3.19 ) @xmath kpc, which\nis large compared to values typical of present day spirals ( @xmath kpc,\nFreeman, 1970). Heisler & Ostriker have set @xmath from a study of the\nrange of absorption in galaxies by Phillips (1986).\n\nModel 2 uses the values of Wright (1990) who studied correlations\nbetween reddening and obscuration of background quasars. This model\ncontains the same total amount of dust as Model 1 but the dust is\nconcentrated in a smaller number of more opaque clouds. In other words,\nby making @xmath larger, one approaches the opaque, hard-edged disk\nlimit.\n\nThe values in Models 3 and 4 are believed to be more representative of\nlocal galaxies. In both of these models @xmath , consistent with lower\nlimits for spiral galaxies derived by Disney and Phillipps (1989), Byun\n(1993) and Giovanelli @xmath (1994). Model 3 has a characteristic radius\nof @xmath kpc, while Model 4 represents a minimal model with @xmath kpc\nand @xmath .\n\n##### 3.3.1 Results and Analysis\n\nFor each set of galaxy parameters ( @xmath , @xmath , @xmath ),\ndistribution functions @xmath for the total optical depth have been\ncomputed from Eqns. 3.18 - 3.21 in redshift intervals of 0.5 up to\n@xmath . Figures 3.1 a and b show the optical depth probability density\ndistributions at different redshifts for Models 1 and 4 respectively. As\ndiscussed, these refer to two extreme scenarios. The curves in Fig. 3.1\na closely resemble those computed by Heisler and Ostriker (1988) (see\ntheir figure 1), except that the median points differ. This is due to\nHeisler and Ostriker adopting an extinction curve for the dust which\ninvolves the @xmath \u00c5\u00a0 feature. The probability that the total optical\ndepth to some redshift @xmath lies within the interval @xmath is given\nby the area under the normalised curve:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor each curve in Fig. 3.1 , a dot is drawn to indicate the median point\nwhere the curve integrated over @xmath equals @xmath . Physically, this\nmeans that for a specific dust model and redshift @xmath , we should\nexpect that in a radio-quasar survey (expected to be unbiased against\nreddening by dust), at least 50% of sources with redshifts @xmath should\nsuffer extinctions corresponding to @xmath .\n\nFigure 3.2 shows the probability that the total optical depth towards\nsome redshift @xmath is greater than 1, computed from the distribution\nfunctions for Models 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Table 3.1 . The probability @xmath\nup to a redshift @xmath is the fraction of the sky to that redshift\nwhich has at least @xmath . Model 1 predicts that all sources with\n@xmath should have at least @xmath , whereas the percentage drops to\n@xmath and @xmath for Models 2 and 3 respectively. The obscuration in\nModel 4 becomes significant for redshift @xmath , where more than @xmath\nof sources are predicted to encounter an optical depth of at least\n@xmath .\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3.2 , Model 1 corresponding to \u201csoft\u201d-edged galactic\ndisks predicts that obscuration should be less severe by as much as a\nfactor of 2 at redshifts @xmath than that of the \u201charder\u201d-edged disk\nModel 2. For redshifts @xmath , the situation reverses: optical depths\npredicted by Model 1 exceed those predicted by Model 2. This can be\nexplained by the values of the parameters defining these models in Table\n3.1 . The \u201charder\u201d edged galaxies with higher central optical depths in\nModel 2 are more effective in causing significant obscuration at lower\nredshifts ( @xmath ). Light emitted from a source is more likely to\nsuffer reddening once it encounters a harder-edged disk than for a\nsofter-edged disk (Model 1), even though Model 1 contains a greater\nnumber of galaxies per unit redshift interval. At redshifts @xmath ,\nobscuration becomes more dependent on the number of galaxies\nintercepting a light ray (the parameter @xmath in Table 3.1 ). Model 1\nwith four times as many galaxies along the line of sight, therefore\ndominates the optical depth to high redshifts.\n\nThe mean optical depth to a given @xmath provides a handle on making the\ncomparison between the dust content specified by each set of model\nparameters in Table 3.1 . Heisler & Ostriker (1988) have shown that the\nmean optical depth to a redshift @xmath scales as the following product:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nEquation 3.24 is plotted in Fig. 3.3 for the models listed in Table 3.1\n.\n\n#### 3.4 Effect on Quasar Number Counts\n\nWe will give a simple illustration of the effects of dust in intervening\nforeground galaxies on quasar counts in the optical. We assume that the\n\u2018true\u2019 number of quasars (ie. in a \u2018dust-free\u2019 universe) at a given\nredshift follows a power-law:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.25)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the total number of quasars observed at fixed @xmath\nwith fluxes greater than some limiting flux @xmath , and @xmath is the\ncumulative luminosity function slope.\n\nIn a dusty universe, quasars observed through a uniform extinction\n@xmath have their true fluxes reduced by a factor @xmath . The total\nnumber of sources that will be reddened below some flux limit @xmath\n(and hence removed from a sample) can therefore be written: @xmath .\nUsing Eqn. 3.25 , we can rewrite this as: @xmath . Since there is a\nprobability @xmath of encountering an optical depth @xmath , the total\nfraction of sources lost from a sample (relative to a dust-free\nuniverse) at some redshift is:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.26)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis fraction scales in terms of the model galaxy parameters as follows:\n\n  -- -------- --\n     @xmath   \n  -- -------- --\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.27)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere the last step follows when the argument of the exponential is\nsmall, which for typical values of @xmath and @xmath , is sufficiently\naccurate for @xmath and redshifts @xmath . We see from Eqn. 3.27 that\nthe obscuration of background sources by line-of-sight galactic dust has\na stronger dependence on the covering factor parameter @xmath (Eqn. 3.19\n), than on the central absorber optical depth @xmath (see section 4.3.2\nfor more details). The fraction of sources missing from some flux limit\nwill increase with increasing @xmath ; in other words, a steeper\nluminosity function implies that a greater fraction of sources will be\nlost from a flux-limited sample.\n\nFrom surveys of quasars selected in the @xmath -band, the slope @xmath\nat the bright end of the cumulative luminosity function (typically for\n@xmath ) lies in the range @xmath (Boyle @xmath 1990). We have chosen\nthe lower bound @xmath . Figure 3.4 plots @xmath , which with @xmath ,\nis a lower limit on the fraction of \u2018bright\u2019 quasars missing from a\n@xmath -band flux limited sample. These sources may be detected as\noptical \u2018empty fields\u2019 in radio surveys. The prediction for each of our\nfour models is shown. Model 1 predicts that almost no quasars should be\nobserved at @xmath within some flux limit, while for model 4, we expect\nat least 5% and @xmath of quasars at redshifts @xmath and @xmath\nrespectively to have been missed.\n\n##### 3.4.1 Dust Reddening and Bias in Optically-Selected Samples\n\nThe mean optical depths as a function of redshift illustrated in Fig.\n3.3 represent \u2018true\u2019 optical depths associated with line-of-sight dusty\ngalaxies. Since optically-selected quasars are expected to be biased\nagainst significant amounts of dust in their line-of-sight, the\npredictions in Fig. 3.3 are expected to differ considerably from\nreddening estimates deduced from optically-selected samples. Due to the\nrelatively large dispersion about the mean optical depth to any redshift\nas shown in the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of Fig. 3.1 ,\nonly background sources which have suffered sufficiently low optical\ndepths will be reddened such as to remain within the flux limit of a\nsample. Thus, this observational bias will lead to an effective\n\u2018observed\u2019 mean optical depth that is considerably smaller than the\n\u2018true\u2019 optical depths modelled above. In this section, we present a\nsimple model to quantify this bias.\n\nIn general, the mean optical depth to any redshift is defined as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.28)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the probability distribution function describing the\ndust model. To give an estimate of \u201cobserved\u201d optical depth as inferred\nfrom observations of the reddening in an optically-selected quasar\npopulation, we must take into account the effects of the \u201cfinite\u201d flux\nlimit imposed. To do this, we require information regarding the quasar\nluminosity distribution. To give a simple illustration, we shall assume\na power-law luminosity function like above (Eqn. 3.25 ). We require an\neffective \u201cobserved\u201d PDF for the optical depth to the optically detected\nsources. For a power-law luminosity function, this observed PDF is given\nby @xmath , where @xmath is the probability that a source which is\nreddened by amount @xmath , will remain within the flux of a sample (see\nabove) and @xmath is the \u201ctrue\u201d optical depth probability distribution\nmodelled in section 3.2 . From Eqn. 3.28 and requiring that @xmath be\nnormalised, the \u201cobserved\u201d optical depth to optically detected sources\nat some redshift can be written:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.29)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThis can be shown to scale in terms of the dust model parameters as\nfollows:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.30)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFigure 3.5 shows the \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cobserved\u201d model optical depths as a\nfunction of redshift. A quasar (cumulative) luminosity function slope of\n@xmath and dust parameters @xmath , @xmath kpc and @xmath are assumed.\nThe @xmath spread is shown for @xmath only, while for the \u201ctrue\u201d optical\ndepth @xmath , the @xmath value (where @xmath ) is almost equal to the\nmean itself at all redshifts. We see that the mean observed reddening to\noptically detected quasars can be less by up to a factor of 3 than the\ntrue mean at redshifts @xmath and a factor of 6 at redshifts @xmath .\nComparing Eqns. 3.24 and 3.30 , the ratio @xmath will be independent of\nthe covering factor parameter @xmath , and will only slightly depend on\nthe central galaxy optical depth @xmath . We conclude that the use of\noptically selected quasars as a means to measure the dust content along\nthe line-of-sight can lead to results that are grossly in error.\n\n#### 3.5 Comparison with \u2018Reddened\u2019 Parkes Quasars\n\nLet us consider whether the reddening observed in the radio-selected\nquasar sample of Drinkwater @xmath (1997) (hereafter \u2018Parkes quasars\u2019)\ncan all be attributed to dust in galaxies that may happen to lie along\nthe line-of-sight. From Fig. 1.2 in section 1.5.3 , two aspects of the\nobservations are relevant: (i) overall, more than @xmath of the sample\nis reddened with colours @xmath , and (ii) the distribution in reddening\n(with median @xmath ) is relatively uniform with redshift to @xmath .\n\nAssuming the generic @xmath extinction law, and that the intrinsic\n(unabsorbed) colour of Parkes quasars is equivalent to the mean value\n@xmath found for optically-selected quasars (which show relatively small\nscatter; see Fig. 1.2 ), the observed @xmath -band optical depth can be\nwritten:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (3.31)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nObserved colours of @xmath therefore correspond to optical depths @xmath\nin the @xmath -band.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3.2 , model 4 (our \u2018minimal\u2019 model) predicts that the\nnumber of reddened quasars exhibiting @xmath is small. For example at\n@xmath , there is almost no predicted reddening. From the observations,\nas many as @xmath of such quasars show significant reddening. Thus, dust\nmodel 4 cannot account for all the observed reddening. The most\nstringent test for model 1 (our \u2018maximal\u2019 model) is at low redshift (\n@xmath ), where a reddening of @xmath is predicted for all but a few\npercent of quasars (see Fig. 3.2 ). More than @xmath of Parkes quasars\nobserved at @xmath however appear strongly reddened. The predicted\nnumber of reddened quasars to @xmath is closer to the observed value,\nbut the dependence of reddening with redshift is inconsistent with that\nobserved.\n\nWe conclude that if the observed reddening is to be totally explained by\ndust in galaxies in the line-of-sight, then more complicated models are\nrequired. An example is the inclusion of evolution in galactic dust\nwhich has been neglected in this chapter. A more detailed model is\npresented and constrained using the data in the next chapter.\n\n#### 3.6 Conclusions\n\nIn this chapter, we have modelled the effects of obscuration due to dust\nin galaxies randomly distributed along the line-of-sight as a function\nof redshift. We have modelled galaxies as randomly inclined disks with\nexponential dust profiles. As an initial investigation, no allowance has\nbeen made for possible evolution in galactic dust content with redshift.\n\nOur main results are:\n1. Flux-limited, optically selected quasar surveys are strongly biased\nagainst reddening by line-of-sight dust. Optically selected quasars are\nexpected to exhibit only a few percent of the total reddening to any\nredshift, and do not provide a handle on the total dust content of the\nuniverse. Our \u2018minimal\u2019 dust model predicts that at least 10% of quasars\nat redshifts @xmath may have been under-represented in optical surveys.\n2. The distribution of observed reddening in quasars in the\nradio-selected sample of Drinkwater @xmath (1996) cannot be fully\nexplained by a non-evolving distribution of dusty galaxies along the\nline-of-sight. The observed dependence of reddening on redshift is\ninconsistent with our predictions.\n3. The models depend on a range of parameters which will require\ndetailed fitting of the observations. The observed reddening\ndistribution as a function of redshift for Parkes quasars may provide a\nstrong constraint on possible models. In the next chapter, a detailed\ncomparison of more complicated models with the data is presented.\n\nThe predictions of this chapter can be best confirmed using\nradio-selected quasar samples which should have no bias against\nobscuration by dust. If models of dusty line-of-sight galaxies are\ncorrect, then a large fraction of radio-selected quasars at high\nredshift must appear heavily reddened. If they are to be completely\nruled out, then current radio surveys will have to identify virtually\nall highly reddened sources as low redshift galaxies or quasars that are\nintrinsically reddened.\n\n### Chapter 4 Time Evolution of Galactic Dust and the Obscuration of\nQuasars\n\nAll space, all time,\nThe stars, the terrible perturbations of the suns,\nSwelling, collapsing, ending, serving their longer, shorter use,\nEver the mutable,\nEver materials, changing, crumbling, recohering \u2026\n\n\u2014 Song Of Myself\n\nWalter Whitman, 1855\n\n#### 4.1 Introduction\n\nAs shown in Chapter 3, the distribution of observed reddening in quasars\nin the radio-selected sample of Drinkwater @xmath (1997) (hereafter the\n\u2018Parkes sample\u2019) cannot be fully explained by a non-evolving\ndistribution of dusty galaxies along the line-of-sight. The observations\n(see Fig. 1.2 ) indicate a mean reddening which scales as a function of\nredshift as @xmath . This dependence is considerably \u2018flatter\u2019 than the\nmean optical depth predicted from models where the dust content is\nassumed not to evolve where @xmath (see section 3.3.1 ). By introducing\nevolution in dust content, it may be possible to reproduce the \u2018flat\u2019\nreddening behaviour as a function of redshift in the Parkes sample. This\nchapter explores the effects of more complicated models where galactic\ndust content evolves.\n\nCosmic evolution in dust content to redshifts @xmath is indirectly\nsuggested by numerous claims of reduced chemical enrichment at @xmath\nrelative to local estimates. This is provided by observations of trace\nmetals and their relative abundances in QSO absorption-line systems to\n@xmath (Meyer & Roth, 1990; Savaglio, D\u2019Odorico & M\u00f6ller, 1994; Pettini\n@xmath . 1994; Wolfe @xmath . 1994; Pettini @xmath 1997; Songaila,\n1997), which are thought to arise from intervening clouds or the haloes\nand disks of galaxies. These studies indicate mean metallicities @xmath\nand @xmath solar at @xmath and @xmath respectively, and dust-to-gas\nratios @xmath of the galactic value at @xmath . These estimates are\nconsistent with simple global evolution models of the star formation\nrate and evolution of gas in the universe (Pei & Fall, 1995). If the\nobserved metallicities in QSO absorption systems are common, then their\ninterpretation as galactic disks implies that substantial evolution has\ntaken place since @xmath . If dust follows a similar trend (as expected\nif dust follows heavy metal production from stellar processes), then one\nmay expect the effects of obscuration to high redshift to be reduced\nrelative to non-evolving predictions.\n\nIn this chapter, we investigate the reddening effects of dust located in\ngalaxies along the line-of-sight using models where the dust content\nevolves. Implications of obscuration on QSO and absorption line\nstatistics are explored. We use optical and near-infrared observations\nin the Parkes sample to constrain evolutionary and physical properties\nof dust in intervening systems. Using existing observations of galactic\ndust properties, we also quantify the contribution of dust in external\nsystems to the reddening observed in this sample.\n\nThis chapter is organised as follows: The next section briefly describes\nthe generalised model. Section 4.3 presents the model predictions.\nImplications of dust obscuration on observations of background quasars\nand QSO absorption line systems are explored in section 4.4 . In section\n4.5 , we fit our model to the Parkes quasar data. Comparisons of our\nconstrained parameters with existing observations are made in section\n4.6 . Possible uncertainties are discussed in section 4.7 and all\nresults are summarised in section 4.8 . All calculations assume a\nFriedmann cosmology with @xmath , and Hubble parameter @xmath where\n@xmath (unless otherwise stated).\n\n#### 4.2 The Evolutionary Dust Model\n\nWe calculate the distribution in total dust optical depth from model\ngalaxies along the line-of-sight as a function of redshift by following\nthe method presented in Chapter 3. This method does not include the\neffects of evolution. We shall generalise this model by considering the\npossibility of evolution in the dust properties of galaxies.\n\nWe assume the following properties for individual absorbing galaxies. As\nassumed in Chapter 3, we model galaxies as randomly tilted exponential\ndisks, where the optical depth through a face-on disk decreases\nexponentially with distance @xmath from the center;\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.1)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n@xmath is a characteristic radius and @xmath , the value of @xmath\nthrough the center of the galaxy @xmath . The redshift dependence of\n@xmath is due to the increase in absorber rest frame frequency with\nredshift.\n\nSince the observed reddening in Parkes sources (with which we shall\ncompare our model) is measured in terms of a @xmath colour excess, we\nrequire an extinction law that covers the optical to near-infrared\nwavelength range. In this study, we assume an extinction law which\nrepresents an average of a number of laws computed for our galaxy and\nseveral external galaxies by Rieke & Lebofsky (1985), Knapen @xmath\n(1991) and Jansen @xmath (1994). This law applies for passbands @xmath\nto @xmath where the optical depth scales as frequency as @xmath . Thus,\nthe optical depth in an observer\u2019s frame through an absorber at redshift\n@xmath ( @xmath in Eqn. 4.1 ) will follow the dependence:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.2)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the @xmath -band optical depth through the center of a\nlocal galaxy ( @xmath ).\n\n##### 4.2.1 Evolution\n\nEquation 4.2 must be modified if the dust content in each galaxy is\nassumed to evolve with cosmic time. The optical depth seen through the\ncenter of a single absorber at some redshift, @xmath , depends on the\nquantity of dust formed from past stellar processes. For simplicity, we\nassume all galaxies form simultaneously, maintain a constant space\ndensity, and increase in dust content at a rate that is uniform\nthroughout.\n\nWe parameterise evolution in dust content by following simulations of\nthe formation of heavy metals in the cold dark matter scenario of galaxy\nformation by Blain & Longair (1993a,1993b). These authors assume that\ngalaxies form by the coalescence of gaseous protoclouds through\nhierarchical clustering as prescribed by Press & Schechter (1974). A\nfixed fraction of the mass involved in each merger event is converted\ninto stars, leading to the formation of heavy metals and dust. It was\nassumed that the energy liberated through stellar radiation was absorbed\nby dust and re-radiated into the far-infrared. They found that such\nradiation can contribute substantially to the far-infrared background\nintensity from which they constrain a model for the formation of heavy\nmetals as a function of cosmic time. Their models show that the comoving\ndensity of heavy metals created by some redshift @xmath , given that\nstar formation commenced at some epoch @xmath follows the form\n\n  -- -- -- -------\n           (4.3)\n  -- -- -- -------\n\nWe assume that a fixed fraction of heavy metals condense into dust\ngrains so that the comoving density in dust, @xmath , follows a similar\ndependence as Eqn. 4.3 . The density in dust relative to the present\nclosure density in @xmath exponential disks per unit comoving volume is\ngiven by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.4)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath and @xmath is the dust mass in a single exponential disk.\nThis mass can be estimated using Eq.7-24 from Spitzer (1978) where the\ntotal density in dust, @xmath , is related to the extinction @xmath\nalong a path length @xmath in kpc by\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.5)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\n@xmath and @xmath are the density and dielectric constant of a typical\ndust grain respectively and the numerical factor has dimensions of\n@xmath - see Spitzer (1978). Using the exponential profile (Eqn. 4.1 )\nwhere @xmath and integrating along cylinders, the dust mass in a single\nexponential disk can be found in terms of the model parameters @xmath\nand @xmath . We find that the comoving density in dust at some redshift\nscales as\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.6)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath is the central @xmath -band optical depth and @xmath the\ndust scale radius of each disk. Thus, the central optical depth, @xmath\n, in any model absorber at some redshift is directly proportional to the\nmass density in dust or heavy metals as specified by Eqn. 4.3 ;\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.7)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nThe redshift dependence in optical depth observed in the fixed @xmath\n-bandpass due to a single absorber now involves two factors. First, the\nextinction properties of the dust as defined by Eqn. 4.2 and second, its\nevolution specified by Eqn. 4.7 . We replace @xmath (the star formation\nepoch) by a hypothesised \u201cdust formation epoch\u201d @xmath . By convolving\nEqns. 4.2 and 4.7 , and requiring that locally; @xmath , the \u201cobserved\u201d\noptical depth through a single absorber at some redshift @xmath now\ntakes the form:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.8)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nFig. 4.1 illustrates the combined effects of evolution and increase in\nobserved frame @xmath -band extinction with redshift defined by Eqn. 4.8\n. The extinction initially increases with @xmath due to a decrease in\ncorresponding rest frame wavelength. Depending on the value for @xmath ,\nit then decreases due to evolution in dust content. This latter effect\ndominates towards @xmath .\n\nThe characteristic galactic dust radius @xmath defined in Eqn. 4.1 is\nalso given a redshift dependence in the sense that galaxies had smaller\ndust-haloes at earlier epochs. The following evolutionary form is\nadopted:\n\n  -- -------- -- -------\n     @xmath      (4.9)\n  -- -------- -- -------\n\nwhere @xmath gives the rate of evolution and @xmath is now a \u2018local\u2019\nscale radius. Evolution in radial dust extent is suggested by dynamical\nmodels of star formation in an initially formed protogalaxy (Edmunds,\n1990 and references therein). These studies show that the star formation\nrate and hence metallicity in disk galaxies has a radial dependence that\ndecreases outwards at all times. It is thus quite plausible that\ngalaxies have an evolving effective \u2018dust radius\u2019 which follows chemical\nenrichment from stellar processes.\n\nOur parameterisation for evolution in galactic dust (Eqns 4.7 and 4.9 )\nis qualitatively similar to the \u2018accretion models\u2019 for chemical\nevolution of Wang (1991), where the effects of grain destruction by\nsupernovae and grain formation in molecular clouds is taken into\naccount. This model is also consistent with empirical age-metallicity\nrelationships inferred from stellar spectral observations in the Galaxy\n(Wheeler, Snedin & Truran 1989), and models of chemical evolution on a\ncosmic scale implied by absorption-line observations of quasars\n(Lanzetta @xmath 1995; Pei & Fall, 1995).\n\n#### 4.3 Model Parameters and Results\n\n##### 4.3.1 Model Parameters\n\nOur model depends on four independent parameters which describe the\ncharacteristics and evolutionary properties of intervening galaxies. The\nparameters defined \u2018locally\u2019 are: the comoving number density of\ngalaxies; @xmath , the characteristic dust radius; @xmath and dust\nopacity @xmath at the center of an individual absorber. The evolution in\n@xmath and @xmath is defined by Eqns 4.7 and 4.9 respectively.\nParameters defining their evolution are @xmath for @xmath , and the\n\u2018dust formation epoch\u2019 @xmath for @xmath . Both @xmath and @xmath have\nbeen conveniently combined into the parameter @xmath where\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.10)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwith @xmath being the Hubble length. This parameter is proportional to\nthe number of galaxies and mean optical depth introduced along the\nline-of-sight (see section 4.3.2 ). It also represents a \u2018local\u2019\ncovering factor in dusty galactic disks - the fraction of sky at the\nobserver covered in absorbers.\n\nIn all calculations, we assume a fixed value for @xmath . From Eqn. 4.10\n, any evolution in the comoving number density @xmath is included in the\nevolution parameter @xmath for @xmath (Eqn. 4.9 ). Thus in general,\n@xmath represents an effective evolution parameter for both @xmath and\n@xmath . Our model is therefore specified by four parameters: @xmath ,\n@xmath , @xmath and @xmath .\n\n##### 4.3.2 Results and Analysis\n\nUsing the formalism of Chapter 3 (ie. Eqns 3.18 - 3.21 ), Fig. 4.2 shows\nprobability density functions @xmath for the total optical depth up to\nredshifts @xmath 1, 3 and 5 for two sets of galaxy parameters ( @xmath ,\n@xmath ), and four sets of evolutionary parameters ( @xmath , @xmath )\nfor each. The values ( @xmath , @xmath ) were chosen to bracket the\nrange available from existing observations. In studies investigating the\neffects of intervening galaxies on background quasars, Heisler &\nOstriker (1988) chose @xmath and @xmath , with @xmath (Eqn. 4.10 )\ncorresponding to a scale radius @xmath kpc, for a nominal comoving\ndensity @xmath . On examination of the literature, Fall & Pei (1992)\nhowever considered the ranges: @xmath and @xmath . This range for @xmath\nis consistent with values found by Rix & Rieke (1993), Giovanelli @xmath\n(1994), Valentijn (1994) and Xu & Buat (1995).\n\nThe values ( @xmath , @xmath ) were chosen to cover a range of evolution\nstrengths for @xmath and @xmath respectively. To cover a plausible range\nof dust formation epochs, we consider @xmath , consistent with a range\nof galaxy \u2018formation\u2019 epochs predicted by existing theories of structure\nformation (eg. Peebles, 1989). The upper bound @xmath corresponds to the\nstar formation epoch considered in the galaxy formation models of Blain\n& Longair (1993b). The values considered for @xmath ( @xmath ) may be\ncompared with those implied by observations of the space density of\nmetal absorption systems from QSO spectra as a function of redshift\n(Sargent, Boksenberg & Steidel, 1988; Thomas & Webster 1990). A decrease\nin absorber numbers is often implied, suggesting fewer (or less)\nchemically enriched regions at high redshift. Present estimates on the\nevolution of absorber numbers however are poorly constrained. Thomas &\nWebster (1990) have combined several datasets increasing absorption\nredshift ranges to give strong constraints on evolution models. For C IV\nabsorption, their values for the evolution parameter @xmath (where\n@xmath -see section 4.6.2 for more details) correspond in our model, at\nthe @xmath level to @xmath and @xmath for rest frame equivalent widths\n@xmath \u00c5 @xmath and @xmath \u00c5 @xmath respectively.\n\nThe area under any normalised curve in Fig. 4.2 gives the fraction of\nlines-of-sight to that redshift which have optical depths within some\ninterval @xmath . Towards high redshifts, we find that obscuration\ndepends most sensitively on the parameter @xmath , in other words, on\nthe covering factor of absorbers (Eqn. 4.10 ). Figure 4.2 shows that as\nthe amount of dust at high redshift increases, ie., as @xmath and @xmath\nincrease, the curves show little horizontal shift towards larger optical\ndepths from @xmath to @xmath . A significant shift becomes noticeable\nhowever for the weaker evolution cases, and is largest for \u2018no\nevolution\u2019 (solid lines). This behaviour is further investigated below.\n\nIn order to give a clearer comparison between the amount of obscuration\nand strength of evolution implied by our model parameters ( @xmath ), we\nhave calculated the mean and variance in total optical depth as a\nfunction of redshift. Formal derivations of these quantities are given\nin Appendix C. Here we are mainly concerned with their general\ndependence on the model parameters.\n\nA useful quantity first worth noting is the number of galaxies\nintercepted along the line-of-sight. In a @xmath ( @xmath ) universe,\nthe average number of intersections within a scale length @xmath of a\ngalaxy\u2019s center by a light ray to some redshift is given by\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.11)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nWhere @xmath and @xmath are defined in Eqns 4.9 and 4.10 respectively.\n\nThe mean optical depth due to intervening dusty galaxies to some\nredshift @xmath is found to scale as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.12)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the optical depth at the center of a local galaxy. An\nexact expression for @xmath follows for the no evolution case:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.13)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nA more convenient measure of the obscuration is the scatter or variance\nin optical depth about the mean to some redshift. The mean optical depth\nhas a simple linear dependence on the parameters @xmath and @xmath and\nthus gives no indication of the degree to which each of these parameters\ncontributes to the scatter. As seen from the probability distributions\nin Fig. 4.2 , there is a relatively large scatter about the mean optical\ndepth to any redshift. The variance is found to scale as\n\n  -- -- -- --------\n           (4.14)\n  -- -- -- --------\n\nIn the no evolution case, the variance is given by the exact expression:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.15)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFrom Eqn. 4.14 or 4.15 , it is seen that the strongest dependence of the\nvariance is on the central absorber optical depth @xmath . Larger values\nof @xmath (corresponding to \u2018harder-edged\u2019 disks), are likely to\nintroduce considerable scatter amongst random individual lines of sight,\neven to relatively low redshift.\n\nIn Fig. 4.3 , we show how the mean optical depth varies as a function of\nredshift for a range of evolutionary parameters. \u2018Strong evolution\u2019 is\ncharacterised by @xmath , @xmath (dot-dashed curves), as compared to the\n\u2018no\u2019, \u2018weak\u2019 and \u2018moderate\u2019 evolution cases indicated. The mean optical\ndepth flattens out considerably towards high redshift in the strong\nevolution case, and gradually steepens as @xmath and @xmath are\nincreased. Note that no such flattening is expected in mean reddening\nfor the no evolution case (Fig. 4.3 c). The mean optical depth to\nredshifts @xmath in evolution models can be reduced by factors of at\nleast four, even for low to moderately low evolution strengths.\n\nFigure 4.3 d shows the scaling of mean optical depth with respect to the\nevolutionary parameters. It is seen that obscuration depends most\nsensitively on the parameter @xmath , which controls the rate of\nevolution in galactic dust scale radius @xmath . A similar trend is\nfollowed in Fig. 4.4 , which shows the dependence of variance in optical\ndepth on evolution as a function of redshift, for fixed ( @xmath ,\n@xmath ). Considerable scatter is expected if the dust radius of a\ntypical galaxy evolves slowly with cosmic time as shown for the\n\u2018weakest\u2019 evolution case @xmath in Fig. 4.4 .\n\nOur main conclusion is that the inclusion of evolution in dust content,\nby amounts consistent with other indirect studies can dramatically\nreduce the redshift dependence of total reddening along the\nline-of-sight to @xmath , contrary to previous non-evolving predictions.\n\n#### 4.4 Implications\n\nThis section explores some consequences of obscuration by intervening\ngalactic dust as predicted by our generalised model above. We\ninvestigate two issues: First, implications on QSO absorption line\nstatistics due to obscuration of background QSOs by dust in absorption\nsystems and second, on evolution of the comoving quasar number density\nwith redshift.\n\n##### 4.4.1 Quasar Absorption Line Systems\n\nDue to their strength, the heavy element absorption systems in QSO\nspectra studied in depth are the Mg II and C IV doublet lines (Tytler\n@xmath 1987; Sargent, Boksenberg & Steidel, 1988). A major step in\nunderstanding the origin of these systems is to tie the properties of\nthe absorbers to the properties of galaxies. It has been found that\n@xmath of known Mg II absorbers are associated with galaxies, confirming\nthe hypothesis that metal line systems do in fact arise from intervening\ngalaxies (Bergeron & Boisse, 1991 and references therein).\n\nOne of the major concerns in QSO absorption line surveys is the\nexistence of a selection bias due to obscuration by dust. As discussed\nby Pettini @xmath (1994), this bias is based on the fact that metal line\nabsorption systems are usually detected in quasars which need to be\nrelatively bright in the optical (ie. @xmath ) to enable accurate\nspectroscopic confirmation. Those absorbers that are significantly dusty\nand hence presumably metal rich may obscure some of the quasars and\nhence escape detection. This will lead to an underestimate of inferred\nabsorber numbers and hence mean metallicity towards high @xmath .\n\nIn this section, we compute the distribution in equivalent width (EW) of\nmetal absorption line systems predicted by our evolving dust-galaxy\nmodel. We also estimate the fraction of metal line systems that may have\nbeen missed from existing surveys due to obscuration by dust.\n\nWe assume absorbers to be associated with spherical haloes where the\ndust optical depth through an absorber follows the exponential profile\nEqn. 4.1 . Allowing for non-uniformity, the number of absorbers along\nthe line-of-sight is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. In other\nwords, the probability that an absorber is intersected within a distance\n@xmath of its center along a line-of-sight to redshift @xmath is given\nby:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.16)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath represents the mean number of intersections within @xmath .\nIn a complete sample, unbiased with respect to obscuration by dust, we\nshall define @xmath where\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.17)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n(see Appendix C). As before, we assume a direct proportionality between\nheavy metal abundance and the amount of dust extinction. To convert from\noptical depth through a single absorber to an absorption line EW\nmeasure, we make use of the \u201clocal\u201d calibration:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.18)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nfound along a number of galactic and LMC sight lines (Ostriker, Vogeley\n& York, 1990 and references therein). We shall follow these authors who\nused Eqn. 4.18 to infer the amount of dust reddening associated with QSO\nabsorption line systems. We assume the mean value @xmath in our\ncalculations.\n\nThe fraction of background QSOs at a redshift @xmath exhibiting\nabsorption lines with rest frame EWs greater than some value @xmath , is\nsimply the fraction of QSOs whose line-of-sight passes within some\nradius @xmath of an exponential dust profile such that @xmath for radii\n@xmath . Converting our rest frame central @xmath -band optical depth\n@xmath into @xmath assuming a galactic extinction law, Eqn. 4.7 can be\nre-written:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.19)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nOur exponential dust profile at any @xmath which includes evolution in\nthe scale radius @xmath can be written\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.20)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\n@xmath and @xmath are our evolutionary model parameters as defined in\nsection 4.3.1 . Combining Eqns. 4.18 , 4.19 and 4.20 , we find that an\nabsorber at redshift @xmath will give rise to an absorption line with EW\ngreater than some value @xmath if it is intercepted within a radius:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.21)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nThe \u201ctrue\u201d (or unbiased) mean number of absorber intersections to a\nredshift @xmath (Eqn. 4.17 ), which yield EWs @xmath can now be written\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.22)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is defined by Eqn. 4.21 .\n\nTo determine the fraction of QSOs with absorption line EWs @xmath in an\noptical flux-limited QSO sample, we must account for the bias due to\nobscuration by dust. In other words, the mean number of absorption\nsystems intercepted to \u2018bright\u2019 optically selected QSOs is expected to\nbe less than @xmath defined by Eqn. 4.22 . Let us define the \u201cobserved\u201d\nmean number of intersections as\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.23)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nwhere @xmath is the \u2018dust bias\u2019 factor. To some redshift and for a fixed\nabsorber optical depth @xmath , the \u201ctrue\u201d (unbiased) mean optical\ndepth, @xmath , is directly proportional to the mean number of absorbers\nintercepted @xmath (cf. Eqns. 4.11 and 4.13 ), since both depend\nlinearly on the covering factor parameter @xmath . For a fixed QSO\ndistribution, this implies that @xmath will also be true, where @xmath\nis the \u201cobserved\u201d mean optical depth to optically detected sources (see\nsection 3.4.1 ). Comparing the functional forms of @xmath , @xmath and\n@xmath (eg. Eqns. 4.11 , 3.24 and 3.30 ), one can easily (and crudely)\nguess an approximate functional form for @xmath . Given this, it can be\nshown that for redshifts @xmath and optical depths @xmath , the bias\nfactor @xmath will scale as:\n\n  -- -------- -- --------\n     @xmath      (4.24)\n  -- -------- -- --------\n\nFor a given set of absorber dust parameters and QSO luminosity function\nslope, @xmath can be easily computed from the observed and true mean\noptical depth following the formalism in section 3.4.1 .\n\nTo summarise, the \u201ctrue\u201d (unbiased) fraction of QSOs with absorption\nline EWs @xmath is computed by combining Eqns. 4.16 , 4.21 and 4.22 ,\nwhile the \u201cobserved\u201d fraction (corrected for dust obscuration) involves\nuse of the bias factor @xmath (Eqns. 4.23 and 4.24 ), where @xmath is\nreplaced by @xmath in Eqn. 4.16 .\n\nFigure 4.5 shows the cumulative EW distribution of a typical metal\nabsorption line (eg. either C IV or Mg II ) expected from a population\nof quasars at @xmath in our model. The dust parameters assumed for model\nabsorbers are an exponential scale radius @xmath kpc and central optical\ndepth @xmath @xmath . A comoving number density of @xmath is assumed,\nsimilar to that inferred for local galaxies. Fig. 4.5 a refers to no\nevolution in these parameters with @xmath , while Fig. 4.5 b assumes a\n\u2018moderate\u2019 evolution in both @xmath and @xmath . Each plot shows the\ntrue distribution expected in a complete sample unbiased with respect to\nobscuration by dust and that expected in an optical flux-limited QSO\nsample. The latter assumes a QSO cumulative luminosity function slope\n@xmath .\n\nThe heavy solid lines represent the fraction of absorption lines with\nEWs @xmath missing from a flux-limited QSO sample relative to the \u2018true\u2019\nnumber expected in the absence of dust obscuration. As expected, the\nincompleteness in the number of absorption lines as a function of EW\nincreases towards the highest EWs. This can be explained by\nlines-of-sight passing close to an absorber\u2019s center where relatively\nmore dust is intercepted in its assumed exponential dust profile. Thus,\nif the dust distribution in QSO absorbers follows an exponential-type\nlaw, then current absorption line surveys are more likely to probe their\nouter regions (at @xmath kpc). The inclusion of moderate amounts of\nevolution in absorber properties (Fig. 4.5 b), only slightly reduces the\nincompleteness in absorber numbers.\n\nSince the dust properties assumed for model absorbers in Fig. 4.5 are at\nthe upper limits of existing observations, we conclude that current\nmetal absorption line surveys may have missed up to 40% of lines with\nEWs @xmath \u00c5. For comparison, Fall & Pei (1995) find that up to to 60%\nof damped Ly @xmath systems at redshifts @xmath may have been missed due\nto obscuration by associated dust. These latter systems however may\ncorrespond to a totally different class of absorber. If they are to be\ninterpreted as arising from the gaseous disks of galaxies, then they may\nalso probe the dustiest regions, where obscuration is more efficient.\n\n##### 4.4.2 Quasar Evolution and Statistics\n\nThere are numerous observations suggesting that the space density of\nbright quasars declines beyond @xmath (Sandage, 1972; Schmidt, Schneider\n& Gunn, 1988). This has been strongly confirmed from various luminosity\n","output":["A majority of quasar surveys have been based on criteria which assume strong\nblue continua or a UV-excess. Any amount of dust along the line-of-sight is\nexpected to drastically extinguish the optical\/UV flux leading to a selection\nbias. Radio surveys however should suffer no bias against extinction by dust.\nRecently, a large complete sample of radio-selected quasars has become\navailable (the `Parkes sample'). A majority of these sources exhibit\noptical--to--near-infrared continua that are exceedingly `red', very unlike\nthose of quasars selected optically. The purpose of this thesis, broadly\nspeaking, is to explore the problem of incompleteness in optical quasar surveys\ndue to obscuration by dust, and to interpret the relatively `red' continua\nobserved in the Parkes quasar sample. The first part of this thesis explores\nthe observational consequences of an intervening (foreground) cosmological dust\ncomponent, such as that located in galaxies and clusters. The second part\nexamines the continuum properties of Parkes-quasars in the framework of a\nnumber of absorption and emission mechanisms to assess the importance of\nextinction by dust. It is found that spectroscopic and photometric data for the\n``reddest'' quasars (with B-K>5) is best explained by the dust model, rather\nthan ``purely'' by an intrinsic emission property.","A majority of quasar surveys have been based on criteria which assume\nstrong blue continua or a UV-excess.

A\nmajority of these sources exhibit optical\u2013to\u2013near-infrared continua that\nare exceedingly \u2018red\u2019, very unlike those of quasars selected optically.\nThe purpose of this thesis, broadly speaking, is to explore the problem\nof incompleteness in optical quasar surveys due to obscuration by dust,\nand to interpret the relatively \u2018red\u2019 continua observed in the Parkes\nquasar sample.\n\nThe first part of this thesis explores the observational consequences of\nan intervening cosmological dust component. A preliminary study explores\nthe effects of different foreground dust distributions (on\ngalaxy-cluster scales to the visible extent of normal galaxies) on\nobscuration of background sources. Numerical simulations of\ndusty-galaxies randomly distributed along the line-of-sight with\nsimplified assumptions are then performed, and implications on optical\ncounts of quasars and absorption-line statistics are explored. This\nfoundation is extended by considering the effects of more complicated\nmodels of foreground obscuration where the dust content evolves with\nredshift. The Parkes sample is used to constrain evolutionary and\nphysical properties of dust in intervening systems. The contribution of\nline-of-sight galactic dust to the reddening observed in this sample is\nalso constrained.\n\nThe second part examines the continuum properties of Parkes quasars in\nthe framework of a number of absorption and emission mechanisms to\nassess the importance of extinction by dust. Three classes of theories\nare explored: \u2018intrinsically red\u2019 AGN emission models, dust extinction\nmodels, and host-galaxy light models. Simple models are developed and\ntested against the available data. Several new correlations between\nspectral properties are predicted and identified observationally. For\nthe dust model, we explore the effects of dust on soft X-rays and\ncompare our predictions with ROSAT data. Possible physical dust\nproperties are constrained. I then consider the possibility that a \u2018red\u2019\nstellar component from the host galaxies contributes to the observed\nreddening. This contribution is quantified using a novel spectral\nfitting technique. Finally, an observational study of near-infrared\npolarisation is presented to distinguish between two models for the\nreddening: the intrinsic \u2018synchrotron emission model\u2019, and the dust\nmodel. Combined with spectral and photometric data, these observations\nare used to constrain various emission and dust absorption models.\n"]}
