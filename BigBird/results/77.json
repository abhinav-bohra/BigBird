{"article": ["We are also excited to discuss Vector Group separating its businesses through the spin off of Douglas Elliman. \u2047 With me here today are Bryant Kirkland, CFO of Vector; Richard Lampen, Chief Operating Officer of Vector; Scott Durkin, President and CEO of Douglas Elliman Realty LLC; David Ballard, CTO of vector; and Nick Anson, President and COO of Liggett Vector Brands. \u2047 We also have Ron Bernstein, Senior Advisor to Liggett Vector Brands joining for the Q&A portion of the call. \u2047 We will then discuss the exciting news of our intention to spin-off Vector Group's real estate brokerage business, including Douglas Elliman and its cutting edge PropTech investments into an independent publicly traded company. \u2047 We also filed a Form 10 with the SEC. \u2047 Let me start with financial results. \u2047 At September 30, 2021 Vector Group's consolidated balance sheet remain strong. \u2047 We maintained significant liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of $524 million, including cash of $159 million at Douglas Elliman and $133 million at Liggett. \u2047 We also held investment securities and investment partnership interests with a fair market value of $214 million at September 30, 2021. \u2047 Now turning to Vector Group's consolidated results from operations for the three months ended September 30, 2021. \u2047 Vector Group's revenues were $652.6 million compared to $547.8 million in the 2020 period, the 104.8 million increase in revenues was a result of an increase of $125.7 million in the real estate segment, partially offset by a decline of $20.9 million in the tobacco segment. \u2047 Moving on to -- excuse me, net income attributed to Vector Group was $48.9 or $0.32 per diluted common share compared to $38.1 million or $0.25 per diluted common share in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $116.5 million compared to $103.3 million in the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted net income was $52.6 million by $0.34 per diluted share compared to $38.3 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the 2020 period. \u2047 Moving on to the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. \u2047 Vector Group's revenues were $1.93 billion compared to $1.45 billion in the 2020 period. \u2047 The $478 million increase in revenues was a result of an increase of $500.4 million in the real estate segment offset by a decline of $22.5 million in the tobacco segment. \u2047 Net income attributed vector Group was $174.2 million or $1.13 per diluted common share compared to $60.7 million or $0.39 per diluted common share in the 2020 period. \u2047 The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $355.1 million compared to $240 million in the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted net income was $194.3 million or $1.26 per diluted share compared to $106.9 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the 2020 period. \u2047 Moving on to the results for the last 12 months ended September 30, 2021. \u2047 Vector Group reported revenues of $2.48 billion, net income of $206.4 million and adjusted EBITDA of $44.8 million[Phonetic]. \u2047 Turning to our tobacco business financial results. \u2047 Liggett continued its strong 2021 performance during the third quarter, delivering an increase in both retail market share and operating income. \u2047 Eagle 20's continues to deliver significantly higher margins, while Pyramid delivers both substantial profit and market presence and we continue to be pleased with the performance of our price-fighting brand, Montego, as we expand its distribution into targeted geographies across the country. \u2047 Based on Management Science Associates retail data, the discount category increased approximately 80 basis points in the third quarter from a year ago, now comprising 26.5% of the total market as compared to 25.7% for the same period last year. \u2047 As the deep discount segment continues to offer attractive value proposition for the consumers, we expect down-trading trends will continue for the foreseeable future. \u2047 As such, we remain confident that our value focused brand portfolio and broad distribution position us well to meet these evolving market demands and drive profitable growth. \u2047 I will now turn to the combined tobacco financials for Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco. \u2047 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, revenues were $297.9 million and $895.9 million respectively, compared to $318.9 million and $918.4 million for the corresponding 2020 period. \u2047 Tobacco adjusted operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $91.8 million and $273.9 million compared to $91.6 million and $240.2 million for the corresponding periods a year ago. \u2047 Through the first three quarters of 2021, tobacco adjusted operating income exceeded our full year 2019 figures, which was a record at that point in time. \u2047 Liggett's third quarter earnings increase was primarily the result of higher gross profit margins associated with higher pricing and promotional spending efficiencies, offset by lower wholesale volumes and higher Master Settlement Agreement expense. \u2047 As discussed in last quarter's conference call, we anticipated pressure on our third quarter wholesale volumes following a significant inventory increase at the end of the second quarter and we estimate approximately half of our year-over-year third quarter wholesale shipment declines related to a reduction in wholesale inventories. \u2047 In addition, significant reductions made to our net MSA expense in the third quarter of last year because of unusually strong third quarter 2020 industry volumes put additional pressure on our year-over-year earnings comparison. \u2047 According to Management Science Associates, overall industry wholesale shipments for the three months ended September 30, 2021 were down 11.8% compared to last year, while Liggett's wholesale shipments declined by 11.6% for the comparable period. \u2047 As we regularly note, however, we believe retail shipments are a much better indicator of underlying industry trends due to varying wholesaler buying patterns. \u2047 Liggett's retail shipments for the three months ended September 30, 2021 declined 6.1% from the year ago period, while industry retail shipments decreased 7% during the same timeframe. \u2047 As a result, Liggett's third quarter retail share increased to 4.22% from 4.18% in the corresponding period last year. \u2047 Sequentially, Liggett's retail share increased by 13 basis points in the third quarter over the second quarter. \u2047 In summary, we remain pleased with the operational and financial performance of our tobacco business. \u2047 Finally, while we always subject to industry regulatory and general market risks, we remain confident that we have effective programs and infrastructure in place to keep our business operating efficiently and delivering both market share and profit growth from our value-based brand portfolio. \u2047 Before Howard addresses the spin-off transaction, turning to Douglas Elliman's financial performance for the three, nine and last 12 months ended September 30, 2021. \u2047 For the three months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $354.2 million in revenues compared to $208 million in revenues in the 2020 period. \u2047 Douglas Elliman reported net income of $25.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $27.8 million in the third quarter compared to $11.8 million and $14.1 million in the year ago period. \u2047 For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $1.02 billion in revenues compared to $506.5 million in revenues in the 2020 period. \u2047 Douglas Elliman reported net income of $82.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $89.5 million for the nine months 2021 period compared to a net loss of $62.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 million in the 2020 period. \u2047 The net loss in the 2020 period included pre-tax charges for non-cash impairments of $58.3 million and pre-tax restructuring charges up $3.3 million. \u2047 For the last 12 months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman reported $1.29 billion in revenues, $96.2 million of net income and $106.2 million in adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 In addition, Douglas Elliman reported closed sales of $47.7 billion in the last 12 months ended September 30, 2021. \u2047 Douglas Elliman's year-to-date results were driven by strong continued activity in all markets. \u2047 Both closed sales volume and revenues doubled from the comparable 2020 period. \u2047 We are particularly pleased with the continued strength of South Florida market as well as a rebound of the New York City market during the first nine months of 2021. \u2047 In addition, Douglas Elliman's gross margin or company dollar increased to $94.5 million in the third quarter 2021, up from $58.9 million in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, Douglas Elliman's gross margin or company dollar increased to $274.1 million or $154.8 million for the same period in 2020. \u2047 And as Douglas Elliman's revenues and gross margins significantly increased in 2021, we have discontinued certain expense reductions, which were implemented in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 These include reductions to activity-based items such as advertising and discretionary compensation. \u2047 This team has substantial real estate expertise and a proven track record of driving growth. \u2047 We are very excited about this team because we have combined a strong management team from Vector with decades of public company management experience and a strong industry team from Douglas Elliman, which brings decades of real estate experience. \u2047 Moving to Page 4, let's discuss our plan to separate Vector Group's real estate brokerage business and it's PropTech investments into an independent publicly traded company. \u2047 We are doing this because we believe Douglas Elliman as a separate company will leverage its comprehensive suite of real estate solutions, industry leading brand name PropTech Investment Arms, New Valley Ventures LLC, and talented team of finding technology, marketing and communication employees to unleash its growth potential. \u2047 We are doing this now, especially given current trends in the large and growing U.S. residential real estate industry at a time when the size of our business has reached a critical mass, positioning us well to succeed in the market as a stand-alone company. \u2047 And of course, it will also be able to access the capital markets and widen its potential investor base, as well as use it pure play stock for M&A purposes and provide incentive opportunities for its key talent. \u2047 We expect this transaction to create significant value for all of Douglas Elliman's key stakeholders: developer, clients, brokerage customers, employees, agents and stockholders. \u2047 Specifically, we believe our presence in the most important primary luxury market in United States, our opportunities for continued growth, our diverse revenue streams, as well as our distinctive approach to technology will furnish a higher earnings multiple. \u2047 Moving to Page 5, this is planned as a tax-free spin-off of Douglas Elliman to Vector Group stockholders. \u2047 Upon completion, the new company called Douglas Elliman Inc will be a separate publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, DOUG. \u2047 Douglas Elliman Inc will consist of the brokerage, New Valley Ventures LLC, DE property management, DE development and marketing, DE title, DE mortgage and portfolio as well. \u2047 The rationale for the spin-off is that Vector Group's two businesses tobacco and real estate operate in distinct markets and possess unique growth prospects and investment profiles. \u2047 As planned, Vector Group stockholders will receive one share of Spinco common stock for every two shares of Vector Group common stock held. \u2047 We also expect subject to Board approval that Spinco will initially pay $0.05 per share quarterly dividend to holders of Douglas Elliman common stock and if Vector were to continue its $0.20 per share quarterly dividend. \u2047 Doug's Board will consist of Dick Lampen and myself, as well as five seasoned public and private company executives who bring technology, legal and financial expertise: Ron Kramer, Wilson White, Lynn Mestel, Michael Liebowitz and Mark Zeitchick. \u2047 Now, let us turn to Page 6 for an overview of Elliman's business. \u2047 Founded in 1911, Douglas Elliman is one of the preeminent cutting edge residential brokerage companies in the United States. \u2047 Douglas Elliman is a leading real estate brand associated with luxury service and forward thinking that operates in premium markets, primarily those that are densely populated international finance and technology hubs, as well as many of the second and third home markets, which DEDM. \u2047 These markets offering housing inventory at premium price points. \u2047 With a brand name synonymous with luxury and its comprehensive suite of technology enabled real estate services and investments, focus element is well positioned to capitalize on the highly attractive dynamics in the U.S. residential real estate market. \u2047 As a stand-alone publicly traded company, Douglas Elliman will pursue profitable growth opportunities to create stockholder value through the expansion of its geographic footprint, adoption of cutting edge PropTech and investments in PropTech companies through New Valley Ventures continue to excel in its retention and recruitment of best-in-class talent, acquisitions Aqui-hires and operational efficiencies. \u2047 Douglas Elliman will also be able to directly and more efficiently access the capital markets and widen it's potential investor base. \u2047 Douglas Elliman has an attractive financial profile with a balance sheet strength of $200 million of net cash at significant operating leverage, currently Douglas Elliman has approximately 6,600 agents and for the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, it had gross transaction volume of $47.7 billion, revenue of $1.29 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $106.2 million. \u2047 Turning to page 7, Douglas Elliman is one of the largest residential brokerage companies in the New York metropolitan area, which includes New York City, Long Island, Westchester and the Hamptons and is sixth largest in the United States by sales value according to HousingWire. \u2047 Note, this is sixth among brokerage such as Realogy, Berkshire Hathaway and Compass, for example, all of which opposed to tens of thousands of agents compared to Elliman 6,600. \u2047 Since 2013 Douglas Elliman has expanded throughout Florida, California, Aspen and Snowmass, Colorado, Houston, Dallas and Austin, Texas and Massachusetts including Boston, Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. \u2047 The company can leverage Douglas Elliman's brand equity and earn credibility to expand its presence in new existing and adjoining markets and recruit best in class agents who recognize and trust the Douglas Elliman name, all contributing to increased market share. \u2047 An important point of differentiation for Elliman from Realogy and Compass is that the primary focus of our business is on the leading densely populated international finance and technology hubs, where housing inventory is at a premium price levels. \u2047 This"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q3 earnings per share of $0.32.  \u2047  q3 revenue rose 19 percent to $652.6 million.
