{"article": ["Then Tom Dineen, our Chief Financial Officer, will give an overview of the third quarter 2021 financial results, and then I will discuss our operations and the state of the market. \u2047 Copy of these documents may be obtained by contacting the company or the SEC or on the company website at ruger.com/corporate or, of course, the SEC website at sec.gov. \u2047 We do reference non-GAAP EBITDA. \u2047 Now Tom will discuss the company's third quarter 2021 results. \u2047 For the third quarter of 2021, net sales were $178.2 million and diluted earnings were $1.98 per share. \u2047 For the comparable prior year period, net sales were $145.7 million and diluted earnings were $1.39 per share. \u2047 For the first nine months of 2021, net sales were $562.7 million and diluted earnings were $6.64 per share. \u2047 For the corresponding period in 2020, net sales were $399.6 million and diluted earnings were $3.31 per share. \u2047 The substantial increase in profitability for the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020 was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and production, resulting in favorable leveraging of fixed costs including depreciation, engineering and other indirect labor expenses. \u2047 Compared to the second quarter of 2021, profitability declined principally due to three factors: First, all of our firearms facilities took a very well-deserved shutdown week in July, which reduced the number of workdays in the quarter to 59 compared to 64 workdays in Q2. \u2047 This decrease in production reduced sales and resulted in some unfavorable deleveraging of fixed costs. \u2047 Second, after a relatively quiet second quarter, COVID positive cases in our plants were then tripled in the third quarter. \u2047 This resulted in significant increases in lost production. \u2047 And third, following six quarters of exceptional demand, excess resales decreased from the second quarter, adversely impacting our overall profitability. \u2047 Our strong financial results yielded significant cash generation. \u2047 During the first nine months of 2021, we generated $117 million of cash from operations. \u2047 We reinvested $15.6 million of that back into the company in the form of capital expenditures. \u2047 We estimate that 2021 capital expenditures will be approximately $20 million, predominantly related to new product development. \u2047 Our ability to shift manufacturing equipment between cells and between facilities improves our overall utilization and allows for reduced capital investment. \u2047 Our balance sheet at October 2, 2021, remain strong. \u2047 Our cash and short-term investments, which are invested in U.S. T-bills totaled $192.7 million. \u2047 Our current ratio was 3.8:1, and we had no debt. \u2047 Our stockholders' equity was $338.1 million, which equates to a book value of $19.21 per share, of which $10.95 per share was cash and short-term investments. \u2047 In the first nine months of 2021, we returned $45.2 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends. \u2047 Our Board of Directors declared a $0.79 per share quarterly dividend for shareholders of record as of November 15, 2021, payable on November 30, 2021. \u2047 Upon receiving this $0.79 quarterly dividend, shareholders will have received $3.36 of dividends per share in 2021. \u2047 As a reminder, our quarterly dividend is approximately 40% of net income, and therefore, it varies quarter-to-quarter. \u2047 That's the financial update for the quarter. \u2047 Demand for our products has remained strong. \u2047 Despite a moderation of overall industry demand, as reflected in the last two quarters of adjusted NICS, we shipped all of the firearms that we built this quarter without the need to aggressively promote or discount any of our products. \u2047 We've just begun to replenish the distributor and retail inventories that were largely depleted over the past 18 months, putting us in a great position as we head into the fourth quarter, which has traditionally been a period of strong demand. \u2047 The estimated unit sell-through of the company's products from the independent distributors to retailers increased 9% in the first nine months of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. \u2047 For the same period, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, background checks, as adjusted by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, commonly referred to as NICS checks, decreased 11%. \u2047 The increase in the sell-through of the company's products compared favorably to the decrease in adjusted NICS background checks, and may be attributable to strong consumer demand for Ruger products, increased production in 2021 and the introduction of new products that have been met with strong demand. \u2047 New product development continues to drive results. \u2047 The MAX-9 pistol and the Ruger LCP MAX pistol, which were both launched in 2021 remain in strong demand. \u2047 In the first nine months of 2021, new product sales represented $116 million or 22% of firearm sales compared to $88 million or 24% of firearm sales in the first nine months of 2020. \u2047 As a reminder, we include only major products introduced in the past eight quarters in our new product sales metric. \u2047 Derivatives, product line extensions of mature product families and models introduced more than two years ago are not included. \u2047 We are hard at work on some exciting new product initiatives, including the return of Marlin lever action rifles, which we begin -- plan to begin shipping later in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Since March of 2020, our workforce has been strengthened by 370 folks, an increase of just over 20%, and our quarterly unit production has increased by more than 160,000 units or 45% during that period. \u2047 A 20% increase in personnel yielding a 45% increase in production. \u2047 That is a tremendous accomplishment by our operations teams at all of our manufacturing plants. \u2047 Despite the growth in production at the end of third quarter 2021, our finished goods inventories remained near historic lows and distributor inventories of Ruger products were 150,000 units lower than they were at the end of 2019, the last time inventories were at what we would consider normal or expected pre-COVID-19 levels. \u2047 As Tom mentioned earlier, after an unprecedented 16-month run of seemingly insatiable product demand and continual monthly production increases, we took a one week shutdown during the first week of July. \u2047 This is our first shutdown in two years, which gave our workforce a very well-deserved break and allowed us to perform some routine maintenance and reconfigure some of our manufacturing operations. \u2047 The shutdown reduced our third quarter production sales and earnings, but that was a small price to pay. \u2047 It was the right thing to do, and I'm glad we did it. \u2047 Our dedicated and hard-working folks deserved and needed a break. \u2047 And after the shutdown, we are better prepared as we head into what we expect will be a busy fourth quarter and 2022. \u2047 Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, we have remained proactive in maintaining the health and safety of our employees and mitigating its impact on our business. \u2047 We provide all hourly employees with additional paid time off and offer incentives to any employee who becomes vaccinated. \u2047 If practical, we allow employees to work remotely. \u2047 And we continue to follow robust cleaning, sanitizing and social distancing protocols to maintain a cleaner and safer workplace. \u2047 With the United States once again seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases in positivity rates, we remain vigilant and are proactively adjusting our plan accordingly to keep our associates healthy and safe and to minimize any disruption to our business. \u2047 Our financial strength, evidenced by our debt-free balance sheet provides financial security and flexibility as we manage through the challenges like COVID-19 and remain focused on our long-term goals and the creation of shareholder value. \u2047 In the third quarter, we added a 225,000 square foot facility in Mayodan, North Carolina, about 1.5 miles down the road from our original Mayodan building that we purchased in 2013. \u2047 This new facility doubles the size of our footprint in Mayodan and provide some room for expansion. \u2047 We moved our finished goods inventory, our ShopRuger operations and our customer service call center into the new facility. \u2047 This freed up some manufacturing space in our original building in addition to the overall -- excuse me, to the available space in the new facility. \u2047 Those are the highlights of the third quarter of 2021. \u2047 Operator, may we have the first question? \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 sales of $178.2 million.  \u2047  compname reports third
