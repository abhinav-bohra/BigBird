{"article": ["Before I turn to our business, let me say the escalation of the devastating crisis in Ukraine is top of mind. \u2047 The event caused great concern for everyone in that region, including our employees, partners and their families. \u2047 Our thoughts are with everyone who is being affected, and we certainly hope peace prevails soon. \u2047 Moving to our business. \u2047 I'm pleased to report a strong start to the fiscal year, led by a fantastic quarter at CooperVision and another solid quarter at CooperSurgical. \u2047 Within vision, our daily silicone hydrogel and myopia management portfolios continued posting strong results, leading to share gains around the world. \u2047 Within surgical, our fertility business posted great numbers and the integration of Generate Life Sciences is going really well with that business off to a fast start as part of Cooper. \u2047 We also recently announced the pending acquisition of Cook Medical's reproductive health business, which will be a great addition to our surgical franchise. \u2047 Regarding first quarter financial results, consolidated revenues were $787 million, with CooperVision at $561 million, up 11%, and CooperSurgical reaching a new all-time high of $226 million, up 30%. \u2047 Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.24. \u2047 Moving to the details and reporting all percentages on an organic basis. \u2047 Our CooperVision growth of 14% was strong and diversified. \u2047 We grew nicely in all product categories, spheres, torics and multifocals, and all three regions posted great results, with the Americas up 8%, EMEA up 17% and Asia Pac up 19%. \u2047 This resulted in nice share gains, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on the reopening of economies around the world as COVID subsides. \u2047 All of this is driven by our multifaceted commercial strategy that we began deploying years ago, which has proven to be extremely successful. \u2047 This includes a consistent cadence of launching new products and product extensions around the world, providing customers with market-leading flexibility through our customized solutions, executing on key account relationships and delivering fantastic customer service. \u2047 We're continuing these efforts while also enhancing our business through sales force expansions and targeted marketing and infrastructure investments. \u2047 Regarding products, our daily silicone hydrogel lenses, MyDay, and clariti, posted strong results, growing 25%. \u2047 Daily silicones continue to lead the market, and we offer the broadest portfolio of products to meet customers' needs. \u2047 This includes MyDay, our premium offering, which is available in a sphere, toric and, most recently, a multifocal. \u2047 And speaking of the multifocal, the launch is going incredibly well. \u2047 The feedback from eye care practitioners regarding use of our breakthrough binocular progressive fitting system that simplifies the fit process while providing optimal visual acuity at all levels has been fantastic. \u2047 And we're continuing to receive feedback from patients that MyDay provides the best multifocal they've ever worn for exceptional near, intermediate and distant vision. \u2047 This success is having a nice halo effect on our already successful MyDay torics and spheres, so we remain very optimistic about this brand. \u2047 The other brand in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio is clariti. \u2047 This lens is also available as a sphere, toric and multifocal and is sold as more of a mass market product. \u2047 We've seen nice growth with this brand, especially in our Asia Pac region, where we just posted an extremely strong quarter. \u2047 For our FRPs, we reported another solid quarter of 10% growth for Avaira and Biofinity, our silicone hydrogel two-week and monthly lenses. \u2047 This was led by improved product availability and our unique offerings such as Biofinity toric multifocal and Energys, the most innovative product in the monthly space. \u2047 To finish on products, we're continuing to see nice strength in torics and multifocals as we expand parameter ranges and increase availability around the world. \u2047 When you combine this with the success we're having in key accounts, it's resulting in nice share gains, and we expect that to continue. \u2047 Moving to myopia management. \u2047 We posted revenues of $20 million. \u2047 And within this, MiSight grew 172%. \u2047 This growth rate was an acceleration from Q4, which is impressive, given the general market challenges around new fits. \u2047 Overall, as a global leader in the myopia management space, our portfolio is the broadest in the industry, comprised of MiSight, the only FDA-approved myopia control product, a broad range of market-leading ortho-k lenses, and our innovative SightGlass Vision glasses. \u2047 For MiSight, we're continuing to make progress around the world, including in China, where we're preparing for a broader launch with our partner, Essilor. \u2047 Our team in China is strong, and our advisory board of key opinion leaders that are affiliated with hospitals representing over 50% of myopia management contact lens volume in China has us positioned for success in a market where childhood myopia rates are estimated to be over 80%, and we're reducing myopia as a priority for the government. \u2047 Lastly, on MiSight, our industry-leading seven-year clinical data has been getting a lot of exposure as it highlights that MiSight works for nearly all myopic children. \u2047 It cuts myopia progression by roughly 59% on average. \u2047 It works at any age a child starts treatment. \u2047 It works for as long as the child wears it. \u2047 And there's no rebound if treatment is stopped. \u2047 Moving to SightGlass myopia management glasses. \u2047 Following our co-launch in the Netherlands with Essilor in November, we started early launches in additional markets, including the U.K. and Canada. \u2047 Within Canada, we've launched the product under the MiSight name, which is an exciting step in combining our myopia management glasses and contact lenses under one brand name. \u2047 We've also accelerated activity in China and plan to launch the product later this fiscal year. \u2047 To conclude on myopia management, our momentum is strong, and we're still targeting roughly $100 million in sales for this fiscal year. \u2047 To wrap up on CooperVision, for calendar Q4, we estimate the global contact lens market grew 10%, with CooperVision growing 16%. \u2047 Within this, COVID-related challenges did negatively impact optometry offices around the world and combining this with heightened patient demand as myopia rates continue to rise is resulting in many eye care offices having full calendars of appointments. \u2047 This demand is great, but it's still impacting fit activities such as in the U.S. where new fits are still roughly 8% below pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Having said that, progress is being made, and we expect to continue seeing positive trends as COVID subsides and economies around the world reopen with people returning to the office and becoming more active in social settings. \u2047 Meanwhile, long-term macro growth trends remain intact with roughly one-third of the world being myopic today and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050. \u2047 For CooperVision, we have a robust product portfolio, ongoing product launches, a fast-growing myopia management business and our fit data remains strong. \u2047 So we remain very bullish on our business. \u2047 We're extremely busy integrating Generate, which we just closed in mid-December. \u2047 In the meantime, we had another strong quarter with organic growth of 9%. \u2047 Before getting into the details, let's cover Generate. \u2047 We recognized roughly $34 million of revenues in the quarter as this was a stub period with only roughly one and a half months of revenue. \u2047 Of this, $23 million was in stem cell storage and $11 million in fertility. \u2047 It's tough to get exact growth rates for a stub period, but growth for the business for the full equivalent fiscal quarter was 10%. \u2047 Moving to our fertility business. \u2047 We posted sales of $97 million, up a very healthy 27% when excluding Generate and the small acquisition of Embryo Options from last January. \u2047 Strength was seen on a global basis and throughout our product portfolio, including from consumables, capital equipment and genomics. \u2047 Within our office and surgical unit, we posted sales of $129 million, up 24% as reported, but down 3% when excluding Generate and other acquisitions. \u2047 This was due to the negative impact of COVID on sales of PARAGARD, as well as certain surgical products. \u2047 Having said that, we did see growth in many areas such as our laparoscopic surgery closure products, and our acquired businesses grew nicely, especially Fetal Pillow in our labor and delivery area, which grew 160%. \u2047 Based on current trends, we expect office and surgical sales to improve and show organic growth in Q2. \u2047 To wrap up on CooperSurgical, let me touch on some market information. \u2047 For fertility, we're largely back to pre-COVID levels. \u2047 are stronger, while others outside the U.S. are still dealing with COVID-related challenges. \u2047 But net-net, the market is in a good place. \u2047 This industry continues to grow nicely, and we estimate our addressable market is approaching $2 billion with 5% to 10% long-term annual growth. \u2047 It's estimated that one in eight couples has trouble getting pregnant due to a variety of factors such as increasing maternal age and that more than 100 million individuals worldwide suffer from infertility. \u2047 Given the improving access to treatments, increasing patient awareness, greater comfort discussing IVF and increasing global disposable income, we expect this industry to grow nicely for many years to come. \u2047 Within office and surgical, as mentioned earlier, we expect growth to return in Q2 as the market fundamentals are improving. \u2047 To summarize, this was a really strong start to our fiscal year. \u2047 CooperVision posted a great quarter, and we're well positioned to continue delivering success with the best team in the industry and the broadest product portfolio in the market. \u2047 Our fertility business is growing nicely and taking share, and the Generate business is integrating really well with some exciting potential as we incorporate stem cell storage into our labor and delivery product portfolio. \u2047 Most of my commentary will be on a non-GAAP basis. \u2047 First quarter consolidated revenues were $787 million, up 16% and up 13% organically. \u2047 Consolidated gross margin decreased year over year by 90 basis points to 66.9%, driven primarily by currency, but also lower sales of PARAGARD, partially offset by lower manufacturing costs at CooperVision. \u2047 Operating expenses grew 19% to 42.3% of revenues with the addition of Generate and higher investment activity. \u2047 Consolidated operating margins were 24.6%, down from 26.9% last year due to the negative impact of FX and higher investing. \u2047 In addition, we did see higher freight, secondary handling and distribution costs within cost of goods and opex and expect this to continue, although price increases are helping to offset the impact. \u2047 Interest expense was $6.6 million on higher average debt, partially offset by lower interest rates. \u2047 The effective tax rate was 13.3%, higher primarily due to the Generate acquisition. \u2047 Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.24 with roughly 49.9 million average shares outstanding. \u2047 FX negatively impacted us by $0.37 in the quarter, which was $0.02 worse than we forecasted at the time of our last earnings call. \u2047 Free cash flow was solid at $109 million, comprised of $166 million of operating cash flow, offset by $57 million of capex. \u2047 Net debt decreased by $1.6 billion to $3 billion, driven by the acquisition of Generate. \u2047 And our adjusted leverage ratio increased to 2.71 times. \u2047 During the quarter, we repurchased roughly 191,200 shares of the company's common stock for $78.5 million at an average purchase price of $410.41 per share, that's $410.41. \u2047 Roughly $256 million remains authorized for repurchase under our program. \u2047 We've updated our numbers to reflect our outperformance in Q1, the addition of Generate, new currency rates and the assumption of a 25-basis-point rate increase by the Fed next week. \u2047 Prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this would have meant the midpoint for earnings per share would have been roughly $14.35, but currency has moved significantly against us over the past week. \u2047 We're increasing prices to offset the negative impact, and hopefully, the currency moves are temporary, but we're taking a conservative approach and fully incorporating negative currency into our guidance, noting that the scope, degree and duration of the crisis on the global economy is an evolving risk. \u2047 With this, the new consolidated revenue range is $3.261 billion to $3.329 billion, up 6.5% to 8.5% organically. \u2047 Within this, CooperVision revenue guidance is $2.221 billion to $2.264 billion, up 7% to 9% organically. \u2047 CooperSurgical revenues are expected to be between $1.04 billion and $1.065 billion, up 35% to 38% as reported or 5% to 7% organically. \u2047 Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $13.70 to $14.20. \u2047 We estimate interest expense around $42 million, which assumes a 25-basis-point rate increase, remembering that $1 billion of our debt is fixed -- is at fixed rates. \u2047 We estimate the full year tax rate to be around 14%. \u2047 Regarding currency, on a year-over-year basis, the negative FX headwind is now roughly 3.5% to revenues and roughly 10% negative impact to EPS. \u2047 Note this guidance does not include our pending Cook Medical reproductive health acquisition as the transaction has not yet closed. \u2047 Regarding Cook, we announced this acquisition on February 7 for $875 million. \u2047 This is a really nice strategic fit as they manufacture and sell minimally invasive medical devices focused on their fertility and gynecology markets. \u2047 With this acquisition, we'll be improving our international fertility footprint, especially within the Asia Pac region and will be adding highly synergistic and respected labor and delivery medical devices. \u2047 From a financial perspective, this business had roughly $158 million in sales in calendar 2021, and we expect long-term growth in the range of 5% to 9%. \u2047 Additionally, we expect year one non-GAAP earnings per share accretion of roughly $0.60. \u2047 In summary, we're pleased with this quarter's performance and believe our momentum will continue, driven by strategic investments in both businesses that will support share gains and durable long-term revenue and earnings growth. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q1
