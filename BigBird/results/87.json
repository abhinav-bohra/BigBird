{"article": ["Joining me are our chief executive officer, Bob Steers; our president, Joe Harvey; and our chief financial officer, Matt Stadler. \u2047 Further, none of our statements constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities of any fund. \u2047 These non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with our GAAP results. \u2047 My remarks will focus on our as-adjusted results. \u2047 Yesterday, we reported record earnings of $1.24 per share compared with $0.76 in the prior year's quarter and $1.06 sequentially. \u2047 The fourth quarter of 2021 included cumulative adjustments to compensation and benefits and income taxes that lowered our compensation-to-revenue ratio and effective tax rate, respectively. \u2047 Revenue was a record $159.7 million for the quarter compared with $116.6 million in the prior year's quarter and $154.3 million sequentially. \u2047 The increase in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management and open-end funds and higher performance fees from certain institutional accounts when compared with the third quarter. \u2047 Our implied effective fee rate was 58.1 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with 57.5 basis points in the third quarter. \u2047 Excluding performance fees, our fourth quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57 basis points, and our third quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57.3 basis points. \u2047 Operating income was a record $82.6 million in the quarter compared with $49.4 million in the prior year's quarter and $70.4 million sequentially. \u2047 Our operating margin increased to a record 51.7% from 45.6% last quarter, primarily due to the cumulative adjustment mentioned a moment ago, which reduced compensation and benefits to reflect actual amounts to be paid. \u2047 Expenses decreased 8.1% when compared with the third quarter as lower compensation and benefits was partially offset by higher G&A. \u2047 The compensation-to-revenue ratio, which included the cumulative adjustment was 26.16% for the quarter. \u2047 For the year, the compensation-to-revenue ratio was 32.22%. \u2047 The increase in G&A was primarily due to higher travel and entertainment, increased hosted and sponsored conferences, and higher recruitment fees. \u2047 And the increase in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to higher average assets under management in U.S. open-end funds. \u2047 Our effective tax rate, which was 25.36% for the quarter, included a cumulative adjustment to bring the rate to 26.15% for the year. \u2047 The reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in a nondeductible portion of executive compensation on a higher than previously forecasted pre-tax base. \u2047 Our firm liquidity totaled $248.2 million at quarter-end, compared with $241 million last quarter. \u2047 Firm liquidity as of December 31 reflected the payment of a special cash dividend in December of $60.3 million or $1.25 per share. \u2047 Over the past 12 years, we have paid a total of $15.25 per share in special dividends, and we continue to be debt-free. \u2047 Assets under management totaled a record $106.6 billion at December 31, an increase of $9.4 billion or 10% from September 30. \u2047 The increase was due to net inflows of $1.8 billion and market appreciation of $9.1 billion, partially offset by distributions of $1.6 billion. \u2047 This marks the 10th consecutive quarter that we have recorded net inflows. \u2047 Bob Steers will be providing an update on our flows and institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates. \u2047 And now, I'd like to briefly discuss a few items as we begin the new year. \u2047 First, regarding our expected compensation-to-revenue ratio. \u2047 We intend to balance anticipated revenue growth from year-end assets under management that exceeded our full-year assets under management by about 13%. \u2047 With a disciplined approach toward adding human capital, in addition to the full-year impact from the new hires we made last year, we plan on making controlled investments in order to broaden our product offerings, expand our public and private distribution efforts, and most importantly, to maintain our industry-leading investment performance. \u2047 As a result, we expect that our compensation-to-revenue ratio will increase to 33.75% and from the 32.22% recorded in 2021. \u2047 Continuing with the theme of investing in our business, we expect G&A to increase 10% to 15% from the $47.2 million we recorded in 2021. \u2047 We intend to make incremental investments this year in technology, including the implementation of new systems that will add efficiencies and expand our capabilities, cloud migration, and upgrades to our infrastructure and security. \u2047 We will also make investments in global marketing, focused on hosting virtual and in-person conferences, as well as expanding our digital footprint. \u2047 And we expect that travel and entertainment costs will increase as global conditions begin to return to normal. \u2047 We expect that our effective tax rate will remain at 26.15% in 2022. \u2047 And finally, you will recall that a year ago, we noted that we were anticipating the redemption of $1 billion global real estate institutional account in 2021. \u2047 I am pleased to inform you that not only do we continue to manage this account, but the client has also added assets to it, and therefore, we no longer consider this account to be at risk. \u2047 Today, I will review our investment performance, and discuss the macro environment and its impacts on our asset classes. \u2047 Four weeks into January, the fourth quarter of last year seems far away, but it was very strong for equities. \u2047 2021 closed with momentum and expectations for post-pandemic economic recovery, earnings growth, stimulus, and appetite for risk-taking. \u2047 Our largest asset class, U.S. REITs, was the best performing sector in the S&P, returning over 16% in the quarter. \u2047 For the full year, our asset classes performed well, with U.S. REITs up 41%, global real estate up 26%, listed infrastructure up 15%, resource equities up 24%, and preferred is up nearly 3%. \u2047 With the new year, however, the market has finally focused on rising inflation, which, as we shared our views with you last year, will likely persist. \u2047 With the last reading at 7%, CPI is currently at the largest gap to the federal funds rate in our professional lifetimes. \u2047 Reversion of that gap will come by way of both monetary tightening, as well as from inflation normalizing at a lower rate. \u2047 We believe inflation could stabilize in the high 2% ZIP code or 100 basis points higher than the pre-pandemic trend line. \u2047 The interest rate and adjustment process will reshuffle the deck of winning and losing asset classes and sectors while exposing vulnerabilities from risk-seeking borrowers. \u2047 We believe that the U.S. economy will continue to enjoy above-trend growth, supported by a prolonged and oscillating recovery as the pandemic ebbs and flows. \u2047 Earnings sensitivity to inflation should be a key differentiator in performance to counteract the impending interest rate adjustment. \u2047 Looking at our performance scorecard. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, eight of nine core strategies outperformed or equaled their benchmarks. \u2047 For the last 12 months, nine of nine core strategies outperformed. \u2047 Measured by AUM, 99% of our portfolios are outperforming benchmarks on a one-year basis compared with 79% last quarter. \u2047 The improvement was attributable primarily to global real estate, which improved from 25% outperforming in the third quarter to 95% outperforming as of year-end. \u2047 For both three and five years, 100% of AUM are outperforming. \u2047 Credit goes to our investment leaders, John Cheigh, our CIO; and Chris Parliman, chief administrative officer, in guiding our teams to these outstanding results. \u2047 In light of the inflation situation, I'll kick off our asset class review by highlighting our multi-strategy real assets portfolio, the benchmark for which returned 21% in 2021. \u2047 This portfolio is designed to provide equity-like returns, inflation sensitivity, and diversification. \u2047 We outperformed the benchmark by 340 basis points for the year, which included outperformance in all five asset class sleeves, as well as asset allocation alpha by our portfolio manager, Vince Childers. \u2047 This portfolio is designed to perform best in environments of rising or unexpected inflation. \u2047 Commodities and resource equities provided the most inflation sensitivity while real estate is driven more by economic growth and infrastructure tends to be an all-weather performer. \u2047 Valuations of these listed real assets are as cheap as they've been to equities in 20 years. \u2047 Meantime, the beta to equities is just 0.6 times. \u2047 We recently published a white paper on this strategy and its constituent asset classes and is available on our website. \u2047 Our three core real estate strategies: U.S., global and international outperformed in both the quarter and year. \u2047 As mentioned, global real estate returned 26% with significant dispersion by region. \u2047 The U.S. returned 41%, Europe returned 9% and Asia returned 4%. \u2047 To address the inflation and interest rate question on prospective performance, earnings sensitivity and replacement cost dynamics should help listed real estate. \u2047 Globally, these companies' cash flows should accelerate to an average of 12% over the next few years compared with their long-term growth rate of 5%. \u2047 U.S. REIT returns have averaged 10.8% during periods of rising bond yields accompanied by rising growth, while in periods of rising yields with declining growth, returns have been flat. \u2047 Comparatively, private real estate unleveraged returns have averaged 10.7% in high-inflation environments versus 6.5% in low-inflation environments. \u2047 The asset class returned 15% in 2021, compared with 22% for global equities lagging for the second year. \u2047 We outperformed our benchmark for the quarter and year. \u2047 Sector dispersion was wide with over 40 percentage points best to worst. \u2047 While certain pandemic-challenged sectors, namely passenger rails, toll roads, and airports, restrained performance, the ongoing economic recovery should provide tailwinds for these sectors going forward. \u2047 Reflecting the income and stable cash flow growth profile of infrastructure, I'd characterize infrastructure generally as steady Eddie. \u2047 That is -- it provides solid returns in most market regimes, while not at the top of the charts nor at the bottom. \u2047 In part due to President Biden's now passed infrastructure spending legislation, we are seeing broadening allocations in institutional portfolios and increased flows in wealth. \u2047 Preferred securities portfolios had modest negative returns in the fourth quarter but performed well versus fixed income for the full year. \u2047 For the quarter and the year, we outperformed benchmarks in both our core and low-duration strategies. \u2047 This year, likely we'll test fixed-income performance generally based on our review for rising bond yields. \u2047 Our portfolios are positioned defensively against increases in interest rates with duration of 2.4 years in our low-duration strategy and 4.0 years in our core preferred strategy. \u2047 After high yield, preferreds offer the second-highest yields in fixed income and offer meaningful tax advantages for the taxable investor due to the high percentage of qualified dividend income that they produce. \u2047 In terms of our private real estate initiative, we have commenced our investment process and have closed on several property acquisitions for both our income strategy and our opportunistic or capital appreciation strategy. \u2047 This year, we will look to add a real estate investment strategist as part of our expansion of multi-strategy capabilities to help our teams and clients allocate between listed and private real estate and execute thematic and strategic research. \u2047 We look forward to sharing our progress on this initiative in the future. \u2047 In closing, we are very positive about the allocation trends we are seeing for our asset classes. \u2047 In the institutional channel, we see a greater need to allocate to real assets. \u2047 By example, in the private market, dry powder and private equity funds is at $390 billion for real estate and $300 billion for infrastructure. \u2047 Investors are becoming more comfortable with listed allocations to complement private, despite greater measured volatility. \u2047 Some investors want real assets with liquidity, particularly in the endowment and foundation and Healthcare segments where some plans liquidity has been challenged. \u2047 In our early stage pipeline, we have some sovereign wealth opportunities where the plan sponsors are making initial allocations to listed real estate and infrastructure. \u2047 We would expect those initial small allocations to grow meaningfully to make it worthwhile for those plan sponsors to research the asset classes and oversee additional managers. \u2047 In the wealth channel, we are seeing earlier-stage adoption of private real asset allocations. \u2047 As we've seen in other markets, this will help drive listed allocations over time. \u2047 We believe the inflation environment will help provide additional support for these trends. \u2047 Finally, manager consolidation and conversions from passive to active are trends also in our favor as our performance continues to be excellent. \u2047 2021 was a record-breaking year in myriad ways for Cohen & Steers. \u2047 It marked our 35th anniversary and 17 years as a public company. \u2047 For the quarter and year, we achieved a record number of records, driven by improving fundamentals, a rebounding economy, accompanied by the return of meaningful inflation. \u2047 And for the first time in over a decade, the prospect of sustained Fed tightening. \u2047 As Matt discussed, assets under management increased to a record $106 billion at year-end, driven by our 10th consecutive quarter of firmwide net inflows. \u2047 Both open-end fund and advisory channels ended the quarter with record assets under management. \u2047 For the full year, we also achieved record gross and net inflows. \u2047 Open-end fund and advisory gross sales increased 11% and 13% to $19.5 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. \u2047 Most notably, open-end fund net inflows rose 62% year over year to a record $8.8 billion, while the advisory channel also registered a record $1.9 billion of net inflows. \u2047 Firmwide organic growth was 12% for the year. \u2047 The seemingly sudden rise of inflation and the expectation from multiple rounds of Fed tightening have put into stark relief the importance and value of portfolio allocations to actively managed real asset strategies across client portfolios to enhance returns and provide diversification. \u2047 The wealth channel was by far our strongest business segment and achieved multiple milestones in the quarter. \u2047 Net inflows in that channel were a record $2.5 billion for a 22% organic growth rate and represented our 12th consecutive quarter of positive net flows. \u2047 Importantly, net flows in the quarter were not just strong but also diverse, with meaningful contributions from each of the wirehouse"], "gold_summary": ["cohen & steers inc - qtrly adjusted earnings per share $1.24.  \u2047  cohen & steers inc-  \u2047  ending aum of $106.6 billion for
