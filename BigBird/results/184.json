{"article": ["Actual results could differ materially from expected results. \u2047 Last night, we reported a loss of $1.24 in adjusted operating EPS, which included $474 million in COVID-19 impacts or $5.31 per share. \u2047 In the context of a quarter that saw pandemic related deaths reached their highest peak in some of our markets. \u2047 This was obviously a challenging quarter for us. \u2047 But if I take a step back, our core business performed well overall, and we consider this another solid quarter, further demonstrating the resilience of our global business platform and franchise. \u2047 Both our Asia Traditional and Financial Solutions businesses had excellent results. \u2047 U.S. Group and individual health performed well, and Australia was breakeven. \u2047 During the quarter, we completed a number of in-force transactions, deploying $100 million in capital, which will further add value to our underlying earnings engine. \u2047 The transaction pipeline remains very good with opportunities in all our regions. \u2047 Our approach to capital deployment during this crisis remained balanced and disciplined as we seek opportunities to deliver long-term value. \u2047 I'm also proud to announce that for the 10th consecutive year, RGA has been ranked #1 for business capabilities on a global basis by NMG in their 2020 global reinsurance report. \u2047 Leveraging our capabilities and being a trusted partner as well as a thought leader, has allowed us to deliver value to our clients throughout the past year. \u2047 A point of personal pride in this organization and a tribute to all our employees and our culture of client centricity. \u2047 Results in our U.S. Mortality business were significantly impacted by the certain COVID-19 claims seen in the first three months of the year. \u2047 Considering the elevated level of population depth, these results are not unexpected. \u2047 Our large claim experience was in line this quarter after being very favorable in the previous two quarters. \u2047 And our mortality performance over the past 12 months, after adjusting for COVID-19 claims, has been in line with our expectations. \u2047 Todd and Jonathan will provide additional information on COVID-19 impacts for all our businesses. \u2047 As we look forward, there is reason for optimism as increasing vaccination rates in the U.S., U.K. and Canada should reduce the level of COVID-19 deaths through the remainder of the year. \u2047 And other markets should follow, as vaccine availability continues to expand. \u2047 RGA's business fundamentals are strong, our business prospects are robust and we are taking appropriate actions to protect our business and position RGA for profitable growth. \u2047 As a final point, it is worth reflecting that through the end of the first quarter, RGA has incurred over $1.2 billion in COVID-19 claims since the pandemic began. \u2047 Our ability to absorb these claims is a testament to our financial strength, but it also serves as a reminder of the important purpose that our industry and RGA play in helping millions of families around the world who have been affected by this pandemic. \u2047 RGA reported a loss for the quarter of $115 million on a pre-tax adjusted operating basis. \u2047 Adjusted operating earnings per share was a loss of $1.24 per share, which includes COVID-19 impacts of $5.31 per share. \u2047 Our trailing 12-month adjusted operating ROE was 3.7%, which was reduced by COVID-19 impacts of 8.8%. \u2047 Reported premiums increased 3% in the quarter. \u2047 Growth was 5%, excluding the premium decline in Australia, reflecting our continued caution in that market. \u2047 The effective tax rate on pre-tax adjusted operating loss was 26.9% for the quarter, above the expected range of 23% to 24% due to the geographical mix of the earnings. \u2047 Beginning with the U.S., the U.S. and Latin America traditional segment reported a pre-tax, adjusted operating loss of $344 million in the quarter, including COVID-19 claim cost of $358 million. \u2047 Let me spend a minute providing a little bit more detail. \u2047 For individual mortality, approximately $340 million of claim costs are attributed to COVID-19. \u2047 The approach used to estimate COVID-19 claims is consistent with that used throughout 2020. \u2047 We also experienced some excess mortality claims in the quarter that is likely directly or indirectly related to COVID-19. \u2047 Which is not unexpected, given the excess mortality experience that has been observed in the general population throughout the pandemic. \u2047 It is important to note that our mortality experience over the past 12 months, excluding COVID-19, was in line with our expectations. \u2047 Our group and individual health business both performed better than our expectations in the quarter. \u2047 Variable investment income was strong in the quarter as the limited partnership investment performance was favorable. \u2047 Our asset-intensive business reported results modestly below the expected run rate due to some unfavorable policyholder experience. \u2047 U.S. Capital Solutions reported results that were in line with our expectations. \u2047 The traditional segment, first quarter results reflected COVID-19 claim cost of approximately $26 million. \u2047 Our Financial Solutions segment performed well in the first quarter, reflecting favorable longevity experience, which we attribute to COVID-19. \u2047 In the Europe, Middle East and Africa segment, our traditional business results reflected a meaningful level of COVID-19 claims in both the U.K. and South Africa. \u2047 We estimate the COVID-19 claim cost for the EMEA traditional segment in the quarter were $98 million. \u2047 EMEA's Financial Solutions business results -- reflect the negative effects of model updates and the longevity offset from COVID-19 was lower-than-expected as a result of longer reporting lags, but we expect that benefit to come through in future periods. \u2047 Turning to our Asia Pacific traditional business. \u2047 In the first quarter, Asia had favorable underwriting experience across most of the region. \u2047 While we did see some COVID-19-related impacts, they were modest and within our expectations. \u2047 Australia results were breakeven for the quarter. \u2047 While there remains some uncertainty in the Australian market, we are continuing to see progress and remain prudent in our approach to new business and focused on actions to improve results. \u2047 Our Asia Pacific Financial Solutions business continued to produce good results in the first quarter, benefiting from organic growth and favorable experience on existing treaties. \u2047 The Corporate and Other segment reported pre-tax adjusted operating income of $94 million. \u2047 Adjusting for that, the results were better-than-expected from our run rate and reflected lower overall expected expenses. \u2047 Going forward, there is the potential for additional volatility and variable investment income from the change in unrealized gains and losses on our equity method investments. \u2047 Moving on to investments. \u2047 The non spread portfolio yield for the quarter was 5.67%, reflecting strong variable investment income. \u2047 Excluding the previously mentioned accounting correction, the yield was 4.52%, as we had strong contribution this quarter from the limited partnership investments. \u2047 Our overall investment portfolio, average quality of A was maintained and credit impairments were negligible. \u2047 We continue to have ample liquidity as we continue to prudently manage capital during the remainder of the pandemic. \u2047 RGA's global platform, strong balance sheet and effective capital management strategy have been vital to RGA's success during this pandemic. \u2047 While we expect to have some additional COVID-19 claims in 2021, we feel confident about RGA's ability to produce attractive financial results in the future. \u2047 As Anna mentioned, Q1 COVID-19 general population deaths were at their highest levels in many countries, notably the U.S. and the U.K. \u2047 Our models continue to track well to actual results and our overall COVID-19 mortality claim costs, which only include claims that we believe will ultimately be reported with the COVID-19 cause of death, were within our expected range based on the level of general population deaths. \u2047 The U.S. continues to be the driver of our mortality claim costs, accounting for 74% of our global total. \u2047 This was approximately $17 million per 10,000 U.S. general population deaths at the lower end of our model estimates and very consistent with the prior quarter. \u2047 Both the U.K. and Canada had Q1 COVID-19 mortality claim costs in excess of our model ranges, which we are attributing primarily to short-term volatility. \u2047 The U.K. and Canada had a greater number of larger COVID-19 claims in the quarter relative to what we saw in 2020. \u2047 After considering this quarterly volatility, we are reiterating our previous rules of thumb for claim cost estimates in these markets as shown on slide 12. \u2047 All other markets combined, accounted for approximately 10% of our COVID-19 mortality claim costs in line with our expectations, with the majority of this coming from South Africa, consistent with the high level of general population death they experienced this quarter. \u2047 India accounted for less than 1% of our COVID-19 claim costs in the quarter. \u2047 Both countries have experienced a significant level of excess mortality beyond what is being reported in general population COVID-19 figures, much of which we believe is likely COVID-19. \u2047 Since the beginning of the pandemic, over the last 12 months, South Africa has accounted for approximately 5% of our COVID-19 mortality claim costs and India approximately 2%. \u2047 The majority of our Q1 longevity experience is based on reporting from Q4 2020 and the significant increase in U.K. general population mortality in Q1 of 2021 is not yet reflected in our results. \u2047 We do expect to see this impact over the next several quarters as reporting is received. \u2047 Going forward, the ultimate longevity offset to our global mortality claim costs may be lower than our 10% rule of thumb, given our concentration of this business in the U.K. and the success of their vaccination efforts to date. \u2047 The significant reduction in general population mortality rates as vaccination levels rise in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada is expected to reduce our COVID-19 mortality claim costs over the remainder of 2021. \u2047 At the same time, we continue to closely monitor the impact that the pandemic variants are having and countries that are at earlier stages of vaccine rollouts where higher mortality could persist for a longer period of time. \u2047 Let me hand it back to Todd. \u2047
