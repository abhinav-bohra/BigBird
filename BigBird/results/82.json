company's performance. \u2047 You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. \u2047 Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. \u2047 The power of Synchrony's model continued to show through in our third quarter financial results. \u2047 We continued to reach and serve more partners and customers. \u2047 New accounts grew 17% to 6.2 million and average active accounts increased 5% to 67.2 million during the period. \u2047 This is in large part attributable to the powerful combination of our data driven insights, our seamless customer experiences, and our industry-leading product suite, which resonates deeply with customers. \u2047 Synchrony's omnichannel capabilities enable our partners and customers to connect wherever and whenever they want to be met and the variety of financing options and value propositions we offer empowers them with choice. \u2047 As we continue to anticipate and deliver on the needs of our partners and customers, we drive more value and greater utilization. \u2047 This translated to an 11% increase in purchase volume per active account during the third quarter and 16% growth in total purchase volume compared to last year. \u2047 Of course, this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from government stimulus and industrywide forbearance actions, leading to a 2% increase in loans, including loans held for sale. \u2047 Net interest margin of 15.45% was 165 basis points higher than last year, primarily reflecting the reduction in excess liquidity. \u2047 Operating expenses were down 10% compared to last year and down 7% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned. \u2047 We remain on track to reduce about $210 million from our expense base by year-end even as we continue to invest in our business. \u2047 The efficiency ratio was 38.7% for the quarter largely flat with last year. \u2047 Credit continued to perform very well. \u2047 Net charge-offs were 2.18% for the third quarter, down 224 basis points from last year. \u2047 Net earnings were $1.1 billion or $2 per diluted share and included a $0.33 benefit from the reserve release related to the reclassification of the Gap portfolio to held for sale. \u2047 Turning to our balance sheet, deposits were down $3 billion or 5% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity. \u2047 Deposits represented 82% of our funding mix at quarter-end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of debt. \u2047 During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion in capital through share repurchases of $1.3 billion and $124 million in common stock dividends. \u2047 We also continue to reinvest in our business. \u2047 As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, our ability to remain nimble and adapt to the ever-changing consumer finance landscape has been driven by our continued investment in our product suite and our innovative digital capabilities. \u2047 In fact, if you think about the last decade alone, the introduction of digital wallets, point of sale financing and a greater variety of installment offerings just to name a few has demonstrated the importance of diversity, accessibility, and utility in both products and experience. \u2047 And so Synchrony has continuously evolved, adding new financing options, enhancing our technology platform and expanding our channels and distribution networks in order to reach and serve more partners and customers in sustainable ways that drive greater value for all. \u2047 In addition to launching new products and partner programs, we are remaining focused on innovative ways to get scale distribution of our product suite. \u2047 Last week, we announced our expanded strategic partnership with Fiserv through which small businesses will now be able to access Synchrony products and services and accept private label credit card payments via the Clover point of sale and business management platform from Fiserv. \u2047 This will enable accelerated growth for small businesses, empowering merchants to attract more customers and generate more revenue by offering our customers greater flexibility and choice in how they make purchases. \u2047 We will also explore additional opportunities to cross-sell Synchrony products to existing Clover merchants. \u2047 Importantly, this strategic partnership also deepens Synchrony's ecosystem and reinforces our growth strategy to expand and accelerate innovative product offerings through additional distribution channels. \u2047 It builds on our momentum to bring our products to merchants faster and leverages Synchrony's leadership in financing, analytics and services. \u2047 We're excited to utilize the point of sale innovations driven by Clover to continue to transform the way people purchase while helping merchants grow. \u2047 Furthermore, as we and our partners' endeavor to provide more comprehensive customer access to financial products and resources, we are excited to expand our partnership with PayPal. \u2047 As announced in late September, Synchrony will be launching PayPal savings, a new PayPal branded savings account. \u2047 This unique opportunity will allow us to expand the distribution of our savings product to a unique set of customers with features and functionality inside the PayPal app delivering an enhanced customer experience while also further diversifying our deposit base at an attractively low cost to acquire. \u2047 In addition to our ongoing efforts to expand both our product suite and distribution network, we also seek to enhance partner and customer engagement through customized value propositions and omnichannel capabilities. \u2047 We recently launched two industry-first retail health and wellness credit cards. \u2047 The myWalgreens Mastercard and myWalgreens private label credit card, which reward customers with savings on future health and wellness purchases. \u2047 MyWalgreens credit card holders can earn 10% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible Walgreens branded products and 5% Walgreens cash rewards on other eligible brands and pharmacy purchases. \u2047 myWalgreens Mastercard holders can also earn 3% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible grocery and health and wellness purchases everywhere else, including healthcare providers and 1% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible purchases anywhere Mastercard credit cards are accepted. \u2047 In a world where consumers are increasingly responsible for a greater proportion of their health-related costs, we believe these value propositions will drive considerable value while also providing greater financing flexibility for health-related needs and enhancing loyalty over time. \u2047 Furthermore, Synchrony's digital capabilities allow us to seamlessly engage with customers wherever they are. \u2047 We have deep digital integration across the Walgreens web, mobile, and native app channels with the ability for customers to apply and instantly buy through all of these channels. \u2047 We've launched frictionless customer experiences, leveraging technology capabilities like QR codes, quick screen[Phonetic], which is a real-time pre-screen of one[Phonetic], customer-initiated pre-qualification, a direct-to-device in-store application process, card servicing integrated seamlessly into the Walgreens app and API integration with the myWalgreens loyalty program. \u2047 And while it's still early, the initial data we're seeing indicates that both the value prop and dynamic customer experience we have achieved with Walgreens are resonating very well with card holders in driving spend both inside and outside of Walgreens in categories such as grocery, health and wellness. \u2047 By empowering our partners and customers with best-in-class wallet optionality and compelling outcomes, Synchrony is increasingly well positioned as the partner of choice. \u2047 With more than 65 million active accounts, Synchrony has market-leading reach and deep diverse lending insights that enable us to better anticipate the needs of customers and therefore which financing options will optimize utilization and drive lifetime value. \u2047 So whether it comes in the form of our dual, co-branded and private label credit cards, our various SetPay installment products or our Synchrony Mastercard, we deeply understand when, why and how customers seek financing solutions for their day-to-day purchases. \u2047 We're particularly excited about the opportunity we see for our Synchrony Mastercard, which allows us to tap into the $500 billion general purpose credit card market. \u2047 We are taking a measured approach to growth. \u2047 However, by leveraging our scale and underwriting expertise, we've been able to identify better performing customer segments, acquire more customers at lower CPAs, and fine tune our channel strategy over the last two years. \u2047 Today, Synchrony Mastercard offers a variety of value propositions, which we use in combination with our pricing strategy to expand our customer reach and optimize conversion and we have great digital utility through dApply and integration in Apple Wallet as well as our mobile app. \u2047 This allows customers to access their various bank products, their money market and high-yield savings accounts as well as their credit card balances and transaction data. \u2047 This value proposition and seamless digital experience resonates very well with our customer, leading to purchase volume growth of 36% versus the same period in 2019. \u2047 We're also seeing higher levels of engagement around the product and brand as spend per active account is up 40% versus 2019. \u2047 So we're very excited about our Synchrony Mastercard. \u2047 It's an important offering within our product suite strategy that we believe will enable us to capture a larger portion of customers top of wallet spend and which should[Phonetic] drive highly scalable growth and above average returns to our business over the long-term. \u2047 Synchrony's third quarter financial results reflected broad-based strength across our business, highlighted by a double-digit purchase volume increase and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our net interest margin, historically low losses and delinquencies, and continued cost discipline. \u2047 The combination of these results led to $1.1 billion in net earnings or $2 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 4.9% and a return on tangible common equity of 40.1%. \u2047 These results are a true testament to the power of Synchrony's unique business model, which builds on our deep domain expertise in consumer lending and leverages dynamic digital capabilities a little bit[Phonetic] through our comprehensive multi-product suite to reach and serve deep and diverse universe of partners and customers. \u2047 Looking at our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with purchase volume, which grew 16% compared to last year and 16% compared to 2019 excluding Walmart demonstrates clear broad-based strength in consumer demand. \u2047 This is also reflected in our purchase volume per account, which increased 11% compared to last year. \u2047 Dual card and co-branded cards accounted for 40% of the purchase volume in the third quarter and increased 29% from the prior year. \u2047 On a loan receivable basis, excluding the impact of the reclassification of the Gap portfolio to held for sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of the portfolio and increased 4% from the prior year. \u2047 Average active accounts increased 5% compared to last year and new accounts increased 17% totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the third quarter and over 17.5 million new accounts. \u2047 In late August, we reached an agreement for the sale of the Gap portfolio, which led to the reclassification of $3.5 billion of loan receivables to held for sale and therefore reduced our ending loan receivables balance. \u2047 Excluding the impact of the reclassification, loan receivables would have increased by 2% versus the prior year as the period's strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate. \u2047 Payment rate for the third quarter was approximately 200 basis points higher when compared to the last year. \u2047 Interest and fees on loans increased 2% compared to last year, reflecting similar growth in average loan receivables. \u2047 Net interest income was 6% higher than last year, primarily reflecting a decline in interest expense due to lower benchmark rates. \u2047 RSAs were $1.3 billion in the third quarter and 6.38% of average receivables. \u2047 The $367 million year-over-year increase primarily reflected the impact of the lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance including growth and improvement in net interest income. \u2047 To put this in context, remember that RSAs are designed to align interest between ourselves and each of our partners. \u2047 This means driving growth in attractive risk-adjusted returns enhancing program profitability. \u2047 This allows each partner to share the programs performance, so when profitability expands, our partners participate in that upside. \u2047 Now when you think about the combined $1.4 billion year-over-year improvement in net interest income, net losses and the reserve change, we shared $367 million of that through the RSA. \u2047 Focusing on our credit performance, provision for losses was $25 million. \u2047 Included in this quarter's provision was reserve release of $407 million which incorporated our continued strength in credit performance and we're optimistic macroeconomic environment and the impact of reclassifying our Gap portfolio loan receivables to held for sale. \u2047 This resulted in a reserve reduction of approximately $247 million. \u2047 Other income decreased $37 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter. \u2047 Other expense decreased $106 million compared to the prior year. \u2047 As you recall, last year we recognized an $89 million restructuring charge and we continue to see favorability from lower operational losses. \u2047 Moving to Slide 8 and our platform results. \u2047 We saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all five platforms, reflecting strong consumer demand. \u2047 Our Home & Auto, Diversified & Value, Digital, and Health & Wellness platforms each experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume. \u2047 The 10% year-over-year increase in Home & Auto was generally driven by strong retailer performance across almost all verticals while purchase volume in Diversified & Value increased 25% reflecting the continued return to in-person retail experiences. \u2047 In Digital, the 21% increase was due to broad-based growth across our partners coupled with growth in our new programs with Verizon and Venmo. \u2047 In Health & Wellness, the 10% growth in purchase volume primarily reflected consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing planned procedures. \u2047 Meanwhile, purchase volume grew a more modest 2% in lifestyle reflecting broad-based growth across the platform, but having a tough comparable to last year's strong growth in power sports. \u2047 Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected modest growth rates versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was largely offset by elevated payment rates. \u2047 The one exception being in our Diversified & Value platform which was impacted by store closures in 2020. \u2047 Average active account trends ranged on a platform basis up by as much as 10% in Diversified & Value and 7% in Digital while Home & Auto and Health & Wellness average active accounts were generally flat. \u2047 The active account growth in Diversified & Value largely reflected the return to in-store retail experiences. \u2047 Digital active accounts were up versus prior year due to greater engagement across our"], "gold_summary": ["third quarter 2021 net earnings of $1.1 billion, or $2.00 per diluted share.  \u2047  q3 net earnings included a $187 million
