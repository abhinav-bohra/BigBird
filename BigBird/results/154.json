{"article": ["In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. \u2047 As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. \u2047 We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. The call agenda is shown on Slide three. \u2047 Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. \u2047 The second quarter was an extremely productive one for us as we achieved milestones across the enterprise in origination, marketing, operations and engineering and construction, just to name a few. \u2047 Global LNG market fundamentals continue to be extremely constructive, and we have begun to see the return of long-term LNG contracts in support of the construction of new liquefaction capacity. \u2047 For the second quarter, we generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $1.023 billion and distributable cash flow of approximately $340 million on revenue of over $3 billion. \u2047 We generated a net loss of approximately $329 million, due primarily to the unrealized derivative accounting treatment required on our hedges and on our Integrated Production Marketing, or IPM transactions, which Zach will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. \u2047 For the third consecutive quarter, we're raising our full year 2021 financial guidance. \u2047 We now forecast 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 billion to $4.9 billion and distributable cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2.1 billion. \u2047 This increase in guidance is being driven by a number of factors. \u2047 First, the continued strengthening of the LNG market is yielding higher netbacks on open volumes. \u2047 For context, since our first quarter earnings call in May, spot margins for 2021 doubled. \u2047 And our portfolio optimization team has been able to capitalize on that with our open volumes. \u2047 In addition, we've been able to further unlock some additional production for the second half of the year, primarily through maintenance optimization, which has contributed to an upwardly revised production forecast. \u2047 And lastly, with Henry Hub moving higher over the past quarter, we made some additional lifting margin. \u2047 So our outlook for the balance of 2021 has improved again based on a very strong LNG market and our very strong operational performance. \u2047 The fundamentals present in the LNG market are as good or better than at any time since I've been at Cheniere. \u2047 Anatol will cover the market in more detail in a few minutes, but market dynamics on both the supply side and demand side continue to move in our favor and support our conviction in the long-term growth prospects for natural gas worldwide. \u2047 Just after the quarter ended, we signed our third IPM agreement in support of Corpus Christi Stage 3, this time, with Tourmaline, the largest natural gas producer in Canada. \u2047 This transaction progresses our commercialization efforts on a shovel-ready Stage three expansion project and helps validate our view of a constructive macro backdrop for long-term contracts. \u2047 In addition, it reinforces Cheniere's record of executing collaborative, innovative solutions to meet the needs of our customers. \u2047 We will continue to leverage our infrastructure platform and commercial advantages to further progress Stage three toward FID. \u2047 During the second quarter, we continue to have meaningful success under our midterm strategy, placing portfolio volumes into the market under various commercial agreements and increasing the percentage of our total volume that is contracted. \u2047 So far in 2021, we've entered into fixed fee sales agreements for portfolio volumes with multiple counterparties aggregating approximately 12 million tons of LNG volume between this year and 2032, in addition to the IPM deal with Tourmaline. \u2047 The success of this midterm strategy underscores the strength in the LNG market today and the strategic competitive advantage of our portfolio volumes. \u2047 We'll continue to place these flexible volumes in the market, tailoring solutions to meet the growing requirements of LNG customers worldwide. \u2047 On the production side, the record we set in the first quarter for LNG exports didn't stand very long as we broke that record in the second quarter with 139 cargoes of LNG exported from our two facilities. \u2047 Year-to-date, Asia is the top destination of Cheniere cargoes with approximately 45% of our cargoes exported having landed in Asia, followed by Europe with roughly 35%, and Latin America with about 20%. \u2047 South Korea and China are the top two countries importing our LNG so far this year, and those two alone account for over 1/4 of all cargo deliveries. \u2047 Our operations and maintenance teams at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi have done an exceptional job thus far in 2021, managing our operating plans to maximize asset availability and LNG production in our facilities, enabling us to increase our production forecast for the year, all while ramping Corpus Christi Train three to four rates and stable operations quickly and safely. \u2047 We look forward to the same performance with the addition of Sabine Pass Train six early next year. \u2047 Speaking of Train 6, a significant milestone was met last month with the introduction of fuel gas into the train, signaling the start of early commissioning activities. \u2047 At the site, 17 systems were turned over to the start-up team in June, another 12 in July. \u2047 With the project approximately 90% complete Bechtel continues to progress this project against an accelerated schedule. \u2047 Turn now to Slide six where we'll provide a brief review of Stage three and the Corpus Christi site overall as the Stage three project comes into focus with our recent commercial momentum and the constructive market we are in. \u2047 As a reminder, our Stage three project at Corpus Christi is fully permitted, and if fully constructed, would have over 10 million tons of LNG capacity per year. \u2047 Stage three enjoys brownfield project economics as it will utilize a significant amount of shared infrastructure constructed as part of trains one through three, which we believe make Stage three a very cost-competitive LNG capacity addition. \u2047 As for the path to FID, we have said this before, we will maintain our discipline to help ensure that the risk and return profile of Stage three is consistent with that of the first nine trains we've built. \u2047 To that end, our origination team is focused on commercializing additional capacity from the project, and we are working closely with Bechtel on finalizing the EPC contract. \u2047 We remain committed to our growth capital investment parameters which help ensure discipline in our capital investment decisions and the sanctioning of projects only when they meet the high standard we have set for all FIDs to date. \u2047 Our excitement around the potential investment opportunities at the Corpus Christi site doesn't end with Stage 3. \u2047 As you may recall, we have acquired approximately 500 acres adjacent to our existing site, which provides us with a platform for major future development potential. \u2047 Any future capacity developed at this site may be designed to leverage already in place to provide substantial cost advantages. \u2047 As you can see from the aerial view of the land position at Corpus Christi, the site possesses a substantial running room for growth well beyond Stage 3. \u2047 And we may develop additional infrastructure there over time, especially as Stage three moves closer to FID. \u2047 Turn now to Slide seven. \u2047 Last month, we were proud to publish our second annual corporate responsibility report entitled Built for the Challenge. \u2047 This report, the product of a deep cross-functional effort across the entire company, provides insight into key actions taken by Cheniere to ensure business resiliency in 2020 and beyond, and is the latest example of our transparency on ESG-related issues and how we are building sustainability into our business model. \u2047 Built for the Challenge is the latest milestone in our ESG journey, which has seen tremendous progress in 2021. \u2047 Highlights of achievements reached thus far through 2021 include the announcement of our cargo emission tags, the climate scenario analysis we published, our first carbon-neutral LNG cargo we announced last quarter, our participation in the first-ever study to measure methane emissions on an LNG carrier, and our collaboration with leading academic institutions and several of our upstream natural gas suppliers to implement QMRV or greenhouse gas emissions performance at natural gas production sites across several bases. \u2047 And finally, earlier today, we announced the publication of our peer-reviewed greenhouse gas life cycle assessment, or LCA, which utilizes greenhouse gas emissions data specific to our LNG supply and will be the foundational analytical tool to estimate greenhouse gas emissions to be included in our CE tags that we provide our customers. \u2047 The items highlighted on this slide are all steps on a continuous path, and we look forward to leading our industry forward in this area, helping to ensure the long-term sustainability of natural gas and helping all participants among the LNG value chain realized the full environmental benefits of our LNG. \u2047 Globally, the pace of recovery in LNG markets from the COVID-related lows has exceeded most expectations, especially when looking at demand growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 through the first quarter of '21. \u2047 This trend continued in the second quarter with not only meaningful growth over the same period in 2020, but also notably well above the five year range, supporting our constructive market views on '21 and subsequent years. \u2047 We continue to see a fundamentally tight market over the next several years breaking the trend for seasonal demand norms even with rebounding LNG supply. \u2047 As reflected by the historically high LNG prices in both Europe and Asia, markets remain tight through this past winter, with global LNG demand growing by 9% year-over-year in the second quarter, slightly surpassing the fourth quarter demand levels despite the second quarter historically being a shoulder period in the market. \u2047 Asia and Europe exited spring with sizable storage deficits as the cold winter in Asia and the colder-than-normal spring in Europe, intensified the interbasin competition for LNG supply. \u2047 Asia and Europe's robust demand caused spreads between the two regions to narrow, with European netbacks even surpassing those in Asia in order to attract imports amid insufficient LNG supply availability in Q2. \u2047 Global LNG production rebounded 8% year-over-year in Q2, primarily on U.S. volume growing 80% compared to last year when customers were exercising their cargo cancellation rights. \u2047 Through the first half of the year, U.S. LNG production is up 43% year-over-year approximately 35 million tons. \u2047 However, non-U.S. volumes have lagged more than expected during most of '21 so far and remain below 2020 levels in June. \u2047 These non-U.S. volumes were impacted by feed gas constraints in Trinidad, and maintenance and outages in North Africa and other LNG-producing regions. \u2047 Consequently, less LNG flowed to Europe year-over-year as it competed for cargoes with Asia and Latin America. \u2047 Overall, U.S. LNG flows to Asia increased over 10% in the first half of '21 to 48% of total U.S. exports compared to 38% in the first half of 2020. \u2047 Meanwhile, flows to Europe dropped over 15 percentage points from 51% to 34% year-over-year, coinciding with natural gas storage inventories again at multiyear lows. \u2047 In Europe, weather-driven demand supported the gas market well into the injection season. \u2047 High carbon prices and low wind generation in June further lifted European gas demand for power generation. \u2047 However, upstream maintenance across Northwest Europe, flat Russian gas pipeline flows and lower LNG imports, capital market tight and storage inventories at a significant deficit relative to historic norms. \u2047 LNG flows into Europe were 9% or roughly 2.1 million tons lower year-on-year in Q2 as a result of tight global LNG supply balances. \u2047 European inventories currently stand at record low levels, with a 16 BCM deficit to the five year average, which is equivalent to roughly 170 LNG cargoes. \u2047 These supply and demand dynamics were reflected in European gas prices during the second quarter, with Dutch TTF settlement averages increasing by over $6 an MMBtu to $7.82 in MMBtu and almost 350% increase year-over-year. \u2047 This average was higher than JKM as the basins competed for import volumes. \u2047 Similarly, in Asia, the continued call on LNG imports to satisfy growing natural gas demand was driven by an early start to the summer, a surge in economic recovery and industrial activity in China, along with heavy nuclear maintenance in Korea. \u2047 Jack mentioned a moment ago that Korea and China alone imported over 25% of all our LNG production year-to-date. \u2047 Asia imported 65 million tons of LNG in the second quarter, an increase of eight million tons or 14% year-on-year. \u2047 The JKT region contributed over 20% of that growth despite higher nuclear availability in Japan. \u2047 10 nuclear units have restarted in Japan as of July 21, the highest number of operating units since the Fukushima disaster over a decade ago. \u2047 Japan's nuclear availability was offset by lower nuclear output in Korea and Taiwan. \u2047 A particular note, Taiwan retired 25% of its nuclear fleet in the second quarter and has a stated goal to become nuclear-free by 2025. \u2047 So this should continue to support the LNG market in the region for years to come. \u2047 The majority of growth in Asian LNG demand, however, came from Mainland China. \u2047 Imports in China surged 22% to 20 million tons in the second quarter, making China the largest LNG importer on a global basis surpassing Japan. \u2047 LNG imports were supported by hotter-than-normal weather in South China, rising industrial gas demand, and increased power sector demand amid low hydro levels. \u2047 In addition to Asia and Europe, we saw a notable uptick in Latin American demand as Brazil's imports reached multiyear highs due to severe drought conditions and the resulting lack of hydropower. \u2047 Latin America's imports increased more than 70% year-on-year in the second quarter, with Cheniere-produced cargoes making up nearly 40% of total imports. \u2047 Flows into Latin America represented 17% of total U.S. exports, increasing over 5% from the comparable 2020 period. \u2047 Clearly, both near-term and long-term dynamics in the LNG market provide a highly constructive backdrop for us to execute on our short-, medium- and long-term LNG origination strategies. \u2047 With highly flexible portfolio volumes available today and cost-competitive brownfield incremental capacity that we are actively commercializing, we possess an ideal platform to meet the growing and evolving needs of LNG customers worldwide. \u2047 As natural gas solidifies its place as a foundational fuel in a global
