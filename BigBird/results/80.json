company's public filings and reports, which are available on the SEC's or the company's corporate website. \u2047 Now I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Colonias, Simpson's President and Chief Executive Officer. \u2047 I'll begin with a summary of our full-year 2020 results before turning to a discussion on our key fourth quarter performance drivers and initiatives. \u2047 Brian will then walk you through our financials and fiscal 2021 business outlook in greater detail. \u2047 I am extremely proud of our strong financial and operational performance in 2020 which we delivered in a highly challenging operating environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Our net sales improved 11.6% over 2019 to $1.28 billion, the highest in the company's history, driven by strong sales volume. \u2047 As a result, we generated record earnings of $4.27 per diluted share, up 43.3% over 2019. \u2047 These results would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of all our Simpson employees. \u2047 Their diligence including strict adherence to protocols to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 has enabled us to continue operating our business with minimal disruptions from the pandemic. \u2047 On behalf of the entire Simpson management team, we applaud them for their tremendous efforts. \u2047 The health, safety and well-being of all our employees remains our Number 1 priority and we will strive for continuous improvement to ensure Simpson remains a safe and rewarding place to work. \u2047 Our record 2020 results were further supported by our commitment to position Simpson for long-term sustainable and increasingly profitable growth. \u2047 In October of 2017, we unveiled a three-year 2020 plan with aggressive targets to maximize our operating efficiencies and drive long-term shareholder value. \u2047 Since then, we've made significant progress against our goal, some of which we updated in July of 2019 to reflect changes in the macroeconomic landscape. \u2047 While we elected to withdraw these financial targets in April 2020 due to the significant level of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we continued to execute based on the same underlying principles, focusing on operating efficiencies and cost savings to guide us through the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 At the same time, we did experience certain tailwinds in our business as a result of the COVID-19 related macroeconomic conditions, namely we had favorable steel prices, temporary reduction in travel and related operating expenses, and an increase in repair and remodel activity. \u2047 Due to the culmination of these factors, we were able to meet or exceed nearly all of our ambitious 2020 plan objectives. \u2047 We are very proud of these accomplishments and I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing those with you. \u2047 Our first 2020 plan objective was a continued focus on organic growth. \u2047 Our goal was to achieve a compounded annual growth rate in net sales of approximately 8% from 2016 to 2020. \u2047 As of the year end of 2020, we had well exceeded this target, achieving a compounded annual growth rate over 10% relative to our 2016 baseline. \u2047 Milestones that helped support this goal included price increase for the majority of our US wood connector products in the third quarter of 2018, the signing of one of our largest US homebuilding companies onto our builder program resulting in 23 of the Top 25 US builders now engaged on our program, strong repair and remodel trends associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of Lowe's as the home center customer in mid-2020. \u2047 Our second objective involved rationalizing our cost structure to improve companywide profitability. \u2047 We aimed to reduce our total operating expense as a percent of net sales from 31.3% in 2016 to a range of 26% to 27% by the end of 2020. \u2047 We tackled this through a combination of zero based budgeting, lowering our indirect procurement costs and other cost reduction measures we took in both Europe and in our concrete business. \u2047 In addition, specifically in 2020, we experienced solid cost savings from our expense management practices as well as one-time benefits from the reduced travel and trade show costs as a result of the COVID-19 restriction. \u2047 These factors combined with strong topline growth enabled us to exceed our operating expense target. \u2047 For the full year of 2020, we recorded operating expenses as a percent of net sales of 25.6%, representing 570[Phonetic] basis points of improvement compared to 2016. \u2047 Our next plan was to improve our operating income margin to a range of 16% to 17% by the end of 2020. \u2047 We exceeded this target as our gross margin significantly benefit from lower material costs and limited spending on operating expenses due to the COVID-19 restrictions. \u2047 We reported an operating income margin of 19.9% for 2020, a 350 basis point improvement compared to 16.4% in 2016. \u2047 At the consolidated level, our gross margin improvement was supported by enhanced gross margins in our concrete business, another 2020 plan goal. \u2047 Following the unveiling of the 2020 plan, we implemented a new concrete strategy in late 2017 by narrowing our concentration to six distinct product categories. \u2047 By focusing on these higher margin products to increase profitability, we exceeded our goal of improving our global concrete gross margin from 34.7% in 2016 42% in 2020. \u2047 Our final profitability goal was to improve our operating income margin in Europe. \u2047 We've made substantial progress in Europe over the past few years, including rolling out our fastener lines in the Nordic region and in France, the consolidation of our European management team to create efficiencies as well as significant cost cutting initiatives. \u2047 As a result, we achieved an operating income margin of 7% excluding our SAP costs of approximately $2.5 million in 2020. \u2047 While this is lower than our original target range of 8% to 9%, we are pleased with the results, which reflect approximately 350 basis points of improvement versus the 2016 numbers. \u2047 Our third objective focused on improving our working capital management and overall balance sheet discipline. \u2047 Since the onset of the 2020 plan, we've made headway on this front, primarily through inventory reductions and the implementation of lean principles throughout our operation. \u2047 We've completed a three-phase SKU reduction program, eliminating upwards of 12,000 non-moving or slow-moving items and converted our customers over to replacement products. \u2047 In addition, we carried out rapid improvement events at many of our US production facilities, resulting in efficiency enhancements as well as improved management of inventory and purchasing practices. \u2047 As we move forward, we remain committed to driving continuous cost management and improved efficiencies through our lean initiatives. \u2047 However, consistent with our strategy, it is critical that we balance our inventory purchases with our liquidity needs in order to maintain our commitment to product availability standards and an exceptional customer service experience. \u2047 The final element of our 2020 plan was focused on maximizing shareholder value with the goal of improving our return on invested capital from 10.5% in 2016 to a range of 15% to 16% by the end of 2020. \u2047 Through our solid operational execution, combined with the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which lowered our effective income tax rate beginning in 2018, we surpassed this target, ending 2020 with the return on invested capital of 20%. \u2047 Beyond this, we continued to return capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. \u2047 In 2020, we returned $116.2 million to our stockholders through the payments of $40 million in dividends and $76.2 million in share repurchases. \u2047 Since the onset of the 2020 plan, we have returned over 83% of our cash generated by operations to our shareholders, far exceeding our target of 50% I'm extremely proud of all that we've accomplished in these past three years and by executing on the 2020 plan, we achieved solid organic growth, we've rationalized our cost structure to improve companywide profitability and we've improved our working capital management and balance sheet position, in turn creating value for all key Simpson stakeholders. \u2047 Now let's turn to a brief information on our fourth quarter results and operating initiatives. \u2047 Our fourth quarter consolidated net sales grew 12% year-over-year to $293.9 million on significantly higher volume. \u2047 Gross margin increased to 42.1% from 41.9% in the prior year quarter, primarily related to strength in Europe, where we experienced lower material and warehouse costs. \u2047 Our solid gross margin combined with effective expense management and reduced costs from travel and other restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 drove a 7.8% year-over-year increase in our income from operations to $39.5 million and earnings of $0.68 per diluted share. \u2047 The increase in sales volume we experienced in the fourth quarter was primarily related to ongoing momentum in the home center distribution channel, which includes both our home centers and co-op customers. \u2047 We are continuing to experience a shift in consumer behavior toward home renovations as a result of the pandemic. \u2047 Sales from home center distribution channels where we see much of our repair and remodel business improved over the prior year period. \u2047 Growth was supported by our product rollout of our connectors, mechanical anchors and fastener product solutions into all 1737 Lowe stores, which we completed during the fourth quarter. \u2047 As a reminder, Lowe's returned to Simpson as a home center customer beginning in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Our sales were further supported by solid US housing starts, as we generally experience a multiple month lag in the demand from the time of the start, in the fourth quarter, we benefited from strong third quarter 2020 housing starts which grew over 11% year-over-year. \u2047 In addition, while we typically see lower seasonal sales in the fourth quarter related to holiday closures and winter conditions, in 2020, the fourth quarter, we experienced a very mild winter. \u2047 This enabled construction activity to continue late into the year, further bolstering our net sales. \u2047 Turning now to Europe. \u2047 Sales continued to recover nicely following government-ordered shutdowns to our operations in the United Kingdom and France due to COVID-19 in late March. \u2047 Sales were assisted by strong demand trends and our ability to meet our customer needs through our solid inventory management practices. \u2047 We believe our sales benefited in Europe during the fourth quarter as many of our competitors experienced supply chain issues. \u2047 During this time, we were able to offer customers the important products they required to keep up with demand and to maintain job site on schedule. \u2047 I'd also like to note that while the United Kingdom has reimplemented shutdowns due to the most recent COVID-19 surge, we have been deemed an essential business and all of our major production and distribution facilities have remained open and operational with remote work being promoted where possible, such as in our corporate offices. \u2047 In regards to,[Indecipherable] implementation, the rollout continued to progress despite travel limitations related to COVID-19. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we completed the SAP rollout at our UK branch and Gallatin, Tennessee locations, both of which are now live. \u2047 Most recently, we successfully transitioned all of our Canadian-based sales organization over to SAP, thus completing the full SAP rollout in North America, a very important milestone. \u2047 This year we will continue working on the SAP transition in our European locations and the rest of the world and we currently anticipate a companywide completion in 2022 and we will continue to monitor and update our timeline should circumstances change. \u2047 Now I'd like to briefly touch on our capital allocation structure. \u2047 We are very grateful to be able to operate as a supplier to other essential businesses with only minimal disruptions due to the pandemic. \u2047 As our business continues to generate strong cash flow, we remain focused on appropriately balancing our growth and stockholder return priorities. \u2047 We are also very pleased to be in a position to pay off our line of credit borrowing in pool, as well as declare our quarterly dividend as we have done consistently since 2004. \u2047 While the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to impact our broader economy, exiting 2020 we feel confident in the bright future that we believe lies ahead for Simpson. \u2047 With another quarter of strong year-over-year growth in housing starts, which were up over 11% in the fourth quarter of 2020, we believe housing will continue to be a key element of the economic recovery in the coming years ahead and we are well positioned to capitalize on this environment. \u2047 At the same time, we continue to pursue our strategy of diversification, positioning our business to be less vulnerable to US housing market through key investments and adjacent products in markets and we also remain focused on growth, including M&A opportunities that would complement our existing product offering, manufacturing footprint or strengthening our software capabilities. \u2047 Our success in achieving the 2020 plan target has created a very strong foundation for Simpson, successfully positioning our company for long-term sustainable and increasingly profitable growth. \u2047 But now we are ready for our next chapter. \u2047 Today, I'm pleased to announce that on Tuesday, March 23, we plan to host a Virtual Analyst and Investor Day to provide more insight and details surrounding the elements of our business strategy in 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Additional information about this event will be released in the coming days. \u2047 I'm pleased to discuss our fourth quarter financial results with you today. \u2047 Now turning to our results. \u2047 As Karen highlighted, our consolidated net sales were strong, increasing 12% to $293.9 million. \u2047 Within North America segment, net sales increased 9.8% to $249.1 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in our home center distribution channel, which includes our home center and co-op customers. \u2047 Sales volumes were supported by the return of Lowe's along with increased repair and remodel activity. \u2047 Our net sales further benefited from other distribution channels, which experienced increased demand from new housing starts and repair and remodel activity. \u2047 In Europe, net sales increased 24.9% to $41.8 million primarily due to higher sales volumes in local currencies. \u2047 Wood construction products represented 85% of total sales compared to 83% and concrete construction products represented 15% of total sales compared to 17% last year. \u2047 Consolidated gross profit increased by 12.4% to $123.7 million, which resulted in a stronger Q4 gross margin of 42.1% compared to last year. \u2047 Gross margin increased by 20 basis points, primarily due to lower material and warehouse costs, which were partially offset by higher labor costs. \u2047 On a segment basis, our gross margin in North America declined to 43.2% compared to 43.9%, while in Europe, gross margin increased to 25.3% compared to 29.9%. \u2047 From a product perspective, our fourth quarter gross margin on wood products was 41.8% compared to 40.8% in the prior year quarter and was 39.6% for concrete products compared to 43.7% in the prior year quarter. \u2047 Now turning to our fourth quarter costs and operating"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q4 earnings per share $0.68.  \u2047
