{"article": ["During the call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. \u2047 A transcript of this conference call will also be posted on our website. \u2047 In what continues to be a challenging and volatile year, I remain impressed by the resilience of our employees across the world. \u2047 Their dedication and success in providing unparalleled service to our clients has been nothing short of remarkable and I'm extremely proud and grateful for all that they have done. \u2047 As cases begin to rise and impact the reentry process to various degrees across the world, we continued to monitor the situation carefully and strictly adhere to the guidance of local and global health authorities to help manage the spread of the virus. \u2047 The health and well-being of our people, clients and communities remain our first priority. \u2047 Turning to the market environment, global economic activity recovered some ground in the third quarter, despite the pandemic's continuing impact on both global and regional real estate fundamentals. \u2047 Improving economic indicators remain vulnerable to a potential resurgence of the virus as cases and hospitalizations rising in many countries around the world. \u2047 Near-term uncertainty continues to dampen forecast into the severity and longevity of the effects of the pandemic, as the world awaits the broad-based distribution of an effective vaccine before we can begin to regain some semblance of normality. \u2047 COVID-19 has accelerated many workplace trends that were prevalent in the commercial real estate industry prior to the Pandemic. \u2047 These include experiential workspaces, outsource real estate functions, and increased focus on employee wellbeing. \u2047 As a result of the changes the pandemic has had on how people work in suits and boards have increased their focus on real estate decisions to ensure their office spaces will suit their future needs. \u2047 Turning specifically to the global office leasing market, JLL Research reported that activity in the third quarter was down 46% from a year earlier, reflecting an improvement from Q2, but a continuation of subdued demand. \u2047 Asia-Pacific recorded a decrease in activity of only 5% relative to last year while EMEA and the United States were down 52% and 55% respectively. \u2047 Vacancy rates moved up across all regions in Q3, so the global vacancy right now recorded at 12.1%, reflecting a 90 basis point increase. \u2047 Declines in investment sales decelerated in the third quarter as global volumes down 44% compared to the same period last year. \u2047 Despite the headwinds associated with the pandemic, I'm pleased that our diversified and scaled platform generated solid results for the third quarter. \u2047 Overall third quarter results were at the upper end of our expectations due to -- in part to stable one-time items that are not expected to benefit future quarters to the same extent. \u2047 Consolidated revenue fell 12% to $4 billion and fee revenue declined 23% to $1.4 billion, in local currency. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA of $244 million represented a decline of 19% from the prior year although adjusted EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points to 17.4% in local currency, driven by cost mitigation initiatives as well as government relief program. \u2047 Adjusted net income totaled $156 million for the quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $2.99. \u2047 Corporate Solutions, again, demonstrated its ability to withstand challenging market conditions, posting a modest fee revenue decline of 2% for the quarter. \u2047 Strengths in Facility Management was slightly offset by declines in EMEA Mobile Engineering, which continues to face pandemic related headwinds. \u2047 Current pipelines for Corporate Solutions are stronger than last year, though the pandemic continues to create delays on real estate decisions affecting the closure rate. \u2047 As expected, our transaction-based service lines, capital markets and leasing recorded notable declines for the quarter as activity remains depressed due to the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. \u2047 Despite the overall declines, we're encouraged by our performance in some of the less impacted sub sectors such as industrial and logistics, which have shown significant resiliency throughout this year. \u2047 Furthermore, we have seen a strong rebuilding of our transactions pipeline since Q2. \u2047 These improving pipeline figures offer encouraging indicators for future performance though near-term uncertainty continues to linger. \u2047 Clients increasingly turn to JLL for our insights on operating the real estate and preparing for post-pandemic world. \u2047 Our conversations focus, first, on helping them evaluate their workplace challenge and objectives. \u2047 Then we develop long-term solutions that will enable successful transitions while preserving their ability to be agile, adaptable and resilient, as well as productive and profitable. \u2047 We've crafted the framework for reimagining the workplace to assist in this transition, which is focused on four strategic pillars; business, people, workplace, and commercial real estate. \u2047 Our consultancy expertise is in significant demand because JLL is uniquely capable of providing our clients advisory and execution services as a result of our global reach and full service platform. \u2047 Further investments in our technology platform have proven to be a strong differentiator when conveying our capabilities and dialog with our clients as the pandemic has accelerated technological disruption in the commercial real estate industry. \u2047 We continue to expand our collaborations across business lines to respond to clients' evolving needs. \u2047 For instance, we were able to expand an existing engagement with a major regional American bank to a five year mandate. \u2047 Multiple services in this assignment are facility management, transaction management and brokerage, project and development services, occupancy planning and the management and administration of all leases. \u2047 The bank identified several benefits of consolidating these services into JLL including our single provider technology platform, our shared services centers, the ability to consolidate services and the opportunity to provide a sustainable carrier roadmap for the internal staff transferring to JLL. \u2047 This is just one successful outcome of acting as one JLL. \u2047 It reflects our ability to deliver the full value of JLL across business lines in every client engagement. \u2047 In this quarter, we took further action as part of our disciplined cost mitigation program while simultaneously preserving our ability to maintain prudent investments across our business. \u2047 The actions taken better align our cost structure with current demand. \u2047 Karen will discuss this in more detail, but let me assure you that we are positioning the Company to drive strong growth and play a leading role in the recovery. \u2047 I'm confident that JLL will gain market share over the medium and longer term, as clients increasingly seek an advisor with global full-service capabilities but has the expertise and resources to help them reimagine their workplaces. \u2047 Strong earnings and cash flow management led to another standout quarter for cash generation, as evidenced by $320 million of net debt reduction, resulting in our leverage now below pre-HFF transaction level. \u2047 Our capital allocation policy is anchored in maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet and ample liquidity to support seasonality in economic cycles, organic and inorganic investments to drive growth and long-term value. \u2047 In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders. \u2047 In the third quarter, we repurchased $25 million worth of shares, bringing our year-to-date cash return to shareholders to $50 million. \u2047 This is slightly ahead of the amount returned in previous years via dividend. \u2047 For at least the foreseeable future, we do not expect to resume paying a dividend and instead will return cash to shareholders via share repurchases. \u2047 As we move through the fourth quarter and 2021, we will continue to evaluate business and market conditions to determine the appropriate mechanism to return value to shareholders in alignment with our long-term strategy. \u2047 Overall, I'm pleased with our third quarter performance, given the current environment. \u2047 There are three points I'll highlight to summarize the quarter. \u2047 First, while our consolidated year-over-year fee revenue percentage decline improved slightly from the second quarter on an organic basis, our top and bottom lines reflected meaningful growth in dollar terms over the second quarter. \u2047 This is an important trend in an unusual year when seasonal revenue growth is at risk of being disrupted. \u2047 Second we, again, generated strong cash flow which were used to repay debt to below pre-HFF acquisition levels. \u2047 Finally, we are taking actions to align our cost structure to the current environment, while continuing to invest in strategic priorities that we believe will drive long-term value. \u2047 Our diversified business continues to be impacted in different ways by the pandemic's economic shock. \u2047 The most significant impact continues to be on our transactional businesses. \u2047 While our pipelines in both leasing and capital markets has increased since the end of June, uncertainty remains regarding the evolution of the pandemic and its impact to decision making by corporate occupiers and investors. \u2047 Conversely, Property & Facility Management remains a growth area, driven largely by new business wins as corporate occupiers and investors seek our services due to increased building management standards. \u2047 Partially offsetting this top line growth were continued headwinds from our U.K. Mobile Engineering business and the late 2019 divestiture of our Continental Europe Property Management Business. \u2047 Moving now to a detailed review of operating performance. \u2047 Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 17.4%, driven by our ongoing cost management actions and a 240 basis point impact from various government relief programs globally, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. \u2047 Consolidated leasing fee revenue declined 30%. \u2047 Our investment in the higher growth asset classes of industrial, supply chain and logistics continue to provide partial offsets to the current softness in the office sector. \u2047 We compared favorably with the 46% decline in global office leasing activity, reflecting the strength of our platform. \u2047 Broadly, clients remain cost conscious and seek to delay significant decisions regarding future real estate strategies. \u2047 According to JLL Research, the U.S. office market has seen an increase in the share of lease activity from renewals to 55% in the third quarter from 29% in 2019, as well as a reduction in aggregate effective rents of roughly 7% in mid-March, through both an increase in free rent concessions and a decline in starting rents relative to pre-COVID. \u2047 Looking ahead, our fourth quarter U.S. gross leasing pipeline increased 16% from three months prior. \u2047 We are encouraged by these trends but emphasize closing rates and timing could be delayed in this environment. \u2047 Capital Markets' fee revenue declined 43%, driven by an over 50% decline in investment advisory and debt placement. \u2047 However, we did see stability in our multifamily business, again, reflecting the resiliency of our diversified platform. \u2047 Looking at the global capital market environment, markets of scale with access to domestic capital in Asia Pacific and Western Europe outperformed while the Americas continued to experience the most significant declines. \u2047 Global investment volume dropped 44%. \u2047 Activity has been curtailed as investors adjust valuations and pricing to reflect the current environment. \u2047 So we are seeing a tightening of the bid-ask spread in some markets. \u2047 The Industrial and U.S. multifamily sectors have been the most resilient to-date. \u2047 Our Capital Markets 2020 pipeline improved modestly across geographies as the quarter progressed, with pipeline at the end of the September up high single-digits, in percentage terms, from the end of June. \u2047 We are also encouraged by the recent reemergence of cross-border activities. \u2047 The longer-term trend of increased allocations to real estate is very much intact with significant capital on the side-lines ready to be deployed with highly liquid debt markets. \u2047 There was no change to our multifamily portfolio loan loss reserve and forbearance activity has been minimal to-date. \u2047 As Christian mentioned, our Corporate Solutions business was down 2% in the quarter and flat year-to-date. \u2047 We continue to be encouraged about the secular outsourcing trends. \u2047 Turning to our Real Estate Services segment, we experienced relatively consistent percentage declines in fee revenue across geographies, but meaningful differences in profitability. \u2047 In the Americas, strong fee revenue growth in Property & Facility Management was more than offset by material declines in other service lines. \u2047 We are encouraged by the moderation and the pace of decline in Americas Leasing and the reasonably stable rate of organic decline in Americas Capital Markets compared with the prior quarter. \u2047 Our ongoing cost mitigation actions and a 180 basis point benefit from government relief programs drove an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.9% compared with 19.3% a year earlier. \u2047 In EMEA, all service lines reported fee revenue declines, with the most significant decline in Capital Markets due to softness in the office sector. \u2047 EMEA leasing, while down 24% materially outperformed the approximate 50% decline in market volumes. \u2047 Including a 120 basis point benefit from government relief program, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 2.7% compared with 6.1% a year earlier. \u2047 The decline in profitability was driven primarily by lower transactional revenue, partially offset by ongoing cost saving actions. \u2047 Within our Asia-Pacific business, Property & Facility Management and Advisory & Consulting fee revenue were reasonably stable, but the transactional businesses were down meaningfully, particularly Capital Markets. \u2047 Our underperformance in Asia Pacific Capital Markets was largely concentrated in Japan and Greater China. \u2047 Including a 710 basis point net benefit from government relief programs, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2% compared with 14.2% a year earlier. \u2047 The relative stability and profitability excluding the government relief was primarily due to ongoing cost mitigation action. \u2047 Turning to LaSalle; fee revenue was down 2%. \u2047 Advisory fees, which are annuity like and comprised approximately 80% of LaSalle's fee revenue this quarter grew 4%. \u2047 Higher transaction fees tied to a Japanese REIT secondary offering mostly offset lower incentive fees. \u2047 We expect a similar level of incentive fees in the fourth quarter as the third quarter which would be considerably lower than the level earned in fourth quarter 2019. \u2047 Equity earnings were $8 million, driven mostly by our co-investment in a publicly traded REIT in Japan. \u2047 LaSalle's AUM totaled $66 billion at quarter end, sequentially up about $1 billion. \u2047 Now, I'll comment on how we are thinking about our cost structure. \u2047 Changes in client needs, particularly in our transactional businesses and continued uncertainty about the pace of recovery made it clear that we needed to accelerate certain cost management action. \u2047 Year-to-date through October, we have taken actions that will result in over $135 million of annualized fixed cost savings. \u2047 Separately, our expense management focus delivered over $240 million of non-permanent savings over the first nine months of 2020, including about $180 million from cost mitigation actions and $67 million from government relief. \u2047 Roughly half of these non-permanent savings were realized in the third quarter. \u2047 These non-permanent savings represent cost likely to return in future periods as business volumes recover. \u2047 Our cost actions are part of an ongoing process to improve our operating efficiency. \u2047 We are confident these actions combined with process improvements and leveraging"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $2.99.  \u2047  jones
