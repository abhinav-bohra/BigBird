{"article": ["Additionally, during this conference call, you will hear management make references to what the estimated positive or negative impacts were as a result of COVID-19 during the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 You will also hear management make statements regarding intra-quarter business performance during the month of July. \u2047 Management is providing this commentary to provide the investment community with additional insights concerning trends, and these disclosures may not occur in subsequent quarters. \u2047 It's a pleasure to speak with you today. \u2047 I'd also like to take a moment to recognize the Teleflex employees around the world. \u2047 These past few months have been far from normal, and our employees continue to inspire me as they have stepped up in extraordinary ways to ensure that we are able to provide our products to the hospitals, clinicians and patients who need them most. \u2047 Now on to our Q2 results. \u2047 When you take into consideration the global escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are quite pleased with our second quarter performance as it significantly exceeded our internal expectations and reflected improvements in underlying monthly revenue trends for the product categories most impacted by the postponement of non-emergent procedures, most notably, Interventional Urology, Interventional Access and Surgical. \u2047 Q2 revenue was $567 million, which was down 12% as compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis. \u2047 The decline in revenue is due to the negative impact from COVID-19, which we estimate caused a net negative impact of approximately $130 million or approximately 20%. \u2047 If we were to normalize for the negative COVID impact, we estimate that we grew our underlying business by approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, or near the high end of our initially provided 2020 full year constant currency revenue growth rate range. \u2047 From an earnings per share perspective, like revenue, our adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 in the quarter also significantly exceeded our internal expectations. \u2047 This reflects the recovery we saw in monthly procedures as we moved through the quarter, coupled with prudent operating expense management. \u2047 Lastly, at the end of the second quarter, we also commenced our workforce reduction plan, which will allow us to capitalize on programs designed to drive further long-term profitability. \u2047 This latest effort is primarily focused on streamlining certain sales and marketing functions within EMEA as well as certain manufacturing operations within our OEM segment. \u2047 Turning to a more detailed review of our second quarter results. \u2047 As I mentioned, quarter two revenue declined 12% on a constant currency basis and 13.1% on an as-reported basis. \u2047 The decline in revenue was primarily due to COVID-19, which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately $144 million across several global product categories. \u2047 This was somewhat offset by approximately $14 million of additional revenue within our vascular access and other product categories, which experienced higher-than-expected demand as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 From a margin perspective, we generated adjusted gross and operating margins of 53.9% and 21.8%, respectively. \u2047 This translated into a year-over-year decline of 380 basis points on the gross margin line and 340 basis points on the operating margin line, as reduced sales volumes and unfavorable revenue mix impacted by COVID were major headwinds. \u2047 These headwinds were partially offset by our cost containment efforts as we continue to tighten our belts where we deem appropriate in the current environment, balanced with continued investment to sustain our long-term growth aspirations. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $1.93, down 27.4% year-over-year, but well ahead of our internal expectations as the business started to recover during the quarter. \u2047 And while I never like to see declines in year-over-year revenue and profitability, I am very pleased with our overall financial performance as it demonstrates the resiliency of the diversified global product portfolio we have built over the past few years. \u2047 Next, I thought it would be helpful to provide some context regarding how we saw COVID-19 impact our second quarter results. \u2047 During the second quarter, we estimate that COVID-19 was a headwind to revenue across Interventional Urology, Surgical, Interventional Access, Anesthesia and OEM. \u2047 Somewhat offsetting these headwinds were positive tailwinds within Vascular Access and other, as hospitals continued to have strong demand for those types of products. \u2047 Netting these two impacts, we estimate that COVID was a $130 million headwind or an approximate 20% detractor from our 2Q revenue growth. \u2047 Importantly, we were encouraged that after a difficult April, the key global business units impacted most negatively by COVID improved sequentially as we moved through May and June. \u2047 Specifically, Interventional Urology year-over-year revenue was down approximately 79% in April. \u2047 It was down approximately 30% in May and then down approximately 8% in June. \u2047 Turning to Interventional Access. \u2047 Year-over-year revenue declined approximately 30% in April, approximately 28% in May, and then it was down approximately 2% in June. \u2047 And finally, our Surgical business experienced year-over-year revenue declines of approximately 34% in April, 31% in May and then approximately 21% in June. \u2047 As we anticipated and stated on our last earnings conference calls, as various states and countries began to reopen, Interventional Urology led the recovery. \u2047 But we also saw improving trends within Interventional Access and Surgical as most hospitals have restarted non-emergent procedures in earnest. \u2047 And while our business our businesses have not yet to fully return to normal, we are encouraged by our trends into July, which largely reflect further improvement in the business. \u2047 That said, while we view the latest trends as encouraging signs of a continued global recovery, we remain cautious as select hospital capacity has come under pressure in certain geographies as COVID-19 cases have reemerged. \u2047 As a result of the uncertainty associated with the scope and duration of COVID-19, we made the decision not to reinstate our 2020 financial guidance at this time. \u2047 Let's now turn to the quarterly results. \u2047 I will begin with a review of our reportable segment revenue. \u2047 The Americas delivered revenues of $312.5 million in the second quarter, which represents a 16% decline. \u2047 Growth within the Americas was driven by Vascular Access and respiratory products, which both saw elevated demands driven by COVID. \u2047 However, this was more than offset by declines in other product categories. \u2047 We estimate that the Americas would have grown approximately 8% excluding an estimated 24% impact of COVID on the region. \u2047 Importantly, as we progressed throughout the second quarter, Interventional Urology saw sequential improvement from April to May and then from May into June with a positive momentum largely carried forward into July. \u2047 While we are encouraged by this recovery, we are cautious due to the recent outbreaks and reduced non-emergent procedure capacity in states, including Texas and Florida. \u2047 EMEA reported revenues of $131.6 million in the second quarter, representing an 8% decline. \u2047 Like the Americas, growth drivers included vascular and respiratory businesses, which benefited from elevated demand related to COVID-19. \u2047 However, like the Americas, growth in these product categories was outweighed by declines elsewhere. \u2047 Adjusting for COVID, we estimate approximately 1% underlying growth for the region. \u2047 Revenues totaled $67.1 million in the second quarter, which represents a decline of 7.8%. \u2047 However, we estimate that we would have had a positive constant currency revenue growth in the low double digits consistent with our long-term outlook for the region if not for the impact of COVID-19. \u2047 And lastly, our OEM business reported revenues of $55.8 million in the second quarter, or 70 basis points recurring on a constant currency basis. \u2047 As we anticipated, during the second quarter, our OEM business saw a lagged impact related to COVID relative to our other businesses. \u2047 Investors familiar with Teleflex will be aware that our OEM business supplies device companies with complex catheters and surgical sutures. \u2047 And the 2Q impact reflects reduced orders from these customers whose business is tied to non-emergent procedures. \u2047 Excluding the estimated COVID-19 impact, the business grew roughly 25%, which includes a 16% benefit from HPC. \u2047 As it relates to the acquisition of HPC, the integration efforts are well under way, and I am very pleased with how the business is performing under our leadership. \u2047 Let's now move to a discussion on our revenues by global product categories. \u2047 Consistent with my prior comments regarding our reportable segments, commentary on global product category growth will also be on a constant currency basis. \u2047 Starting with Vascular Access. \u2047 Due to the growth within both our central venous catheter and EZ-IO products, Q2 revenues increased 8.8% to $164.9 million. \u2047 We estimate that COVID-19 positively impacted the growth rates of our vascular products during the second quarter by approximately 5%. \u2047 Moving to Interventional Access. \u2047 Second quarter revenue was $82.6 million, which is lower than the prior year by 20.3%. \u2047 The decrease was largely due to the delay in the performance of certain non-emergent procedures because of COVID-19. \u2047 We estimate that underlying growth was in the mid-single digits, adjusting for an approximate 24% COVID-19 headwind. \u2047 Q2 revenues were $64.9 million, which is lower than the prior year by 23%. \u2047 The revenue decline was due to lower sales of laryngeal masks and regional anesthesia products. \u2047 We estimate that COVID had an approximate 22% negative impact in the quarter. \u2047 Revenue declined by 28.4% to $67.3 million, driven by lower sales of our ligation portfolio and instruments. \u2047 We estimate a significant 30% headwind from COVID during 2Q. \u2047 However, as we stated earlier, we have seen sequential improvements on a monthly basis since April lows. \u2047 Moving to Interventional Urology. \u2047 Q2 revenue decreased 40.9% to $40.1 million. \u2047 We estimate an approximate $58 million COVID-19-related headwind during 2Q. \u2047 Unfortunately, the cancellation of elective procedures impacted this product line more than any other in our portfolio. \u2047 That said, because the UroLift procedure is primarily performed in an outpatient lower acuity setting, we envisioned that UroLift will be one of the first types of procedures that would be performed once the United States began to reopen, and that's exactly what we have seen with sequential improvements from April to May, May to June and from June into July. \u2047 And finally, our other category, which consists of our respiratory and urology care products grew 5.4%, totaling $91.4 million. \u2047 In large part, we estimate the growth during the quarter was due to increased demand for certain humidification and breathing products resulting from COVID-19. \u2047 If we were to exclude the estimated benefit from COVID-19, we estimate that the other category would have been down slightly as compared to the prior year period. \u2047 That completes my comments on quarter two revenue performance. \u2047 Turning to some clinical and commercial updates. \u2047 Our body of clinical evidence for UroLift continues to expand during the second quarter with data from two studies presented at the AUA 2020 Virtual Science Event and data from another study published in the Canadian Journal of Urology. \u2047 The first study presented at the AUA 2020 Virtual Science Event in May was a meta-analysis of patients' sexual function following treatment with the UroLift System versus medical therapy, while the second study was an analysis comparing patient outcomes from the large Real World Retrospective study to those found in the L.I.F.T. \u2047 pivotal trial and the P.U.L.S.A.R. urinary retention trial. \u2047 The results from the first study compared sexual function outcomes of 849 sexually active men who received daily treatments with an alpha blocker, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, either alone or in combination and 190 men from combined clinical studies of the UroLift System at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. \u2047 Results from the analysis showed that patients treated with the UroLift System experienced significant improvement in ejaculatory function and erectile function at 12 and 24 months post treatment. \u2047 Patients also reported significant improvement in overall sexual satisfaction through 48 months post treatment. \u2047 In contrast, none of the medical therapies significantly improved patients' erectile or ejaculatory function at any time point and some therapy significantly reduced function. \u2047 Additionally, the UroLift System significantly outperformed all three medical therapies across all-time points at preserving patient ejaculatory function. \u2047 Only patients who received UroLift System reported significant improvement in overall satisfaction in sexual life. \u2047 The second study compared patient outcomes from the large Real World Retrospective study to those found in the L.I.F.T. \u2047 pivotal trial and P.U.L.S.A.R. urinary retention trial, which studied catheter-dependent BPH patients. \u2047 Results from analysis showed patients from all groups experienced similar absolute IPSS scores at all-time points following treatment with the UroLift System. \u2047 Analysis also revealed equivalent safety profiles among non-urinary retention and urinary retention patient groups from the Real World study when compared to corresponding groups in control studies. \u2047 Finally, the results indicated that the majority of retention patients became catheter independent at the end of the study. \u2047 Lastly, a study comparing patient experience of those treated with the UroLift System to those who received tissue ablation by a steam injection was published in the Canadian Journal of Urology. \u2047 The study compared 53 non-retention patients from two U.S. sites. \u2047 Early postoperative results showed positive differences for patients treated with the UroLift System compared to resume, including better sexual function outcomes, less interference in daily activities and higher patient satisfaction. \u2047 We continue to extend our body of clinical evidence which should help to get the fast followers on board with UroLift, which is quickly becoming the standard of care as the leading minimally invasive surgery to address a massive global market opportunity. \u2047 Turning to the next slide on key commercial updates. \u2047 We received FDA clearance for the UroLift advanced tissue control or ATC system. \u2047 This is an instrument that optimizes UroLift for the treatment of obstructive median lobe. \u2047 We plan to hold a market acceptance test for this product in late 2020. \u2047 And while we estimate that between only 5% and 10% of the market have an obstructive median lobe, this enhancement demonstrates our commitment to invest in R&D to expand our leadership position in BPH. \u2047 In addition, as we"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 adjusted earnings per share $1.93 from continuing
