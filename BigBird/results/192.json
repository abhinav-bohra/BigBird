{"article": ["Following comments from Michael and Sachin, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&A session. \u2047 Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to GAAP reported amounts. \u2047 I'm starting off with the key highlights for the quarter. \u2047 We delivered strong revenue and earnings growth as we saw further improvement in our underlying operating metrics. \u2047 Quarter 4 net revenues were up 28% and earnings per share up 46% versus a year ago on a non-GAAP currency-neutral basis. \u2047 On the same basis, Quarter 4 net revenues are 19% above pre-COVID levels in 2019. \u2047 So with that, let's take a look at the macroeconomic front. \u2047 The outlook remains positive despite the recent supply chain constraints, geopolitical uncertainties and inflationary pressures. \u2047 Although there has been a recent surge in COVID cases, there are signs that these may be peaking. \u2047 By each of these areas, merit monitoring, underlying spending trends remain strong as consumers, businesses and governments have become more adaptable to a changing environment. \u2047 In the U.S., economic growth remains solid with low unemployment and healthy consumer confidence. \u2047 According to our Quarter 4 SpendingPulse report, which is always based on all payment types including cash and check, guest retail sales ex auto, ex gas were up 6.4% versus a year ago and up 10.9% versus 2019. \u2047 In Europe, GDV growth has been strong, although recently impacted by mobility restrictions. \u2047 SpendingPulse shows that overall European retail sales in Quarter 4 were up 3.3% versus a year ago and up 1.3% versus 2019. \u2047 In Asia Pacific, vaccination rates continue to improve, and we expect the economic recovery to pick up pace as both government and businesses ramp up investment. \u2047 The travel recovery in Asia Pacific has lagged that of the rest of the world and has significant growth potential. \u2047 The growth in Latin America is expected to moderate a bit following the rebound in 2021. \u2047 As it relates to COVID specifically, there are early signs that the Omicron will be relatively short-lived. \u2047 The reality is that the tools we have to deal with the pandemic are more advanced than ever. \u2047 60% of the world's population is now at least partially vaccinated, effective therapeutics are becoming available, and governments are using more targeted measures to limit the spread. \u2047 More bodies have opened and have stayed open despite the recent variant. \u2047 Although we've always said the path forward will not be linear, there are signs we are moving toward the endemic phase of the disease. \u2047 Looking at Mastercard's spending trends, switch volume growth continued to improve quarter over quarter. \u2047 Both consumer credit and debit continued to grow well. \u2047 The recovery has continued with overall Quarter 4 cross-border levels now higher than those in 2019. \u2047 While Omicron has had some recent impact on cross-border travel, we continue to believe that cross-border travel will return to 2019 levels by the end of this year. \u2047 Cross-border card-not-present spending ex travel continued to hold up well in the quarter. \u2047 So overall, the spending trends are moving in the right direction with some near-term travel-related headwinds as a result of the variant. \u2047 Now turning to our business highlights. \u2047 As outlined at our investment community meeting in November, we remain focused on our growth, diversified build strategy and our three strategic priorities, which are expanding in payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. \u2047 Here's an update on how we're progressing against each of those priorities. \u2047 First, we're expanding in payments, a growing person to merchant payments, scaling across other payment flows and leaning into innovation in new payment technologies. \u2047 In aggregate, these targeted flows represent $115 trillion in opportunity. \u2047 First off, we're driving growth in person to merchant payments through new wins across the globe. \u2047 In the U.S., I'm excited to announce that we're partnering with Chase and Instacart, a leading online grocery platform in North America on a new Instacart Mastercard co-brand program. \u2047 This partnership marks an additional co-brand win with Chase, quickly following the recent launch of the Chase Aeroplan World Elite Mastercard. \u2047 In addition, with First Interstate Bank's planned acquisition of Great Western Bank, we will flip Great Western's consumer debit, credit and commercial portfolios to MasterCard. \u2047 And I'm happy to note that the consumer credit portfolio of Merix Bank, over 3 million customers will transition to Mastercard beginning in the second quarter. \u2047 Merix Bank plans to leverage several Mastercard solutions, including our fraud prevention, consulting, open banking and loyalty services. \u2047 Over in the Netherlands, we've renewed our partnership with Rabobank, which includes the migration of 8 million Maestro cards to debit Mastercard. \u2047 We signed an exclusive deal with Westpac in Australia for the new Banking-as-a-Service platform. \u2047 This platform will allow new players to leverage Westpac's banking capabilities. \u2047 Afterpay, the first partner on the platform will connect debit Mastercards to their money by Afterpay app. \u2047 And in the U.K., the Net West debit migration is progressing to plan as in the early stages of consumer rollout. \u2047 We're also expanding in payments by capturing new payment flows, including commercial, B2B accounts payable, bill pay and cross-border remittances. \u2047 For example, in the commerce space, we've expanded our relationship with Bank of America, where we'll be the lead brand for new commercial card issuance. \u2047 We've also renewed and expanded our relationship with WEX, including the chosen as their strategic partner, and adding open-loop functionality to their millions of closed-loop fleet cards. \u2047 For accounts payable, we continue to scale Mastercard tracks, WEX, BMO, BOK Financial,[Inaudible] will connect to the platform. \u2047 We also launched the launch -- we also announced the launch of Mastercard Track Instant Pay, which uses machine learning to analyze and initiate automatic virtual card payments, streamlining processes for buyers and improving cash flow for suppliers. \u2047 And we're driving new B2B acceptance through a global partnership with Boost Payment Solutions with an initial focus on expanding the use of commercial card in seven key markets. \u2047 We're addressing new payment flows in consumer bill payments as well. \u2047 We recently announced the acquisition of Argus to help deliver bill pay solutions and other real-time payment applications in Latin America. \u2047 Argus enables digital payments for the majority of households built in Mexico and its connections with banks, fintechs and digital wall providers across the region. \u2047 And finally, we continue to capture new flows in cross-border remittances. \u2047 This quarter, we established a partnership with Travelex in Brazil, who will use Mastercard's cross-border services, send P2P transfers to the U.S. and Europe. \u2047 For domestic disbursements in the U.S., we partnered with fintech processor, TabaPay, to make Mastercard Send easily available to fintechs and merchants across multiple use cases. \u2047 We're also expanding in payments by leaning into payment innovation in areas like installments, contactless acceptance and crypto currencies. \u2047 Here are a few examples. \u2047 Our open-loop Mastercard installment program that we announced last quarter has been very well received. \u2047 The U.S. launch is on schedule for Quarter 1. \u2047 We're actively bringing new partners into the program as we announced in the Middle East, Africa earlier this week, watch this space. \u2047 Now we're making great progress in expanding contactless acceptance by turning the world's billions of active smartphones into potential acceptance devices, enabling people to buy and sell whenever, wherever they want. \u2047 We now have 100 deployments of Tap on Phone in over 50 markets with leading partners globally. \u2047 Contactless penetration increased to one and two of our in-person switch transactions globally this quarter. \u2047 This is up from approximately one and three prior to the pandemic. \u2047 And with that, the potential for accelerated acceptance growth, financial inclusion and consumer convenience is substantial. \u2047 We're also bringing capabilities, experience and reach to help enable the crypto ecosystem. \u2047 Our new collaboration with Coinbase will allow consumers to use their Mastercard to purchase NFTs, try that myself. \u2047 Our work with consensus will make it easier for software developers to increase the scale, efficiency and speed of transactions on Ethereum and finishing blockchains. \u2047 And our CPC Sandbox Test Platform, which we launched in 2020, continues to gain traction. \u2047 We're helping central banks, financial institutions and fintechs simulate the issuance and distribution of CBDC along with the integration of CBDDs with our card network, our real-time payment modules and native blockchain wallets. \u2047 Now shifting to services. \u2047 Our services support can differentiate our core products and have played a critical role in having many of them I just mentioned. \u2047 The group services revenue at 25% in 2021 on a currency-neutral basis. \u2047 We will continue to extend our service capabilities to enhance the value of payments. \u2047 We even further accelerating our growth by expanding into new areas and new use cases, particularly through our data and services and cyber intelligence propositions, again, a few examples for you. \u2047 In December, we announced an agreement to acquire Dynamic Yield from McDonald's. \u2047 Dynamic Yield uses enhanced AI to deliver customized product recommendations, offers and content to consumers. \u2047 Their customer set includes over 400 global brands ranging from financial services companies like Synchrony to retailers like Lens End. \u2047 When combined with SessionM's loyalty platform and our Test & Learn experimentation software, we will be able to offer a unified consumer engagement and loyalty hub to our customers. \u2047 McDonald's is a great example of a company who's using all three of these platforms today with plans to further scale and integrate Dynamic Yield's capabilities globally. \u2047 In addition, our Ethoca platform continues to experience strong traction in preventing unnecessary chargebacks, a real pain point. \u2047 We added new customers in every region in 2021 for Ethoca. \u2047 Recently, we launched Ethoca Consumer Clarity, which gives consumers detailed information about purchases on their mobile banking app. \u2047 and several European markets, including OTP Bank, central Cooperative Bank and Paybox Bank. \u2047 Now beyond expanding in payments and extending in services, our third strategic priority area is embracing new networks. \u2047 Specifically, we are leveraging our expertise and payments to build out new networks for the current focus on open banking and digital identity. \u2047 On the open banking front, we have closed the acquisition of Aiia in November, which brings strong API connectivity to over 2,700 banks across Europe. \u2047 And combined with Finicity's North American connection, which covered more than 95% of deposit accounts in the U.S. market, Mastercard has an unparalleled footprint in the key open banking regions, upon which we are building solutions to solve a wide range of these cases. \u2047 One example is in the mortgage verification space, where Finicity has signed deals with several new partners, including loan people. \u2047 And in the digital identity space, we're helping our customers with fast, frictionless identity verification services. \u2047 Ethoca has performed strongly over the last quarter, expanding through strategic partnerships with companies such as ZIP and Equifax, as well as growing its global footprint with leading frack providers Tonga and Air Click in Asia Pacific. \u2047 Combined, open banking and digital identity extend our value before and after the payment transaction. \u2047 These are large, attractive and growing opportunities, and we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both. \u2047 So in summary, we delivered strong revenue and earnings growth this quarter. \u2047 The macroeconomic outlook remains positive with a few areas of the monitoring, and we're executing against our three strategic priorities: spanning and payments, extending our services and embracing new networks. \u2047 And all that with substantial progress on the product and deal front this quarter. \u2047 Now Sachin, over to you and the numbers. \u2047 So turning to Page 3, which shows our financial performance for the quarter on a currency-neutral basis, excluding special items and the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments. \u2047 Net revenue was up 28%, reflecting the continued execution of our strategy and the ongoing recovery in spending. \u2047 Acquisitions contributed 3 ppt to this growth. \u2047 Operating expenses increased 19%, including a 7 ppt increase from acquisitions. \u2047 Operating income was up 37%, which includes a 1 ppt decrease related to acquisitions. \u2047 Net income was up 44%, which includes no impact from acquisitions as the impact of acquisitions on operating income was offset by a onetime acquisition-related tax benefit. \u2047 EPS was up 46% year over year to $2.35, which includes a $0.04 contribution from share repurchases. \u2047 During the quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion worth of stock and an additional $528 million through January 24, 2022. \u2047 So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. \u2047 Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, increased by 23% year over year on a local-currency basis. \u2047 We are seeing continued strength in debit and credit. \u2047 U.S. GDV increased by 23% with debit growth of 15% and credit growth of 34%. \u2047 Outside of the U.S., volume increased 23%, with debit growth of 25% and credit growth of 20%. \u2047 To put this in perspective, as a percentage of 2019 levels, GDV is at 125%, up 4 points quarter over quarter with credit at 116%, up 5 points sequentially and debit at 134%, up 3 points sequentially. \u2047 Cross-border volume was up 53% globally for the quarter, with intra-Europe cross-border volumes up 45% and other cross-border volumes up 63%, reflecting continued improvement in travel-related cross-border as several borders opened during the fourth quarter. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, cross-border volume was 109% of 2019 levels, with intra-Europe at 122% and other cross-border volume at 98% of 2019 levels. \u2047 Turning to Page 5. \u2047 Switched transactions grew 27% year over year in Q4 and were at 132% of 2019 levels. \u2047 Card-present growth continued to improve while card-not-present growth rates remain strong. \u2047 Card-present growth was aided in part by increases in contactless penetration in several regions. \u2047 In addition, card growth was 9%. \u2047 Globally, there are 3 billion Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards issued. \u2047 The increase in net revenue of 28% was primarily driven by domestic and cross-border transaction and volume growth, as well as strong growth in services, partially offset by higher rebates and incentives. \u2047 As previously mentioned, acquisitions contributed approximately 3 ppt to net revenue growth. \u2047 Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items. \u2047 Domestic assessments were up 24%,"], "gold_summary": ["fourth quarter adjusted net income of $2.3 billion, and adjusted diluted earnings per share
