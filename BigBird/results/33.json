{"article": ["We will be referring to that slide deck throughout today's call. \u2047 I'm Kelly Boyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. \u2047 Joining me on the call today are Chris Rossi, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Damon Audia, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 These risk factors and uncertainties are detailed in Kennametal's SEC filings. \u2047 In addition, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures today. \u2047 Reconciliations to GAAP financial measures that we believe are most directly comparable can be found at the back of the slide deck and on our Form 8-K on our website. \u2047 For today's call, I'll start with some general comments on the year followed by an overview of the fourth quarter. \u2047 From there, Damon will review the quarterly financial results and our outlook in more detail. \u2047 Now turning to Slide 2. \u2047 In fiscal year '21, despite the obvious COVID-19 challenges, we continue to operate safely to serve customers and invest in our commercial and operational excellence initiatives, including simplification/modernization. \u2047 We ended the year on a particularly strong note, with positive momentum heading into fiscal year '22, enabled by continued market recovery and advancement of our strategic initiatives that are transforming the company. \u2047 The additional simplification/modernization savings in fiscal year '21 bought the total savings achieved from the program to $186 million, in line with the target range we announced in our December 2017 Investor Day, despite lower volumes than we envisioned at that time. \u2047 This is a notable achievement. \u2047 And while fiscal year '21 may have marked the end of investment in our simplification/modernization program, we will continue to drive benefits from this investment. \u2047 In fact, the structural cost savings for the program are already contributing to strong underlying operating leverage as volumes recover, which we saw in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal year '21 and expect to continue in fiscal year '22 and beyond. \u2047 In addition, our investment in modernized processes will drive future growth and share gain. \u2047 These investments enable higher levels of customer service and new product innovations, some recent examples of which include the HARVI I TE endmill, which was a 2021 Golden Edge Award winner for Best Product Innovation at the China International Machine Tool Trade Show and is helping us gain share in aerospace and general engineering. \u2047 And our new indexable milling platform, Mill 4-15, designed to improve customer productivity to gain share, especially in general engineering. \u2047 We also saw a major win in the electric vehicle space with our RIQ Reamer, which was selected over top competitors by a major electric vehicle manufacturer for motor casings. \u2047 We would not have been able to make this tool without our investments in additive manufacturing as part of modernization. \u2047 And finally, our fit-for-purpose products, which as a result, of modernization can now be produced at a price point and availability to win in a multibillion-dollar application space of metal cutting that we previously had not focused on. \u2047 We are making excellent progress in this space with growth of our fit-for-purpose product portfolio outpacing the broader general engineering and market growth. \u2047 We're also seeing success in renewable energy applications, such as the machining of components for wind turbines and our infrastructure business segment is successfully leveraging their simplification/modernization investments to improve global reach and expand into mining adjacencies. \u2047 So looking forward, we are excited and confident to deliver additional returns on our simplification/modernization investment as we leverage it for growth, share gain and improved profitability throughout the economic cycle. \u2047 Now let's review a summary of Q4 on Slide 3. \u2047 We saw underlying momentum picking up across all our end markets, and in the fourth quarter we posted 29% organic growth versus a decline of 33% in the prior year quarter. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, all regions and end markets posted positive growth, except aerospace. \u2047 It's worth noting, however, that on a sequential growth basis, Aerospace was one of the leading end markets. \u2047 Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 19.2%, driven mainly by increasing volume and associated absorption, incremental simplification/modernization benefits, partially offset by the reversal of temporary cost control actions taken in the prior year. \u2047 Free operating cash flow was $66 million for the quarter and $113 million for the full year. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $0.53 for the quarter. \u2047 Graph on the left shows the sales level on a rolling 4-quarter basis through the downturn relative to our sales during the Great Recession while the graph on the right shows the corresponding adjusted operating margin. \u2047 The margins at the trough were 600 basis points higher through this downturn, illustrating our substantially improved cost structure. \u2047 Also note that the current trend lines are showing an upswing in both revenue and margin. \u2047 And we believe that these trends will continue in fiscal year '22, supported by the strong operating leverage from our simplification/modernization investments as demonstrated on Slide 5. \u2047 You can see from the slide that on a sequential basis we increased operating income by 57% on a 6% increase in sales. \u2047 This strong operating leverage is also evident on a year-over-year basis and even more impressive when you consider the roughly $45 million of temporary cost actions we took in the prior year quarter. \u2047 I will begin on Slide 6 with a review of our Q4 operating results on both a reported and adjusted basis. \u2047 As Chris mentioned, demand trends improved significantly year-over-year and our results highlight the strong operating leverage we are now demonstrating from our continued focus on commercial and operational excellence. \u2047 For the quarter, sales of $516 million improved 36% year-over-year and 29% on an organic basis from the low of $379 million in the fourth quarter last year. \u2047 Foreign currency had a positive effect of 6% on sales and business days contributed another 1%. \u2047 Adjusted gross profit margin of 34.5% was up 680 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 Adjusted operating expenses increased year-over-year to $108 million, reflecting the reversal of temporary cost actions taken last year. \u2047 Nevertheless, we were able to hold our operating expenses at 20.9% of sales, close to our target of 20% this quarter. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 19.2%, up 150 basis points from the prior year quarter and adjusted operating margin of 12.8% was up 400 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 The 19.2% adjusted EBITDA margin is another validation point related to the successful execution of commercial and operational excellence. \u2047 The last time adjusted EBITDA margins were over 19% was in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2019, and that was based on quarterly sales of approximately $600 million or 15% higher than this quarter. \u2047 This is yet another data point of the structural cost improvements we have made in confirming our ability to achieve the 24% to 26% adjusted EBITDA margin target as sales reached the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion level. \u2047 The improved year-over-year performance was related to higher volumes and associated absorption, benefits from simplification/modernization and a slight positive from price and raw materials, partially offset by roughly $45 million of temporary cost actions taken last year and a modest mix headwind. \u2047 The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.3%, a more normalized level than the previous year due to higher pre-tax income as well as a reduced effect of GILTI on the effective tax rate this quarter. \u2047 The adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 23.6% as expected. \u2047 We reported GAAP earnings per share of $0.41 versus a loss per share of $0. \u2047 11 in the prior year period. \u2047 On an adjusted basis, earnings per share was $0.53 per share versus $0.15 in the prior year quarter. \u2047 The main drivers of our adjusted earnings per share performance are highlighted on the bridge on Slide 7. \u2047 The effect of operations this quarter amounted to positive $0.02 compared to negative $0.68 in the prior year quarter and negative $0.33 in the third quarter of this fiscal year. \u2047 The operations bucket turned positive for the first time since Q3 of fiscal year '19, reflecting improving volumes offset by approximately $0.26 related to the reversal of temporary cost actions in effect last year. \u2047 Simplification/modernization contributed an incremental $0.13 in the quarter, bringing the total FY '21 simplification/modernization savings to $0.68 or $85 million and $186 million for the total program. \u2047 The detailed full year results can be found in the appendix. \u2047 Slides 8 and 9 detail the favorable performance and continuing progress we have achieved on our initiatives in our segments this quarter. \u2047 Metal cutting sales increased 30% organically versus a 35% decline in the prior year period. \u2047 All regions posted year-over-year sales increases with the largest increase in EMEA at 37%, followed by the Americas at 30% and Asia Pacific at 23%. \u2047 The slightly lower sales growth in Asia Pacific reflects the earlier timing of the recovery in China last year as well as the ongoing challenges in India this quarter due to a surge in COVID-19 cases. \u2047 From an end market perspective, on a year-over-year basis, the increasing strength in demand is broad-based. \u2047 Transportation was the strongest end market with 50% growth, followed by general engineering, up 35%. \u2047 Energy was up 4% year-over-year despite slowing demand in China due to the reduced wind subsidies. \u2047 Although aerospace declined 7% year-over-year, it showed the strongest sequential improvement, up 10%. \u2047 In addition to aerospace, on a sequential basis, General Engineering also showed strong signs of improvement and energy was slightly positive. \u2047 Transportation declined 11% sequentially due to the temporary supply chain challenges, which force transportation customers to slow their metal cutting factories like engine plants to better align with their overall production. \u2047 Based on comments from our customers, we expect these challenges to persist into our fiscal first quarter and to start to improve sequentially thereafter. \u2047 However, the situation continues to be fluid and different customer by customer. \u2047 Adjusted operating margin improved 540 basis points to 11.7% compared to 6.3% in the prior year quarter. \u2047 The increase was primarily driven by volume and associated absorption, simplification/modernization benefits and price and raw material benefits, partially offset by temporary cost actions taken last year and a modest mix headwind. \u2047 Turning to Infrastructure on Slide 9. \u2047 Organic sales increased 28% year-over-year versus a 29% decline in the prior year period. \u2047 FX and business days contributed positively to sales in the amount of 5% and 1%, respectively. \u2047 Regionally, the largest increase year-over-year was in the Americas at 35%, then EMEA at 29% and Asia at 14%. \u2047 By end market, the results were primarily driven by general engineering and energy, up 42% and 41%, respectively. \u2047 Earthworks was up 12%. \u2047 The bright spots in Earthworks this quarter were in the Americas in agriculture and forestry and in EMEA construction. \u2047 Adjusted operating margin increased to 14.5% from 12.7% in the prior year quarter. \u2047 The improvement was driven by higher volumes and associated absorption, simplification/modernization benefits, a slight positive effect from price and raw materials, partially offset by temporary cost actions taken last year in mix. \u2047 Now turning to Slide 10 to review our balance sheet and free operating cash flow. \u2047 We continue to maintain a very strong liquidity position, healthy balance sheet and debt maturity profile. \u2047 At fiscal year-end, we had combined cash and revolver availability of approximately $850 million. \u2047 Primary working capital of $602 million was relatively flat year-over-year and down approximately $13 million sequentially. \u2047 On a percentage of sales basis, it decreased to 33.4% as our focus on working capital during the year continued to strengthen our free operating cash flow even as sales have increased. \u2047 Our primary working capital target remains 30%, which we expect to approach by the end of this fiscal year. \u2047 Our fourth quarter free operating cash flow was $66 million, a significant year-over-year increase, reflecting higher income due to volume and strong operating leverage. \u2047 This is similar on a full year basis with free operating cash flow of $113 million compared to negative $18 million last year. \u2047 Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $30 million, a decrease of approximately $8 million from the prior year, bringing the total net capital spend for the year to $123 million, in line with our expectations. \u2047 We also paid the dividend of $17 million in the quarter. \u2047 The full balance sheet can be found on Slide 18 in the appendix. \u2047 Starting with the first quarter, we expect sales to be in the range of $470 million to $490 million. \u2047 At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year growth of approximately 20% and approximately 7% sequential decline, which is stronger than our normal Q4 to Q1 pattern. \u2047 At the midpoint of the sales outlook, we have assumed there will be no significant sequential change in the supply chain challenges in transportation. \u2047 We expect these challenges to persist into our fiscal first quarter and to start to improve sequentially thereafter. \u2047 However, the situation continues to be fluid. \u2047 Also, we do not expect to see demand adversely affected from additional lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 Delta variant. \u2047 Lastly, we are planning for the typical EMEA first quarter extended vacation and summer shutdowns for our customers. \u2047 Assuming our current outlook, we expect adjusted operating income to be a minimum of $45 million and to improve by at least 300% year-over-year despite the $15 million in Q1 year-over-year headwinds related to temporary cost actions taken last year. \u2047 Also, we expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 28%, and depreciation and amortization will increase $3 million to $4 million year-over-year. \u2047 Lastly, we expect free operating cash flow to be slightly negative, which is typical in the first quarter. \u2047 Regarding the full year, visibility remains limited in the current environment. \u2047 But at this time, we would expect to exceed normal sequential growth patterns throughout the year. \u2047 Furthermore, we are confident that we will continue to achieve strong annual operating leverage in any growth scenario. \u2047 Keep in mind, this annual operating leverage is excluding approximately $25 million of year-over-year headwinds from temporary cost actions taken last year, of which approximately $15 million will return in Q1 and the remaining $10 million in Q2. \u2047 Also, it's important to note that leverage may vary quarter-to-quarter. \u2047 For"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.53.  \u2047  q4 earnings
