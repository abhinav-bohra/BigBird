Holdings posted another quarter of strong operating results, highlighted by year-over-year home sales revenue growth of 33%, homebuilding operating margin expansion of 370 basis points and net income growth of 96%. \u2047 Net new order growth for the quarter increased 73% as compared to last year on a sales pace of 6.1 homes per community per month. \u2047 These results underscore the excellent homebuilding fundamentals we are currently experiencing across our markets and demonstrate our ability to grow our operations while continuing to improve our profit margins. \u2047 Homes increasingly serve as offices, classrooms and places of entertainment for the family, and as a result, people have gravitated to a living environment then can be accommodated in this new reality. \u2047 While this trend has been a positive development for the overall housing market, it has been particularly beneficial to the new home market for several reasons. \u2047 First, there is a limited existing inventory for consumers to choose from. \u2047 According to the National Association of Realtors, total housing inventory at the end of September totaled 1.4 million units, which was down 19% from a year ago and represents less than a three-month supply of homes. \u2047 Second, a newly constructed home gives consumers the peace of mind that they will be living in a home that no one else has lived in, which is a real selling point for many families during these uncertain times. \u2047 Supplementing the demand we've experienced as the pandemic, is the demographic shift toward home buying that we believe will serve as the tailwind for industry moving forward. \u2047 Millennials are increasingly aging into their prime home buying years, while baby boomers and empty nesters are looking to downsize into homes that fit their new lifestyles. \u2047 MDC is well positioned to take advantage of these demographic shifts due to our strategic focus on opening communities with affordable products. \u2047 Homebuyers of all ages are looking for value when it comes to buying a home, and we have found ways to accommodate the desires through more efficient floor plans, while the combination of lower rates and pandemic-related buying has spurred demand across all product types, we believe the more affordable segments of the market will be the most resilient over time. \u2047 We have been fortunate in having a deep bench at MDC. \u2047 And to that end, I am pleased that Rebecca Givens has agreed to step into Michael's role as Senior Vice President and General Counsel. \u2047 On the operations side, David Viger has moved into the important role as Chief Operating Officer of our homebuilding operations. \u2047 Anthony Berris has been promoted to President of our Financial Service operations. \u2047 And Dawn Huth has taken on additional responsibilities as Senior Vice President of National Finance. \u2047 All of these individuals have proven themselves to be highly capable leaders during their time at MDC, and I look forward to them contributing to our continued success in the future. \u2047 Finally, I'd like to congratulate David Mandarich, who has been elected as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. \u2047 David has been associated with the Company since 1977, most recently as our President and Chief Operating Officer. \u2047 And he is widely regarded as one of the most skilled leaders within the homebuilding industry. \u2047 His move into the CEO role is a key step in the evolution of our Company. \u2047 And I look forward to continued collaboration with him on strategic directions of the Company. \u2047 David will be participating with me in our earning calls going forward. \u2047 We experienced strong topline growth for the quarter as home sale revenues increased by 33% year-over-year to $1 billion. \u2047 Homebuilding operating margin improved by 370 basis points from the prior year quarter, resulting in a 109% increase in pre-tax income from our homebuilding operations to $101.7 million. \u2047 In addition, our financial services pre-tax income increased $10.3 million, or 73%. \u2047 The increase was due to our mortgage business, which continued to benefit from a higher interest rate lock volume and increased capture rate and better net interest income on loans originated during the quarter. \u2047 As a result, net income increased 96% to $98.9 million, or $1.49 per diluted share for the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Our tax rate increased from 19.5% to 21.5% for the 2020 third quarter. \u2047 The increase in rate was primarily due to changes in the estimated amount of energy tax credits to be received during the respective quarters. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, we currently estimate a 25% tax rate, excluding any discrete items. \u2047 Homes delivered increased 25% year-over-year to 2,147, driven by an increase in the number of homes we had in backlog to start the quarter, and to a lesser extent, an increase in our backlog conversion rate. \u2047 The average selling price of homes delivered during the quarter increased 6% to about $466,000. \u2047 The increase was the result of price increases implemented across the majority of our communities over the past 12 months, as well as a shift in the mix of homes closed from Nevada to Southern California. \u2047 We are anticipating home deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2020 to reach between 2,400 and 2,600 units. \u2047 Backlog conversion for the fourth quarter will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2019 as a result of the considerable year-over-year increase in orders during the 2020 third quarter, many of which are unlikely to deliver this year. \u2047 We expect the average selling price for 2020 fourth quarter unit deliveries to again exceed $460,000. \u2047 Gross margin from home sales improved by 170 basis points year-over-year to 20.5%. \u2047 While we have seen an increase in certain building costs, most notably lumber, as a result of the pandemic and other factors, we have been successful to this point in recouping these increased costs through home price increases. \u2047 This has resulted in improved gross margins on both build-to-order and speculative home deliveries across each of our homebuilding segments. \u2047 Gross margin from home sales for the 2020 fourth quarter is expected to approach 21%, excluding impairments and warranty adjustments. \u2047 We continued to demonstrate solid operating leverage during the third quarter as our SG&A expense as a percentage of home sale revenues decreased 200 basis points year-over-year to 10.4%. \u2047 Our total dollar SG&A expense for the 2020 third quarter increased $10.9 million year-over-year, mostly due to variable commissions and marketing expenses that increased in line with our 33% increase in home sale revenues during the period. \u2047 Our general and administrative expense was down slightly when compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation that was largely offset by an increase in salaries and other compensation-related expenses. \u2047 Our overall headcount has increased by 5% year-over-year as we work to support the Company's strong growth trajectory. \u2047 For the fourth quarter of 2020, we may see our general and administrative expense increase to between $50 million and $55 million due to the 5% year-over-year increase in headcount I just mentioned, additional bonus accruals in line with strong operating results, and a potential charitable contribution to our Foundation. \u2047 As I previously mentioned, as a result of the continued expansion of our gross margin and our improved operating leverage, our homebuilding operating margin, defined as gross margin from home sales minus our SG&A rate, grew by 370 basis points year-over-year to 10.1%. \u2047 On the strength of this improvement, our last 12 months pre-tax return on equity increased 560 basis points year-over-year to 21.8%, which is our highest level in 15 years. \u2047 Let's look at our net new home order information for the quarter on Slide 9. \u2047 The dollar value of our net orders increased 89% year-over-year to $1.65 billion, and unit net orders increased by 73%, driven by a 70% increase in our monthly absorption rate to 6.1. \u2047 The average selling price of our net orders increased by 10% year-over-year, driven by price increases implemented over the past 12 months, as well as a shift in mix to California, which has our highest average price. \u2047 During the third quarter, our California markets had nearly as many net new orders as our Colorado markets. \u2047 I'd like to note that we ended the quarter with 194 active subdivisions, which is slightly higher than a year ago. \u2047 With the strong sales activity we've experienced during the third quarter, we have a number of subdivisions that are approaching closeout earlier than expected. \u2047 As a result, we anticipate roughly 185 active subdivisions at year-end. \u2047 Although this would be a decrease from the end of the third quarter, it would be unchanged from where we started the year. \u2047 On Slide 10, we provided further net new order detail by month since April. \u2047 You can see that sales activity ramped up significantly after the initial slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We saw order activity peak during the month of August, but September remained strong and well above the prior year, even after we increased prices in most of our subdivisions. \u2047 We also saw the rate of cancellations continue to decrease as the months progressed. \u2047 We expect some seasonality to kick in during the fourth quarter. \u2047 However, October has remained very strong relative to the prior year. \u2047 Based on the activity we've seen to date, we expect our October 2020 net orders to exceed our October 2019 orders by at least 50%. \u2047 As a result of our strong sales, we ended the quarter with an estimated sales value for our homes in backlog of $3.1 billion, which was up 47% year-over-year. \u2047 The average selling price of homes in backlog increased 4% due to price increases implemented over the past 12 months, decreased incentives, and a shift in mix to California. \u2047 These factors were slightly offset by a shift in mix to lower-priced communities consistent with our ongoing strategy of offering more affordable home plans. \u2047 I will now turn to land activity on Slide 12. \u2047 The number of lots we acquired this quarter increased 63% year-over-year, reflecting our confidence in market conditions and our focus on continuing to grow our business. \u2047 While the number of lots we approved earlier this year were down due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19, we approved over 3,800 lots for purchase during the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 In the end, in spite of immense volatility, the number of lots approved over the last 12 months has increased by 34% compared to the prior year period. \u2047 As a result, our total lot supply to end the quarter was 8% higher than at the same point in 2019, supporting our growth potential for future periods. \u2047 We expect to see strong lot approval and acquisition activity continue into the fourth quarter given the robust demand that we have seen in recent months and our conviction about growth prospects for housing in future years. \u2047 In summary, clearly, we are encouraged by the resilience the housing market has shown in the third quarter given the immense challenges our country has faced in 2020, and we believe that we have executed our operating strategy well in this volatile environment. \u2047 More importantly, we see an opportunity to sustain growth well into the future, supported by solid demographics and changing customer preferences. \u2047 Our current backlog, not only puts us in position for a strong end to 2020, but also provides us with the opportunity for significant year-over-year increases in home sale revenues and pre-tax income to start 2021. \u2047 With our strong balance sheet and current land pipeline, we are well positioned to grow community count significantly in 2021 and have a preliminary target of at least 10,000 home deliveries for the coming fiscal year. \u2047 We are mindful that there are many risks to achieving this target, especially with COVID-19 still impacting our daily lives. \u2047 These risks will be closely monitored as we work to grow our Company and the safety of our employees, subcontractors and customers will remain top priority. \u2047 Following our strong third quarter, our Board of Directors has declared a 21% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $0.33 to $0.40 per share. \u2047 This represents a 33% increase from the prior year and demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders for their continued support. \u2047 "],
