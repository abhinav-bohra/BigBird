{"article": ["I'm Susie Lisa, senior vice president of investor relations for CVS Health. \u2047 Today's call is being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year. \u2047 CVS Health has delivered another strong quarter and exceeded expectations. \u2047 For the third quarter in a row, we are raising adjusted earnings per share guidance. \u2047 Throughout 2021, we have made progress executing our strategy to deliver an integrated healthcare experience centered around the consumer. \u2047 We sustained strong revenue growth in each of our core businesses helped improve health outcomes and reduce costs by broadening access to quality care. \u2047 We help fight the pandemic and reach millions of consumers with convenient, accessible care in communities across America. \u2047 During the third quarter, we delivered revenue growth of 10%. \u2047 This double-digit growth was led by membership gains in both healthcare benefits and pharmacy services, as well as higher volume in retail. \u2047 We grew adjusted operating income by 12.5%. \u2047 We generated adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 and strong cash flow from operations of $5.5 billion. \u2047 Given these results and our outlook, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $7.90 to $8. \u2047 This higher guidance reflects the quarter's outperformance and continued positive momentum, which Shawn will discuss shortly. \u2047 Third quarter results again demonstrate that our customers value how we bring together our unique portfolio of assets our deep healthcare expertise and vast consumer touchpoints to meet health needs. \u2047 There is strong demand for our integrated solutions across the healthcare continuum, including health management programs for chronic conditions, mental health support, pharmacy services, and health and wellness products. \u2047 We added over 1.3 million new integrated pharmacy and medical members through the 2021 and 2022 selling season. \u2047 More customers are seeking complementary health services that work together, such as virtual care. \u2047 Earlier this year, CVS Health launched the first national Virtual Primary Care program. \u2047 This market-leading solution offers a national network of physicians virtually and access to convenient face-to-face care in our MinuteClinic locations when needed, often with 0 co-pay. \u2047 Our program has grown to 30 customer accounts with over 750,000 eligible members as of January 1, 2022. \u2047 This is an indication of our ability to scale nationally and bring innovative products to the marketplace. \u2047 Our customers recognize the importance of CVS Health Care Solutions and the ease of access we now provide in the community, the home, and virtually. \u2047 Our high customer retention rates and new business wins are a testament to the strength of our business model. \u2047 Healthcare benefits revenue increased 9.5% year over year. \u2047 Strength in government services helped drive an adjusted operating income increase of 2.4% versus prior year despite higher costs related to COVID-19, net of deferred care primarily within our commercial book. \u2047 We generated sequential membership growth across all three product lines in the quarter: commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid. \u2047 Our medical benefit ratio of 85.8% was above our expectations, driven by COVID-related costs, primarily driven by commercial. \u2047 Underlying non-COVID costs emerged in line with our expectations. \u2047 We believe aggregate medical costs will slightly exceed baseline levels for the full year. \u2047 We produced strong results in our Medicare business and grew membership both sequentially and year over year across all Medicare products. \u2047 This reflects our strong product portfolio, Stars performance, and reputation for service excellence. \u2047 Year to date, Medicare Advantage membership has grown 9.2%. \u2047 In 2022, we anticipate we will achieve double-digit growth in individual Medicare and generate strong momentum in dual eligibles. \u2047 Our strong performance in Stars continues, as you saw for 2022, with 87% of our members in Star plans rated four and higher, up from 83% in 2021. \u2047 In our commercial business, we expect moderate growth in 2022 for national accounts, driven by both increased sales, which are up approximately 50% year over year, and a 95% client retention rate. \u2047 As we mentioned earlier this year, we are reentering the individual exchanges in eight states as of January 2022. \u2047 Enrollment began on Monday, and we anticipate our co-branded CVS Aetna offering and benefit design focused on consumer choice will result in gains of at least 100,000 new members in 2022. \u2047 Turning to pharmacy services. \u2047 We delivered third quarter revenue growth of 9.3% and adjusted operating income growth of 9.5% year over year. \u2047 For the 2022 selling season, we achieved a 98% retention rate. \u2047 We drove $10.4 billion of growth new business, resulting in $8.9 billion of net new business wins, providing evidence of our market-leading trend management, transparency customer service, and integrated offerings. \u2047 We continue to be a leader in specialty pharmacy with programs that drive value in the marketplace provide substantive savings to customers and differentiate us as we pay our programs with digital assets. \u2047 We maintained a strong momentum this quarter with specialty revenue up 8.7% versus prior year. \u2047 Our service excellence and top-tier execution are key areas of differentiation. \u2047 Our retail segment continues to play a critical role as a local health destination for millions of Americans. \u2047 Retail outperformed both expectations and the industry in the third quarter. \u2047 We delivered 10% revenue growth and 22% adjusted operating income growth year over year. \u2047 Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased 8% year over year, largely driven by COVID-19 vaccine administration and core pharmacy services. \u2047 Our patient satisfaction scores remain high with approximately 90% satisfied with their experience in our CVS Health locations. \u2047 We continue to support millions of Americans for COVID-19 testing and vaccine administration. \u2047 We administered 11.6 million COVID-19 vaccines and 8.5 million COVID-19 tests in the quarter. \u2047 Since our program began, we have administered 43 million vaccines and approximately 38 million tests. \u2047 We also expanded our digital capabilities to provide universal access to CVS Health vaccination records to the millions of adults we have vaccinated. \u2047 This new capability has driven over 1 million visits per month to vaccination records on cvs.com. \u2047 This provides another opportunity for us to build deeper engagement with our customers while simplifying and connecting their health experience. \u2047 Front store sales momentum also continued with revenue growth of 13% versus prior year. \u2047 Front store sales were led by consumer demand for COVID-19 home testing kits, as well as cough and cold products, with year-over-year volume increases across most front store categories. \u2047 Our CVS Health retail presence consistently serves as a strong channel for capturing new lives. \u2047 In fact, this year, 12.5% of new COVID-19 testing customers chose to fill new prescriptions or receive a COVID-19 vaccination with CVS Health. \u2047 Finally, we anticipate a benefit from administering boosters and pediatric doses to eligible consumers will occur largely in the fourth quarter of this year. \u2047 We continue to make measurable progress with our strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and address the total cost of care. \u2047 We have focused on several important areas. \u2047 First, with our unique portfolio of businesses, we continue to expand our role in care delivery designed around the customer. \u2047 We are taking a proactive approach to meeting the emerging needs of customers, clients, and communities. \u2047 We are improving access, lowering costs, and combining local points of care to simplify the consumer health experience. \u2047 We have one of the country's largest network of physician extenders and are able to deliver care locally with our national footprint. \u2047 We will continue to drive higher engagement with customers as we evolve the format of select CVS locations, creating community health destinations, and shifting into three distinct models: sites dedicated to offering primary care services, an enhanced version of health hubs with products and services designed for everyday health and wellness needs. \u2047 Our traditional CVS Pharmacy store model that provides prescription services and health and wellness and other convenient retail offerings. \u2047 Our unique combination of businesses and our presence in communities nationwide enable us to meet consumers where they are to enhance their well-being and to be a bigger part of their wellness. \u2047 Next, we are further strengthening the consumer experience through the expansion of digital services and platforms that connect to health services and in-person channels for our more than 35 million unique digital customers. \u2047 For example, more than 70% of CVS Pharmacy customers are enrolled in our text messaging programs today. \u2047 Within that group this quarter, adherence outreach drove 10% growth in prescriptions filled. \u2047 Greater adherence leads to improved health outcomes and lower costs. \u2047 In today's hyper-connected digital consumer-driven world, the demand for omnichannel pharmacy is greater than ever. \u2047 We continue to modernize our operating systems and enhance the integration of pharmacy model simplifying consumer interactions and driving further engagement with our customers. \u2047 Finally, we continue to invest in our employees as part of our workforce strategy. \u2047 Last quarter, we announced the phased increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour by July 2022. \u2047 We invested in modernizing our training programs and technology for our frontline and clinical colleagues. \u2047 Despite the tight labor market and anticipation of the higher demand for health services, we strengthened our workforce in every business. \u2047 We hired a record number of people in the third quarter to advance open enrollment and customer service, as well as enhance technology and clinical capabilities. \u2047 Nearly 20,000 pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and nurses recently joined the CVS Health team supporting flu season, as well as COVID-19 vaccinations and testing. \u2047 Our pharmacists and pharmacy technicians are an integral part of our overall workforce strategy. \u2047 We are committed to investing in our pharmacists, awarding immunization bonuses in the second half of this year. \u2047 We look forward to sharing more about our strategy to improve access, quality, and customer engagement in investor day on December 9. \u2047 Our commitment to shareholders, customers, and communities remain steadfast. \u2047 Health equity is critical as the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact certain communities. \u2047 In addition to targeted vaccine and booster education efforts, we provided 31 million meals this year to people suffering from food insecurity and invested in 2,800 affordable housing units in 30 cities. \u2047 By helping address the social determinants of health, permanent housing can reduce healthcare costs by 59%. \u2047 Joneigh Khaldun, to build upon our efforts to advance health equity and better support underserved communities, and our increased wages and bonuses support our employees, their families, and their communities. \u2047 For the third quarter in a row, we executed on and exceeded our plan and raised adjusted earnings per share guidance. \u2047 We continue to enhance our diverse portfolio of assets to serve the customer. \u2047 We are guiding to a strong year end, all possible due to the leadership and commitment of our over 300,000 CVS Health colleagues that bring their heart to every moment of our customers' health. \u2047 Our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2021 and as we exceeded our expectations from both a revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share basis. \u2047 These results ensue from our differentiated portfolio of capabilities and keen focus on operational execution. \u2047 This momentum in our performance enables us once again to raise our outlook for 2021. \u2047 Starting with the enterprise as a whole. \u2047 Total revenues of $73.8 billion increased 10% year over year with robust growth in all three segments. \u2047 We reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion, a 12.5% increase versus the prior year. \u2047 This growth in adjusted operating income was also reflected in the strong cash flow generation in the third quarter. \u2047 with year-to-date cash flow from operations now exceeding $14 billion. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share of $1.97 represent a nearly 19% year-over-year increase, generated by our adjusted operating income growth and lower interest expense resulting from our ongoing deleveraging efforts. \u2047 Moving to the segments. \u2047 Healthcare benefits revenue increased by 9.5% year over year, driven by sustained growth in our Government Services business, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurance fee. \u2047 In the third quarter, we saw Medicaid membership grow sequentially by 67,000 members across multiple geographies. \u2047 Medicare Advantage membership also continued to grow in the quarter, increasing by 42,000 members sequentially and representing year-over-year growth of 9.8%. \u2047 Our Medicare Advantage franchise continues to be a powerful growth engine with Medicare Advantage membership more than doubling since the third quarter of 2015, representing a 15% compound annual growth rate. \u2047 Our attention has now turned to ensuring a successful 2022 annual enrollment period for Medicare, which began on October 1. \u2047 While still quite early in that process, we are pleased with what we have seen to date. \u2047 Healthcare benefits adjusted operating income grew modestly year over year but fell below our expectations for the quarter due to higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in our commercial business. \u2047 With the surge in nationwide COVID cases emanating from the Delta variant, we experienced higher-than-expected COVID-related medical costs in August and September. \u2047 Three key factors drove this difference versus our expectations. \u2047 First, commercial COVID inpatient admissions in August and September. \u2047 Were in line with the peak levels experienced in January 2021 and were nearly three times the average of the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Second, COVID testing costs, which we had expected to moderate during the third quarter, also approached January 2021 levels and were more than 1.5 times the average we experienced in the second quarter. \u2047 It is critical to recognize the outsized impact of COVID testing on overall claim costs as testing costs represented approximately 35% of gross COVID costs in the quarter. \u2047 And finally, while non-COVID deferred care was better than we had forecast, it was not enough to entirely offset these higher COVID costs in commercial. \u2047 The resultant medical benefit ratio for the quarter of 85.8% was above our forecast and driven almost entirely by the higher-than-expected commercial COVID testing and treatment costs. \u2047 There are two important aspects of HCB's third quarter performance to note. \u2047 One, absent these COVID dynamics, underlying performance in our commercial book of business continues to be in line with our expectations. \u2047 Two, in our government services business, we also saw an increase in COVID treatment and testing costs, but far less pronounced than in commercial. \u2047 This lower level of increase was fully offset by better-than-expected deferred care. \u2047 As a result, the overall performance of our Government Services business was in line with expectations. \u2047 Wrapping up HCB -- We experienced favorable prior period development in the quarter on both commercial and government products. \u2047 Days claims payable of 51 at the end of the third quarter is three days higher sequentially and two days above prior year. \u2047 While influenced by many factors with the anticipated abatement and COVID-related claims in the fourth quarter, we would expect DCP to return to a more typical results in Q4"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q3 adjusted earnings per share $1.97.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share $1.97 .  \u2047  sees fy
