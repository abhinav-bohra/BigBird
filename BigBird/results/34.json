{"article": ["Today, I am joined by Bill Furman, Greenbrier's executive chairman; Lorie Tekorius, CEO and president; Brian Comstock, executive vice president and chief commercial and leasing officer; and Adrian Downes, senior vice president and CFO. \u2047 This past month has been an eventful time in the world and at Greenbrier. \u2047 On March 1, Lorie Tekorius assume the role of Greenbrier's CEO. \u2047 Last week, our board of directors appointed Lorie as our newest director. \u2047 As we begin today's call, I want to first congratulate Lorie on the new positions at Greenbrier. \u2047 And we're proud of the board's development of Greenbrier, how we have managed this very important transition. \u2047 I'm pleased that I now serve as executive chairman through the remainder of our fiscal year and as a board member and investor until 2024. \u2047 With Lorie's appointment, we've expanded our board's gender diversity, four of our 11 directors are female. \u2047 Further, three of the directors identify as people of color. \u2047 Omicron is still a factor in our operations, as you will hear today, but things are getting much better. \u2047 Just so those impacts begin to add, the war in Ukraine has impacted the economies everywhere we operate. \u2047 We are witnessing a true tragedy and I pray for a swift end to the conflict and to all of the human suffering. \u2047 While the war creates challenges for everybody in the near term, it also provides opportunities for major shifts in freight corridors and transportation roads that will enhance Greenbrier's business as the world enters a reordered state. \u2047 History demonstrates the integral role of railroads to support civilian life and economies and a heightened manner during wartime. \u2047 The current war in Europe has created direct pressure on the availability and cost of commodities ranging from minerals to food, to fertilizer, to crude oil as well as coal and natural gas. \u2047 Railroads and railway suppliers will help meet the challenge of keeping civilian life and economies functioning during the crisis. \u2047 The commodity markets are traditionally leading indicators for expansion in rail freight. \u2047 Most commodities shipped by rail are experiencing upward pricing pressure from demand constraints due to either sanctions on Russia or reduced production from Russia and in the Ukraine. \u2047 We expect rising global commodity prices and shifting trade patterns to elevate railcar demand in North America and Brazil and elsewhere in the world. \u2047 Already changing energy policies in North America and Western Europe are creating opportunities for rail transport of oil, ethanol and other products. \u2047 The impact will be similar in fertilizers and other items needed to produce food. \u2047 Finally, the rising cost of diesel creates a distinct opportunity for model shift from road to rail. \u2047 Freight rail is one of the most sustainable and fuel-efficient modes of surface transportation. \u2047 U.S. freight railroads with diesel-electric power generation are three to four times more fuel efficient than trucks. \u2047 Think about that for just a moment. \u2047 One ton of freight can be moved by rail almost 500 miles per gallon of fuel. \u2047 Additionally, moving freight by train instead of trucks reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 75% per tonne travel and it reduces congestion on wear and tear on bridges and byways. \u2047 As more freight ships to rail, in many cases, this will induce longer railcar dwell tough times and lowered railroad velocity. \u2047 In turn, railroad congestion causes the need for more railcars to make railroad service more efficient, notwithstanding the increase in demand we expect in major commodities like fertilizer, food steps, and other products. \u2047 We recognize the role and responsibility our industry must play in times of crisis and as the geopolitical landscape shifts. \u2047 The cruel irony is this war in Ukraine is that there will be ultimately beneficiaries. \u2047 Now we can't choose the exogenous factors that affect our business, but we have almost always have to be ready to meet the challenges and opportunities that come with them. \u2047 Greenbrier has proven the ability to thrive on adversity and seize opportunities. \u2047 I'm sure this legacy will continue for years to come under Lorie's leadership. \u2047 With that, I'll hand the call over to Lorie to discuss our strong performance during the quarter. \u2047 Before I discuss our results for the quarter, I'd like to express my gratitude to Bill and the rest of the Greenbrier Board for the opportunity to serve as CEO. \u2047 We have an outstanding team at Greenbrier who works hard and smart every day. \u2047 While it's difficult to predict the specific opportunities or challenges that may arise, I know that Greenbrier team has the experience, knowledge, and tenacity to make the most of any situation with a focus on increasing shareholder value. \u2047 Greenbrier posted strong results this second quarter. \u2047 And while not all of our operating segments performed as expected, our business is highly diverse and in the aggregate, performed very well. \u2047 In the quarter, we delivered 4,800 railcar units, a 17% increase from the prior quarter, driven by our core North American market. \u2047 Our lease fleet utilization increased to 98% and our leasing team generated robust cash proceeds and gains through regular lease fleet optimization and monetization transactions. \u2047 Our leasing business is operating ahead of our expectations as we achieve growth at scale. \u2047 Our strong quarterly performance was achieved as the omicron variance of COVID-19 reached peak levels in the United States. \u2047 Sadly, in February, Charles Wallace, a longtime employee in our maintenance services group passed away due to COVID. \u2047 Charles is survived by a son and four sisters. \u2047 We send them our condolences for their loss. \u2047 Further, we experienced significant absence here another quarter as approximately 12% of our workforce contracted the virus. \u2047 Recently, the infection rates have declined, and we're hopeful the worst of the pandemic is now behind us. \u2047 Our manufacturing gross margin percentage was below our expectations in the quarter, impacted by supply chain and labor issues. \u2047 Our global sourcing team continues to do an exceptional job of mitigating severe disruptions to support increasing production rates and simultaneously minimizing production delays. \u2047 We have avoided any line shutdowns across our network due to material availability. \u2047 Additional expenses were incurred in connection with sourcing spot materials and expediting delivery. \u2047 Operating momentum is increasing, and we expect improved performance in the coming quarters due to improved pricing and overhead absorption on higher production. \u2047 In Europe, the situation is fluid. \u2047 The period leading up to and the subsequent war in Ukraine has created a highly disruptive environment for many European manufacturers. \u2047 Our operations have been impacted by rapidly rising energy costs and now finished steel and components in our supply chain. \u2047 Ukraine and Russia are among the biggest suppliers of iron ore, finished steel, and wheelsets to European mines and welders. \u2047 As Bill mentioned, railroads are integral to supporting the economy during wartime. \u2047 Our management team is working together with our customers and suppliers to maintain production and ensure the best outcomes for all parties. \u2047 Our maintenance service business continued to be impacted by higher material costs and labor shortages during the quarter with the omicron variant having an outsized impact on the network of smaller workforces. \u2047 We are beginning to see improving financial results on the action plan implemented to mitigate these headwinds in Q1. \u2047 We expect to sustain our momentum in the second half of the year as we remain focused on executing our plans while also looking for additional opportunities to reduce costs and improve margins. \u2047 Our leasing and management services group had another strong quarter, driven by increased fleet utilization and regular asset optimization and monetization transactions. \u2047 Our owned fleet has grown by over 25% from the end of fiscal 2021 to around 11,000 units. \u2047 And in addition to managing our lease fleet, our management services, or GMS group, continues to provide creative railcar solutions for over 25% of the North American rail freight fleet. \u2047 Within GMS, we're launching an initiative to redevelop the service platform used to manage equipment and data. \u2047 One of the goals with this important initiative is to ensure scalable support for our leasing and syndication business as well as our external customers as we continue to execute on our leasing strategy. \u2047 Looking ahead, we see strong operating momentum continuing throughout fiscal 2022 and beyond. \u2047 We've been able to maintain our market-leading positions through disciplined execution and by maintaining our strong liquidity position. \u2047 These were hallmarks of our management team's plans at the start of the pandemic and they continue to service well. \u2047 There is no doubt that the market backdrop will remain dynamic, particularly with the war in Europe. \u2047 Inflation, supply chain issues, and the continuing human impact of pandemic will persist for some time. \u2047 We are managing the business accordingly and maintain our optimistic market outlook. \u2047 We expect our operating metrics to continue to improve as we move through the next several quarters and beyond. \u2047 As we've said before, the market recoveries won't follow a straight line, and there will be challenges along the way. \u2047 We're managing our business to get ahead of these challenges wherever we can to continue to provide solutions to our customers and ultimately, deliver value to our shareholders. \u2047 As I said before, our leadership team has the experience, knowledge, and tenacity to make the most of any situation. \u2047 And with that, I'll hand the call over to Brian Comstock to provide an update on current railcar demand environment and our leasing activity. \u2047 Greenbrier's secured new railcar orders of 8,500 units valued at $930 million. \u2047 With deliveries of 4,800 units in the quarter, the book-to-bill increased to 1.8 times. \u2047 Orders through the first half of the year are already over 85% of fiscal 2021 activity. \u2047 New railcar backlog of 32,100 units has a market value of $3.6 billion and provides multiyear visibility. \u2047 This is Greenbrier's largest backlog in six years. \u2047 Historically, when our backlog reaches this level, it includes several multiyear orders. \u2047 In this case, there are a few multiyear orders, which illustrates the strength of the overall demand environment. \u2047 From an operations perspective, this means that a greater portion of our backlog is scheduled to enter production in the short term and translate to revenue sooner. \u2047 Also, as production space becomes more valuable, we expect multiyear orders to follow and pricing could continue improvement. \u2047 As a reminder, our new railcar backlog does not reflect 3,200 units valued at $180 million that are part of Greenbrier's refurbishment program. \u2047 Because of the large scale and nature of this activity, this work occurs at our manufacturing facility that absorbs production capacity while contributing to overhead absorption. \u2047 Our refurbishment program is an important part of ensuring rail remaining the most environmentally friendly lot of surface transport. \u2047 I'm excited about this growing partnership with our customers to sustainably repurpose North America's aging railcar fleet. \u2047 Fleet utilization ended the quarter at 98%. \u2047 Lease pricing and terms continue to improve sequentially, and we are seeing strong demand for new and used leased equipment. \u2047 As part of our enhanced leasing strategy, GBX Leasing, closed our inaugural asset-backed securitization by using -- by issuing $323 million in investment-grade rated notes with a blended coupon rate of 2.9% and an anticipated repayment date of January 2029. \u2047 Our capital markets team executed well this quarter and syndicated 1,400 units, the highest level of activity in nearly two years. \u2047 Syndication is an important source of liquidity and profitability, and we expect to continue strong syndication activity in the second half of the year. \u2047 As many of you know, syndication and asset disposition are important activities for leasing that will continue to grow into the future. \u2047 Looking ahead, I remain optimistic about the momentum that has been building, especially in light of the strong demand environment in North America. \u2047 Greenbrier is well-positioned for a period of strong growth. \u2047 I believe the combination of market forces, the ability of our focused management, and experienced management team to capitalize on them will deliver results in its early phase of this railcar cycle, which is substantially better than we've seen in previous cycles. \u2047 Today, I will discuss highlights from the quarter, and we're also affirming guidance for fiscal year 2022. \u2047 Second-quarter highlights include revenue of $683 million, deliveries of 4,800 units, which includes 400 units from our unconsolidated joint venture in Brazil. \u2047 Aggregate gross margins of 8% reflects continued effects from ramping of new railcar production, the impact of the omicron variant, mitigation of supply chain, labor shortages, and an additional warranty accrual for certain older railcars. \u2047 Selling and administrative expense of about $55 million was higher sequentially, reflecting increased employee-related costs, consulting, travel, and legal expense from higher levels of business activity. \u2047 Net gain on disposition of equipment was $25 million. \u2047 This activity was part of our ongoing optimization and monetization of our leasing portfolio. \u2047 Non-controlling interest provides a benefit of $1.6 million, primarily resulting from the impact of line changeovers and production ramping at our Mexico joint venture. \u2047 This improved sequentially, and we expect our Mexican JV to be profitable in the second half of the year. \u2047 Net earnings attributable to Greenbrier of approximately $13 million or $0.38 per diluted share, and EBITDA of about $52 million or 7.6% of revenue. \u2047 In the quarter, we recognized $2.1 million of gross costs, specifically related to COVID-19 employee and facility safety. \u2047 This expense increased almost 75% sequentially and was our highest level in the last 12 months. \u2047 Greenbrier's liquidity increased to $804 million at the end of Q2, consisting of cash of $587 million and available borrowings of $217 million. \u2047 Because of the strength of our balance sheet, we are well-positioned to navigate any market dynamics. \u2047 We expect to receive a large portion of our $106 million tax receivable in fiscal Q4, reflecting delays in processing with the IRS. \u2047 This refund will be in addition to Greenbrier's available cash and borrowing capacity. \u2047 In the quarter and shortly after the quarter, Greenbrier entered additional interest rate swaps to fix long-term floating rate debt for the next several years, reducing the risk of increasing interest expense and a rising interest rate environment. \u2047 At the end of the second quarter, effectively all of our outstanding leasing debt was at fixed interest rates and approximately 90% of our corporate non-leasing long-term debt was fixed. \u2047 Together with executing on over $2 billion of new and refinanced borrowing facilities over the past year, including the ABS lease financing completed in Q2, this positions Greenbrier quite well as we move forward. \u2047 On March 31, Greenbrier's board of directors declared a dividend of $0.27 per share, our 32nd consecutive dividend"],
