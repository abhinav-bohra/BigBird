{"article": ["I'm Shivani Kak, Head of Investor Relations. \u2047 I'm going to begin by providing a general update on the business, including Moody's second quarter 2021 financial results. \u2047 And following my commentary, Mark Kaye will provide further details on our second quarter 2021 performance as well as our revised 2021 outlook. \u2047 Moody's delivered strong financial results in the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Revenue growth of 8% and increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 15% highlighted the robust demand for our best-in-class integrated risk assessment offerings. \u2047 Favorable market conditions and heightened M&A activity provided the backdrop for sustained leveraged finance issuance in the second quarter, and it supported growth in our ratings business. \u2047 The ongoing expansion of our risk assessment solutions combined with strong retention rates drove MA's significant recurring revenue growth. \u2047 Top line performance as well as expense discipline contributed to adjusted operating margin expansion, and our cost efficiency initiatives continue to fund key investments and product innovation that should support ongoing growth. \u2047 As a result of our solid execution in the quarter, we've revised our full year 2021 guidance and now forecast Moody's revenue to grow in the low double-digit percent range. \u2047 Additionally, we've raised our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be in the range of $11.55 to $11.85. \u2047 Now turning to second quarter results. \u2047 MIS revenue grew 4%. \u2047 That's despite the tough prior year comparable, while MA achieved its highest ever quarterly revenue, up 15% from last year. \u2047 On an organic constant currency basis, MA revenue increased 8%. \u2047 Moody's adjusted operating income rose 12% to $861 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 55.4%. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.22, up 15%. \u2047 On the last earnings call, I highlighted that issuance volumes reached their highest level in over a decade. \u2047 This quarter, as anticipated, investment-grade activity declined as many issuers had already substantially fulfilled their funding needs in recent quarters. \u2047 Although overall issuance declined by 16%, as you can see on the chart, second quarter issuance was still well above the historical 10-year average as shown on the blue line. \u2047 While the growth in leveraged loans outpaced high-yield bonds, the demand that we saw earlier this year from both asset classes persisted, albeit a bit slower sequentially. \u2047 We also saw increased momentum in the CLO market, driven by opportunistic refinancing as spreads remain tight. \u2047 We frequently comment on our revenue relative to issuance levels, which relates to issuance mix. \u2047 And in the second quarter, transactional MIS revenue grew 3%, while MIS rated issuance declined 16%. \u2047 This chart provides an illustration of our second quarter issuance and revenue mix by asset class. \u2047 So for example, the dark green bubble on the bottom left corner represents investment-grade issuance. \u2047 And you can see that issuance was down 68% in the second quarter versus the prior year. \u2047 However, leveraged loans, which has a greater proportion of issuers on per issuance or pay-as-you-go commercial programs, represented by the dark blue bubble on the far right, saw issuance up over 200%. \u2047 And that significantly contributed to this quarter's favorable issuance mix. \u2047 Similar to last quarter, favorable market conditions led issuers to access the debt markets for a variety of reasons. \u2047 Credit spreads tightened as default rates trended lower, keeping the overall cost of debt low and allowing issuers to opportunistically refinance existing debt. \u2047 And as the economy started to recover and equity markets continued their strong run, we saw an acceleration of M&A as companies use the combination of cash balances and debt financing to acquire growth and position businesses for the post-pandemic economy. \u2047 We expect this constructive environment to persist, providing issuers further opportunities to tap the markets. \u2047 That said, we forecast activity for the remainder of 2021 to moderate from the historical highs that we saw in the first half of this year. \u2047 And Mark is going to go into further detail on our issuance guidance by asset class later in the call. \u2047 Now let's turn to MA. \u2047 MA's growing recurring revenue base and strong retention rates demonstrate the market demand for our products. \u2047 Our emphasis on renewable sales has increased the proportion of recurring revenue by four percentage points in the trailing 12-month period to 92%. \u2047 We continue to see significant opportunities in know your customer and financial crime compliance solutions as well as areas like insurance and asset management, both of which contributed to recurring revenue growth along with research and data feeds. \u2047 We briefly discussed some of these businesses in the first quarter 2021 earnings call, and I want to further spotlight these two high-growth areas. \u2047 I'll start by highlighting a few key trends in the KYC market. \u2047 First, as I've mentioned before, the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in know your customer and customer onboarding. \u2047 Second, regulators are requiring organizations to know more about their customers and suppliers than ever before. \u2047 And finally, financial crime continues to become more sophisticated, which requires advanced detection and monitoring capabilities. \u2047 Our industry-leading product offerings and solutions leverage information on hundreds of millions of entities and ownership structures as well as detailed profiles on over 13 million politically exposed individuals. \u2047 Using artificial intelligence, we combine our world-class data sets to map and analyze adverse media, together generating insights and identifying risks at a scale, speed and precision that is difficult for others to match and creating a compelling solution that is unique to Moody's and enables our customers to make better and faster decisions to combat financial crime. \u2047 Similar to our know your customer and financial crime compliance products, our expanding offerings for insurers and asset managers are contributing to revenue growth for MA and are a core part of our integrated risk assessment strategy. \u2047 We initially entered the insurance customer segment by providing market-leading regulatory compliance software. \u2047 We then moved into actuarial models to support global life insurers enabled by our acquisition of GGY. \u2047 We further expanded our capabilities to include asset and liability management and balance sheet solutions, portfolio analytics and other tools to help address new accounting standards such as IFRS 17 and CECL. \u2047 Now the data, analytics and domain expertise from across our business enables us to provide insurers and asset managers with more comprehensive solutions to manage a wider set of risks. \u2047 As the industry continues to evolve, our holistic approach allows us to build on our existing position in the insurance space, while at the same time provide a broader range of increasingly important analytics and insights, such as climate risk scenarios. \u2047 Together, this has contributed to our ability to deliver 20% organic revenue growth over the trailing 12 months in this segment. \u2047 And we're excited about the opportunity ahead to serve new and growing risk assessment use cases for insurers and asset managers, leveraging our vast data sets and analytic capabilities. \u2047 I've also talked a number of times about the importance of innovating and integrating our data and analytics across our product suite. \u2047 For example, this quarter, we launched an industry-first ESG Score Predictor. \u2047 This offering combines Moody's ESG scoring methodology with company-specific data and predictive analytics to produce ESG scores for over 140 million small- and medium-sized enterprises. \u2047 These scores allow our customers to screen ESG risks on public and private companies to monitor portfolio and supply chain risk and are a great example of integrating our SME and ESG capabilities to address a key market need, which is ESG assessment to support sustainable supply chains. \u2047 Now staying on ESG for a moment, there's been a proliferation of climate-related financial disclosures over the past few years, and we recently partnered with the TCFD to provide insight on the quality of climate disclosures, leveraging our natural language processing and machine learning tools. \u2047 In MIS, we expanded our proprietary ESG credit impact score coverage to companies in a broader range of industries as well as to U.S. states and cities. \u2047 And we believe this is a unique offering that will allow investors to understand more clearly the impact of E, S and G on any issuer's creditworthiness and enhances our credit ratings relevance and thought leadership. \u2047 In MA, as a leading provider of know-your-customer data and analytics, our customers are increasingly needing to comply with regulations relating to modern slavery and human trafficking within their supply chain. \u2047 Working with various stakeholders, we added new AI-enabled features to help our customers screen and track previously undetected instances of human trafficking and modern slavery risk across their supplier base, providing an opportunity to further broaden our KYC customer base beyond financial institutions. \u2047 I'm frequently asked how we are differentiating ourselves in the ESG space. \u2047 So I thought I would take a minute to provide a few customer case studies that illustrate how we're combining our capabilities to meet the risk assessment needs of different customer types. \u2047 In the Americas, we worked with a leading global commercial real estate firm to embed physical climate risk analysis into their global funds and client portfolios. \u2047 The detail and rigor of our climate scores and data on individual properties allowed them to analyze thousands of properties in a more sophisticated and a more efficient way. \u2047 In Europe, a large government agency requested our expertise on their green bond financing framework. \u2047 Through our second-party opinion, we assessed that the proposed framework not only aligned with their climate and environmental agenda but also with the 2021 green bond principles. \u2047 And since 2012, we provided hundreds of second-party opinions across 30 countries with over 60 second-party opinions provided just in the first half of this year. \u2047 On to Asia, a large regional bank, also an existing MA customer, recently selected Moody's to create a robust framework to quantify the ESG and climate risk of customers' portfolios, leveraging our ESG assessments, ESG and climate insights and data and our ESG Score Predictor that I just talked about. \u2047 They also requested in-house training on how to integrate ESG and sustainability into their in-house risk management practices. \u2047 So it's a really great example of commercializing ESG and climate across our risk assessment offerings and our customer base. \u2047 And these matter because they are independent third-party validation about the strength of our offerings across the firm. \u2047 MIS was named Best Credit Rating Agency in multiple areas in the GlobalCapital Bond Awards and the Best Global Credit Rating Agency by Institutional Investor again. \u2047 MIS was also ranked the number one Securitization Rating Agency of the Year in the GlobalCapital European Awards. \u2047 As I noted, within MA, we are investing in our products to help our customers make better decisions on a wider range of risks. \u2047 Industry participants recognize the pace of our innovation, awarding MA's Credit Sentiment Score the Best AI-based Solution in the 2021 AI Breakthrough Awards. \u2047 I'm pleased that we ranked number two on Chartis' STORM Top 50, demonstrating our position at the forefront of digital transformation in our sector. \u2047 Moody's ESG Solutions also won the Climate Risk Solution of the Year in Environmental Finance's Sustainable Investment Awards. \u2047 I'm also enormously proud that Moody's was named a Top 50 Company for Diversity by DiversityInc. \u2047 And together, these recognitions underscore our commitment to customer delivery, innovation, sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion, all of which are critical to our sustained success. \u2047 And finally, I'm thrilled that Moody's joined the Fortune 500 earlier this quarter. \u2047 This milestone is a testament to the dedication our employees have shown both to our customers and to one another. \u2047 In the second quarter, MIS revenue increased 4%, supported by a 3% rise in transaction revenue, while global MIS rated issuance declined 16%. \u2047 As a result of favorable mix, corporate finance revenue declined 4% versus a 26% decrease in issuance. \u2047 This was attributable to a surge in leveraged finance activity as U.S. and EMEA issuers opportunistically refinance existing debt and funded M&A transactions. \u2047 Investment-grade supply contracted compared to the prior year period, which had seen significant liquidity-driven financing caused by uncertainty over the unfolding pandemic. \u2047 Financial institutions revenue rose 6%, above the 1% increase in issuance. \u2047 This is due to infrequent EMEA bank issuers who sought to take advantage of the ongoing attractive rate environment. \u2047 Revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance declined 2% compared to a 45% decrease in issuance as increased non-U.S. project and infrastructure activity was offset by a reduction in U.S. infrastructure supply. \u2047 Structured finance revenue increased 73%, supported by an over 200% growth in issuance. \u2047 This is due to approximately 200 CLO deals this quarter, our highest on record, predominantly attributable to refinancing activity. \u2047 In addition, CMBS formation further bolstered overall results. \u2047 MIS' adjusted operating margin expanded 230 basis points to 66.3%. \u2047 This was enabled by strong revenue growth, coupled with operating efficiency initiatives and lower legal accruals, partially offset by higher reserves for 2021 incentive compensation. \u2047 Second quarter revenue rose 15% or 13% on an organic basis. \u2047 In RD&A, revenue increased 19% or 16% on an organic basis. \u2047 This is due to robust demand for KYC and compliance solutions as well as strong customer retention rates and double-digit trailing 12-month sales growth in research and data feeds. \u2047 For ERS, recurring revenue rose 16%, driving overall ERS growth of 5% or 3% organically. \u2047 This reflected the demand for our insurance and asset management offerings, tools supporting upcoming accounting standards implementations such as IFRS 17 as well as our SaaS-based credit assessment and origination solutions. \u2047 Additionally, ERS' recurring revenue comprised 88% of second quarter revenue, up eight percentage points from the prior year period. \u2047 MA's adjusted operating margin expanded 310 basis points to 31.8%. \u2047 This reflected the benefits of our recently completed restructuring program, which relates to the realization of incremental operating leverage in the quarter. \u2047 Turning to Moody's full year 2021 guidance. \u2047 Moody's outlook for 2021 is based on assumptions regarding many geopolitical conditions, macroeconomic and capital market factors. \u2047 These include, but are not limited to, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; responses by governments, regulators, businesses and individuals as well as the effects on interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, capital markets liquidity and activity in different sectors of the debt market. \u2047 Our full year 2021 guidance is underpinned by the following macro assumptions: a rise in the 2021 U.S. and euro area GDP to a range of 6% to 7% and 4% to 5%, respectively; benchmark interest rates will remain low, with U.S. high-yield spreads remaining below approximately 500 basis points; the U.S. unemployment rate will decline to under 5% by year-end; and the global high-yield default rate will fall below 2% by year-end. \u2047 Our guidance also assumes foreign currency translation at end of quarter exchange rates. \u2047 "],
