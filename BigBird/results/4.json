{"article": ["I am joined on the call today by Michael Happe, president and chief executive officer, and Bryan Hughes, senior vice president and chief financial officer. \u2047 These factors are identified in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to read. \u2047 We, as always, deeply appreciate your interest in Winnebago Industries and taking the time to discuss our fiscal fourth quarter and annual 2021 results. \u2047 Our fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 was a strong finish to a remarkable year, characterized by record revenue and record profitability, propelled by three key factors. \u2047 First, a sustained elevated excitement for the outdoor lifestyle remained a powerful tailwind driving demand for Winnebago Industries premium products. \u2047 Winnebago Industries grew fourth-quarter revenues 40.4% year over year, and 56.8% on an organic basis ex-Newmar, compared to our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter. \u2047 Second, Winnebago Industries trend of expanding market share accelerated in the fourth quarter, gaining a full 2.1 percentage points of share during the three-month period ending August. \u2047 Importantly, this is driven by both new and experienced consumers who recognize the differentiated quality and innovation in Winnebago Industries brand portfolio. \u2047 And the exceptional service we are known to provide in partnership with our dealers. \u2047 And third, our team's relentless demonstration of operational excellence, which enabled us to deliver for consumers and our dealer partners efficiently and profitably during a very challenging period as supply constraints and inflation have endured. \u2047 As a result, we expanded margins in both our motor home and towable segments during the fourth quarter. \u2047 Before I continue, I want to recognize the superb Winnebago Industries employee team. \u2047 Our employees now 6,800 plus drawn with the addition of Barletta, have worked tirelessly to provide the high-quality products and exceptional service our customers and dealer partners have come to expect. \u2047 While managing through record high backlogs to meet the tremendous demand for our products, their dedication throughout this year has been the key factor in our success. \u2047 The pandemic has undoubtedly catalyzed and accelerated powerful demand for outdoor experiences. \u2047 And we believe this secular shift already underway pre-COVID-19 will have a lasting impact as more and more new families experience the great outdoors. \u2047 Over 10 million households camp for the first time in 2020, and we are tracking toward another estimated 4.3 million households to have their first camping experience in 2021. \u2047 In addition to first timers, a new wave of engaged enthusiasts, especially millennials, younger generations are investing more of their time and income in the outdoor lifestyle. \u2047 To put a finer point on this, even as we saw the easing of pandemic restrictions over the summer, creating a possible return to a broader set of vacation and travel leisure options. \u2047 Our performance in the summer selling season was strong, setting revenue records in both our fiscal third quarter, and now, our fiscal fourth quarter. \u2047 Our record backlog of orders continues to grow, and we are seeing rapid sell-through of inventory we provide to dealers. \u2047 We are also confident that the diverse cohorts making memories in the outdoors will be the foundation of our growth in the decades ahead. \u2047 So, we're bullish on the broader recreation economy and investing to expand our reach beyond RVs, in line with our strategy to become a premier outdoor lifestyle company. \u2047 Early in the first quarter of our fiscal 2022 year, we completed our acquisition of Barletta Boat Company. \u2047 Building on our past marine investment in the Chris-Craft brand, Barletta's premium pontoon boats meaningfully expand and extend our marine platform into one of the fastest-growing boating segments in pontoons. \u2047 Looking ahead, we're excited to discuss the exciting opportunity in our new marine reporting segment in quarters to come. \u2047 Due to the strength of our overall offering, we have been very successful in harnessing the industrywide demand for the outdoor lifestyle and delivering net total growth. \u2047 Winnebago Industries is increasingly winning with customers, and we're proud that an outsized share of new outdoor adventures has chosen to become part of the Winnebago Industries' community. \u2047 As of August 2021, our RV fiscal year-to-date market share is now 12.5%, up 140 basis points from the same period last year. \u2047 Even better, we've been able to achieve these gains while maintaining record low levels of discounting. \u2047 Our performance and ability to capture share in the full value of our products in a competitive market underscores the unique appeal of our differentiated brand portfolio, which includes a broad range of options for new customers as they enter the market, as well as more premium products as customers upgrade and move up the value chain. \u2047 Continuing to invest in our products and brands unified by our golden threads of quality, innovation and service ensures we are positioned to meet consumer demands on technology and capabilities to drive share gains now and into the future. \u2047 Finally, our world-class team did a masterful job translating demand growth and market share gains into financial performance in the fourth quarter with an enterprisewide commitment to operational efficiency, despite the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. \u2047 These operational efforts can be clearly seen as we kept off the fiscal year with record consolidated annual gross margins of 17.9%. \u2047 One key element of our operational excellence is the success of our enterprisewide operations and sourcing teams, who quickly adapted to component shortages and supply disruptions that have become commonplace across the supply chain. \u2047 Our team has remained flexible using creative and strategic material sourcing strategies and solutions to keep our assembly lines moving. \u2047 We will continue to monitor supply chain issues and provide updates along with our results as long as they persist. \u2047 Our work to improve communication across our supply chain has allowed us to better anticipate and plan for disruptions in partner component availability. \u2047 And we are continuing to strengthen and deepen our relationships with our dedicated dealer network as we focus on replenishing their inventories as quickly as possible. \u2047 We are incredibly proud of our team and the performance in the fourth quarter and for our entire fiscal 2021 year. \u2047 Our results demonstrate that we are executing well on our proven value creation strategy. \u2047 The new heights we were able to achieve in revenues and profitability demonstrate the unique strength and appeal of our growing platform, as well as our world-class team. \u2047 I'll touch on fourth quarter and annual highlights, recent capital allocation announcements and several items impacting reporting going forward. \u2047 This information can be found on our investor relations website at investor. \u2047 As Mike mentioned earlier, our first fiscal fourth quarter was a strong finish to an already outstanding fiscal 2021. \u2047 Fourth-quarter revenues were a record $1 billion, an increase of 40% compared to the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. \u2047 Fourth quarter consolidated gross profit margin of 18.1% was up 150 basis points compared to the same period last year due to leverage, pricing, including lower discounts and allowances and profitability initiatives. \u2047 Fourth-quarter record revenues and strong margins resulted in record levels of earnings per share. \u2047 Fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share was a record $2.45, an increase of 96% versus the same period last year. \u2047 Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share was a record $2.57, up 77% versus the same period last year. \u2047 Now turning to the full-year fiscal 2021 results. \u2047 Consolidated fiscal 2021 record revenues of $3.6 billion increased approximately 54% from $2.4 billion in fiscal 2020, positively impacted by strong consumer demand for Winnebago Industries product, coupled with continued RV market share gains. \u2047 Revenues were also positively impacted by pricing taken throughout the year, which was implemented to offset inflationary cost input, as well as lower levels of discounts and allowances. \u2047 Annual gross profit margin improved 460 basis points to a record 17.9%, primarily due to robust fixed cost leverage, profitability initiatives, increased pricing, including lower discounts and allowances and favorable segment mix. \u2047 In line with the fourth quarter, strong annual revenues and healthy margins drove record levels of profitability. \u2047 Full-year earnings per diluted share were a record $8.28, an increase of 350% compared to fiscal 2020. \u2047 Annual adjusted earnings per diluted share also hit a record high of $8.55, an increase of 231% compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.58 in the same period last year. \u2047 Now, turning to the individual segments. \u2047 Towable segment revenues for the fourth quarter were $560 million, up approximately 35% from $414 million in fiscal 2020, primarily driven by strong-end consumer demand and pricing, which was implemented to offset inflationary cost input pressures. \u2047 Segment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $83.4 million, up approximately 36% year over year, primarily driven by the higher revenues. \u2047 Fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.9% increased 10 basis points, compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by operating leverage, which was offset by a shift in mix favoring travel trailers versus fifth wheel. \u2047 For the full-year fiscal 2021, revenues for the towable segment were a record $2 billion, up 64% from fiscal 2020, driven by high demand for our towable products and pricing, which was implemented to offset inflationary cost input pressures. \u2047 Segment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $289 million, up 95% from fiscal 2020. \u2047 Segment adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.4% increased 230 basis points for the full year over fiscal 2020. \u2047 Now, let's turn to our motor home segment. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, revenues for the motor home segment were $448.9 million, up approximately 49% from the prior year, driven by strong end consumer demand, particularly in class B and class A and pricing, which was implemented to offset inflation. \u2047 Segment adjusted EBITDA was $50.4 million, up approximately 159% from the prior year. \u2047 And adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.2%, an increase of 480 basis points over the prior year and 150 basis points sequentially, driven by fixed cost leverage and profitability initiatives. \u2047 For the full-year fiscal 2021, revenues from motor home segment were $1.5 billion, up approximately 46% compared to fiscal 2020 due to increased unit sales and pricing. \u2047 Segment adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $169.2 million, up 414% from fiscal 2020. \u2047 Segment adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 11%, up 790 basis points over fiscal 2020. \u2047 Turning to the balance sheet. \u2047 As of the end of the 2021 fiscal year. \u2047 The company had outstanding debt of $528.6 million comprised of $600 million of gross debt, net of convertible note discount of $60.4 million and net of debt issuance costs of $11.1 million. \u2047 Working capital was $651.6 million. \u2047 Our current net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 0.4 times, below our targeted range of 0.9 to 1.5 times providing financial flexibility and balance sheet strength to enable continued investment in our strategic imperatives and health returns for our shareholders. \u2047 We continue to maintain a very healthy liquidity position. \u2047 Our cash balance increased to $434.6 million at the end of fiscal 2021, and we have not drawn on our $192.5 million ABL. \u2047 This liquidity of approximately $627 million provided the necessary funding for the Barletta acquisition, which closed in early fiscal 2022. \u2047 We also bought back approximately $45 million worth of shares throughout the year with approximately $35 million occurring in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Combining share repurchases with dividends paid, Winnebago Industries returned a total of $62 million to shareholders in fiscal 2021, while also growing the business significantly. \u2047 The effective income tax rate for the full year was 23.3% compared to 20.5% for fiscal 2020 due to relatively consistent year-over-year tax credits on higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021. \u2047 Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%, not considering unforeseen discrete items or any change in the tax law. \u2047 Our balance sheet and financial health have never been so strong. \u2047 With that in mind and looking ahead, I want to comment on our capital allocation priorities. \u2047 First, we will continue to invest in our business and advance our strategic priorities focused on growth and to meet the robust demand we continue to expect. \u2047 We are planning investments to add capacity, including new facilities, executing production flow, redesign and optimizing our operational capabilities. \u2047 These improvements will support continued production output, as well as product innovation, and they signal our confidence in the future of Winnebago Industries and the vitality of our end markets. \u2047 We continually look for areas of improvement across our Winnebago, Grand Design, Newmar, Chris-Craft, and now, Barletta, manufacturing and assembly footprint and will add meaningful square footage in the coming year. \u2047 Our acquisition of Barletta completed in early fiscal 2022 was primarily funded out of cash but also included newly issued shares. \u2047 This effective deal structure keeps our liquidity position strong and our leverage ratio low, so we can continue to pursue M&A opportunities as they arise. \u2047 Issuing shares also serves to align all parties on driving a successful integration and our collective future success. \u2047 On August 18, 2021, the company's board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share, payable on September 29, 2021, to common stockholders of record at the close of business on September 15, 2021. \u2047 This quarter's dividend declaration represents a 50% or $0.06 per share increase from the previous quarter and further demonstrates our confidence in future business performance while also delivering financial returns to our shareholders. \u2047 As mentioned previously, we returned approximately $45 million to shareholders through share repurchases during the year. \u2047 with approximately $35 million occurring in the fourth quarter. \u2047 To enable further repurchase activity in the future, our board approved a new share buyback program on October 13 that authorizes us to repurchase up to $200 million of our shares in the future. \u2047 This should be interpreted as a signal that we have confidence in our future, and we will continue to utilize our share repurchase program as another mechanism to return cash to our shareholders. \u2047 Before I conclude my remarks, I want to raise three items that will change our reporting beginning with the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022. \u2047 The first is that, as previously announced, our acquisition of Barletta Boat Company materially increases the scale of our marine platform. \u2047 Beginning next quarter, Q1 of fiscal 2022, Winnebago Industries' public reporting will include a new reporting segment, the Marine segment, comprised of Barletta and Chris-Craft. \u2047 Comparisons will be made to fiscal 2021, which will only include Chris-Craft results, and we will report the same key data points for the"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q4 earnings of $2.45 per share.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $2.57.  \u2047  q4 earnings per share $2.45.  \u2047  compname posts q4 adjusted earnings per share $2.57."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q4 adjusted earnings per share $2.45.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $2.45.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $2.45."]}
