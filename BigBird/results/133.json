{"article": ["I'm Patrick Burke, the company's head of investor relations. \u2047 Artie Starrs, Topgolf's CEO; William Davenport, Topgolf's CFO; and Jennifer Thomas, Callaway's chief accounting officer, are also in the room today for Q&A. \u2047 generally accepted accounting principles. \u2047 Results for the second quarter were nothing short of outstanding, and I'm extremely proud of our entire global team for the work they have put in to build this business to the powerhouse that it is today. \u2047 As you will hear throughout the call today, we are experiencing strong momentum across all of our business segments and are delivering exceptional operating results despite a challenging environment. \u2047 Revenue for the quarter was up 208% to $914 million and up over 112% to approximately $1.6 billion for the first half of 2021, both new records for our business. \u2047 Profitability also reached new highs, with adjusted EBITDA of $164 million for the quarter and $292 million for the first six months of the year. \u2047 While headwinds from COVID persist, we have strong conviction in both the long-term strategic position and impressive earnings growth prospects of this unique business. \u2047 Before shifting gears to talk specifically about each area of our business, I want to give a personal shout-out to our tour team who's having an exceptional year as well. \u2047 Congrats to Phil and John for their wins at the PGA Championship in the U.S. Open earlier this season; to Xander for his gold medal performance in Tokyo; and to Annika for her dominant victory at the U.S. Senior Women's Open. \u2047 What a summer for Callaway Golf's tour staff. \u2047 I can't tell you how excited I get seeing our players representing Callaway, along with our other brands, including TravisMathew and Topgolf, on the game's biggest stages. \u2047 From a business perspective, I'm confident this exposure is very good for our brands and will help us deliver long-term shareholder value. \u2047 Looking first at our golf equipment business. \u2047 Demand for clubs and balls remains very high as the sport continues to gain interest from both new entrants, which are driving continued unprecedented growth in package sets, junior clubs, and women's clubs, along with core golfers who are playing more than ever and showing strong enthusiasm for the game. \u2047 According to Golf Datatech, rounds played in June remained at an all-time high, and retail demand remains elevated. \u2047 Datatech's hardgoods sell-through in Q2 was up an impressive 40% versus 2019, and retail inventory levels remain extremely low, with only 2.2 months on hand at the end of June as industry supply chain strained to keep up with the last 12 months of unprecedented demand. \u2047 With more options for activities opened this spring and summer compared to last year, we were cautious that there could have been a potential slowdown in golf participation and/or demand. \u2047 However, thus far, we're pleased to report that we're not seeing this from our seat in the market. \u2047 We are also monitoring supply chain disruption due to the resurgence of the coronavirus Delta variant. \u2047 The resurgence has not had any negative demand implications yet, but it has caused further supply disruptions from factories based in and around Southeast Asia, primarily Vietnam. \u2047 The safety of the people working in these regions is top priority, and we're working with suppliers to make sure operating conditions are and remain as safe as possible. \u2047 Also, we have become accustomed to adapting to these circumstances over the last 18 months, and thus, we're able to shift some portion of our production to other less-impacted factories. \u2047 Still, given how lean inventories are already, the fact that nearly all our factories are running at 100% capacity, and that we'll need to shift production shortly toward next year's launches to protect that supply, these shutdowns will have an estimated $55 million negative impact on second-half revenues, primarily in our golf equipment segment and primarily in Q3. \u2047 Although disappointing, I view this disruption as a short-term issue, not one that will have a long-term impact on value for strategy. \u2047 On the positive side, and I recognize this is a glass-half-full view, we now believe field inventory levels will almost certainly stay lower than expected through this year, in many ways, a healthy market dynamic that bodes well for 2022. \u2047 All in all, we are very pleased with the strength of this category and our position in it. \u2047 We expect to deliver record performance for our golf equipment segment this year, and perhaps most importantly, we continue to believe the outlook for the golf equipment category is highly positive, with both a larger total market and a higher embedded growth rate. \u2047 Turning now to our apparel and soft goods segment. \u2047 The business put up another strong quarter, exceeding our expectations as retail locations reopened across the world and our brands remain top of mind for consumers. \u2047 This business strongly overperformed during the quarter and continues to see incredible growth as we move into the back half of the year. \u2047 To contextualize, year over year for the second quarter, we saw more than 30% comp store growth in our own retail stores versus 2019, the last period of unaffected by COVID as well as strong growth in sell-through at wholesale accounts and e-commerce. \u2047 Another fun fact is that we are not just seeing brand momentum in the target male audience buying for themselves, as approximately 30% of the direct-to-consumer sales that we track are her buying for him. \u2047 I'm no expert here, but when women are picking the brand for their men, I think it's a very good sign. \u2047 Jack Wolfskin was a strong performer as well this quarter. \u2047 The business has faced additional challenges given the longer COVID shutdowns in Europe than here in the U.S., but the team has worked through the issues brilliantly and is on track for a strong year. \u2047 As our owned stores in Europe reopened during the quarter, retail picked up nicely, almost reaching 2019 levels of revenue. \u2047 Most importantly, we experienced strong sell-through of the spring/summer 2021 line, as well as strong, prebooks for the spring/summer '22 line, two very important indicators for the health of the brand. \u2047 Our stores in China also continued to perform well as the brand maintains strong awareness and positioning within the outdoor apparel market there. \u2047 The team at Jack Wolfskin has done a fantastic job of revitalizing this business and putting us in a strong position to grow on the top and bottom line as COVID restrictions abate in the brand's key markets of Europe and China and as the brand grows and strengthen appeal. \u2047 Lastly, our Callaway-branded soft goods business showed strength as well, particularly in Japan, as popularity for the sport drove consumer spending. \u2047 Additionally, toward the end of the quarter, we took back the Korea apparel business, which was being licensed to a third party for several years. \u2047 Although that business is just starting up, we are very excited about the long-term opportunity it will provide to our soft goods segment, and the team did an excellent job managing this transition given the COVID travel restrictions and challenges. \u2047 With demand levels high across this business segment, we expect to enter 2022 with low retail inventory across all of our soft good brands. \u2047 In summary, we are fortunate to be in excellent categories and are on our path to deliver a good 2021 in this segment as well as future growth. \u2047 Now on to Topgolf. \u2047 Q2 marked the first full quarter of Callaway results with Topgolf included in our numbers, and they delivered beyond our expectations. \u2047 While COVID concerns remain a challenging variable for venue operations, the team put up outstanding numbers even as other options for consumers became available. \u2047 We continue to be invigorated by the momentum of this business brought to both Callaway's portfolio and to the game of golf. \u2047 Same venue sales percentage versus 2019 levels continued encouraging trend of recovery, with Q2 results in the low 90s, up substantially from the low 80s in Q1 of this year. \u2047 Results were driven by a mix of strong walk-in sales and continued recovery in the event business. \u2047 Looking forward, and this assumes no major restrictions from COVID upticks, we feel same venue sales for Q3 will be above Q2 results, while we expect Q4 sales to be slightly slower than Q2 due to the corporate events mixed in that quarter and that the full year should end at approximately 90%. \u2047 To put this in context, this is considerably above our expectations for the year and, we believe, a strong performance. \u2047 Domestic venue expansion continued as planned during the quarter, with four new venues opening. \u2047 Another venue, Holtsville, Long Island, opened recently, and yet another, Colorado Springs will open later this week. \u2047 We then expect to open one more venue in Q4 for a total of nine new domestic venues this year. \u2047 At the end of the year, we will have 67 domestic venues in operation across three owned UPA venues for a total of 70 owned venues in operation. \u2047 Internationally, our U.K. venues had an excellent quarter as they reopened strongly after COVID induced shutdowns in Q1, and our franchise international venue business continues to build capability and momentum despite various COVID challenges. \u2047 Overall, the venue business is very healthy, with profitability exceeding our expectations. \u2047 The Toptracer business had a successful quarter as well, with over 2,000 bays installed in Q2, setting a new record as we continue to see strong demand and excellent customer feedback. \u2047 While some challenges remain on the installation front due to COVID, we expect to meet or exceed our target of 8,000 new bays for the year. \u2047 One of the highlights for the quarter was the successful installation of Toptracer into what we believe is the world's largest driving range, Golf Club Daiju located outside Nagoya in Central Japan. \u2047 Lastly, Topgolf's unique position in the market as a gateway to golf is continuing to introduce new players in the sport, and we see excellent long-term potential through our preferential ability to market to these new entrants and drive synergies across a growing consumer base, both on and off course. \u2047 Looking ahead to the second half of the year and beyond, I remain excited about the opportunity ahead of us. \u2047 We operate in great categories with a unique portfolio of businesses that are all exceeding our expectations. \u2047 There are, of course, macroeconomic hurdles that we and many companies are facing, including supply chain constraints, freight costs, staffing challenges, and inflationary pressure, but at the demand level, we are experiencing and expect to experience in the foreseeable future we see these as manageable and expect to still deliver excellent financial results. \u2047 On the supply chain side, our guidance assumes an estimated $55 million negative impact to our top-line growth, primarily in Q3, to account for current disruptions. \u2047 On the inflationary side, we have already started taking some price and believe we'll largely have the ability to take price as needed. \u2047 Given the various moving parts for the remainder of the year, we are providing both third quarter and full-year guidance. \u2047 I'll let Brian discuss the numbers in more detail, but the headline is that we expect our full-year 2021 sales to be over $1.3 billion higher than 2019 and adjusted EBITDA to be between $134 million and $149 million higher than 2019. \u2047 Our EBITDA for 2021 will be very close to the number we guided to for 2022 when we provided longer-term guidance in the fall of last year. \u2047 We are essentially a year ahead of plan. \u2047 As Chip mentioned, we are very pleased with our second quarter and first-half results. \u2047 Each of our operating segments performed above our expectations, leading to record results despite a challenging operating environment. \u2047 There are some continuing challenges from the pandemic that will have effect on our business in the short term, including supply chain constraints, increased freight costs, staffing challenges, and inflationary pressures. \u2047 However, we believe that current demand levels, along with actions we can take, will mitigate the impact of these factors, and we expect to have strong financial results for the year and the foreseeable future. \u2047 We are energized by the opportunities ahead of us, and we believe we are well situated to handle the prolonged pandemic. \u2047 More specifically, each of our operating segments support an outdoor, active and healthy way of life that is compatible with the world of social distancing, and we have a strong liquidity position. \u2047 As of June 30, 2021, our available liquidity, which is comprised of cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities, was $877 million, compared to $483 million at June 30, 2020. \u2047 In evaluating our results for the second quarter and first half, you should keep in mind the following: First, our non-GAAP results exclude non-cash amortization expense of intangible assets acquired in acquisitions, including fair value adjustments to Topgolf's leases and debt; noncash depreciation expense from the fair value step-up of Topgolf assets; transaction and transition costs from the acquisitions; noncash amortization of the debt discount on the notes issued during the second quarter of 2020; the $174 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020 related to the Jack Wolfskin goodwill and trade name; a $253 million non-cash gain related to the write-up of our premerger Topgolf investment; a $33 million benefit in the second quarter of 2021 from the reversal of a portion of the noncash valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets and certain other nonrecurring items. \u2047 We have provided in the tables to this release a reconciliation detailing the impact of these items on second quarter and first-half GAAP results. \u2047 Second, this is a reminder that our first-half financial results include Topgolf for four months only as the merger was completed on March 8, 2021. \u2047 With those factors in mind, I will now discuss our financial results. \u2047 Looking at Slides 10 and 11. \u2047 Following record revenues in the first quarter, our revenues continued to be very strong in the second quarter of 2021, setting another record for the company. \u2047 The second-quarter 2021 revenues benefited from incremental revenue from the Topgolf merger, and second-quarter 2020 revenues were significantly impacted as much of the company's business in golf retail will shut down then due to the pandemic. \u2047 During the second quarter of 2021, sales in all product segments and in all major regions increased compared to both 2020 and 2019. \u2047 With that said, consolidated second quarter 2020 revenues were $914 million, compared to $297 million for the same period in 2020, an increase of $617 million or 208%. \u2047 This increase was led by a 98% increase in the golf equipment and soft goods businesses"], "gold_summary": ["q2 2021 consolidated net revenue increased $617 million (+208%) to $914
