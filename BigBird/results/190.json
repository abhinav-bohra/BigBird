{"article": ["We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website. \u2047 Excluding a special item with a net after-tax benefit of $32 million, we earned $450 million or $0.60 per diluted share. \u2047 In the third quarter, we delivered strong results across each of our businesses despite weather-related disruptions, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and continued supply chain challenges. \u2047 Our teams did an exceptional job navigating these headwinds, and I'm incredibly proud of their collective efforts and focus on safely operating our businesses and continuing to serve our customers. \u2047 Truly, great execution across the entire supply chain in a difficult environment, which has resulted in record earnings and cash flow in 2021. \u2047 Year-to-date, we've generated more than $3.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $2.4 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution. \u2047 Turning now to our third quarter business results. \u2047 I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on pages six through nine of our earnings slides. \u2047 Timberlands earnings increased by $20 million in the quarter, which included a $32 million gain on the previously announced sale of our North Cascades Timberlands. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15 million compared to the second quarter. \u2047 In the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13 million compared to the second quarter. \u2047 Western domestic log markets started the quarter in a favorable position despite weakening lumber prices and ample log supply. \u2047 Demand remains elevated as mills continue to bolster log inventories during the peak of wildfire season, but weakened somewhat in September as a number of producers experienced COVID-related disruptions and finished lumber inventories increased above normal levels. \u2047 Despite these headwinds, our third quarter domestic sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter, driven by strong domestic log prices in July and August. \u2047 Salvage operations resulting from the 2020 Oregon wildfires continued in the third quarter. \u2047 The teams have done an outstanding job in managing these salvage efforts over the last year. \u2047 To date, we've completed approximately 80% of our planned salvage harvest and expect to conclude most of this work by year-end. \u2047 As expected, during the warmer and drier months in the summer, we transitioned to higher elevation and higher cost operations. \u2047 Additionally, although we experienced very minimal wildfire damage to our timberlands, active fires and dry conditions across the region resulted in restrictions on our harvest activity in the quarter, particularly in Oregon. \u2047 As a result, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were modestly lower in the third quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were higher. \u2047 Turning to our export markets. \u2047 In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the third quarter. \u2047 Lumber imports from Europe into Japan continue to be restricted by the ongoing shortage of global shipping containers. \u2047 This dynamic is driving increased market share for our customers and robust demand for our logs. \u2047 As a result, our Japanese log sales realizations increased moderately compared to the second quarter, and sales volumes were comparable. \u2047 In China, demand for our logs remained favorable in the quarter despite seasonally lower consumption, COVID impacts to construction activity and other supply chain disruptions. \u2047 Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be constrained by global shipping container availability as well as the ban on Australian logs. \u2047 As a result, sales realizations for our China export logs increased moderately compared to the second quarter, but were more than offset by higher ocean freight rates. \u2047 Sales volumes to China were comparable to the second quarter. \u2047 Moving to the South. \u2047 Southern timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter. \u2047 Southern sawlog and fiber markets continued to strengthen as log supply was constrained and mill inventories remain lean, resulting from ongoing wet conditions and significant weather events. \u2047 As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the second quarter. \u2047 Fee harvest and sales volumes increased slightly in the third quarter, but fell below our planned activity level as a result of persistent wet weather and operational disruptions from Hurricane Ida. \u2047 Per unit log and haul costs increased slightly in the quarter as did forestry and road costs. \u2047 On the export side, we continue to see growing demand for our Southern logs. \u2047 Our export log pricing increased substantially in the third quarter, but volumes were lower than second quarter as we continue to face challenges associated with container availability and increased freight rates. \u2047 In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the second quarter. \u2047 Sales volumes were significantly higher coming out of spring breakup conditions, though sales realizations were lower due to mix. \u2047 Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on pages 10 and 11. \u2047 Real estate and ENR contributed $45 million to third quarter earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $31 million lower than the second quarter due to timing of transactions, but comparable to the year ago quarter. \u2047 Similar to last year, our 2021 real estate sales activity has been heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. \u2047 Third quarter earnings more than doubled compared to the third quarter of 2020 due to the mix of properties sold. \u2047 We continue to capitalize on strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. \u2047 Moving to Wood Products, pages 12 through 14. \u2047 Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 60% compared to the prior quarter as lumber and OSB pricing declined substantially from record levels earlier in the year before stabilizing later in the quarter. \u2047 Additionally, weather events in the U.S. South, including Hurricane Ida, resulted in temporary downtime and lost production in our lumber business. \u2047 And together with COVID-related staffing disruptions, further exacerbated transportation challenges in the region. \u2047 Despite these headwinds, our teams performed well and delivered strong results. \u2047 Our EWP business established a new quarterly EBITDA record in the third quarter and the overall Wood Products segment has achieved year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of more than $2.8 billion. \u2047 Lumber markets began the third quarter with elevated home center and treater inventory levels due to softening do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity. \u2047 As a result, pricing continued its downward trajectory in July and for much of August. \u2047 The market began to strengthen later in the quarter as home centers and treaters work through excess inventories and consumer spending shifted back to do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity after Labor Day. \u2047 When combined with solid demand from new home construction and professional repair and remodel activity, each of which remain healthy throughout the third quarter. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased $686 million compared to the second quarter. \u2047 Our sales realizations decreased by 52% in the third quarter while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 61%. \u2047 Our sales volumes increased moderately in the third quarter and log costs increased slightly, primarily for Canadian logs. \u2047 The OSB market weakened significantly at the outset of the third quarter with the softening of do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity. \u2047 This dynamic drove lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers. \u2047 As a result, we experienced a rapid decline in pricing from the peak record prices that we reached in July. \u2047 Pricing then stabilized above the historical average in August, as demand from strong new home construction activity continued and the market faced supply constraints resulting from ongoing resin availability and transportation challenges. \u2047 This dynamic, along with late quarter improvement in do-it-yourself repair and remodel demand, drove prices gradually higher through September. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $128 million compared to the second quarter. \u2047 Our sales realizations decreased by 24% in the third quarter while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 43%. \u2047 This relative outperformance was largely a result of our higher percentage of premium OSB products. \u2047 Our sales and production volumes improved modestly in the third quarter due to less downtime for planned maintenance. \u2047 Unit manufacturing costs increased slightly, primarily for resin costs. \u2047 Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million compared to the second quarter, a 43% improvement. \u2047 Sales realizations improved significantly across most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joist products. \u2047 This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for OSB webstock, resin and veneer. \u2047 Sales and production volumes were moderately lower for most products as a result of planned annual maintenance during the quarter. \u2047 In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $53 million compared to the second quarter. \u2047 Despite lower sales volumes for most products and significantly lower margins resulting from the commodity price correction, our teams did a great job navigating these challenges and delivered $22 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. \u2047 I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on page 16. \u2047 We generated $659 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly $2.7 billion, our highest year-to-date operating cash flows on record. \u2047 Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD, for year-to-date, third quarter 2021 totaled over $2.4 billion, as highlighted on page 17. \u2047 Year-to-date, we have returned $382 million to our shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, and we will supplement the base dividend each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. \u2047 For this year, we intend to achieve this entirely through a variable supplemental cash dividend. \u2047 Though in future years, we may also utilize opportunistic share repurchase for a portion of this cash return. \u2047 The supplemental dividend will normally be paid in the first quarter of each year based on prior year cash flow. \u2047 However, as a result of the record year-to-date performance, we accelerated a portion of the supplemental dividend by returning $375 million to our shareholders through our previously announced $0.50 per share interim supplemental dividend earlier this month. \u2047 We look forward to returning the remaining portion of the supplemental dividend with a significant payment in first quarter 2022. \u2047 During the third quarter, we also returned $26 million to shareholders through share repurchases. \u2047 Further, as previously announced, we authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. \u2047 And as always, we'll look to repurchase shares opportunistically under circumstances when we believe it will create shareholder value. \u2047 Turning to the balance sheet. \u2047 We ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. \u2047 Subsequent to quarter end, we repaid our $150 million or 9% note at maturity, which brings our debt balance to $5.1 billion. \u2047 After this repayment, we have no additional maturities until 2023. \u2047 Looking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on page 18. \u2047 In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter. \u2047 Turning to our Western Timberland operations, although domestic log inventories ended the third quarter higher than normal, takeaway of finished lumber and log demand have improved following a brief pullback in September. \u2047 We anticipate this dynamic continuing for most of the fourth quarter. \u2047 As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to improve from the lower levels experienced in September. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, we anticipate our average domestic sales realizations to be moderately lower than the elevated third quarter levels. \u2047 As Devin discussed, we have made great progress within our salvage operations in Oregon and expect our salvage volumes to decrease in the fourth quarter. \u2047 As a result, we expect fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher with lower per unit log and haul costs. \u2047 Moving to the export markets. \u2047 In Japan, log demand remains favorable. \u2047 We anticipate our fourth quarter sales realizations to be comparable to the elevated third quarter levels, partially offset by moderately lower sales volumes due to the timing of vessels. \u2047 In China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable as construction activity increases seasonally and imports of lumber and logs continue to be constrained from other countries. \u2047 We expect our fourth quarter sales volumes to be higher than the third quarter, partially offset by slightly lower sales realizations. \u2047 Elevated freight costs and labor to load ships continue to be headwinds. \u2047 In the South, weather conditions improved at the outset of the fourth quarter. \u2047 As a result, we anticipate slightly higher fee harvest volumes compared to the third quarter. \u2047 Log demand continues to be favorable as mills work to bolster lean inventories, resulting from persistent wet conditions and reduced log supply. \u2047 As a result, we anticipate slightly higher sales realizations during the fourth quarter. \u2047 We expect this will be offset by slightly higher per unit log and haul costs as well as a moderately higher forestry and road costs as a portion of our planned activities in the third quarter were deferred due to weather disruptions. \u2047 As a result of persistent wet conditions in 2021 and significant weather events in the third quarter, we now expect full year Southern fee harvest volumes to be comparable to 2020. \u2047 In the North, sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower due to mix and fee harvest volumes are also expected to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter. \u2047 Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. \u2047 Fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than third quarter due to timing of transactions. \u2047 We continue to predict full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $290 million, and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 25% to 30% for the full year. \u2047 For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity remains strong and demand from the repair and remodel segment continues to strengthen following the improvement in do-it-yourself activity in September. \u2047 This dynamic should continue for most of the quarter before weakening seasonally into winter. \u2047 Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the third quarter. \u2047 For lumber, production volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. \u2047 However, our sales volumes are expected to be modestly lower, resulting from the inventory drawdown we experienced in the third quarter. \u2047 We anticipate this will be offset by slightly lower log costs and improved unit manufacturing costs. \u2047 As shown on page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for lumber are slightly higher than the third quarter average. \u2047 For oriented strand board, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes and improved unit manufacturing costs, primarily due to less downtime for"], "gold_summary": ["q3 sales $2.3 billion.  \u2047  q3 earnings per
