{"article": ["We appreciate you participating in our conference call today to discuss Flowserve's 2020 third quarter financial results. \u2047 These statements are based on forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of November 6, 2020, and they involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company's control. \u2047 We are pleased with how Flowserve is responding to the dramatic and unprecedented change in 2020. \u2047 COVID-19 continues to impact our lives on a global scale, which is impacting Flowserve's end markets and changing the way we run our Company on a day-to-day basis. \u2047 Considering the current environment, I truly appreciate the dedication and commitment demonstrated by Flowserve's leaders and associates, and especially those in the frontline working at our manufacturing facilities and QRCs who continue to fully support our customers each and every day. \u2047 While we have had associates directly impacted by COVID, our strict adherence to the operating policies and procedures we implemented earlier in the year prevented any Flowserve to Flowserve transmission from occurring in our facilities during the quarter. \u2047 We are pleased with this outcome, and we remain committed to the safety of our associates. \u2047 Despite our best efforts in investment to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers, COVID continues to cause sporadic disruptions within our facilities. \u2047 In the third quarter, our Indian and Mexican operations were the most challenged regions, where we have several large manufacturing facilities. \u2047 However, today, all of our locations are operational and providing support to our customers. \u2047 The recent rise in COVID-related cases in Europe and the United States is concerning. \u2047 We're doing everything possible to keep these facilities open and operational throughout the fourth quarter and beyond, and we believe our system and processes will continue to keep our associates safe and productive. \u2047 Before Amy covers our financials in detail, I would like to address our results at a high level. \u2047 Overall, we are pleased with our execution during the quarter. \u2047 Flowserve delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.50, in line with our expectations. \u2047 These solid earnings also reflect the significant cost actions we have implemented this year. \u2047 In the quarter, adjusted SG&A decreased $30.8 million year-over-year to $193 million. \u2047 We continue to track ahead of our $100 million cost-out program for full-year 2020, compared to last year's cost structure. \u2047 As we communicated previously, these savings are about half from discretionary measures and half from structural actions we have taken. \u2047 In addition to the SG&A savings, we are working hard to reduce our product cost through supply chain savings and to maintain higher levels of productivity in our manufacturing locations. \u2047 Our Flowserve 2.0 Transformation program continued to deliver solid operational execution, limiting the decline in our adjusted operating margin to 60 basis points on a $71.4 million revenue decrease versus third quarter 2019, resulting in decremental margins of 19.5% in the quarter. \u2047 We are confident, as additional Flowserve 2.0 process improvement initiatives are implemented within the organization, we will capture more margin enhancement opportunities through further cost actions, manufacturing productivity and product cost reductions. \u2047 Let me now turn to our segment level performance in the third quarter. \u2047 FPD's bookings decreased 22.6%, while sales decreased 1.8% as we executed on its strong backlog. \u2047 The bookings decline was driven by original equipment down 37%, while aftermarket bookings were more resilient at a decline of 12%. \u2047 Oil and gas bookings were down 45% year-over-year, primarily due to a nearly $60 million decline in project awards. \u2047 FPD's adjusted margins were in line with expectations, including the 110 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin to 14.1%. \u2047 Despite the modest revenue decline, adjusted operating income increased approximately 6.8% to $94.5 million, demonstrating solid operating performance, which more than offset the headwind of a 400 basis point mix shift toward original equipment. \u2047 Aggressive cost actions drove a $22 million decrease in adjusted SG&A and a 280 basis point decrease in adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales to 18.7%. \u2047 FCD's bookings and sales were down 16% and 18.7%, respectively. \u2047 Oil and gas, power and general industries were both primary drivers or were the primary drivers, down 30%, 20% and 12%, respectively. \u2047 Additionally, within general industries, the North American distribution channel continues to be challenged as spending has been impacted by COVID and commodity price declines. \u2047 FCD's adjusted gross and operating margins were 30.3% and 12.2%, respectively. \u2047 While these are not the results we typically expect from the business, I am confident that our focus on execution, cost reduction, backlog conversion and inventory reduction will drive fourth quarter margins above their second and third quarter levels. \u2047 Turning now to bookings. \u2047 As expected, our third quarter bookings of $806 million was generally in line with second quarter levels and represented a 21% decline year-over-year. \u2047 As you may recall, last year's third quarter included strong oil and gas project activity in the Middle East and Asia Pacific, as well as the number of smaller projects awards, which together totaled roughly $140 million. \u2047 By contrast, the largest award we received in the 2020 third quarter was $12 million and when combined with our other small- to medium-sized project awards, the sum represented less than $60 million of project awards. \u2047 On a positive note, we didn't have any material cancellations in backlog in the quarter. \u2047 Third quarter aftermarket activity remained relatively stable with bookings up $424 million, down 32.5%, modestly better -- modestly below our expectations. \u2047 While customers continued to spend to meet safety and regulatory requirements, upgrade and productivity investment remained muted and larger-scale turnaround and maintenance activity continued to face COVID-related headwinds with limitations due to site access. \u2047 Original equipment bookings in the quarter were $381 million, down 28% versus prior year and up about 4% sequentially. \u2047 Large projects, which typically accounts for 10% to 15% of our business, remain the most challenged. \u2047 The majority of these projects have been delayed and are currently being reevaluated. \u2047 Our customers' project spending decisions will largely depend on the status of the COVID environment. \u2047 The bookings level over the last two quarters accurately represents the current market environment, and we expect bookings in the fourth quarter, and likely the first quarter of 2021, to be similar to this year's second and third quarter. \u2047 Given what we know today, I am increasingly optimistic that we'd begin return to bookings growth next year, as the world moves beyond the COVID crisis. \u2047 We should see it first in our aftermarket bookings ahead of an inflection in project bookings, but we expect both to be better in the back half of 2021. \u2047 On the aftermarket side, we feel there is pent-up demand building for parts and services and expect that growth in this area to incur earlier than the project business. \u2047 We are beginning to see signs of increased aftermarket spending in 2021 as operators are planning for maintenance and turnaround events. \u2047 Let me now address our served end markets. \u2047 Our oil and gas markets continue to be the most impacted due to the COVID-related declines in energy demand. \u2047 Third quarter bookings declined 42% year-over-year and were roughly flat sequentially. \u2047 Last year's third quarter presented a challenging compare figure due to the strong project environment at that time, which included several larger awards related to IMO 2020 upgrade activity. \u2047 2019 third quarter included over $90 million of project awards. \u2047 This quarter, our largest project award in oil and gas was just $12 million. \u2047 Third quarter chemical bookings were down 21.6% in the quarter, primarily driven by FPD's 31% decline, while FCD's bookings were down only 5%. \u2047 The quarter included one small award of $4 million in Asia Pacific. \u2047 Our integrated customers continued to delay petrochemical investment while specialty chemical demand presents growing opportunities. \u2047 While the power market continues to be challenged, it has not declined as much as oil and gas or the chemical markets. \u2047 Third quarter and year-to-date bookings are down just 7.5% and 9.2%, respectively. \u2047 The quarter includes a few small nuclear awards totaling $9 million and a $4 million fossil fuel award in Asia. \u2047 The general industries market, which includes a significant level of distribution and was our most challenging market in 2019, continued to show signs of recovery in the third quarter with bookings up 18.6% and up 5.9% year-to-date. \u2047 FPD's 31% increase was partially offset by FCD's 11.5% decline, driven by the continued MRO slowdown in North America. \u2047 FPD's growth was driven by distribution in food and beverage growth. \u2047 Finally, representing our smallest market, water bookings decreased $41 million or 66%. \u2047 Last year's third quarter was particularly strong, including over $20 million in awards for a large Middle East desalination project. \u2047 While the 2020 third quarter included only one project award of $6 million in North America, we continue to expect investment opportunities from desalination, flood control and municipal water markets. \u2047 Regionally, our largest dollar decline was in North America, which has seen a significant impact from COVID as well as the related downturn in energy demand. \u2047 Only Latin America has delivered constant-currency bookings growth in 2020, up 6% and 9% in the third quarter and year-to-date, respectively. \u2047 We incurred double-digit year-over-year bookings declines in all other regions. \u2047 We're seeing the most potential in the Asian markets, as mobility has returned to near-normal levels, demand for processing-based product has recovered and infrastructure spending continues. \u2047 With limited and highly competitive project opportunities, we continue to focus on improving our position for winning available work, driving our cost structure lower to offset pricing pressure and maintaining a quality backlog to increase our installed base and create aftermarket opportunities. \u2047 We believe our markets have stabilized and expect fourth quarter bookings to be in line with what we saw in the second and third quarters of this year. \u2047 Looking at Flowserve's third quarter financial results in greater detail, our reported earnings per share of $0.39 included realignment and transformation expenses, as well as below the line FX charges totaling $0.11. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 was solid, considering we continued to experience ongoing COVID-related headwinds. \u2047 Third quarter revenues of $924 million were flat sequentially and down 7.2% versus the prior year. \u2047 FPD's revenue declined 1.8% on reduced aftermarket activity, which more than offset strong original equipment sales growth of 10% through backlog execution. \u2047 Consolidated OE revenues of $479 million were down 5.6%, where FCD's 21% year-over-year decrease more than offset FPD strength. \u2047 Aftermarket revenue of $445 million was down 8.8%, with both segments down in that general range. \u2047 In addition to limitations accessing our customer sites, many of the planned refinery and chemical plant turnarounds that were expected for this fall were further delayed and the active Gulf Coast hurricane season also caused temporary closures and disruptions at several of our QRCs, as well as our customers' facilities. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 230 basis points to 31.5%, including declines of 180 basis points and 240 basis points at FPD and FCD, respectively. \u2047 In addition to the previously mentioned cost increases related to COVID and the associated disruption with our sites, margins were also negatively impacted by a 100 basis point mix shift toward original equipment revenues as a percentage of our total sales, driven by FPD's 400 basis point mix shift. \u2047 On a reported basis, Flowserve's third quarter gross margins decreased 250 basis points to 30.9%, again due to COVID disruptions and mix headwinds, and a $2 million increase in realignment expenses versus last year's third quarter. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted SG&A decreased $30.8 million or 13.8%, demonstrating our cost control and the aggressive cost actions we took in the first half of the year. \u2047 These measures brought our $193 million of adjusted SG&A down 160 basis points as a percentage of sales to 20.9% versus prior year, which was flat sequentially. \u2047 On a reported basis, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 140 basis points, primarily due to the cost actions we implemented considering our adjusted items were relatively flat with prior year. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points versus last year's 10.9%. \u2047 With third quarter adjusted operating income of $100.6 million and a $71.4 million year-over-year revenue decline, it represents an adjusted decremental margin of approximately 19.5%. \u2047 FPD's solid operating performance delivered adjusted operating income growth at the segment level, even as its revenues declined modestly. \u2047 As a result, FPD drove 110 basis points increase in its adjusted operating margin to 14.1%. \u2047 FCD's adjusted operating margin of 12.2% was below our expectations, driven by a higher mix of lower margin project work. \u2047 With clear visibility and line of sight, we fully expect FCD's margins to return to around the mid-teen levels in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Reported third quarter operating margin decreased 110 basis points to 9.4%, driven primarily by a loss of leverage on lower revenues and included the benefit of modestly lower adjusted items. \u2047 Turning to cash flow and liquidity. \u2047 As many of you know, Flowserve's results are traditionally seasonal and most of our full-year cash flow is delivered in the second half of the year, especially in the fourth quarter. \u2047 While our cash flow statement will be published in a few days with our 10-Q, I can say we feel good -- we feel very good about our cash generation during the quarter. \u2047 Based on our operating cash flow of $70 million to $75 million and quarterly capex spending, free cash flow for the quarter will be about $57 million. \u2047 This performance as well as the $300 million of net proceeds after our note issuance and tender offer, brought Flowserve's cash and cash equivalents balance at September 30 to over $921 million. \u2047 Even absent the net proceeds of the bond issuance, Flowserve increased its cash position $59 million in the quarter. \u2047 In future periods, we intend to use some of this excess cash to retire outstanding debt, considering we have maturities in 2022 and 2023. \u2047 However, primary working capital as a percent of sales grew to 30%, as inventory, including contract assets and liabilities, increased roughly $100"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports third quarter earnings per share $0.39.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.50.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $0.39.
