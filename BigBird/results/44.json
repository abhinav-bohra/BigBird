{"article": ["We will reference this information during today's call. \u2047 Today's earnings call will begin with Ward Nye, whose remarks will focus on the state of our business in light of the Coronavirus pandemic, the actions we have and are taking and the strength of our positioning to manage the current environment. \u2047 Jim Nickolas will then review our first quarter 2020 financial results and liquidity position, and then Ward will provide some closing comments. \u2047 A question-and-answer session will follow Ward's closing remarks. \u2047 First and foremost, we hope that you and your families are and remain safe and healthy as we confront the challenges and uncertainties presented by COVID-19. \u2047 I also want to extend my sincere gratitude to our Martin Marietta team. \u2047 I'm tremendously proud of how everyone is working together to manage through this unprecedented time and how the character of our employees has shown through. \u2047 Day after day, Martin Marietta employees are safely and resolutely meeting the critical needs of our customers. \u2047 They're also supporting their local communities in both large and small ways donating vital supplies and equipment to healthcare workers and first responders, helping neighbors by picking up groceries and ensuring our colleagues are well cared for and safe. \u2047 Our team has shown great courage, determination and resilience as we successfully meet our stakeholders' needs while never losing sight of our core values of safety, integrity, excellence, community and stewardship. \u2047 These values define us and our character. \u2047 We look at these foundational principles to guide our daily and long-term actions and decisions, particularly during difficult times. \u2047 Martin Marietta remains open as an essential business. \u2047 That designation means we're continuing to provide heavy building materials and services to our customers even in those areas with shelter-in-place orders. \u2047 Communities across the nation must maintain their vital infrastructure and we're working hard to support that objective in a safe, efficient and responsible way. \u2047 Through the end of April, our workforce, operations and supply chains have seen little disruption. \u2047 We believe this is largely due to our company's decisive steps early to respond quickly to this pandemic, our domestic focused approach to sourcing supplies and materials and our expanded safety procedures, all of which are designed to protect Martin Marietta employees and the organizational health of the company. \u2047 During this pivotal time, our focus is threefold: communication, resource management and business continuity. \u2047 We've implemented new robust protocols and practices, including remote working, social distancing and enhanced equipment and facility cleaning, consistent with guidelines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the medical professionals who partner with the industrial hygienist familiar with our operations. \u2047 These protocols were updated on an ongoing basis as public experts provide additional guidance. \u2047 We also established a COVID-19 Planning and Communications task force, canceled all nonessential business travel and in-person meetings and established contingency plans with respect to staffing, and we've been actively engaged enterprisewide to enhance the substance and frequency of our communications to ensure the flow of the most accurate and timely information about our operations, thus enabling our employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to stay fully informed. \u2047 Our operations teams have shown considerable agility, flexibility and perseverance while keeping our business running smoothly. \u2047 Among other things, they've taken timely and responsible steps to clean and disinfect their facilities, while carefully screening necessary third-party visitors to minimize any COVID-19 exposure. \u2047 Additionally, for our colleagues that typically work in doors in close proximity to one another, we're utilizing a combination of social distancing as well as work-from-home protocols. \u2047 Our employees are dutifully meeting their job responsibilities and remaining fully accessible. \u2047 Importantly, whether working at an operating site, an office or remotely, our employees are empowered and encouraged to look out for one another. \u2047 With our team's safe and employee engagement high, we can be attentive to our other stakeholders, our customers, suppliers, creditors, shareholders and communities as we have an essential business to run. \u2047 Jim will discuss these results with you shortly. \u2047 Let me first say that we're proud of these results, which underscore our commitment to operational excellence and to our disciplined strategies. \u2047 While we had a promising start of what we believe would have been a record-setting 2020, we recognize this year will now be filled with an unprecedented level of uncertainty as the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic and societal outcomes continue to unfold. \u2047 Accordingly, while we remain confident in the fundamental strength and underlying drivers of our business, we have withdrawn our 2020 full year guidance issued back in February. \u2047 We've not yet seen contractors and customers delaying or canceling building projects in a material way. \u2047 While we typically do not comment on intra-quarter trends, these are atypical times. \u2047 We're making an exception and as highlighted on our supplemental information slides 13 and 14, we are sharing preliminary April shipment and pricing trends to provide greater transparency as to what we're now seeing in a COVID-19-impacted month. \u2047 Specifically, for the month of April, aggregate shipments remained elevated in most areas but did not match the near-record April 2019 volumes. \u2047 We saw notable growth in North Texas, Colorado and Indiana. \u2047 Cement shipments continue to be strong and are currently trending close to prior year levels. \u2047 The one notable exception is oil well cement shipments as demand continues to decline due to volatile and historically low oil prices. \u2047 Ready mixed concrete shipments are also trending near April 2019 levels, even as some homebuilders temporarily pause construction activity. \u2047 April revenues for the Magnesia Specialties business are $10 million lower than the comparable prior year period. \u2047 Demand for our lime and periclase products has slowed dramatically as steel-producing customers temporarily idled their facilities in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown of certain domestic auto manufacturers beginning in mid-March. \u2047 In terms of April pricing trends, aggregates pricing improved mid-single digits over April 2019 as announced increases were broadly implemented earlier in the year. \u2047 Cement pricing is up, even with several competitors announcing plans to delay price increases until June 1. \u2047 Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we were highly confident in realizing the full announced increase of $8 per ton implemented April 1, given overwhelming market support in a tight Texas cement environment. \u2047 Ready mixed concrete pricing is slightly higher than April 2019 levels. \u2047 We'll have a clearer picture of ready mixed concrete pricing trends for the remainder of the year as the phased reopening of the Texas and Colorado economies unfold. \u2047 Though ours is a basic and durable industry, it does not mean that we're immune to the disruptions caused by the pandemic. \u2047 Our economy is interconnected and dislocations in consumer behavior or other industries may impact Martin Marietta. \u2047 As such, looking beyond April, we anticipate product demand will soften in the coming months, with the private sector feeling the effects sooner than the public sector. \u2047 The timing, duration and extent of weaker demand levels are presently unknown. \u2047 Infrastructure, particularly for aggregates-intensive highways and streets, is expected to be the most resilient of the company's three primary end uses in the near term. \u2047 The vast majority of state departments of transportation are operational and continue to advertise and award projects. \u2047 Nonetheless, we expect many state DOT budgets will face temporary headwinds from lower fuel taxes, tolls, user fees and other related revenue collections as much of the nation has been sheltered in place. \u2047 The impact of lower funding levels is expected to become more meaningful in the second half of 2020, absent congressional action and will vary considerably among the states. \u2047 Florida DOT, for example, has accelerated over $2 billion of critical transportation projects to leverage construction efficiencies resulting from lower vehicle traffic, including closing additional travel lanes and performing more daytime hours work. \u2047 To help mitigate state DOT funding risks, industry representatives are actively engaging with Congress to address surface transportation in the Phase four emergency relief and economic recovery COVID-19 legislation. \u2047 The first recommendation is the federal backstop of nearly $50 billion in immediate flexible funding to offset the estimated 30% loss in state transportation revenues over the next 18 months. \u2047 The second recommendation is the passage of a comprehensive major surface transportation reauthorization package. \u2047 We believe our industry is better equipped than in recent history to execute on an infrastructure build given the backlog of fully designed projects. \u2047 Nonresidential construction activity on existing projects has broadly continued in most regions. \u2047 However, many commercial projects and the engineering or planning stages are being delayed or canceled, particularly for office, retail and hospitality. \u2047 Some industrial activity, on the other hand, is not expected to experience significant near-term disruption from COVID-19, warehouses, distribution centers and data centers are expected to perform relatively well in the current environment, as businesses increase e-commerce activity, secure regional supply chains and become more reliant on cloud and network services. \u2047 Similarly, large energy sector projects along the Gulf Coast of Texas that are already under way are expected to continue. \u2047 The residential market is expected to experience the most rapid and perhaps steepest decline from the impacts of COVID-19 as unemployment and general economic instability of home buyers and home developers to delay plans. \u2047 However, in contrast to the Great Recession, we do not anticipate a prolonged period of reduced residential activity. \u2047 Today's housing inventories remain near all-time lows despite notable population gains in Martin Marietta states and to benefit from historically low interest rates. \u2047 As we prepare for the secondary effects of the economic fallout from the Coronavirus, we rely on our values-driven culture. \u2047 As I emphasized earlier, the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders remains our top priority. \u2047 With established protections in place to accomplish this, we're focused on our business priorities of generating cash flow, preserving liquidity and adjusting costs to align with product demand. \u2047 Our team has developed extensive plans for a variety of economic scenarios, and we're ready to implement them with immediacy and integrity as warranted. \u2047 In addition to strengthening our balance sheet through a timely $500 million bond offering in early March, we've cut nonessential costs, reduced capital spending for discretionary projects and implemented hiring restrictions. \u2047 We're tightening our belts and aligning our capacity with demand consistent with our commitment to being prudent stewards of shareholders' capital. \u2047 We will reevaluate these actions as visibility improves. \u2047 Having the right strategy, making the right decisions at the right time, and being able to safely execute them does matter a lot. \u2047 And Martin Marietta will do just that. \u2047 We're well positioned geographically, financially and otherwise to successfully manage through today's unprecedented environment and emerge more resilient and capable. \u2047 First, Martin Marietta has a much stronger geographic and competitive position today compared with any previous downturn in our more than 25 years as a public company. \u2047 This is noteworthy, considering we navigated through the Great Recession and remain profitable throughout, never suspended or cut a dividend and emerged with a healthy balance sheet. \u2047 Today, we continue to generate record profitability on aggregate shipment levels much lower than our peak volumes in 2005, and with a geographic footprint that we've not only considerably expanded but also improved. \u2047 Moreover, we continue to thoughtfully execute on our strategic plans, carefully positioning our business through aggregates-led expansion in high-growth markets with attractive fundamentals and leveraging strategic cement and targeted downstream opportunities. \u2047 These strategic plans not only provide Martin Marietta with new growth platforms, but also opportunities to expand our footprint to complement existing operations and build critical mass. \u2047 We now have leading positions in 90% of our markets, up from 65% a decade ago, which supports favorable pricing trends, economies of scale and cost flexibility. \u2047 Second, we have experienced teams with decades of collective industry knowledge and expertise. \u2047 Together, their leadership and contributions have produced strong and sustained financial returns for Martin Marietta and our shareholders as recently demonstrated by our one, five and 10-year cumulative shareholder return performance. \u2047 This is largely the same leadership team that successfully formulated our operational response and prudently addressed our business needs during the Great Recession, the most challenging economic environment our industry ever experienced. \u2047 In uncertain evolving times, proven cycle tested leadership and experience is critical. \u2047 In brief, Martin Marietta has the right strategies, priorities, experience and teams to responsibly manage us through these challenging times. \u2047 I will briefly highlight our first quarter results as well as provide a summary of our financial and liquidity positions, both of which support our near- and long-term strategies. \u2047 As detailed in today's release, our first quarter financial and operational performance exceeded our expectations, particularly considering the record-setting prior year quarter that benefited from carryover work from an extraordinarily wet 2018. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, total revenues increased 2% to $958 million, a first quarter record. \u2047 Gross profit was relatively flat. \u2047 Selling, general and administrative expenses improved 10 basis points as a percent of total revenues. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share was $0.41 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, decreased 6% to $149 million. \u2047 The Building Materials business achieved record first quarter revenues. \u2047 Across our geographic footprint, product demand trends remain strong, even in the Texas and North Georgia markets that experienced record or near-record precipitation levels. \u2047 Aggregates, cement and ready mixed concrete pricing also improved, with all divisions contributing to the solid growth, a testament to the strength of our markets, and the disciplined execution of our locally driven pricing strategy. \u2047 Building Materials gross profit improved slightly. \u2047 Key takeaways include the following: aggregates product gross profit decreased $5 million, largely due to our quarterly update of inventory standard costs. \u2047 Our per ton production costs have been trending downward over the last 12 months as cost control measures and operating efficiencies have their desired effect. \u2047 All else equal, this would result in higher operating margins going forward. \u2047 But in this quarter, it also resulted in a $4 million expense as we reflected the lower cost in our updated inventory valuation. \u2047 In contrast, during the first quarter of 2019, we recorded an $11 million inventory valuation adjustment to reflect the higher production costs experienced during the weather-impacted year in 2018. \u2047 While this cumulative $15 million year-over-year inventory standard variance reduced quarterly product gross margin by 260 basis points, lower unit production costs will provide future benefits. \u2047 Cement product gross margin expanded 1,170 basis points driven by improved cost absorption from higher production levels as well as increased shipments to the San Antonio, Austin and Houston markets. \u2047 Pricing gains, combined with lower maintenance and energy expenses also contributed to the improved margin. \u2047 Gross profit for the ready mixed concrete business declined $9 million. \u2047 Pricing improvements and double-digit shipment growth in Colorado were more than offset by lower Texas volumes from record rainfall, delaying projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area as well as increased raw material costs. \u2047 For the Magnesia Specialties business,"], "gold_summary": ["martin marietta withdraws 2020 outlook in light of
