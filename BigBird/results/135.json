{"article": ["As we all know COVID-19 pandemic as lasted in some of the most difficult times for so many people around the globe, and we continue to pray for all those affected. \u2047 I'd like to share my appreciation for our employees and sales force in Japan and the United States for their tireless work in helping our policyholders and communities impacted by the pandemic. \u2047 During this difficult time, it's important to note, that we remain focused on doing what we do best, that is providing protection products to help consumers when they need it most. \u2047 Financially, backlog continues to be impacted by the pandemic, but remain strong in terms of capital and liquidity. \u2047 In addition, our investments are high-quality diversified and they are among the highest return on capital and lowest cost of capital in the industry. \u2047 Amid the challenges of COVID-19, this quarter was also significantly impacted by the release of favorable US tax regulations related to the utilization of foreign tax credits. \u2047 You'll recall that our Japanese subsidiary is taxed as a US domestic company for US tax purposes. \u2047 In the quarter, we recognized a cumulative year-to-date benefit from these regulations of $202 million or $0.28 per share compared to our previous run rate. \u2047 Max will provide additional details. \u2047 Turning to our operations starting with Aflac Japan, the effects of COVID-19 continues noticeably impacted our results, as seen in the third quarter, with sales decreasing 32%. \u2047 We continue to have around 50% of the workforce working from home in Japan and in September, traffic coming into the shops remained at 70% of pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 While these sales results represent sequential improvements relative to the last quarter, the effects of the reduced face-to-face activities are evident and we continue to promote virtual sales. \u2047 2020 as also ushered in a change on the Japanese political front. \u2047 Prime Minister, Abe, was Japan's longest serving Prime Minister and a source of political stability with nearly eight years in office. \u2047 Mr. Suga, was a core member of Abe's administration leadership team, serving as the Chief Cabinet Secretary. \u2047 We believe Mr. Suga's administration will carry on skilled leader skill. \u2047 This will continue to promote a good business environment in Japan and emphasize policies and terms of the response to the COVID-19 and economic policies. \u2047 Prime Minister Suga is accelerating efforts to move toward -- to move forward with regulatory reforms for a post-pandemic world, promoting digital transformation. \u2047 In that respect, I'm pleased that flagged Japan's paperless initiatives is well under way and Fred will share more. \u2047 Turning to Aflac US. \u2047 The effects of COVID-19 continued to noticeably impact our results in this segment as well, largely due to the reduced face-to-face activity, third quarter sales were down 35.7%. \u2047 In the US, we continue to feel the impact of temporary business closures and lack of access to the work side, especially among our career agents who have historically relied upon face-to-face meetings to engage our small business owners and their employees. \u2047 At the same time, the fourth quarter, typically when we see strong results and the broker driven group market, which is generally been more resilient to face-to-face to not face-to-face conditions. \u2047 As a result, we remain cautiously optimistic for modest sequential sales improvement for Aflac US in the fourth quarter compared to the second and third quarter, contingent upon the pace of the economic recovery. \u2047 We are also on track to close our acquisition of Zurich Group business benefits soon, which allows us to extend our distribution reach and appeal to brokers and large employers, while having little effect on the fourth quarter, the acquisition positions us more expanded capacity as we look forward to 2021. \u2047 To place Aflac in a position of strength, we know that we must balance investing in growth with an eye toward reducing expenses in the long run. \u2047 As such, we took an opportunity to offer a very generous voluntary separation package to eligible employees who expressed an interest. \u2047 As a result we have achieved an approximate 9% reduction in our US and corporate workforce with expected one-time expenses of $45 million in the fourth quarter. \u2047 You'll recall that the US benefit ratio was significantly affected by policyholders limited visits to the doctor. \u2047 With this in mind, we lost the US initiatives early in the third quarter to remind policyholders of the value of their wellness benefits attached to their products. \u2047 The wellness benefits pays on certain routine doctor, dentist and hospitalizations visits. \u2047 In addition, we made sure that it pays a benefit for COVID-19 testing. \u2047 The wellness initiative has been a success. \u2047 We are glad we emphasized this important aspect of our policies as it reinforces how we are there for the policyholder when they need us most. \u2047 This wellness campaign and the voluntary separation programs are a couple of near term headwinds to the profit margin. \u2047 However, we expect that they will serve us well as we enter 2021. \u2047 To conclude our operational discussion, as I've said before, we want to be where the people want to purchase insurance. \u2047 That applies to both Japan and the US. \u2047 In the past, this is meeting face-to-face with individuals to understand their situation, propose a solution and closed the sale. \u2047 However, the pandemic clearly demonstrates the need for virtual means. \u2047 In other words, non-face-to-face sales to reach potential customers and provide them with the protection that they need. \u2047 Therefore we have accelerated investments to enhance the tools available to our distribution in both countries. \u2047 As always, we are committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. \u2047 This includes maintaining strong capital ratios on behalf of the policyholders in both the US and Japan and a tactical approach to capital allocation. \u2047 It goes without saying that we treasure our record of dividend growth. \u2047 With the fourth quarter declaration 2020 will mark the 38th consecutive year of dividend increases. \u2047 Our dividend track record is supported by the strength of our capital and cash flows. \u2047 At the same time we have remained tactical in our approach to share repurchase, buying back $400 million of our shares in the third quarter. \u2047 We have also focused on integrating the growth investments that we have made in our platform. \u2047 By doing so, we look to emerge from this period of continued position of strength and leadership. \u2047 As always, we are working to achieve our earnings per share objective, while also ensuring we deliver on our promise to our policyholders. \u2047 We look forward to going into greater detail on our strategic growth plans and efforts to drive efficiency at the Financial Analyst Briefing Conference Call in a few weeks. \u2047 So now, I'd like to turn the program over to Fred. \u2047 I'm going to touch briefly on conditions in the third quarter, and how we're navigating the pandemic. \u2047 I'll also provide an update on key initiatives in Japan and the US to include our approach to managing expenses. \u2047 There are currently approximately 97,000 COVID-19 cases and 1,730 deaths in all of Japan. \u2047 Through the third quarter Aflac Japan COVID-19 impact totaled 1,750 unique claimants with incurred claims totaling approximately JPY550 million in the quarter and JPY760 million year-to-date. \u2047 In short, we are tracking well below our stress assumptions with no measurable impact from COVID-19 claims. \u2047 However, reduced sales and delaying the promotion of the new cancer rider and refreshed medical product are contributing to revenue pressure. \u2047 This pressure is offset somewhat by favorable persistency. \u2047 COVID related expenses in the quarter totaled JPY1.7 billion, which included the rollout of virtual distribution tools, employee teller working equipment and distribution support. \u2047 In the US, the dynamics are understandably more complex. \u2047 COVID-19 case levels in the US now exceed 8.5 million with deaths nearing 230,000. \u2047 Through the end of the third quarter, COVID-19 claimants in the US totaled 12,800 with incurred claims of approximately $23 million in the quarter and year-to-date approximately $57 million. \u2047 We are closely monitoring the recent surge in infections, but continue to see the rate of hospitalization, length of stay in the hospital and transition to ICU traveling below our expectations. \u2047 We believe this is attributed to advancements in treatment and the nature of the work site which is generally younger and healthier population of policyholders. \u2047 As Dan noted in his comments, we launched an initiative early in the third quarter to remain policyholders of their wellness benefits, which drove increased utilization. \u2047 This effort involved connecting with 2.7 million accident and hospital policyholders through a combination of email and direct mail in the month of August. \u2047 This impacted our benefit ratio in the period, but is designed to reinforce the value proposition of our products. \u2047 We have thus far seen limited impact persistency, however, we believe this is partially attributed to state executive orders requiring premium grace periods. \u2047 These executive orders are still in place in 13 states as of the end of the quarter. \u2047 In those states where the executive orders have expired, we have reduced pressure on lapse rates through proactive outreach to policyholders and employers, actively converting policyholders from payroll deduction to direct bill and notifying policyholders of the wellness benefits. \u2047 Turning to key operating initiatives in both Japan and the US, we are balancing investments in growth, while addressing our expense structure. \u2047 A material driver of elevated expense ratios in Japan and the US is weakness in revenue. \u2047 Thus, the need for a balanced approach. \u2047 Beginning with Japan, we are set to promote a simplified cancer rider in the fourth quarter in launching our refreshed medical product in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 Rolled out in late October, we have the technology in place to pivot from face-to-face to virtual sales and an entirely digital customer experience. \u2047 We continue with direct mail campaigns aided by data analytics that serve to enhance the close rate. \u2047 We expect the combination of product development, a recovery in pandemic conditions and our alliance with Japan Post to be important growth drivers as we make our way through 2021. \u2047 We view the pandemic as a call to action on accelerating investment in our digital roadmap and related process improvement. \u2047 On our second quarter call, I noted, our paperless initiative across all operations in Japan. \u2047 This is a three year, and roughly JPY10 billion investment with approximately JPY2 billion spent in the third quarter, along with another JPY3.6 billion estimated spend in the fourth quarter. \u2047 While elevating our 2020 expenses, this effort will reduce the production and circulation of 80 million pieces of paper per year with run rate savings in the range of JPY3 billion annually. \u2047 As we move to the fourth quarter, we have budgeted an increase in general, administration expenses over our third quarter of approximately JPY6 billion. \u2047 This includes 50% of our 2020 annual advertising spend, concentrated in the quarter to raise new product awareness as well as a stepped up level of investment in the paperless initiative. \u2047 We are effectively accelerating investments in our digital platform into 2020 and 2021. \u2047 Turning to the US, the build out of network, dental and vision remains on track. \u2047 We have successfully filed our new network products in 48 states with approvals received in 37 states. \u2047 We are up and running with sales in 10 states and expect to ramp this up as we move into 2021. \u2047 Our consumer markets platform remains on track with hospital accident and cancer product filings expected to be completed in early 2021. \u2047 We also plan to include life insurance in 2021, recognizing that is a natural product to sell digitally empowered by the Aflac brand. \u2047 Finally, we will soon close on our Zurich Benefits acquisition having successfully completed the required regulatory approvals, along with efforts to improve overall persistency, these are the three largest incremental drivers to earn premium growth in the coming years. \u2047 Anticipating further pressure on near term earned premium as we move into 2021, we are addressing expenses in the US with a sense of urgency. \u2047 We are addressing expenses across two horizons. \u2047 Horizon one is near term focused and includes a series of actions in 2020 designed to take out approximately $100 million of annualized run rate expenses as we enter 2021. \u2047 This includes both the US platform and corporate expenses. \u2047 Early in the fourth quarter, we completed a voluntary separation plan for eligible employees, which will result in a 9% reduction to our US workforce. \u2047 We expect to record a one-time separation expense of approximately $45 million in the fourth quarter and we will realize annualized run rate savings in the $45 million to $50 million range. \u2047 Horizon two expense initiatives elevate near term expenses until such time the investment is complete. \u2047 Legacy platforms are decommissioned and business processes are adjusted. \u2047 The most significant investment is in our group business in migration off an old administrative platform to a new platform. \u2047 In addition, we are completing a broader digital roadmap, which includes approximately $25 million of accelerated investment in 2020. \u2047 Much of that investment coming in the fourth quarter. \u2047 As I noted, we need to balance these expense initiatives with investment in growth. \u2047 We have adopted a buy-to-build acquisition strategy. \u2047 While a tactical and prudent use of excess capital, this is not an inexpensive effort in the early years. \u2047 These build efforts include dental and vision, direct to consumer and Group benefits and taken together impacted our expense ratio in the third quarter by 110 basis points, and are expected to impact the fourth quarter by approximately 160 basis points. \u2047 I'll conclude my comments with investment conditions. \u2047 Our global investment team remains focused on asset quality, monitoring economic conditions and sourcing new investment opportunities in a low interest rate environment. \u2047 Our firm view is that we will experience a check mark-shaped recovery, meaning a slow road to recovery with pockets of volatility along the way. \u2047 Our actions prior to the pandemic tactically improved the risk profile of our portfolio combined with some additional derisking earlier this year has served us well with only modest losses on the sale of securities, impairments and loss reserve increases. \u2047 These actions have also positioned the portfolio defensively, should we see a second surge in the virus impact economic conditions. \u2047 We continue to watch closely our middle market loan and transitional real estate portfolios. \u2047 While we have seen credit rating downgrades, our middle market loan portfolio is more resilient to consisting a first-lien loans to high quality borrowers backed by strong equity sponsors. \u2047 In the case of transitional real estate, our portfolio is also consisting of only first-lien positions and is diversified with strong loans to value. \u2047 We continue to explore ways to optimize currency hedging. \u2047 Overall no material change, but we are further refining our approach to managing the unhedged dollars in Japan. \u2047 These unhedged dollars provide diversification and income benefits as well as lowering our enterprise exposure to the Yen. \u2047 As we look toward 2021,"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $1.39.  \u2047  in yen terms, aflac japan's net premium income was \u00a5336.5
