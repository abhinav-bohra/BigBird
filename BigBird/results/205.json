{"article": ["We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in Graham Corporation. \u2047 Joining me on the call are Dan Thoren, our president and CEO; and Jeff Glajch, our chief financial officer. \u2047 You should have a copy of the third quarter fiscal 2022 financial results, which just released a few minutes ago. \u2047 If not, you can access the release as well as the other slides that will accompany our conversation today at our website, grahammanufacturing.com, and I also want to point out that we also have now ir. \u2047 grahamcorp.com to access the investor information. \u2047 These documents can be found on our website or at sec.gov. \u2047 During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 We believe these will be useful in evaluating our performance. \u2047 We have provided reconciliation of non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today's release and the slides for your information. \u2047 I am starting on Page 3. \u2047 As you might imagine, having just assumed the role of CEO in September, reporting this fiscal third year -- third quarter's results is a little bit rough. \u2047 Revenue has increased to $28.8 million, but we had a loss of $0.35 per share. \u2047 The loss was driven by Navy project cost overruns in our Batavia operations as a result of decisions we made during the quarter to ensure timely execution of our high-profile submarine and carrier projects. \u2047 The multiple decisions that led to the loss were for long-term gain over short-term pain and were not made lightly. \u2047 Our Navy business is very important for our future. \u2047 We had to protect this business and ensure our customers knew we were committed to hitting their need dates, even though we took a significant financial hit in the quarter and over our fiscal year 2022. \u2047 Jeff and I will provide more detail on subsequent slides. \u2047 As a result of the quarter loss, we were out of compliance on our financial covenants, which required suspending our dividend. \u2047 Jeff will talk more about the waiver we obtained and the coming amendment of our credit facility. \u2047 While this was a disappointing quarter and has been a very challenging year, we are deeply committed to our strategy to diversify beyond refining at petrochem with our defense work. \u2047 The pivot toward defense has been successful, as indicated by bookings and revenue. \u2047 Our defense revenue is now over half our total revenue. \u2047 We had a huge bookings quarter at $68 million. \u2047 Over half of these bookings were at Barber-Nichols. \u2047 Now that we have the bookings, we have to execute this work profitably. \u2047 Final point on this page is that Barber-Nichols' performance is exceeding our expectations. \u2047 They are building a larger backlog and delivering strong margins. \u2047 Jeff will provide more detail in the financial discussion. \u2047 But first, I'd like to provide more detail on our Navy challenges in Batavia. \u2047 We'll move to Slide 4. \u2047 So let me first address what led up to our third quarter performance. \u2047 To date, Graham manufacturing has been very successful in winning the trust and confidence of the U.S. Navy and its prime shipbuilders with its high-quality heat exchange and vacuum products used in the nuclear Navy power plants. \u2047 Navy orders and backlog continue to climb and have now significantly exceeded our commercial backlog and will soon exceed our commercial revenue. \u2047 As of December 31, 2021, our Navy backlog in Batavia was over $100 million. \u2047 Those orders come with big expectations. \u2047 As we have worked over the last two years to continue to win new business and meet those expectations, a perfect storm brewed in our third quarter. \u2047 There were several events that led to our need to readjust in Q3. \u2047 After getting started on Colombia, there was a Navy wide reset of quality requirements that caused delays with welder and quality recertification. \u2047 This was followed by the impact of COVID-19, the ongoing limited skilled workforce in the welding trades, and the sheer magnitude of work running through our shop combined with first article learning curve, all of these items caused us to get behind on our Navy jobs. \u2047 We do continue to have first article challenges. \u2047 This is quite typical with defense projects, and we would have expected this on the Columbia project. \u2047 We've reviewed this with you in the past. \u2047 Now while the CVN-80 work is not a true first article job for us, the lack of process documentation from the previous work combined with severe labor challenges and use of contract welders new to the equipment caused challenges on the carrier work as well. \u2047 Even as we work to catch up on hours, our equipment became the pacing item associated with our nation's most strategic ship and submarine build schedules. \u2047 The pressure to expedite was extreme. \u2047 Let's turn to Page 5. \u2047 The chart on Page 5 shows our labor plan with blue bars, our actual labor, application in gray bars, and the resulting deficit of hours caused by actual being less than our planned hourly expenditure. \u2047 The depth of our deficit occurred around May of 2021. \u2047 In past calls, we talked about redirecting commercial welders to Navy and hiring contract welders to address this deficit. \u2047 In third quarter, we redirected even more commercial welders, outsourced more commercial work, hired more contract welders and even added some of our new welders that completed our training programs. \u2047 These actions help to reverse the Navy labor deficit, but they came at additional costs. \u2047 Outsourcing commercial work results in less margin. \u2047 We also realized less third quarter revenue as the outsourced suppliers were not able to ramp up quickly. \u2047 The contract welder costs were high, the specialized training required by the Navy took a long time and retention of the contract welders was poor. \u2047 Ultimately, we've been able to reduce our Navy program labor deficit by doubling our Navy workforce, mitigating the schedule slips and keeping our customer relationship strong. \u2047 The deficit should be erased in the first half of fiscal '23, but we expect to start reducing high-cost contract welders as we enter the next fiscal year. \u2047 In the end, the actions we took to stay on track in the last quarter resulted in revising estimates on labor hours and material, and we booked loss conversion costs that were recorded in the quarter and impacted our results as well. \u2047 Jeff will cover that detail in the financial briefing. \u2047 Certainly, we've learned a lot from this experience and have or will institute corrective and preventative actions to ensure that we continue to grow our Navy business and can deliver quality products in a timely fashion and earn a fair return for our efforts. \u2047 Our customers have been very appreciative of our efforts and we do not see any negative consequences if we hold current deliveries. \u2047 This equipment is built into the bowels of these ships, and they will never come out. \u2047 Thus, quality is paramount and Graham has not disappointed. \u2047 As we catch up on these programs and reduce our labor deficit, we can reclaim margins by eliminating contract welders, reassigning our commercial welders back to our commercial product and reduce the outsourcing that we're doing today. \u2047 Our people pipeline continues to be critical, and our welder training program will be continued. \u2047 Looking back, we could have done a better job in predicting and mitigating the situation with better developed FP&A, financial planning and analysis, and project management skills. \u2047 We are adding new talent with defense expertise in Batavia to better manage these processes. \u2047 In fact, we're adding a new position and Batavia will have a Navy business leader beginning February 28. \u2047 As we look forward, our processes need to advance to enable our ability to document and optimize all of our fabrication processes to prevent a recurrence of this first article issues that we've seen. \u2047 We see opportunities to increase future profits with investment in time-saving automated welding, and we're evaluating current contract margins and revisiting pricing on future production opportunities. \u2047 In summary, our Batavia defense business was hit by a perfect storm at a very inopportune time. \u2047 We made decisions to protect our strategic Navy business. \u2047 It cost us in the short term, but proved our dedication to our customers for the long term. \u2047 As Dan mentioned, our third quarter performance was quite disappointing. \u2047 Sales were $28.8 million, up $1.6 million over last year's third quarter. \u2047 Barber-Nichols contributed $12 million in sales in the quarter, helping to offset the weak sales quarter of our legacy Graham manufacturing business. \u2047 Our Batavia operations were impacted because of its need to focus on catching up and executing the two large Navy projects. \u2047 Those projects will both require more labor and material costs to complete that were projected at the start of the quarter. \u2047 The additional labor hours to complete the projects impacted the quarter's revenue since we did not move the projects as far along as expected. \u2047 The added labor and material costs, including the use of higher cost contract laborers required us to record increased reserves. \u2047 The sum of all these items impacted both revenue and gross margin. \u2047 The impact of the cost increases and required fully burdened contract costs in the quarter were $2 million. \u2047 In addition, the delayed revenue was approximately $6 million, and the delayed operating profit is approximately $750,000. \u2047 Furthermore, to get back on schedule with the Navy projects, we reallocated our commercial labor to Navy work, which resulted in increases in cost estimates for those jobs, which have now been outsourced. \u2047 All of the above items contributed to an adjusted EBITDA of negative $2.6 million in the quarter and an adjusted net loss of $0.27 per share. \u2047 On the positive front, with the addition of Barber-Nichols, we had 58% of our sales to the defense industry, as well as 5% or $1.5 million to the space industry. \u2047 If we can move on to Slide 7. \u2047 The impact of the third quarter results on top of a challenging first half of the year have yielded an unacceptable loss even as sales increased 16% or $11.3 million to $83.1 million. \u2047 There is a bright light within the results, and this has been the contributions of Barber-Nichols, which we acquired on June 1. \u2047 In the seven months since the acquisition, BN has contributed $31.9 million in sales, offsetting significant declines in refining and petrochemical markets. \u2047 In fact, our diversification into defense, which is less cyclical than our commercial business, has resulted in 52% of our year-to-date revenue coming from that industry. \u2047 The shortfall in commercial sales in the first nine months of the fiscal year reflects the very low order levels, which we saw in the second half of fiscal 2021. \u2047 The two Navy projects in our Batavia operations will continue to convert over the next three quarters, and we expect this to be behind us by mid fiscal 2023. \u2047 As of December 31, we recorded all known expected costs on these large projects. \u2047 We are also implementing expanded processes within our project management group to better review all of Batavia's major projects. \u2047 The year-to-date impact of increased cost on these two jobs is approximately $4.5 million. \u2047 In addition, the delayed revenue was approximately $12 million and the delayed operating profit is an additional $1.5 million. \u2047 These latter amounts will be recognized over the next three quarters as the jobs are completed. \u2047 We've had to outsource more commercial work and have also had cost challenges on a couple of projects. \u2047 This, too, has impacted financial results. \u2047 The increased cost of outsourcing and higher costs has impacted the commercial business by $3 million. \u2047 All of the above items contributed to an adjusted EBITDA of negative $5.4 million year-to-date, and a year-to-date net loss of $0.70 a share and an adjusted loss of $0.60 per share. \u2047 Barber-Nichols again, is a strong positive in the first three quarters. \u2047 In the seven months since the acquisition, BN sales are on track at $31.9 million, and EBITDA margins are well ahead of expectations. \u2047 I have noted in previous calls, that we were expecting $45 million to $48 million in sales and low double-digit EBITDA margins. \u2047 The sales number is on target, and we are now seeing mid-teen EBITDA. \u2047 In fact, through seven months since the acquisition, BN has achieved our targeted EBITDA for the full fiscal year. \u2047 So its Q4 EBITDA will represent overachievement compared with our expectation. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 8. \u2047 And given the weak financial performance in the first three quarters, we have failed to meet our debt covenant related to debt-to-EBITDA and fixed cost charges. \u2047 This miss was due to the EBITDA loss. \u2047 We were given a waiver by our lender for Q3 and are proactively in negotiations to amend our existing bank agreement. \u2047 Because of the covenant misses, it was necessary to suspend our dividend. \u2047 And as part of the waiver agreement, we have agreed not to utilize more than $15 million of our revolver. \u2047 I want to be clear that the issues we are seeing are P&L profit issues and not liquidity issues. \u2047 We have sufficient liquidity from cash we are generating from operations to work through our challenges. \u2047 In fact, in January alone, lowered our revolver debt from $9.75 million to $6 million. \u2047 We expect to lower it further between now and the end of March. \u2047 Conversations with our lender have been very positive. \u2047 I've been pleased with the bank's willingness to understand the details and not overreact to the numbers. \u2047 They understand the near-term challenges are primarily related to profitability and delayed revenue. \u2047 While there are certainly some significant cost -- cash cost increases, the costs booked in Q3 and the elongation of project revenue and profit recognition into future quarters have doubled down the impact on our year-to-date P&L. \u2047 The bank and I both expect the lending amendment to be completed by the end of Q4. \u2047 Onto Slide 9, some very good news on the order front. \u2047 As Dan noted, orders in Q3 were $68 million. \u2047 Just over half of this came from Barber-Nichols, which most of their orders coming from key defense projects. \u2047 They also continue to bring in a nice level and variety of space orders. \u2047 On the commercial side, Graham manufacturing saw another strong quarter of aftermarket and short-cycle orders. \u2047 Those are promising since historically, an increase in those areas has often been a precursor to a recovery in capital investment by our customers. \u2047 We also booked a significant refinery order in China. \u2047 Our backlog at the end of Q3 is a record"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 loss per share $0.35.  \u2047  q3 loss per share $0.35.  \u2047  sees q4 revenue $37 million to $42 million.  \u2047  qtrly revenue of $28.8 million, up 6% over prior-year period."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings
