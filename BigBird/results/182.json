{"article": ["Kessel Stelling, chairman and chief executive officer, will begin the call. \u2047 He will be followed by Jamie Gregory, chief financial officer; and Kevin Blair, president and chief operating officer. \u2047 During the call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures related to the company's performance. \u2047 And now here's Kessel Stelling. \u2047 Just last month, six months, after converting to drive-through appointment only, our retail branch network reopened to walk-in customers. \u2047 Although things are far from back to normal, we're fundamentally a relationship bank, and I've enjoyed so much hearing from our front-line team members who take such pride and pleasure in serving our customers in person, even if it's across a plexiglass barrier or from a distance of six feet. \u2047 Our team's response to this ongoing pandemic continues to demonstrate what's unique about this company, our culture of service, our focus on customers and communities, our adaptability in changing circumstances and our ability to execute. \u2047 All of those, along with continued economic recovery contributed to our strong performance in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share was $0.56 per share compared to $0.57 last quarter and $0.83 a year ago. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.89 per share compared to $0.23 last quarter and $0.97 a year ago. \u2047 The primary difference between reported and adjusted figures for the quarter was a $0.30 per share impact from a goodwill impairment of our mortgage reporting unit that Jamie will detail shortly. \u2047 Period-end loan balances of $39.5 billion were down $364 million from the prior quarter, with commercial loan growth partially offsetting declines in the consumer portfolio. \u2047 1% of loans had a full principal and interest deferral at the end of the quarter, down from 15% in May. \u2047 Total deposits of $44.7 billion were up $471 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 Broad-based core transaction deposit growth of $1.6 billion allowed us to accelerate our deposit pricing and remixing strategy, which led to stable net interest income at $377 million. \u2047 The net interest margin declined three basis points to 3.10%, slightly better than we expected as headwinds from student loan sales and bond portfolio repositioning completed in the second quarter were partially offset by the favorable trends in deposit pricing and remixing. \u2047 Adjusted non-interest revenue of $116 million was strong, up $20 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 The improvement was led by quarter-over-quarter increases in net mortgage revenues of $8 million and core banking fees of $5 million. \u2047 Adjusted non-interest expense of $269 million was down $8 million from the prior quarter, led by an improvement of $5 million in employment expenses. \u2047 Provision for credit losses of $43 million were down $98 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 The ACL ratio increased six basis points to 1.80%, excluding P3 balances. \u2047 The past due NPA and net charge-off ratios remained relatively stable. \u2047 The CET1 ratio increased 40 basis points to 9.3%, following strong core performance in the settlement of transactions we executed in the second quarter. \u2047 The total risk-based capital ratio increased 46 basis points to 13.16%, the highest level since 2014. \u2047 Jamie will now share more detail about the quarter. \u2047 Before moving to Slide 4, I'd like to provide an update on goodwill. \u2047 We have been conducting evaluations of goodwill in response to market volatility and expectations for a lower for longer interest rate environment referenced by the FOMC in August. \u2047 As a result, there has been a goodwill impairment for our mortgage reporting unit of $45 million. \u2047 This is a noncash charge that has no impact to cash, liquidity, tangible book value or regulatory capital ratios. \u2047 Beginning on Slide 4. \u2047 Total loans declined $364 million in the third quarter as commercial loan growth helped offset reductions from P3 loan payoffs of $77 million and strategic asset dispositions of single service loans. \u2047 Excluding the impact of asset dispositions and P3 payoffs, we had net loan growth of $245 million in the quarter. \u2047 Commercial loans, excluding P3 balances, increased $291 million. \u2047 Although pipelines are lower than they were pre-COVID, we continue to see demand, especially in middle market businesses and our higher growth and higher opportunity markets, such as Atlanta, Birmingham and South Florida. \u2047 Consumer loans declined $578 million, led by the disposition of roughly $185 million of non-relationship mortgages, along with continued declines in our lending partnership portfolios. \u2047 Additionally, a portion of the decline can be attributed to the continuation of our GreenSky strategy, which we highlighted last quarter, and which to some degree, is offset by an increase in balances within our held-for-sale portfolio. \u2047 While we will continue to evaluate opportunities to efficiently manage our balance sheet, there are currently no existing plans for material dispositions, such as those we made the last two quarters. \u2047 We expect loans, excluding the impact of P3 forgiveness, to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter. \u2047 As shown on Slide 5, we had total deposit growth of $471 million. \u2047 More importantly, we're continuing to strategically reposition the portfolio. \u2047 Broad based core transaction deposit growth of $1.6 billion offset the strategic declines in time deposits of $1.2 billion and broker deposits of $381 million. \u2047 We estimate approximately $2.3 billion or 80% of deposit balances associated with P3 loans remained on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. \u2047 The cost of deposits fell by 14 basis points from the previous quarter to 39 basis points due to a combination of rates paid and deposit remixing. \u2047 For context, this compares to a low of 26 basis points in the third quarter of 2014. \u2047 We continue to believe there are further opportunities to reduce deposit costs through CD turnover, repricing and remixing. \u2047 These activities in an environment of lower for longer interest rates, combined with strong growth in core customer deposits, should allow us to get our total deposit cost to the 26 basis point lows of the prior cycle. \u2047 Slide 6 shows net interest income of $377 million, stable from the previous quarter and included $12 million in fee accretion from our P3 loan portfolio. \u2047 There are $74 million of P3 processing fees remaining. \u2047 Earlier this month, the SBA announced a streamlined forgiveness process for certain P3 loans of $50,000 or less. \u2047 Approximately 7% of our P3 balances fall within this threshold. \u2047 There is approximately $10 million in fees associated with these loans, which will be accelerated when we receive the forgiveness proceeds. \u2047 Net interest margin was 3.10%, down three basis points from the previous quarter. \u2047 Consistent with our expectations, the current level of interest rates, combined with a nine-basis-point headwind from bond repositioning and student loan sales executed in the second quarter, put downward pressure on NII and NIM in the third quarter. \u2047 However, these headwinds were partially offset by a handful of factors, including further declines in deposit pricing and favorable deposit remixing trends. \u2047 Our guidance from the previous quarter largely remains the same, and we continue to expect modest downward pressure on NIM as the repricing within our fixed rate asset portfolio is partially offset by continued declines in overall deposit costs and further improvements in managing liquidity costs. \u2047 Excluding the potential impacts from P3 forgiveness, we expect NII and NIM will decrease slightly in the fourth quarter. \u2047 It was another strong quarter for non-interest revenue, which is shown on Slide 7. \u2047 Core banking revenue improved by $5 million from the second quarter, primarily due to increased transaction activity as most components are gradually returning to pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Net mortgage revenue of $31 million remained elevated, primarily due to increase in secondary revenues driven by higher loan sales and gain on sale. \u2047 Secondary mortgage production was $654 million in the third quarter, which is an increase of $19 million or 3% from the second quarter's record production. \u2047 We continue to see positive momentum in other fiduciary service business, including brokerage and trust. \u2047 Assets under management of $17.5 billion grew 6% from the previous quarter. \u2047 Other income for the quarter included a valuation adjustment for tax credits and gained from the previously mentioned mortgage portfolio sales. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we expect stable revenues from core banking fees, fiduciary services and capital markets income. \u2047 We expect to see declines in mortgage revenue and other income. \u2047 Slide 8 includes non-interest expenses, which were $317 million or $269 million adjusted. \u2047 Adjustments include $3 million in restructuring charges, primarily related to branch optimization, as well as the $45 million goodwill impairment previously discussed. \u2047 This goodwill impairment is limited to the mortgage reporting unit and results from a combination of factors, including the extended duration of lower market valuations, high volumes and refinancings that have reduced mortgage yields and the clarity around longer term policy actions designed to keep interest rates low. \u2047 Total employment expenses were $5 million less than the previous quarter, primarily due to lower commissions, lower headcount and reduced COVID-related staffing expenses. \u2047 Total COVID-related expenses for the quarter were minimal. \u2047 We expect further headcount reductions in the fourth quarter as part of the normal attrition and a voluntary retirement offer we recently extended. \u2047 The voluntary retirement offer is expected to result in a onetime fourth-quarter expense of approximately $14 million and have a two-year payback. \u2047 These savings are part of the Synovus forward initiatives and will help offset expected increases to other line items such as travel and advertising in 2021 as banking activity returns closer to normal. \u2047 We continue to focus on what we can control, which includes prudent expense management. \u2047 Excluding the upfront expenses associated with Synovus Forward initiatives, we expect adjusted NIE in the fourth quarter will be in line with the third quarter. \u2047 Key credit metrics are on Slide 9. \u2047 There were slight increases in NPA, NPL and past due ratios from the previous quarter, but we currently do not see widespread deterioration in the portfolio. \u2047 Our comprehensive reviews have largely isolated the elevated risks to certain segments, including hotels and full service restaurants, and we continue to work with borrowers who have been most negatively impacted by the pandemic. \u2047 Provision for credit losses of $43 million includes net charge-offs of $28 million or 29 basis points. \u2047 Downgrades in the hotel portfolio, one of the hardest hit industries, accounted for $603 million of the increase in criticized and classified loans. \u2047 There were $125 million in hotel loans that had principal and interest deferrals at the end of the quarter, which represents about 8% of the total hotel portfolio. \u2047 Our latest economic outlook includes an unemployment rate of about 8% as of year-end before declining modestly in 2021. \u2047 This, along with credit migration and other portfolio activity resulted in an allowance for credit losses of $665 million, up $15 million from the previous quarter. \u2047 The allowance for credit loss ratio increased six basis points to 1.8%, excluding P3 loans. \u2047 The amount of provision for credit losses going forward will continue to fluctuate based on a number of factors, including economic outlook, loan growth, loan mix, risk rate migration, as well as the timing and impact of future government stimulus. \u2047 Heightened levels of uncertainty and those factors could result in reductions of allowance less than net charge-offs. \u2047 As the outlook becomes more stable and uncertainty declines, we expect changes in allowance to rely more heavily on the traditional factors previously mentioned. \u2047 Preliminary capital ratios on Slide 10 continued to build from a combination of earnings and balance sheet activities completed over the past several months. \u2047 These balance sheet activities include the settlement of our second-quarter bond repositioning and our ongoing efforts to reduce single service loan portfolios as we prioritize our balance sheet for core client relationships. \u2047 CET1 increased 40 basis points to 9.3% this quarter, that's an increase of 35 basis points from the end of 2019 and was accomplished while increasing the reserve by $382 million. \u2047 The total risk-based capital ratio of 13.16%, up 46 basis points from the second quarter was the highest since 2014. \u2047 We remain focused on supporting our overall capital position and are targeting the higher end of our CET1 operating range of nine to nine and a half percent, given the heightened uncertainty in the current economic environment. \u2047 We expect core earnings will continue to support our capital position and allow us to achieve our strategic objectives, with consideration for our anticipated balance sheet growth and the payout objectives we've outlined previously. \u2047 As a reminder, we do not expect any share repurchases for the rest of the year. \u2047 I'd like to begin on Slide 11 with an update on deferments. \u2047 At the end of the third quarter, we had $337 million in loans on a full principal and interest deferral, which was less than 1% of total loans. \u2047 The aggregate amount in deferment was well below the 3 to 5% range we estimated last quarter and down significantly from the 15% we referenced in our first quarter 10-Q filing. \u2047 We attribute the lower P&I deferral activity this quarter to the strength of our borrowers and improving economic environment and support provided through various government stimulus programs. \u2047 Of the $337 million in deferment at the end of the quarter, 50%, or $169 million were in the consumer book. \u2047 These were predominantly consumer mortgage loans, which are largely comprised of physician and private wealth customers. \u2047 The $169 million in deferments represents approximately 2% of total consumer loans. \u2047 Commercial deferments as of 9/30 were $168 million, or 54 basis points of the total commercial portfolio. \u2047 Full P&I deferments were largely concentrated in the hotel and full-service restaurant segments, which comprise 85%, or $143 million of commercial deferments at the end of the quarter. \u2047 We have not only seen a significant reduction in the level of deferments. \u2047 We are also seeing strong performance from those that have exited a deferral status. \u2047 94% have made a payment, while another 5 to 6% have not had a payment due or were in a grace period at the end of the quarter. \u2047 Only approximately 20 basis points of loans that exited a deferral status were past due are moved to nonaccrual status at the end of the third quarter. \u2047 In addition to the full P&I deferment program, we have continued to work with other borrowers who have been impacted during the current crisis to provide flexibility in payment terms, which may include modifications such as interest only or amortization extensions. \u2047 Inclusive of these modifications, we estimate that total loans with accommodations, as of the end of September, remained below 3"], "gold_summary": ["compname announces q3 earnings per share $0.56.  \u2047  q3 adjusted
