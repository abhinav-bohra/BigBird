{"article": ["With me on the call are Pam Kessler, Co-President and Chief Financial Officer; and Clint Malin, Co-President and Chief Investment Officer. \u2047 Not being able to quantify an impact of the delta variant on current and near future operations, what we have recently heard from our operators gives us some optimism. \u2047 We are seeing occupancy gains for the first time in a long while. \u2047 Vaccination rates among patients and residents throughout the industry are high, generally in the 80% range with gradual increases expected. \u2047 Our buildings are beginning to stabilize with in-person tours and family visits allowed once again, notwithstanding the recent introduction of the delta variant. \u2047 The transition of our senior lifestyle portfolio is virtually complete and we are seeing a nice pickup in deal flow and activity. \u2047 We are seeing a few encouraging signs throughout the industry. \u2047 According to Nick's data, communities and nursing centers are doing much better clinically than they have in some time given the high rate of vaccinations among residents and patients. \u2047 On average, especially with respect to SNF, occupancy is trending slowly upward. \u2047 Over the last 25 weeks, SNF have seen occupancy rise in each week except one, when census remained flat. \u2047 Various government stimulus programs have helped significantly in keeping skilled nursing operators a float over the course of the pandemic. \u2047 Additionally, there is about $25 billion remaining for distribution to all healthcare providers in the Provider Relief Fund. \u2047 While private pay has not been a beneficiary of adequate government relief to date, we are seeing some signs that more aid may become available soon. \u2047 This is not to say unfortunately, that all of the challenges facing our industry are slowly trending downward. \u2047 Labor continues to be a major challenge for operators and interest rates and inflation are something we're watching carefully. \u2047 Even so, I believe our industry is on more solid footing today than it has been over the last 18 months and I'm hopeful that some of the remaining pressures will begin to ease in the coming months. \u2047 That said, however, a serious surge of the COVID delta variant across the country, especially in states with lower vaccination rates among staff could result in the need to stop admissions again temporarily delaying a full recovery but hopefully, any such surge will be addressed locally rather than by a national e-debt. \u2047 Second quarter rent and mortgage interest income collections were 93.6% excluding Senior Lifestyle and Senior Care an 86.1% excluding just Senior Lifestyle, whose transition Clint will discuss in detail. \u2047 We are no longer seeing new substantial requests for rent deferrals and abatements and if new ones arise, we will review each on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind an operator's ongoing operations, rent coverage, corporate financial health and liquidity. \u2047 We expect to continue providing some amount of relief in the form of deferrals and abatements until occupancy gains become more permanent. \u2047 I'm so very pleased to be able to report that the senior lifestyle portfolio transition is nearly complete. \u2047 19 of the buildings have been or shortly will be under new leases. \u2047 The other four properties in the portfolio have been sold. \u2047 Clint will provide more details in his comments. \u2047 With respect to Senior Care Centers, bankruptcy proceedings are continuing with the next scheduled court date on August 11. \u2047 Building on the uptick, we saw toward the end of the last quarter, deal flow continues to accelerate with several potential transactions in the pipeline that meet our investment criteria. \u2047 These opportunities are mostly shorter-term and cash flow strategic with what we believe our reduced risk profiles and strong returns. \u2047 Through the first half of the year, we have actively reviewed a host of transactions passing on most either because the properties are not performing well or the asking prices don't reflect what we believe to be market value rates. \u2047 We have no problem temporarily remaining on the sidelines for our more traditional long-term investments until we can find the right deal at the right price. \u2047 The opportunities we are currently working through include mostly structured finance transactions and span the full spectrum of care. \u2047 It bears repeating that LTC has ample access to liquidity to act on these opportunities when the timing is right. \u2047 But as a good financial steward we will not enter into a deal that does not produce accretive returns for LTC and our shareholders. \u2047 With respect to our dividend, I'd like to repeat what I said last quarter. \u2047 It has been LTC's practice to support a dividend payout ratio of approximately 80% of FAD. \u2047 As a result, of the financial support we have provided some of our operators and the significant senior lifestyle and senior care defaults our second quarter 2021 dividend payout ratio was 98%. \u2047 However, we believe our 2022 FAD will improve as we fully transition the Senior Lifestyle portfolio to more stable operators and the issues related to the Senior Care bankruptcy are resolved. \u2047 At this time, we will provide guidance for the third quarter. \u2047 We expect similar NAREIT FFO results as we reported for the just completed second quarter. \u2047 This guidance does not include recovery of any deferred rent or any rent payment from Senior Care. \u2047 With that I'll turn things over to Pam. \u2047 Total revenue increased $9.6 million compared with last year's second quarter resulting primarily from a $9.5 million increase in rental revenue, which was due to a $17.7 million write-off in last year's second quarter related to Senior Lifestyle straight-line rent and lease incentive balances. \u2047 Completed development projects and higher rent payments from Anthem also contributed to the increase. \u2047 The increase in revenue was partially offset by reduced rent from senior lifestyle net of rent received from releasing 11 properties in the portfolio defaulted Senior Care lease obligations, abated and deferred rent and a decrease in property tax revenue. \u2047 Interest income increased $113000 from the prior year due to the funding of expansion and renovation projects offset by scheduled principal pay downs. \u2047 Interest expense decreased by $686000 due to scheduled principal paydowns on our senior unsecured notes lower interest rates and a lower outstanding balance under our line of credit partially offset by lower capitalized interest in 2021. \u2047 Property tax expense decreased $311000 compared with last year's second quarter as a result of the timing of certain operators property tax escrow receipts and the payment of related taxes partially offset by completed development projects. \u2047 G&A was $757,000 greater than last year due to the timing of accrual for incentive compensation salary increases and restricted stock vesting. \u2047 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased $376000 due to mezzanine loan fundings. \u2047 During last year's second quarter, we recognized a loss on liquidation of unconsolidated joint ventures of $620000 related to the sale of the four properties comprising our unconsolidated real estate joint venture with an affiliate of senior lifestyle. \u2047 During the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a net gain on sale of real estate of $5.5 million related to the sale of three properties in Wisconsin and a closed property in Nebraska all previously leased to Senior Lifestyle. \u2047 We also transitioned a memory care property in Colorado, previously operated by Senior Lifestyle to an operator new to LTC. \u2047 The lease has a five-year term and provides a purchase option for $5.5 million, which is exercisable after the first year of the lease. \u2047 Cash rents starting in the second year of the lease is $150,000 increasing to $300,000 in the third year and escalating 2% annually thereafter. \u2047 Net income available to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2021, increased by $16.4 million primarily due to the senior lifestyle write-off in the prior year and the gain on sale of the three Wisconsin properties this year. \u2047 This is partially offset by the revenue declines previously detailed. \u2047 NAREIT FFO per fully diluted share increased to $0.57 from $0.31 last year's excluding nonrecurring items related to last year's second quarter. \u2047 FFO portfolio diluted share was $0.57 this quarter and $0.76 in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 The decrease is specifically due to the non- payment of rent by Senior Lifestyle and Senior Care. \u2047 During the 2021, second quarter we paid $41 million under our unsecured revolving line of credit. \u2047 Additionally, we maintained our $0.19 per share monthly dividend by paying our shareholders $22.4 million in common dividends during the quarter. \u2047 Subsequent to the end of the second quarter we entered into lease agreements covering the remaining properties in the Senior Lifestyle portfolio which Clint, will discuss shortly and sold a skilled nursing center in Washington for $7.7 million. \u2047 We received proceeds totaling $7.2 million and expect to recognize a gain on sale of $2.6 million. \u2047 Additionally, we paid $25.2 million in regular scheduled principal payments under our senior unsecured notes and borrowed $19 million under our unsecured revolving line of credit at 1.2%. \u2047 It is important to note that we have no significant long-term debt maturities over the next five years. \u2047 At the end of the 2021 second quarter, our credit metrics remained strong with a debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDA for real estate of 5.3 times. \u2047 In annualized adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.3 times and a debt to enterprise value of 29%. \u2047 We expect to see this 5.3 ratio come down as we receive more rent from assets formerly operated by Senior Lifestyle and eventually we expect to be able to collect rent from assets involved in the most recent senior care bankruptcy. \u2047 Next, I'll discuss rent deferrals and abatements. \u2047 As Wendy mentioned excluding Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle, we collected 93.6% of second quarter rent and mortgage interest income. \u2047 We provided $1.1 million in rent deferrals and $1.1 million in rent abatements. \u2047 As a reminder, Senior Lifestyle did not pay us rent in 2021. \u2047 With the portfolio virtually fully transitioned, we are receiving contractual rent from the operators who now lease these properties. \u2047 Additionally, during the second quarter Senior Care did not pay rent. \u2047 We applied the remaining $889,000 of the $2.1 million letter of credit to satisfy certain obligations owed under the master lease in the second quarter. \u2047 As of June 30, Senior Care's unaccrued outstanding rent balance was $3.1 million. \u2047 In July we provided rent deferrals totaling $366,000 and rent abatements of $323,000. \u2047 We have agreed to provide rent deferrals of up to $493,000 and abatements of up to $319,000 for each of August and September 2021. \u2047 As Wendy discussed, our Senior Lifestyle portfolio is now nearly fully transitioned and I'm excited to provide our final update on the transition. \u2047 I'll speak in some detail about the newest transactions, but I will start with a brief recap of the transactions completed earlier this year. \u2047 In total the Senior Lifestyle portfolio included 23 properties, 12 of which were transitioned through April of this year. \u2047 Six of those communities were transferred to Randall Residence, a current LTC operator, five to Encore Senior Living an operator new to us and one to Graceful Senior Living also new to us. \u2047 Of the remaining 11 properties, four were sold in the second quarter, three assisted living communities located in Wisconsin were sold for $35 million, which roughly approximates their combined gross book value. \u2047 We used the net proceeds of approximately $33.9 million to pay down our unsecured revolving line of credit. \u2047 In total, these properties included 263 units. \u2047 The fourth was a previously closed property sold for $900,000 for an alternative use. \u2047 The gross book value when we acquired it in 1997 was $2.5 million and the net book value was $1.1 million. \u2047 Of the remaining seven buildings in the portfolio, three have been transferred and four are awaiting licensure. \u2047 Two properties are being operated by Juniper in Pennsylvania. \u2047 One property in New Jersey also to be operated by Juniper should be receiving licensure any day. \u2047 Combined these communities include 168 units. \u2047 Juniper has been a close partner of LTCs since 2012. \u2047 The new lease has a two year term with zero cash rent for the first three months. \u2047 After that time, cash will be reset based on mutually agreed upon fair market rent. \u2047 Cash rent will be reset every three months for the first year and twice a year for the second year as cash flow in the buildings improves until we set permanent rates for the longer term. \u2047 three properties in Nebraska with a combined 119 units will be operated by Oxford Senior Living, an existing LTC partner since 2012 as soon as licensure is received which we also expect in short order. \u2047 The new lease follows the same pattern as I described for Juniper. \u2047 One property in Wisconsin is now being operated by a regional partner new to LTC. \u2047 This community includes 101 unit and will be operated under a 10-year lease with three five year renewal terms. \u2047 Cash rent under the new lease is $920,000 in the first year $1.2 million in the second year $1.3 million in the third year then escalating 2% annually thereafter. \u2047 I'll complete my remarks about the Senior Lifestyle portfolio by saying that among the properties that were transitioned in the January and February timeframe, especially in markets that did not have stringent lockdowns during that time occupancy increased under new management sometimes meaningfully. \u2047 Next, I'll provide some detail on our most recent development projects that are now operational. \u2047 Weatherly Court operated by field Senior Living in Oregon began accepting residents last September. \u2047 At June 30 occupancy was 36% up from 24% on March 31. \u2047 Ignite Medical Resort and Blue Springs located in Missouri began welcoming patients last October. \u2047 At June 30, occupancy rose nicely to 83% up from 64% on March 31. \u2047 Moving next to our portfolio numbers, please remember that with the pandemic and the challenging environment it created we don't believe coverage is a good indicator of future performance at this time and we are focused mainly on occupancy trends which I'll discuss shortly. \u2047 Q1 trailing 12 month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage as reported using a 5% management fee was 0.99 times and 0.8 times respectively for our assisted living portfolio. \u2047 Excluding stimulus funds received by our operators, coverage was 0.85 times and 0.67 times respectively. \u2047 Excluding Senior Lifestyle from our Assisted Living portfolio, as reported EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages would increase to 1.03 times and 0.84 times respectively. \u2047 Excluding both senior lifestyle and stimulus funds EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverages would be 0.9 times and 0.71 times respectively. \u2047 For our skilled nursing portfolio, as reported EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage was 1.94"], "gold_summary": ["q2 ffo per share $0.57."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share $0.57.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.57."]}
