{"article": ["With me on the call today are Seamus Grady, chief executive officer; and TS Ng, chief financial officer. \u2047 We delivered a strong performance in the first quarter with revenue and earnings that were above our guidance. \u2047 Demand trends appear to be stabilizing in most of the end markets we serve, and we're optimistic that we are positioned to deliver strong results in the second quarter. \u2047 Revenue in the first quarter was $399 million, a slight decrease from the record fourth quarter as expected with a 6% increase from a year ago. \u2047 Non-GAAP net income was $0.86 per share, exceeding the high end of guidance as gross margins improved to 12% in the quarter. \u2047 Looking at our business by end markets. \u2047 Optical communications revenue of $302 million was up about $2 million from the fourth quarter and represented 76% of total revenue. \u2047 Within optical communications, telecom revenue of $230 million increased 7% from the fourth quarter and represented 76% of optical revenue. \u2047 This growth is particularly notable considering we had expected telecom revenue to be flat at best. \u2047 Further, we expect this momentum to continue in Q2. \u2047 Datacom revenue was $73 million in the quarter, an expected decrease from Q4, of 15%. \u2047 Datacom represented 24% of optical communications revenue. \u2047 We believe this decline is primarily the result of broader industry trends and not due to execution or competitive issues. \u2047 In fact, based on anticipated near-term demand, we believe datacom trends could be nearing the bottom and we expect datacom revenue to be roughly flat in Q2. \u2047 By technology, silicon photonics based optical communications revenue decreased from the fourth quarter to $77 million and represented 25% of optical communications revenue. \u2047 Revenue from QSFP28 and QSFP56 transceivers was $45 million, down slightly from fourth quarter. \u2047 By data rate, 100-gig programs continued to represent nearly half of optical communications' revenue at $147 million. \u2047 And products rated at speeds of 400 gig and above were up strongly from the fourth quarter of $38 million or 13% of optical communications revenue. \u2047 Looking at our nonoptical communications business. \u2047 Revenue moderated sequentially as expected to $97 million from $105 million in Q4. \u2047 As anticipated, revenue from industrial lasers declined from the fourth quarter and was $41 million compared to $53 million in Q4. \u2047 These same demand trends seem to be persisting, so we anticipated industrial laser revenue to be roughly flat in Q2. \u2047 Longer term, we remain optimistic about our potential to further penetrate the industrial laser market as more manufacturers inevitably turn to outsourcing to better compete in this global market that is, in fact, larger than the optical communications market. \u2047 Automotive and sensor revenue were both stable at $24 million and $3.5 million, respectively. \u2047 Finally, revenue generated from other nonoptical applications grew 15% sequentially to $28 million, mainly from Fabrinet West. \u2047 Fabrinet West has been a great success for winning business for our offshore volume manufacturing sites. \u2047 We have seen numerous programs migrate from early prototyping in Fabrinet West to volume production in Thailand. \u2047 At the same time, Fabrinet West has been an enabler for us to win business in new markets and with new customers that might have otherwise gone to competitors. \u2047 As such, we have been focused on establishing a similar model to Fabrinet West in Israel. \u2047 We already have a number of customers there, and we believe we have the opportunity to grow our business with these customers as well as attract new ones. \u2047 We have signed a lease for a building in[Inaudible] which is a former semiconductor manufacturing facility. \u2047 It is already equipped with most of the infrastructure we need for a new product introduction center. \u2047 We are currently in the process of setting up SMT lines advance packaging and a failure analysis lab similar to what we have to support NPI in our Bangkok facilities. \u2047 We have hired a general manager for Fabrinet Israel and we are targeting to be up and running early next year. \u2047 In summary, we believe we are off to a good start to the fiscal year with revenue and earnings that meet our guidance ranges and return to gross margins that were within our target range. \u2047 We're optimistic that our telecom strength will continue and the datacom trends appear to be bottoming. \u2047 In addition, we're excited to have achieved important milestones toward establishing a second new product introduction facility at Fabrinet Israel. \u2047 Combined with our continued leadership as a contract manufacturer for the most complex products, we are very excited about our future. \u2047 I will provide you with more details on our performance by end market and our financial results for Q1 as well as our guidance for Q2 for fiscal year 2020. \u2047 Total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $399.3 million and above the upper end of our guidance range. \u2047 Non-GAAP net income was $0.86 per share and was also above our guidance range even after a foreign exchange headwind of $1.9 million and the mark-to-market loss on interest rate swap contracts of $1.7 million. \u2047 These losses accounted for approximately $0.09 per share. \u2047 Now turning to the details of our P&L. \u2047 We were pleased to see non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter improve to 12%, a 20-basis-point increase from the fourth quarter as efficiency more than offset the impact of merit increases. \u2047 Non-GAAP operating expense was $11.6 million in the first quarter. \u2047 As a result, non-GAAP operating income was $36.2 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 9.1%, flat with the fourth quarter. \u2047 Taxes in the quarter were $2.2 million, and our normalized effective tax rate was less than 5%. \u2047 We expect our effective tax rate to be 5% to 6% for the full year. \u2047 Non-GAAP net income was above our guidance range at $32.2 million in the first quarter or $0.86 per diluted share as I indicated earlier. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, which includes share-based compensation expenses and amortizations of debt issuing costs, net income for the first quarter was $25.9 million or $0.69 per diluted share, also above the high end of our guidance. \u2047 Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. \u2047 At the end of the first quarter, cash, restricted cash and investments were $436.4 million compared to $444.7 million at the end of the fourth quarter. \u2047 Operating cash flow in the quarter was $2.6 million and with capex of $6.3 million, free cash flow was an outflow of $3.7 million in the first quarter. \u2047 During the quarter, our working capital increased to higher than normal level in support of major new program transfer. \u2047 This will begin to self-correct in the second quarter as we start to consume the transfer inventory and collect receivables. \u2047 We did not repurchase any shares during the first quarter. \u2047 As such, $62.2 million remain in our share repurchase program and we will continue to evaluate market condition to opportunistically repurchase shares when possible. \u2047 I would now like to turn to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2020. \u2047 As Seamus described, we expect a strong second quarter and anticipate that revenue will be between $408 million and $416 million. \u2047 From a margin perspective, we are optimistic that we will see efficiency continue to drive incremental improvements in non-GAAP gross margin within our target range of 12% to 12.5%. \u2047 From an earnings per share perspective, we anticipate non-GAAP net income per share in the second quarter to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.94 and GAAP net income per share of $0.74 to $0.77 based on approximately $37.7 million fully diluted shares outstanding. \u2047 In conclusion, we are excited with our strong performance in the quarter. \u2047 We remain very positive about our long-term prospects for continued leadership in the marketplace. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["fabrinet q1 earnings per share $0.69.
