{"article": ["I'm pleased that you're joining us for DXC Technology's second quarter FY '22 earnings call. \u2047 Our speakers on the call today will be Mike Salvino, our president and CEO; and Ken Sharp, our executive vice president and CFO. \u2047 In accordance with SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of these measures to their respective and most comparable GAAP measures. \u2047 A discussion of these risks and uncertainties is included in our annual report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings. \u2047 Today's agenda will begin with an update on our Q2 performance, which shows hard evidence that we are delivering on our transformation journey and building the foundation to make DXC operationally efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow. \u2047 Next, I will provide you with additional insights as to the operational work we are performing as we execute our transformation journey. \u2047 Then I will hand the call over to Ken to share our Q2 financials, guidance and more details of the financial results driven by our strong operational execution. \u2047 Regarding our Q2 performance, our revenues were $4.03 billion. \u2047 Our organic revenue growth continued to show progress as we improved from minus 3.7% in Q1 to minus 2.4% in Q2. \u2047 Also, I was very pleased to see that the GBS business segment grew for the second quarter in a row from positive 2% in Q1 to positive 3.4% in Q2. \u2047 We also continue to improve the organic revenue of the GIS business segment from minus 9.1% in Q1 to minus 8% in Q2. \u2047 Now all of these results show our organic revenue is on the right trajectory. \u2047 Our adjusted EBIT margin was 8.6% and was driven by the operational work that we are doing to optimize our business. \u2047 This is the third straight quarter of both improving organic revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q3. \u2047 Book-to-bill for the quarter was 0.91, which came in below our goal of one due to the timing of a couple of deals. \u2047 I'm happy to report that both deals are hybrid cloud/ITO deals and are now closed. \u2047 We continue to track to a book-to-bill over one year to date, and we expect to be back above 1.0 in Q3. \u2047 Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90 in the quarter, which is up $0.41, as compared to $0.64 a year ago. \u2047 Finally, we are encouraged by the strength of our Q2 free cash flow, which moved us into positive territory. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, we have now produced roughly $100 million in cash. \u2047 Now let me turn to the progress we are making on our transformation journey. \u2047 The first step is inspire and take care of our colleagues. \u2047 We are executing a people-first strategy, and attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth. \u2047 We know our strategy is working. \u2047 We saw a higher percentage of our employees complete our September employee engagement survey, and we are showing improved and stable engagement scores. \u2047 These engagement scores give us confidence that we have a motivated workforce, and we will be able to manage attrition, which we've seen an uptick. \u2047 To offset this increase in attrition and demand, we hired and onboarded more colleagues than any other quarter since I became CEO. \u2047 Key advantage to our hiring efforts is that we have implemented and are running a virtual-first model. \u2047 Hiring has been a focus for us and will continue. \u2047 While hiring improved, we left some open demand and project work unconverted. \u2047 And we are focused on capturing this moving forward. \u2047 Focus on the customers is the second step of our transformation journey and continues to be the primary driver of our success in improving our organic revenue growth. \u2047 A key metric that we measure is our Net Promoter Score, and we are seeing continued improvement. \u2047 The last time we gave you our NPS score was during the Investor Day in June, and it was 18, almost within the industry best practice range of 20 to 30. \u2047 Currently, our 12-month rolling NPS score is at the midpoint of the best practice range. \u2047 This is the most positive our customers have been since I arrived. \u2047 This improvement is due to our strong service delivery and gives us the ability to sell up the enterprise technology stack from our GIS business to our GBS business. \u2047 Now let me remind you that the way we will get to grow is to deliver the GIS services that are critical for our customers and build trusted relationships. \u2047 Once these trusted relationships are built, we can move our customers up the enterprise technology stack toward the services of our GBS business. \u2047 This is exactly what we are doing. \u2047 And the organic revenue trajectory of GIS, GBS and the overall business is great evidence that this strategy is working. \u2047 Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. \u2047 We continue to make progress in optimizing our cost and delivering for our customers without disruption. \u2047 I've already commented on some of the operational work we are doing like motivating our colleagues, hiring new talent and implementing a virtual-first model. \u2047 In addition to this work, we are also improving the efficiency of our service delivery, implementing better IT tools and actively managing our real estate footprint. \u2047 Let me provide you with some additional color considering the operational work we are doing with real estate. \u2047 This quarter, we closed our Tysons facility and are moving to a much smaller footprint in the D.C. area, where our colleagues that need to come into a facility will share a space versus having dedicated space. \u2047 This work emphasizes our commitment to a virtual-first model, reduce our carbon footprint and represents our desire to maintain a much smaller real estate footprint. \u2047 Jim will detail out the financial results of all of these operational work that, simply put, this work is allowing us to improve margins from 8% in Q1 to 8.6% in Q2 and gives us the confidence to increase our margin and earnings per share guidance for FY '22. \u2047 Next, seize the market is where we are focused on cross-selling for our existing customers and winning new work. \u2047 As I previously mentioned, we had two significant deals slip into Q3 and are now signed. \u2047 The great news about these deals is they were both hybrid cloud/ITO deals with long-standing customers. \u2047 Specifically, we are helping these customers modernize their existing IP estate and building new private cloud capability to run their mission-critical applications. \u2047 In Q2, 59% of our bookings were new work and 41% were renewals. \u2047 The new work continues to increase due to the focus on another piece of our strategy, which is our platinum customer channel. \u2047 Taking our offerings through this channel is another key foundation piece for growth. \u2047 We are now starting to see evidence that we are being successful taking Luxoft, which drives our Analytics and Engineering services through our platinum customer channel. \u2047 The evidence is that Analytics and Engineering grew 17.3% in Q2, which is clearly helping us create growth in our GBS business segment. \u2047 Now let me give you an example of what the Platinum customer of the future looks like at DXC. \u2047 We have a 14-year relationship with one of the world's largest specialty retailers. \u2047 Now before I arrived and implemented the strategy, our revenues were roughly $80 million per year, split a third GBS and two-thirds GIS. \u2047 By continuing to deliver our GIS services for this customer, we are offering the opportunity to sell our GBS services. \u2047 The result is we have increased the total revenue on this account by 13%, and the mix between GBS and GIS is now split 50-50 as we are now providing them Analytics and Engineering services. \u2047 We're in the early innings of this strategy, but we feel confident that we can implement this approach to our other Platinum customers, successfully delivering GIS services and growing GBS services to have the same or more revenue at better margins. \u2047 Turning to our quarterly financial performance on Slide 11. \u2047 As you can see, our progress continues. \u2047 Our organic revenue improved to a decline of 2.4% or a 130 basis point improvement from Q1. \u2047 This represents our third consecutive quarterly improvement. \u2047 As you can see, we have come a long way from double-digit organic revenue declines in Q1 FY '21 to low single-digit declines in FY '22. \u2047 Our adjusted EBIT margin continues to improve as well, delivering 8.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points as compared to the first quarter. \u2047 Year over year, our adjusted EBIT margins have expanded 240 basis points or 460 basis points, excluding the disposed businesses. \u2047 Our book-to-bill for Q2 was 0.91, below our goal of one due to timing and remains over one year to date. \u2047 Further, we expect to deliver a book-to-bill of over one for Q3 and for the full year. \u2047 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90, up $0.06 from Q1 and a healthy 41% increase as compared to the prior year. \u2047 Our earnings per share expanded due to increased margins, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. \u2047 Moving to our segment results on Slide 12. \u2047 Our GBS segment continued its strong growth performance, posting its second quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 3.4%, an improvement from 2% in the first quarter. \u2047 The GBS growth is a positive sign as we continue to deliver higher value for our customers. \u2047 Our GBS business has higher margins and lower capital intensity. \u2047 So as we grow this business, it has a more positive impact on margins and cash flow. \u2047 Our GBS margin was 15.9%, up 150 basis points compared to the first quarter and up 180 basis points compared to prior year. \u2047 Our GIS segment organic revenue declined 8%, a full 110 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter and improved 380 basis points compared to the decline from prior year. \u2047 GIS margins were 5.5%, an improvement of 390 basis points compared to prior year. \u2047 Turning to the enterprise technology stack. \u2047 Analytics and Engineering revenue was $520 million, up 17.3%. \u2047 Analytics and Engineering book-to-bill was 0.95 and 1.13 year to date. \u2047 We continue to see high demand in this area. \u2047 The Applications layer was up 1.5%, book-to-bill was 0.94 and 1.13 year to date. \u2047 BPS, our smallest layer of the enterprise technology stack, at $118 million of revenue, was down 13.7%. \u2047 Book-to-bill was 0.69 and 0.91 year to date. \u2047 Cloud and security revenue was $521 million, down 1.5%. \u2047 Book-to-bill was at 0.8 in the quarter and 0.82 year to date. \u2047 IT Outsourcing revenue was $1.05 billion, down 9.6%. \u2047 ITO book-to-bill was 0.81 and 0.92 year to date. \u2047 We expect our ITO decline to continue to gradually moderate as we move through FY '22. \u2047 The two deals Mike mentioned earlier that slipped out of Q2 that were subsequently closed were in the ITO and Cloud and Security layers of our technology stack and would have boosted our GIS book-to-bill for the quarter to over 1.1. \u2047 Lastly, Modern Workplace revenues were $581 million, down 10.9% as compared to prior year. \u2047 This is an improvement from last quarter when Modern Workplace was down 19.7% year over year. \u2047 Book-to-bill was 1.2 and 1.1 year to date. \u2047 Next up, let me touch on our efforts to build our financial foundation. \u2047 This quarter, we made particularly strong progress on strengthening our balance sheet and solidifying our financial position, cash generation and reducing restructuring and TSI expense. \u2047 As Mike pointed out earlier, we've made measurable improvements driving our business to improve our financial foundation that will ultimately allow us to increase our deployable cash affording us more opportunities to create value. \u2047 We reduced our debt from $12 billion to $5.1 billion. \u2047 The refinancing of all of our high rate bonds during the quarter culminates our collective efforts to transform the business, improve its trajectory and strengthen our balance sheet. \u2047 There is no similar and clear way of seeing the impact that Mike and his team have made improving the operations of the business than what was accomplished with our debt over the last year. \u2047 Net interest expense has been reduced from $83 million in the first quarter of FY '21 to $45 million this quarter. \u2047 With the full benefit of our refinancing, we anticipate interest expense to be reduced to approximately $33 million in Q3. \u2047 We also continue to deliver on reducing restructuring and TSI expense while increasing our margins. \u2047 This not only improves our cash flow, it also narrows the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. \u2047 Finally, capital lease and asset financing is an area that was overused. \u2047 In the last year or so, we've significantly curtailed new capital lease originations from $1.1 billion in FY '20 and are on track to reduce originations to approximately $500 million this year. \u2047 These efforts to better manage this form of financing allowed us to reduce our debt and ultimately our capital lease cash outflows from $245 million in Q1 FY '21 to $177 million this quarter. \u2047 We expect further reductions in our quarterly cash outflows to around $150 million per quarter at the end of FY '22 and further below that level going forward. \u2047 We delivered these reductions while also better managing capital expenditures. \u2047 Our capital expenditures were reduced from $225 million in Q1 FY '21 to $159 million Q2 FY '22. \u2047 Based on our reductions to capital lease originations, a more meaningful metric to demonstrate our progress is capex spend and capital lease originations as a percent of revenue. \u2047 Capex and capital lease originations as a percent of revenue were 10.2% for FY '20, 8% for FY '21 and now down to 5.3% for Q2 FY '22. \u2047 Delivering 5.3% is a good step forward related to better managing our capital spend as it gets us in the peer range, albeit at the top end and is a proof point of our improved operational rigor. \u2047 Returning to our debt on Slide 16, I want to spend a minute on our recent refinancing. \u2047 This chart shows how the refinancing further solidifies our financial position. \u2047 By extending maturities, we now have no bond maturities before FY '26, lowering maturity towers and reducing annual interest expense and cash outflows"], "gold_summary": ["q2 non-gaap earnings per share $0.90.  \u2047  q2 revenue fell 11.6 percent to $4.03 billion.  \u2047  reducing fy22 revenue guidance range due
