{"article": ["I'm Quynh McGuire, Vice President of Investor Relations. \u2047 You may access it via our website at www. \u2047 As indicated in our announcement, we've also posted materials to the Investor Relations page of our website that will be referenced in today's call. \u2047 References may also be made today to certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Joining me for our call today are Leroy Ball, President and CEO of Koppers; and Mike Zugay, Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 We'll start on Slide three where there's a save-the-date for our upcoming Investor Day scheduled to be in Pittsburgh on Monday, September 13, starting at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. \u2047 Now while there will be an option to join the meeting remotely, we hope that the current developments regarding COVID tamp down enough so that you feel comfortable enough joining us in person for this event. \u2047 Of course, we'll continue to closely monitor health and safety guidelines regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and we'll have appropriate safety protocols in place. \u2047 Invitation with specific details of the event will be distributed in the coming weeks. \u2047 Now as mentioned, we're also providing remote option to attend. \u2047 Now let's move on to Slide five. \u2047 Koppers continues to serve in an essential role, such as keeping railroads safe so they can transport critical goods, helping to provide power and connectivity to homes and businesses and keeping our infrastructure strong and reliable, both home and away. \u2047 Our team members take this responsibility seriously, and we are incredibly proud to do our part to keep the global economy moving and growing. \u2047 Now let's take a look at our Zero Harm activities and results, as shown on Slide seven, which details the changes in guidance recently outlined by the Center for Disease Control due to the rise in COVID-19 cases from the Delta variant. \u2047 The Occupational Safety and Health Administration followed suit, directing all U.S. employers to adhere to the CDC's updated guidelines, and we've communicated these updates to our employees and have adopted them at each of our applicable locations. \u2047 The primary driver of mask requirements is now based on a county-by-county measurement of disease transmission rates. \u2047 A high rate, which is red or significant rate, which is orange, means masks must be worn by all individuals indoors, regardless of whether they've been vaccinated fully, partially or not at all, or whether they've already been infected by COVID-19. \u2047 Koppers has also updated our Zero Harm lifesaving role to reflect these new requirements as described on Slide eight. \u2047 In the counties with high or significant infection rates, vaccinated employees must wear a mask in public indoor environments and unvaccinated employees must mask and social distance from others. \u2047 These same guidelines are in effect for employees returning to the office. \u2047 However, vaccinated employees do not need to mask, if alone in their office. \u2047 Intentional violations of life-saving rules could lead to disciplinary actions up to and including termination of employment. \u2047 Unfortunately, COVID is not going away quietly and with vaccination rates at our locations ranging anywhere from 22% to 76%, we need to continue to practice good behaviors to keep our people safe. \u2047 Another Zero Harm news, as seen on Slide nine, following delays due to the pandemic, we've begun reaching frontline employees directly by rolling out a series of Zero Harm in-person training workshops. \u2047 One of the first examples came when our Zero Harm trainer spent time with our railroad structures frontline employees in the Chicago area, conducting workshops, both in a classroom setting and in the field. \u2047 Similar trainings have been conducted in Galesburg and Guthrie with more sessions scheduled for the third quarter and the remainder of 2021. \u2047 The idea, as always, is to illustrate and illuminate specific steps to prevent exposure to unsafe conditions and practices, but also to an instill an epithet mindset, where every employ actively and intuitively is always looking out for other team members and placing safety first. \u2047 We continue to strongly promote employee vaccinations, addressing misinformation with a special video produced in partnership with the Allegheny Health Network here in Pittsburgh. \u2047 two expert physicians, neither of whom are affiliated with Koppers in any way, are featured in the video speaking about how the vaccines were developed and their safety and effectiveness. \u2047 Our purpose in sharing this video is to help overcome any hesitation or concerns among our unvaccinated employee population. \u2047 In addition, our $250 vaccination incentive remains in place. \u2047 On another note, the wildfires on the West Coast of the U.S. and Canada have continued their devastation and recently came close to our Koppers Ashcroft facility, forcing employees to evacuate. \u2047 Our operation was down for a total of 11 days as Wildcat Fire Services arrive to fight the fires and keep our people and our facilities safe. \u2047 The men and women of Wildcat and other fire services like them are amazing, heroic and every other superlative adjective you want to apply to them. \u2047 On Slide 10 through 15, we have a number of notable happenings that have occurred in the past quarter. \u2047 And I won't go through them in any detail, you can do that on your personal time, if you'd like. \u2047 So in the meantime, I would like to turn the program over to Mike to discuss the second quarter results. \u2047 Let's start on Slide 17, that shows consolidated sales were $441 million, an increase of sales from $437 million in the prior year. \u2047 Sales for RUPS were $196 million, down from $210 million. \u2047 PC sales rose to $146 million, up from $137 million, and CM&C sales came in at $100 million, up from $90 million. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 18. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $66 million or approximately 15%, up from $60 million or 14% in the prior year. \u2047 Compared to the prior year, adjusted EBITDA for RUPS was $12 million, down from $23 million. \u2047 PC EBITDA rose to $35 million, up from $29 million, and CM&C EBITDA improved to $19 million, up from $7 million. \u2047 On Slide 19, sales for RUPS were $196 million and declined from $210 million in the prior year. \u2047 This was primarily due to lower Class I crossties treating volumes and customers deferring purchases because of price increases associated with a temporary shortage of untreated crossties. \u2047 Some sawmills shifted their capacity to serve higher demand construction lumber. \u2047 These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the crosstie disposal business. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 20. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for RUPS was $12 million in the quarter compared with $23 million in the prior year. \u2047 This was driven by lower treating volumes, which resulted in reduced absorption of fixed cost. \u2047 We experienced lower volumes in our Utility business caused by transitioning the production from our former facility in Jasper, Texas to our Summerville, Texas plant. \u2047 Also higher raw material costs impacted profitability. \u2047 A bright spot was our Australian Utility pole business, which achieved higher margins in Q2. \u2047 On Slide 21, sales for PC were $146 million in the quarter compared to sales of $137 million in the prior year. \u2047 In Q2, we experienced strong -- continued strong international sales as well as price increases for copper-based preservatives in the Americas. \u2047 These positives were partially offset by lower treating levels in North America due to lumber treaters tightly managing their inventory as a result of high lumber prices. \u2047 On Slide 22, adjusted EBITDA for PC was $35 million compared with $29 million in the prior year. \u2047 The higher profitability can be attributed to higher sales volumes, lower raw material costs from our copper hedging programs and ongoing strong demand in the home repair and remodeling segments. \u2047 Slide 23 shows CM&C sales at $100 million for the quarter compared to sales of $90 million in the prior year. \u2047 The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher pricing for carbon black feedstock in Europe and for phthalic anhydride in North America, partially offset by lower volumes of carbon pitch in North America, which was due to a temporary plant outage, lower pitch volumes in Europe and lower pitch pricing in Australia. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 24. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for CM&C was $19 million in the quarter compared to $7 million in the prior year. \u2047 This increased profitability was driven by higher product demand, favorable pricing in certain markets, strong operational efficiencies and the receipt of an insurance proceed. \u2047 As demand continues to recover, our efficient cost structure will continue to drive higher margins. \u2047 Now let's review our debt and liquidity. \u2047 As seen on Slide 26, at the end of June, we had $760 million of net debt with $330 million in available liquidity. \u2047 We continue to project $30 million of debt reduction for 2021 and expect to be at a 3.1 times to 3.2 times net leverage ratio by year-end. \u2047 We remain comfortably in compliance with all debt covenants and have no significant debt maturities until 2024. \u2047 Our net leverage ratio dropped to 3.2 times at June 30, down from 3.5 times at December 31, 2020, and it also showed a significant decline from 4.5 times in the prior year quarter. \u2047 Long term, our net leverage goal continues to be between two times and three times. \u2047 Now I'd like to give a little bit more color on each of our business segments, which includes some feedback from our customers and our suppliers. \u2047 So starting with Performance Chemicals on Slide 28. \u2047 The moment we knew was coming at some point in time, began actually occurring in the midpoint of Q2 as the U.S. lumber market finally peaked and then began a precipitous descent. \u2047 Lumber futures are currently trading at 1/3 of their peak from mid-May, and everyone is still a little skittish as to where things are going in the near term. \u2047 This has led to treaters and retailers trying to push their high-cost inventory through the system while working hand to mouth on replenishment, so a not to find themselves heavy on inventory on the wrong side of a dropping market. \u2047 And while you can never quite be entirely certain, according to our industry contacts, we're at or near the bottom of this curve. \u2047 And it's correct and the treaters are expected to gradually increase their buying and treating activity within the next month. \u2047 To provide some perspective, while our Q2 was a record sales and adjusted EBITDA quarter for PC, we did see a 17% drop in sales from May to June and even more pronounced drop in EBITDA for that period as business pulled back. \u2047 Q3 thus far has been more of the same, but what we are being told is that as lumber pricing moderates, and people get back from their vacations, demand is expected to pick back up as DIYers and contractors push forward on their backlog of projects. \u2047 Also, we're generally seeing favorable demand in 2021 from our international markets, and they will exceed their pandemic effective 2020 results, which will help offset some of the reduced demand that we're seeing in North America currently. \u2047 In terms of gaining market share, we're seeing customer consolidations in 2021. \u2047 It should present new volume growth in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022, supported by our continued investments in capacity expansion. \u2047 From an overall macro standpoint, we're seeing favorable trends that continue to benefit our PC business overall. \u2047 Existing home sales in June increased 1.4% from May, marking sales higher than prior year by 22.9%, with all four major U.S. regions experiencing double-digit year-over-year gains according to the National Association of Realtors. \u2047 The leading indicator of remodeling activity states that spending on home renovation repairs will reach 8.6% annual growth and surpass $380 billion by mid-2022. \u2047 And in July, the Consumer Confidence Index stands at 129.1, the highest level since February of 2020, with consumer spending expected to support robust economic growth in the second half of this year. \u2047 Looking at the international markets on Slide 29. \u2047 We're working to expand PC sales in overseas markets like Chile, Brazil and others, even as Europe continues to deal with regulatory and supply chain issues. \u2047 We do expect copper costs to be higher year-over-year for mid-2022 and beyond, but we remain relatively protected with current hedges in place. \u2047 Now if the price of copper does not decline to pre-pandemic levels over the next year, then significant pricing adjustments will need to be put into effect to account for the increase in cost. \u2047 Slide 30 highlights our UIP business, where there's a lot of transition happening. \u2047 We've been working hard to bring our Summerville, Texas treating plant up on pole production as we exited our operating agreement for the TEC Jasper, Texas plant. \u2047 We shipped our first poles out of Summerville during the second quarter and are beginning to build our business organically in the Texas market, which has a lot of upside. \u2047 We expect demand to remain strong in the U.S. and Australia throughout the balance of this year, but we will likely experience some limited sales decline due to our Texas transition. \u2047 The good news is the sales that are being displaced, were low-margin business. \u2047 So therefore, EBITDA should improve as we begin building a bigger book of business for Summerville. \u2047 We benefit from the fact that utilities need to maintain their infrastructure to avoid service interruptions, a need brought into sharper focus as more people choose to work remotely. \u2047 And as such, infrastructure is spending for improving broadband availability and the utility grid is projected to increase. \u2047 Demand is also expected to increase for poles among U.S. utilities for project work and upgrades that were delayed by the pandemic. \u2047 Piling business also is opening up with new construction in the Mid-Atlantic region, which will provide additional opportunities. \u2047 Wood supply remains strong and pricing steady even as transportation costs increased due to rising diesel fuel costs and lack of third-party trucking. \u2047 We're working to pass our inflationary cost increases on, but are currently behind the curve and look to catch up as the year progresses. \u2047 And with production of Penta ceasing by year-end, we're capturing market share among customers transitioning to new preservatives by converting our facilities from penta treating to CCA and other wood preservatives. \u2047 We're currently in the middle of a conversion at our Vidalia, Georgia plant, and should have it back online by the end of this quarter with the conversion of our advanced Alabama plant lined up next. \u2047 In Australia, wildfires have provided a solid demand for poles as utilities need to update an aging network and infrastructure"], "gold_summary": ["q2
