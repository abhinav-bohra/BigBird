activity remained solid during the third quarter. \u2047 We continued to experience elevated demand and despite the return of some seasonality in the quarter, monthly demand has improved sequentially from August to September and October. \u2047 The macro drivers for market demand continued to be what we've experienced all of '21: limited housing supply, still extremely low interest rates and higher home buying activity from millennials and baby boomers who are experiencing life events associated with changes in housing needs. \u2047 New and existing resale housing supply remained tight, especially for affordable entry-level homes. \u2047 Mortgage interest rates are still very attractive as entry-level buyers are typically focused on monthly payment. \u2047 The low interest rates continued to offset higher ASPS and we are seeing elevated demand persist. \u2047 And lastly, we continued to see household formation for millennials and downsizing for baby boomers, both of which create demand for the type of housing that we build. \u2047 We believe these underlying demographic factors will not fundamentally change in the near future, and although they may be bumpy if interest rates move materially within a short period of time. \u2047 This quarter, we leaned on our deep vendor relations to navigate ongoing industrywide supply chain challenges. \u2047 These strategic supply side partnerships and our operating model focus on spec homes and limited SKUs, allowed us to deliver 3,112 homes, which set the company record for the highest third quarter of home closings. \u2047 We also set two additional quarterly company records: we generated the highest quarterly home closing gross margin of 29.7% in company history as a result of pricing power, more than offsetting the elevated lumber and other commodity costs; and our quarterly diluted earnings per share of $5.25 was the highest in our company's history. \u2047 We grew community count sequentially again this quarter as well as year-over-year, overcoming municipal delays and supply shortages and land development as well. \u2047 As of September 30, 2021, we had 236 ending communities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of 300 communities by mid-2022. \u2047 On slide four, I want to touch on the latest milestones we achieved this quarter. \u2047 The EPA recognized Meritage as a recipient of the 2021 Indoor airPLUS Leader Award. \u2047 Our advanced air filtration, ventilation and HVAC as well as spray foam insulation helped minimize the indoor exposure to airborne pollutants and contaminants. \u2047 So it's great to be recognized for these accomplishments nationally. \u2047 In terms of innovation, we launched self-guided tours in select locations to address customers' changing preferences when it comes to the home buying process. \u2047 Self-guided tours allow buyers to sign up for a no contact tour of our model homes on our website and then tour the home after-hours at their convenience. \u2047 We expect to have this program rolled out throughout the country in the coming months. \u2047 Additionally, we expanded our offering of digital financial services, so Meritage customers can now receive guaranteed on-demand homeowners' insurance quotes on their selected home on our website. \u2047 From an ESG perspective, we memorialized our human rights policy, which can now be found on our Investor Relations website, and stay tuned as we will have more to share on ESG -- on the ESG front before year-end. \u2047 Overall, it was another successful quarter, where our teams and supplier relationships helped Meritage deliver 3,112 homes. \u2047 Affordability was one of the cornerstones of our strategic shift in 2016, and we continue to be focused on today. \u2047 From land acquisition to operations, we look to maintain our entry-level products as an affordable home offering in the new home marketplace. \u2047 That being said, the sustained favorable pricing environment stemming from the elevated demand for our products over the past few quarters and the tight housing supply conditions led to ASP increase on orders, backlog and closings that are masking our ongoing product mix shift toward entry level. \u2047 Although order ASP grew 12% year-over-year, we experienced a deceleration in ASP growth sequentially this quarter, and the new product we'll be bringing on in 2022 and 2023 will allow us to continue repositioning our future communities down the ASP band. \u2047 During the third quarter, we continued metering our orders pace to align with the current production environment and supply chain challenges. \u2047 Even still, our average absorption pace remained elevated at 5.0 per month. \u2047 We were still typically able to sell inventory shortly after releasing it, but we are only releasing homes once we have visibility into our cost structure and confidence about closing times, which is a bit late in the process today due to supply constraints. \u2047 It is unclear when the current supply challenges will work themselves out. \u2047 We currently have no insight to suggest that it's on the near term, and therefore, we are continuing to model elongated cycle times for the foreseeable future. \u2047 Now turning to slide five. \u2047 Our third quarter closings totaled 3,112 homes. \u2047 They were up 4% over the prior year. \u2047 Entry-level comprised 78% of closings, up from 63% in the prior year. \u2047 For us, Q3 of last year was the quarterly peak of the surging housing demand since the start of COVID-19, resulting in our all-time highest third quarter absorption pace of 5.8 sales per month. \u2047 In 2021, we have been metering orders due to the well-documented supply chain issues. \u2047 As a result, the total orders of 3,441 for the quarter of 2021 reflected a decrease of 11% year-over-year, driven by a 15% decline in average absorption pace that was partially offset by a 5% increase in average communities. \u2047 Despite metering, our third quarter 2021 absorption pace currently remained elevated at five sales per month. \u2047 Entry-level comprised over 80% of quarterly orders, up from nearly 70% in the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Entry-level also represented 77% of our average active communities compared to 60% a year ago. \u2047 Moving to the regional level trends on slide six. \u2047 Our central region, which is comprised of Texas, led in terms of average absorption pace with 5.4 sales per month this quarter, which was 14% lower than prior year. \u2047 This decline was partially offset by a 5% greater average active communities, which together contributed to a 10% decline in order volume. \u2047 Third quarter order ASP increased 20% year-over-year given solid market conditions in Texas. \u2047 Our east region with the highest entry-level product mix with -- representing 80% of the average community was the only region to generate year-over-year growth in order volume of 3% despite metering as a result of an 8% increase in average active communities in the third quarter, which offset a 4% decrease in average absorption pace. \u2047 South Carolina opened several new communities later in the third quarter, which resulted in a 3.7 average absorption pace in the third quarter. \u2047 This was our lowest absorption pace in the company's quarter, despite South Carolina's orders increasing 11% over prior year. \u2047 Given healthy demand in the state, we anticipate the order pace will increase in the near future. \u2047 The west region's third quarter 2021 order volume had our largest decline at 24% year-over-year, mainly due to 25% lower average absorption pace to 4.9 per month. \u2047 Specifically, Arizona reduced its absorption pace from 6.5 per month in Q3 of 2020 to 4.8 per month this quarter as a result of supply chain challenges. \u2047 Colorado remained the lowest percentage of entry-level mix at 48% of its average active communities this quarter. \u2047 During the third quarter, California had the highest average absorption pace of all our states at 5.6 per month. \u2047 Given 100% of the average active communities are entry-level there, we continue to focus on affordability, particularly as it's our most expensive geography. \u2047 The third quarter order ASP increased 15% year-over-year in the west region. \u2047 Arizona and Colorado had the largest increase in order ASP in all our states at 26%. \u2047 So we are monitoring these markets to ensure we wire ASP to local market condition and continue to introduce products that is more affordable. \u2047 Overall, demand remained healthy in all of our markets. \u2047 Turning to slide seven. \u2047 Of our home closings this quarter, 74% came from previously started spec inventory, which increased from 71% a year ago. \u2047 We ended the quarter with nearly 2,100 spec homes in inventory or an average of 11.7 homes per community as we push to get homes in the ground. \u2047 This was an important improvement from approximately 2,300 specs or an average of 11.2 in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 At September 30, 2021, less than 5% of the total specs were completed versus our typical run rate of 1/3. \u2047 Having available spec is crucial to our business model, but even as we started over 3,400 homes this quarter, maintaining our goal of a four to six-month supply of entry-level spec has been challenging. \u2047 As we have been ramping up our new communities, we are working very hard to get enough spec started in all of them. \u2047 We didn't accomplish all that we wanted in Q3, but we expect to accelerate our pace in Q4. \u2047 We ended the quarter with a backlog of over 1,500 units as our conversion rate declined from 68% last year to 57% this year due to supply delays. \u2047 Although we believe our spec strategy and entry-level focus will drive the conversion up in the long-term when the supply chain normalizes, we expect current supply issues and the resulting slower backlog conversions to persist at least for the next couple of quarters. \u2047 During the third quarter, bottlenecks abound in various areas along supply chain, some on the front-end and others on the back-end, leading to an additional two weeks or so of construction cycle times sequentially from Q2 to Q3 this year. \u2047 In particular, windows and truss delays impacted our operations throughout the country. \u2047 As Steve mentioned, our operating structure and strong vendor partnerships have afforded us some advantage as we navigate these disruptions. \u2047 We reengineered our product a few years ago which limit our SKU count and planned libraries, allowing us to order material in bulk in advance. \u2047 We have also heavily invested in relationships with our vendors, which we have strengthened during the last couple of quarters. \u2047 We are maintaining constant communication and remain flexible to substitute or upgrade our SKUs or find alternative supplies as necessary. \u2047 We have been benefiting from our 100% spec building strategy for entry-level homes. \u2047 Pre-starting homes enable us to maintain a steady cadence of homebuilding construction and makes us a preferred partner to our trades This transparency and scheduling visibility as well as no structural changes makes our products simpler to build. \u2047 At times like these, we appreciate that we can leverage our spec building strategy and our operating model to continue to deliver our backlogs and get more homes started. \u2047 The 10% year-over-year home closing revenue growth to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2021 was the result of the 4% increase in home closings and 7% higher closing ASP despite the mix shift to more entry-level products. \u2047 The 820 bp improvement in third quarter 2021 home closing gross margin to 29.7% from 21.5% a year ago was driven by the price increases over the past several quarters as well as the leveraging of our fixed costs on greater home closing revenue. \u2047 The pricing power more than offset the increased cost of lumber and other commodities. \u2047 Today's more normal lumber cost will start to be reflected in our gross margin in early 2022, but will be partially offset by other increased commodity costs as well as the additional overhead burden in gross margin from our community count ramp up. \u2047 Once we're fully selling and closing from all 300 communities in 2022, we will be able to leverage the higher fixed overhead costs across the corresponding higher revenue. \u2047 We are also continuing to monitor the recent increases in lumber and the impact they may have on our 2022 gross margin. \u2047 Our SG&A leverage of 9.3% remained better than our 10% expectation and continued to benefit from both greater closing volumes and higher ASPs. \u2047 The 80 bps year-over-year improvement and SG&A leverage from 10.1% in the third quarter of 2020 also included lower brokerage commissions in 2021 and cost savings from technology innovations that particularly benefited our sales and marketing efforts. \u2047 We will continue to find ways to incorporate technology into our operations and expect to be able to better leverage our total SG&A on higher closing volumes in 2022 as well. \u2047 The third quarter 2021's effective income tax rate was 23.3% compared to 19.5% in the prior year. \u2047 Both years reflect reduced rates primarily from eligible tax credit on qualifying energy-efficient homes closed under the 2019 Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act. \u2047 Increased profit in states with higher tax rates and reduced benefit of the energy tax credit due to greater overall profitability for the company both contributed to the higher tax rate in 2021. \u2047 Higher closing volume, pricing power, expanded gross margin and the improved overhead leverage that we achieved this quarter all led to the 85% year-over-year increase in third quarter diluted earnings per share of $5.25. \u2047 To highlight a few year-to-date results through September 30, 2021, on a year-over-year basis, we generated an 85% increase in net earnings, orders decreased 1%, closing were up 15%, we had a 640 bp expansion of our home closing gross margin to 27.4%, and SG&A as a percentage of home closing revenue improved 90 bps to 9.4%. \u2047 As seen on slide nine, our balance sheet reflects ample liquidity and flexibility for further growth. \u2047 At September 30, 2021, our cash balance was $562 million compared to $746 million at December 30, 2020. \u2047 It was down just $184 million despite an $815 million increase in real estate assets over the same time. \u2047 Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 17.5% at September 30, 2021, remained low. \u2047 We still target a maximum ceiling of net debt-to-cap in the high 20s, which is in line with the quick asset turn we expect from our entry-level and first move-up offerings. \u2047 Our capital usage priority is still focused on growth. \u2047 The bulk of our cash will be spent on land acquisition and development and to get specs in the ground in our new communities. \u2047 We routinely repurchase shares to offset new grants and keep our dilution neutral. \u2047 As demonstrated in the third quarter, we will also continue to opportunistically repurchase incremental shares. \u2047 We repurchased over 95,000 shares during the quarter for $9."], "gold_summary": ["compname reports third quarter 2021 results,
