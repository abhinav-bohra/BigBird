Events. \u2047 Despite the challenging operating environment, our team remains steadfast in their dedication to fulfilling our mission of serving others by providing affordable, convenient and close to home access to everyday essentials, and I could not be more proud of their efforts. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, our priority has been the health and safety of our employees and customers, while meeting the critical needs of the communities we serve as an essential retailer. \u2047 Protective equipment dedicated certain store hours for the most vulnerable members of our communities and, most recently, removed barriers for our frontline associates to receive the vaccine. \u2047 In total, we invested approximately $248 million in response to the pandemic in 2020, including about $167 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible front-line employees to demonstrate our appreciation for their exceptional performance during an incredibly challenging year. \u2047 At Dollar General, we remain committed to being part of the solution, and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue supporting our customers through our network of more than 17,000 stores located within five miles of approximately 75% of U.S. population. \u2047 At the same time, we remain focused on advancing our operating priorities and strategic initiatives as we continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers and further position Dollar General for long-term sustainable growth. \u2047 To that end, we are excited to share an update on some of our plans for 2021. \u2047 First, we plan to further the rollout of several value-creating initiatives, including our non-consumables initiative, Fast Track and the completion of our initial rollout of DG Fresh. \u2047 In addition, while still early, we are very pleased with the results of our pOpshelf stores, which have far exceeded our initial expectations for both sales and gross margin. \u2047 As a result, we plan to accelerate our pace of new store openings for pOpshelf in 2021 and expect to incorporate this concept into a number of our larger format Dollar General locations as we look to capitalize on the significant growth opportunity we see for this differentiated concept. \u2047 We are also pleased to highlight key changes to our development strategy, including plans to build on the success of our Dollar General Plus Store or DGP, and the introduction of two new store formats, which we began testing in 2020. \u2047 Similar to our larger footprint, DGP concept, the first new format has selling space of approximately 8,500 square feet, which compares to about 7,300 square feet of selling space for our traditional store. \u2047 Beginning later this year, this new format along with our DGP concept will become our base prototype for nearly all new stores, replacing both our traditional and higher, cooler count DGTP format, allowing for a more optimized assortment and room to accommodate future growth. \u2047 Our second new format is even larger with approximately 9,500 square selling feet, and will be deployed opportunistically across new store relocation and remodel opportunities. \u2047 Notably, on average, our DGP and new store formats are outperforming the chain on a comp sales basis and have considerably higher sales volumes compared to both the traditional and DGTP store, which bodes well for the future as we look to increase their unit counts in the years ahead. \u2047 Finally, we are pleased to provide an update on a number of our new small box store opportunities we see available in the Continental United States, which represents an increase compared to our prior estimate. \u2047 Jeff will discuss these updates in more detail later in the call. \u2047 But first, let's recap some of the highlights for the fourth quarter and full year. \u2047 The quarter was once again highlighted by strong growth on both the top and bottom lines. \u2047 We're pleased that, for the quarter, our three non-consumable categories once again delivered a combined comp sales increase well in excess of our consumable business. \u2047 Of note, this represents our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year comp sales growth in our combined non-consumable categories, which we believe speaks to the strong and sustained momentum in these product categories. \u2047 From a monthly cadence perspective, comp sales in December increased in the high-single digit range with similar mid-teens growth in both November and January. \u2047 In total, fourth quarter net sales increased 17.6% to $8.4 billion, primarily driven by comp sales growth of 12.7%. \u2047 These results include significant growth in average basket size and units in particular, partially offset by decline in customer traffic. \u2047 And while customers continue to consolidate trips, on average, they are spending more with us compared to last year. \u2047 Once again, this quarter, we increased our market share in highly consumable product sales, as measured by syndicated data, driven by a meaningful increase in both units and dollars. \u2047 Importantly, our data suggests an increase in new customers this quarter as compared to Q4 of 2019. \u2047 These new customers continue to skew younger, higher income and more ethnically diverse, underscoring the broadening appeal of our value and convenience proposition. \u2047 We continue to be encouraged by the retention rates of new customers and we are working to drive even higher levels of engagement with more personalized marketing and continued execution of our key initiatives. \u2047 We're particularly pleased that we delivered significant operating margin expansion, which contributed the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.62, an increase of 24.8% over the prior year. \u2047 For the full year, net sales increased 21.6% to $33.7 billion, including net sales growth of 28.1% in our combined non-consumable categories. \u2047 Comp sales for the year increased 16.3%, representing our 31st consecutive year of same-store sales growth. \u2047 In 2020, we celebrated the opening of our 17,000 store and the launch of our newest store concept pOpshelf. \u2047 In total, we completed a record 2,780 real estate projects during the year, exceeding our initial target of 2,580 projects as we continue to build and strengthen the foundation for future growth. \u2047 From a position of strength, we also made targeted investments in other key areas, including the acceleration of certain strategic initiatives to strengthen our competitive position and further differentiate and distance Dollar General from the rest of the discount retail landscape. \u2047 Collectively, our fourth quarter and full year results reflect strong and disciplined execution across many fronts and further validate our belief that we are pursuing the right strategies to enable sustainable growth while creating meaningful long-term shareholder value. \u2047 As a mature retailer in growth mode, we are also laying the groundwork for future initiatives, which we believe will unlock additional growth opportunities as we move forward. \u2047 We operate in one of the most attractive sectors in retail. \u2047 And in an environment where customers continue to seek safe and convenient experiences, we believe our unique store footprint, further enhanced through our multiyear initiatives, provides a distinct competitive advantage and positions us well for continued success. \u2047 Overall, I am proud of our associates and all that we've achieved over the past year. \u2047 We feel very good about the underlying business and I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. \u2047 Now that Todd has taken you through a few highlights of the quarter and full year, let me take you through some of its important financial details. \u2047 Unless we specifically note otherwise, all comparisons are year-over-year. \u2047 All references to earnings per share refer to diluted earnings per share and all years noted refer to the corresponding fiscal year. \u2047 As Todd already discussed sales, I will start with gross profit, which was positively impacted in the quarter by a significant increase in sales, including the impact of COVID-19. \u2047 Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 32.5% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 77 basis points, which represents our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin rate expansion. \u2047 This increase was primarily attributable to: a reduction in markdowns as a percentage of sales, higher initial markups on inventory purchases, a greater proportion of sales coming from non-consumable categories and a reduction in shrink as a percentage of sales. \u2047 These factors were partially offset by: increased transportation and distribution costs, which were impacted by increased volume, some of which is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher transportation rates and discretionary employee bonus expense for our distribution center and private fleet employees. \u2047 SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2%, an increase of 48 basis points. \u2047 This increase was primarily driven by incremental costs related to COVID-19, including appreciation bonuses paid to our frontline retail employees and health and safety-related expenses as well as increased incentive compensation expense and hurricane-related expenses. \u2047 These items were partially offset by certain expenses, which were lower as a percentage of sales, including occupancy costs, retail labor and depreciation and amortization. \u2047 Moving down the income statement. \u2047 Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 21% to $872 million. \u2047 As a percent of sales, operating profit was 10.4%, an increase of 30 basis points. \u2047 Operating profit in the fourth quarter was positively impacted by COVID-19, primarily through higher sales. \u2047 The benefit from higher sales was partially offset by approximately $96 million or 110 basis points of incremental investments that we made in response to the pandemic, including approximately $69 million in appreciation bonuses for eligible frontline employees and additional measures taken to further protect our employees and customers. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% and compares to 23% in the fourth quarter last year. \u2047 Finally, as Todd noted earlier, earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 24.8% to $2.62, which contributed to full year earnings per share of $10.62, an increase of 59.9%. \u2047 Turning now to our balance sheet and cash flow, which remain strong and provide us the financial flexibility to further support our customers and employees during these unprecedented times while continuing to invest for the long term and provide meaningful returns to shareholders. \u2047 Merchandise inventories were $5.2 billion at the end of the year, an increase of 12.2% overall and 6.3% on a per-store basis. \u2047 While a lot of stocks remain higher than we would like for certain high-demand products, we continue to make good progress with improving our in-stock position and are pleased with our overall inventory levels. \u2047 In 2020, we generated significant cash flow from operations totaling $3.9 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion or 73.2%. \u2047 Total capital expenditures for the year were $1 billion and included our planned investments in new stores, remodels and relocations, distribution and transportation projects and spending related to our strategic initiatives. \u2047 During the quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock for $900 million and paid a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per common share outstanding at a total cost of $87 million. \u2047 With today's announcement of an incremental share repurchase authorization, we have remaining authorization of approximately $2.4 billion under the repurchase program. \u2047 Our capital allocation priorities continue to serve us well and remain unchanged. \u2047 Our first priority is investing in high-return growth opportunities, including new store expansion and our strategic initiatives. \u2047 We also remain committed to returning significant cash to shareholders through anticipated share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, all while maintaining our current investment-grade credit rating and managing to a leverage ratio of approximately 3 times adjusted debt to EBITDA. \u2047 Moving to our financial outlook for 2021. \u2047 We continue to operate in a time of uncertainty regarding the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on the economy, consumer behavior and our business. \u2047 Despite continued uncertainty, we are providing select annual guidance in an effort to provide the best view we reasonably can, based on what we currently know. \u2047 That said, there could be a number of potential headwinds and tailwinds this year, which are not incorporated into our guidance as the timing, degree and potential impacts on our business are currently unclear, including, but not limited to: the recently approved government stimulus package; other unknown external factors related to the ongoing health crisis, including its impact on consumer behavior and additional changes to minimum wage rates. \u2047 With this in mind, we currently expect the following for 2021: net sales in the range of a 2% decline to flat; a same-store sales decline of 4% to 6% but which reflects growth of approximately 10% to 12% on a two-year stack basis; and earnings per share in the range of $8.80 to $9.50, which reflects a compound annual growth rate between 15% and 20% or between 14% and 19% on an adjusted basis over a two-year period, which is well above our long-term goal of delivering at least 10% annual earnings per share growth on an adjusted basis. \u2047 Our earnings per share guidance assumes an effective tax rate in the range of 22% to 23%. \u2047 Capital spending is expected to be in the range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives and core business to support and drive future growth. \u2047 We also plan to repurchase a total of approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock this year, reflecting our strong liquidity position and confidence about the long-term growth opportunity for our business. \u2047 Let me now provide some additional context as it relates to our expectations. \u2047 Given the unusual situation, I will elaborate on our comp sales trends thus far in Q1. \u2047 Despite approximately 8,400 lost store operating days as a result of closures due to winter weather across the country, same-store sales for the month of February increased 5.7%, reflecting a healthy comp sales increase of 11.2% on a two-year stack basis. \u2047 From the end of February through March 16, comp sales decreased approximately 16% as we are in the midst of lapping our most difficult monthly comp sales comparison of the year. \u2047 As a reminder, comp sales growth for the month of March in 2020 was 34.5%. \u2047 Looking ahead, we remain cautious in our 2021 sales outlook, given the continued significant uncertainty that still exists as well as the unique comparisons against last year. \u2047 That said, as you think about the sales cadence of 2021, our performance is expected to be stronger in the second half, given a more difficult sales comparison in the first half and particularly in Q1. \u2047 Turning to gross margin. \u2047 In 2020, gross margins benefited from a greater proportion of sales coming from our higher-margin non-consumable categories, driven by a full year net sales percentage increase of these categories well in excess of our consumables business. \u2047 We expect our sales mix will ultimately shift toward our consumables categories in 2021, resulting in pressure on our rate. \u2047
