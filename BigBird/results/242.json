{"article": ["This is Alison Griffin, Vice President, Investor Relations. \u2047 With me on the call I have Byron Boston, Chief Executive Officer; Smriti Popenoe, President and Chief Investment Officer; and Steve Benedetti, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. \u2047 And with that, I now have the pleasure of turning the call over to our CEO, Byron Boston. \u2047 As CEO of Dynex, I'm very proud to report that in 2020 we delivered a 15.2% total economic return and a 17% total shareholder return. \u2047 I've been at Dynex for 13 years and no other year has demanded as much active decision making as 2020. \u2047 We stuck with our discipline and excelled. \u2047 We didn't just protect shareholders money. \u2047 We made money for our shareholders in 2020. \u2047 Our book value increased and we delivered a solid dividend. \u2047 This performance stands in contrast to most other mortgage REIT and many other investment alternatives for investors seeking income. \u2047 Now as you can see on Slide 5, Dynex has now delivered industry leading performance on a one-year, three-year and five-year basis. \u2047 And when you look at our long-term chart on Page 17, you can see that we have delivered solid returns through multiple market cycles during my tenure at Dynex Capital. \u2047 This performance reflects my distinct philosophy of how to manage a mortgage REIT for the long term and that same philosophy is guiding our investment approach today. \u2047 We believe in risk management first, followed by disciplined capital allocation. \u2047 As experienced and skilled investors, we have been cautious about leveraging lower credit illiquid assets since 2016. \u2047 When spreads are tight, this strategy looks attractive during short term, but ultimately crumbles when liquidity dissipates in a crisis. \u2047 This is what happened last year when the prices of illiquid assets dropped dramatically as COVID-19 intensified and creditors demanded more cash or margin in response. \u2047 The takeaway here is that, it was no surprise that the market reacted the way it did. \u2047 We witnessed the same reaction in every major crisis in recent memory. \u2047 The Dynex management team has successfully managed through these intensified risk events throughout our careers and we were prepared. \u2047 2020 was a challenging year, but in our opinion, not a black swan event. \u2047 As we indicated at the beginning of 2020, we saw the global risk environment intensifying. \u2047 So, we were prepared for increased volatility. \u2047 While it is impossible to predict the timing of specific events, we foresaw a higher risk profile building in the global financial markets. \u2047 Our experience and insight gave us the edge to actively manage our portfolio to provide our shareholders strong returns. \u2047 We managed our book exactly as we told investors we would. \u2047 For years, we have emphasized liquidity and diversity in our portfolio, and this discipline served us well in 2020. \u2047 Our 2020 performance was not a coincidence or good luck, but rather years of thoughtful planning around our portfolio and a team of talented people ready to actively manage the book of business in volatile times. \u2047 As a CEO and coach, I could not be prouder. \u2047 Now from a human capital perspective, we have a world-class team with unmatched skills and experience. \u2047 And 2020 was the year when the management team mattered more than anything. \u2047 Our team has weathered significant crises in the past and long-term capital management to the Great Recession. \u2047 And as we have learned again this past year, nothing surpasses experience. \u2047 We have the institutional knowledge to address many market disruptions and to identify new opportunities that may come along. \u2047 Our team is diverse, which is critical to our strategy. \u2047 Risks do not stay within borders, and our teams worldwide perspective is invaluable when dealing with a global crisis. \u2047 Now, COVID-19 disrupted many work environments, but we already had the advantage of enabling our people to work remotely long before it became a necessity. \u2047 Just as risk is border-less, so is talent. \u2047 Our employees were accustomed to working outside the office. \u2047 So, we remained calm, focused during the quarantine, filtered out the noise to actively manage our risk, and effectively maintained key relationships and the confidence with lenders, regulators and investors. \u2047 So in the past 12 months we have taken a strategic view on both sides of the balance sheet with the goal of being able to grow and scale the Company efficiently, and in a stakeholder-friendly manner. \u2047 We made several moves. \u2047 We retired two of our higher cost preferred stock issues and we replaced them with our new Dynex Capital Preferred C. And during the last two weeks, we issued approximately $56 million in common equity in line with our long-term strategy to grow our capital base. \u2047 It's very important to note the return environment is conducive for absorbing any costs associated with our capital activities. \u2047 Our ultimate goal is to increase our stock's liquidity and offer investors the opportunity to invest in Dynex via multiple products, including our fixed dividend C Preferred, and our higher yielding common stock. \u2047 We've been in business for 30 years and we are fully committed to delivering solid cash flow, and attractive total returns to our shareholders well into the future. \u2047 Now as a company, our greater purpose is to support two of our main stakeholders and constituencies, the individual savers and the communities across America. \u2047 We are building this company for the long term, because we believe in America, and our role in helping individual savers achieve a respectable return on their savings from financing of real estate assets. \u2047 The capital that we bring to the table is critical for housing and the real estate community. \u2047 As long as savers need cash income and housing and real estate finance exist in America, our business model will remain relevant and critical. \u2047 Most importantly, we are deeply committed to the highest ethical standards because savers need management teams with integrity as stewards of the capital. \u2047 Our management team operates with integrity and an unwavering commitment to our values and to supporting our community. \u2047 We take our fiduciary responsibility very seriously and strive to be good stewards of capital, transparent in our actions and good corporate citizen. \u2047 At Dynex, we are building a diverse and multi-generational organization with a 30-year vision that we believe will create enormous value for shareholders, stand the test of time and prepare us for the future. \u2047 I feel fantastic about 2020, and I'm very positive about 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Before I turn over the call, I want to highlight that we have promoted Smriti Popenoe to President of our Company. \u2047 And this is another reason that I'm excited as the CEO and a coach. \u2047 All of our stakeholders should be elated about her promotion, and what this means for the future of Dynex. \u2047 As I said earlier, we have a 30-year vision that include getting the right people in the right places with the right skill sets and experience. \u2047 The fourth quarter continued the excellent performance for the Company for 2020. \u2047 For the quarter on a per common share basis we recorded comprehensive income of $1.23, total economic return of $1.22 or 6.7% based on the beginning book value per share of $18.25 and core net operating income of $0.45. \u2047 For the year on a per common share basis, we reported comprehensive income of $2.88, total economic return of $2.73 and core net operating income of $1.94. \u2047 2020 performance was highlighted by active portfolio and risk management and dynamic capital allocation, which enabled us to take advantage of improving asset valuations over the year, and declining funding costs. \u2047 Realized and unrealized investment in TBA gains, net of hedges, were approximately $1.83 per common share, driving a large part of the comprehensive income and total economic return for the year. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, both comprehensive income and total economic return were bolstered by the strong performance of lower coupon RMBS during the quarter, particularly in TBA securities relative to associated hedges and to a lesser extent increasing value on CMBS IO securities. \u2047 Core net operating income sequentially declined from $0.61 last quarter to $0.45 this quarter, principally as a result of the smaller average balance of interest-earning assets and modestly declining asset yields. \u2047 In addition, general and administrative expenses increased $2.1 million during the fourth quarter from year end incentive compensation accruals reflecting a catch-up adjustment for accrued bonus expense for management's achievements of its corporate goals and objectives this year. \u2047 Net interest spread and adjusted net interest spread, both slightly declined by 2 basis points respectively quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Prepayments increased, but were well within expected ranges. \u2047 Agency RMBS prepayment speeds were 17.1 CPR for the quarter. \u2047 While overall portfolio CPRs including the CMBS portfolio were approximately 15.1 CPR. \u2047 Adjusted net interest spread continues to benefit from the favorable TBA dollar roll conditions versus on balance sheet repo. \u2047 As a reminder, the Company utilizes the perspective method for amortizing investment premiums, and as such, our results fully reflect the actual realized prepayments during the quarter and do not include cumulative catch up amortization adjustments that are based on long-term assumptions and could potentially distort near-term results. \u2047 As it relates to book value, the driver of the $0.83 per share increase during the fourth quarter was net gains from continued spread tightening on investment assets, particularly in both lower coupon TBAs and pools. \u2047 Treasury future hedges also helped to offset the impact on investment valuations from the sell-off in interest rates during the quarter. \u2047 We estimate that book value per common share at the end of January is up approximately 1%, inclusive of the impact of the capital raise announced last week. \u2047 We ended the year with investment assets, including TBA securities of $4.2 billion and leverage at 6.3 times shareholders equity similar to the end of the third quarter. \u2047 Overall investment assets, including TBA securities were down on an average basis by approximately 7% as compared to last quarter. \u2047 This quarter we added 15-year agency RMBS investments through TBA positions and overall the portfolio composition is approximately 84% RMBS investments, including TBA securities and approximately 16% invested in CMBS and CMBS IO. \u2047 Let me also mention that the tax character of the dividends on the Company's equity capital. \u2047 For 2020, dividends in both the preferred stock and common stock were a 100% capital gain income. \u2047 Let me start by saying that I appreciate the confidence that the Board and Byron has placed in me. \u2047 I'm honored and delighted to serve the Company's shareholders in my new role as the President. \u2047 I'm going to briefly cover our 2020 performance and then shift to our outlook for 2021. \u2047 In extreme volatility events like March 2020, there can be a lot of risk and with that comes opportunity. \u2047 With thorough planning and expecting the probability of such events, we were positioned with higher levels of liquidity. \u2047 We successfully managed the portfolio rapidly in February before conditions deteriorated, positioned ourselves to weather the extraordinary market events of March, and rebalanced our investments in April to take advantage of the remarkable recovery in asset prices through year end. \u2047 Our annual total economic return of 15% is only the third best in Dynex's history since 2008, but it is remarkable in that it was earned in an outlier year like 2020. \u2047 Moving on to 2021. \u2047 I'll start with a summary of our macroeconomic view. \u2047 To deal with the pandemic and its after effects, central banks have implemented highly accommodative policies, designed to increase employment, increase inflation and put the economy on a growing trajectory. \u2047 A flood of unprecedented liquidity has raised the price of financial assets globally. \u2047 Governments around the world are also implementing debt financed fiscal policy to close the gap on lost GDP from the pandemic and to drive future growth. \u2047 This is likely going to lead to a period of massive deficits. \u2047 Against this backdrop of unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus, we have the health crisis that much of the globe is still dealing with. \u2047 In the near term, we expect to see a period where there is a tug-of-war between the negative impacts of the pandemic and the positive impacts of the vaccine. \u2047 In the medium term, the stimulus plus the impacts of more vaccination could eventually lead to a period of higher growth, as more of our services-driven economy is able to come back online. \u2047 The Fed also remains committed to a broad recovery in employment, and an overshoot of inflation over 2%. \u2047 In the long term, we believe the world has been permanently reshaped by the pandemic and its impact will continue for many years to come across broad segment of our economy and many aspects of our daily lives. \u2047 This will continue to be a focus for Dynex in our macroeconomic process. \u2047 Right now, our macroeconomic view leads us to prepare for a somewhat bumpy transition to a steeper yield curve as one of the more probable scenarios for 2021. \u2047 We believe this is also a more favorable environment for higher returns. \u2047 Turning now to our current positioning and economic return outlook. \u2047 Our goal is always to manage the balance sheet to generate a total economic returns to meet or exceed the dividend. \u2047 Rather than think solely about core earnings versus the dividend, we are focused on capital preservation and generating returns over the long term. \u2047 Our experience shows that this focus results in higher total shareholder returns and creates long-term value for shareholders. \u2047 We believe the broader investment environment remains favorable with financing costs anchored well into 2022 and beyond. \u2047 First, financing costs are anchored well into '22 and beyond, agency MBS are liquid, lower risk assets. \u2047 And third, we believe the market will evolve to a steeper curve environment that is ideal for earning wider net interest spreads. \u2047 We expect returns to move into the 10% to 12% range and could offer mid-teens returns if spreads widen. \u2047 We are entering this period with solid performance quarter-to-date. \u2047 Book value since year-end is up about 1% net of the equity rate. \u2047 We have a strong liquidity position of $375 million and tremendous upside earnings power on the balance sheet. \u2047 Leverage stands slightly over 6 times today and we still believe a liquid strategy is appropriate for the environment. \u2047 Let me explain why we believe a steeper curve is possible. \u2047 While financing costs are expected to stay close to zero through 2023, the back end of the yield curve will face pressure from treasury issuance, possible increases in realized inflation and expectations for inflation, as the economy begins a path to recovery and gains traction in the second half of 2021. \u2047 This will likely result in higher long-term treasury yields. \u2047 A steeper yield curve is a very positive factor for net interest spread expansion as it offers a chance to invest at higher yields, especially as prepayments slow. \u2047 In steeper yield curve environments, agency RMBS spreads also tend to widen because they now have"],
