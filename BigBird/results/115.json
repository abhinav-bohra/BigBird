{"article": ["These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, recent current reports on Form 8-K, and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. \u2047 Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of special items. \u2047 Last quarter, we discussed a longer view of a recovering market and our confidence in a multi-year upcycle. \u2047 I am pleased that the steady march of activity and Halliburton's performance in the third quarter internationally and in North America, all reinforce our enthusiasm today and for what we expect in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of both our strategy and our execution as the market recovery accelerates. \u2047 Here are some highlights. \u2047 Total company revenue increased 4% sequentially, with top-line improvements across all regions, while adjusted operating income grew 6% with solid margin performance in both divisions. \u2047 Our completion and production division revenue grew 4%, driven by increased global activity. \u2047 Operating margin was essentially flat in the third quarter as we made operational choices to prepare for higher demand for our services in 2022. \u2047 Our drilling and evaluation division revenue grew 4%, with increased activity across multiple regions. \u2047 Operating margin of 11% was about flat sequentially. \u2047 North America revenue increased 3% as growth in US land was partially offset by a decline in our Gulf of Mexico business due to Hurricane Ito. \u2047 International revenue grew 5% sequentially, in line with the international rig count growth. \u2047 Our year-to-date free cash flow generation of almost $900 million puts us solidly on track to deliver our full-year free cash flow objective. \u2047 Finally, we retired $500 million of our long-term debt and ended the quarter with $2.6 billion of cash on hand. \u2047 As this upcycle unfolds in both the international and North America markets, Halliburton is executing on our strategy to deliver profitable growth and generate industry-leading returns. \u2047 In the international markets, third-quarter activity momentum continued, and I believe it will accelerate into year end and support mid-teens second-half revenue growth compared to the second half of last year. \u2047 This expected outcome is better than we anticipated a quarter ago. \u2047 In the third quarter, we started long-term projects across all regions in spite of COVID-19 interruptions. \u2047 While mobility restrictions and daily precautions remain in place, business activity around the world has adjusted and continues to improve. \u2047 In the Middle East, countries relaxed border restrictions and OPEC members prepared for activity increases. \u2047 We started to work on several rigs, offshore UAE, mobilized a workover project in Bahrain and completed multiple ESP installations on our artificial lift contract in Kuwait. \u2047 We expect the Middle East to exit the year with solid activity momentum. \u2047 In Asia Pacific, we launched operations on an integrated project offshore Malaysia, with full implementation of Halliburton's digital well construction capabilities. \u2047 We also ramped up for an increase in our Indonesia drilling operations, where the local NOC plans to boost production from its assets. \u2047 In Europe/Africa/CIS region, the start of operations on a 23-well offshore integrated development campaign for Woodside and Senegal marked a new country entry for Halliburton. \u2047 In Russia, we are mobilizing for a multi-year IOC-operated project on Sakhalin Island. \u2047 In the UK sector of the North Sea, work continues on several new development drilling and workover projects for local independent operators. \u2047 Finally, Latin America delivered its best quarterly performance since 2015. \u2047 We spudded the first well on a three-year integrated project in Brazil, deployed our new drilling technologies on multiple wells in Argentina and prepared to mobilize for new work in Ecuador and Colombia. \u2047 In addition to contract start-ups, our pipeline of new tenders continues to grow. \u2047 While large Middle East tenders and Latin America projects receive most of the headlines, Customers in Africa, Russia, and Southeast Asia, among others, are also issuing tenders for new work. \u2047 All of this points to increasing international customer urgency and demand for our services. \u2047 Let me describe what I am seeing that gives me this conviction. \u2047 Global supply and demand balance continues to tighten, resulting in a strong commodity price environment. \u2047 In response, asset owners are eager to reverse baseline production declines caused by multiple years of underinvestment. \u2047 We expect that NOCs and other operators with short-cycle production opportunities will commit additional capital and gain share to meet future oil demand. \u2047 Additionally, new fields are smaller and more complex where customers work harder to produce more barrels. \u2047 Finally, as mature assets change hands, new owners move quickly to revitalize the assets they acquire and unlock remaining reserves. \u2047 They require service partners who can deliver proven technology and decades of experience. \u2047 All of these things have one thing in common: they require higher service intensity, more dollars spent on the wellbore rather than on infrastructure. \u2047 As the international recovery accelerates, we remain committed to a clear strategic priority, deliver profitable growth. \u2047 And we had unique competitive advantages to deliver on this priority. \u2047 We have the established footprint, geographic presence, and customer and supplier relationships to capitalize on growth. \u2047 We have a strong presence in all major international markets. \u2047 The substantial majority of our workforce is local. \u2047 And within the regions where we operate, our supply chain spend is primarily with local suppliers. \u2047 We have proven capabilities to ramp up our services as customers enter new markets. \u2047 We demonstrated this in Guyana, Suriname and, most recently, in Senegal. \u2047 The Halliburton team mobilized personnel and built a multifunctional operational base to support Woodside as we embark together on a development campaign offshore Senegal. \u2047 We also engineer innovative solutions both digital and hardware to meet the complex reservoir challenges faced by our international customers. \u2047 For example, in well construction, this quarter, we introduced the iStar comprehensive measurement platform. \u2047 This next-generation intelligent platform provides multiple logging and drilling measurements that enabled reservoir evaluation, faster drilling, and consistent well delivery. \u2047 For multiple customers in the Middle East and North Sea, the iStar platform provides insight into the impact of drilling parameters on wellbore conditions and optimizes the drilling process in real time. \u2047 In completions, we are the global leader in downhole completion solutions. \u2047 As our customers increase their activity, our e-completions ecosystem integrates manufacturing, digital twins, and technology development processes to increase our speed to market for these long lead complex systems. \u2047 In many regions, as customers drive for better performance in the face of increasing operational challenges, I expect adoption of integrated and bundled contracts will continue to grow. \u2047 Halliburton has strong project management capabilities and a proven track record that deliver efficiencies and reduce total customer cost of ownership. \u2047 Our digital innovations reframe customer project economics through greater efficiencies and improved decision-making. \u2047 For example, in the third quarter, we deployed our Well Construction 4.0 digital solution to deliver further operational efficiencies for our customer in the Middle East. \u2047 Finally, our customers calling us for collaboration from an IOC looking to reduce emissions on its operations in Mexico to a European independent working to remotely monitor and control all of its global drilling operations. \u2047 Halliburton's value proposition to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers is working for both our customers and Halliburton. \u2047 Now turning to North America. \u2047 The bifurcation between public and private company activity continued in the third quarter. \u2047 Public E&Ps remain committed to their spending plans for 2021 while private operators continue to take advantage of a strong commodity price environment. \u2047 As expected, completions growth moderated in the third quarter as operators shifted their focus from completions to drilling activity. \u2047 Just like in the international markets, customer urgency and demand for our services keep growing in North America. \u2047 Drilled but uncompleted well counts reached the lowest level since 2013 as operators depleted the surplus of DUCs accumulated in 2020. \u2047 We expect customers to drill and complete more new wells to offset steep base decline rates and deliver production into an anticipated attractive market next year. \u2047 Completions equipment availability is tightening. \u2047 Customers have responded by starting the 2022 tender process earlier in an attempt to lock in access to quality services for next year's programs. \u2047 Private companies now operate about 60% of the US land rig count, and current commodity prices provide a strong incentive for their activity to expand. \u2047 Our market-leading position in North America is rooted in the groundbreaking technologies we put to work in this market. \u2047 We are the only fully integrated service provider in North America, and this gives us a unique competitive advantage. \u2047 We combine the full breadth of our technology disciplines, geosciences, physics, chemistry, material science, and mechanical, electrical, and software engineering to deliver innovative solutions at scale around the world and uniquely in North America to maximize production and minimize costs. \u2047 Our SmartFleet intelligent fracturing service has transitioned from pilot to campaign mode. \u2047 Several large operators today have SmartFleet working on multi-pad completion programs. \u2047 SmartFleet, for the first time, allows operators to measure treatment placement in real time, which, among other things, has demonstrated up to 30% improvement in cluster uniformity. \u2047 In the third quarter, we introduced the IsoBond Cement System and pumped it for multiple customers in the DJ Basin and in the Marcellus Shale. \u2047 By removing liquid additives, this dry blended cement provides significant operational efficiencies and lowers capital requirements for land operations. \u2047 Taking advantage of the increasing demand for our services require strategic execution on many fronts, particularly in the current environment of stretched supply chains, tight labor, and inflationary pressures. \u2047 Against that reality, I believe that Halliburton is best prepared to provide reliable execution for our customers. \u2047 Our sophisticated supply chain organization translates Halliburton's size and scale into real savings for us and our customers. \u2047 We are seeing that in action as our supply chain delivers what our customers require for their projects. \u2047 The labor market is tight today. \u2047 We have seen this situation before, and our human resources team knows how to navigate it. \u2047 Over the last few years, we compressed our onboarding time, strengthened our national recruiting network and use digital solutions to significantly reduce our field personnel requirements. \u2047 Despite real challenges, we have the scale, speed, and systems to recruit talent nationally and quickly deploy it for our customers. \u2047 In logistics, we have ready access to a fleet of drivers to make deliveries to the job site. \u2047 We expanded our collaboration with Vorto, an artificial intelligence supply chain platform. \u2047 Our early adoption of Vorto's platform that connects drivers, asset owners, and maintenance yards, allows us to effectively manage trucking inflation and availability constraints. \u2047 Now let me spend a few minutes on our activity and pricing outlook for 2022. \u2047 First, in the international markets and then in North America. \u2047 Next year, we expect international activity momentum to accelerate an international leading-edge pricing to move upward in pockets as a result of higher activity. \u2047 This is what we are seeing today. \u2047 Large tenders remain competitive, but we are already seeing modest price increases on discrete work in underserved markets. \u2047 We see increasing customer demand for Halliburton's high-end technology and a recognition of its value. \u2047 Finally, as a result of lower spending by service companies for more than half a decade, international markets face tightening equipment supply. \u2047 To meet these demands, we are strategically reallocating assets to drive improved utilization and returns. \u2047 Let me be clear. \u2047 Halliburton prioritizes profitable growth internationally, and this will drive our capital allocation decisions to the best returning product lines, geographies, and contracts. \u2047 In North America, we expect customer spending to increase in and around 20% next year, including solid net pricing gains. \u2047 Many factors drive that spending and pricing, including customer urgency, equipment tightness, and the desire to align with a reliable and differentiated service provider like Halliburton. \u2047 Last quarter, we highlighted the pricing traction that exists for low emission equipment. \u2047 Today, as we tender for 2022 work, we're seeing price increases for the rest of our fracturing fleet as well. \u2047 Net pricing has also increased across different nonfrac product service lines: drilling, cementing, drill bits, and artificial lift. \u2047 To generate the highest returns as this market grows, we are taking steps to maximize the value of our North America business. \u2047 Specifically, we are repositioning our fracturing fleets to customers in areas where we can maximize returns in 2022, securing longer-term premium pricing contracts for our existing and planned electric fleets and accelerating fleet maintenance and deployment of the next-generation fluid end technology, which extends the life of our equipment. \u2047 Halliburton is committed to North America, and I expect we will benefit more than others as activity and pricing momentum accelerates across the board. \u2047 Next, let me turn to how we are executing on our strategic priority to advance a sustainable energy future. \u2047 As we are witnessing now and saw in the third quarter, the world requires a greater supply of oil and gas. \u2047 As an oilfield services company, we have the core competency to help our customers to deliver the supply in the most efficient and technologically advanced ways possible. \u2047 With our customers, we are bringing our technical expertise and over a century of industry experience to actively participate in the transition to a cleaner economy. \u2047 One of the most meaningful contributions we can make today to this transition is to help our customers reduce emissions from their existing production base. \u2047 Emissions reduction is a critical part of our technology development process, and our innovative low-carbon solutions are helping oil and gas operators reduce their carbon footprint. \u2047 Halliburton's electric fracturing solution delivers results now for our customers. \u2047 In the third quarter, Halliburton completed an all-electric pad operation on a multi-year contract with Chesapeake Energy in the Marcellus Shale. \u2047 We deployed our electric fracturing spread with electric blending, wireline and ancillary equipment and an advanced power generation system from VoltaGrid. \u2047 This high-performing solution reduced Chesapeake's emission using over 25 megawatts of lower-carbon power generation from Chesapeake's local field gas. \u2047 We are collaborating with an IOC in Mexico on their total carbon footprint reduction because we provide both well construction services and logistics services on this contract. \u2047 We changed supply boat fueling mechanisms and optimized usage to achieve emissions reductions in the first year of operations. \u2047 We are now using a similar contract structure to collaborate with this IOC on its other projects in Latin America. \u2047 We are also advancing renewable energy solutions through Halliburton Labs, our clean energy accelerator. \u2047 In the third quarter, we doubled our size by increasing the number of Halliburton Labs companies from four to eight, welcoming Alumina Energy from California, Ionada from Ontario and Parasanti and SurgePower Materials from"], "gold_summary": ["q3 revenue $3.9 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $3.92 billion.  \u2047  completion and
