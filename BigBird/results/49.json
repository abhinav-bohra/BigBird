{"article": ["I'll begin by sharing a few thoughts on our business performance and our operations. \u2047 As mentioned on our last earnings call, we expected sales to improve in the third quarter. \u2047 Sales were $113.8 million in the quarter, down 2% in the third quarter of 2019 and up 35% sequentially. \u2047 Third quarter gross margin was 32.4% compared to 32% in the same period in 2019, up 40 basis points and up 80 basis points sequentially from the second quarter of this year. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.34, up 17% from $0.29 in the third quarter of last year and up from $0.18 in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 We delivered an EBITDA -- an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19%, up 230 basis points from 16.7% in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 New business wins were $127 million in the third quarter, and we added seven new customers. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $132 million in cash and $106 million in debt. \u2047 Operationally, all our plants are running. \u2047 We continue to experience challenges at our Mexico locations. \u2047 Since last quarter, those facilities have improved from approximately 60% capacity to more in the range of 90%. \u2047 We are monitoring local changes to COVID-19 restrictions at one of those facilities and at our Ostrava facility in Czech Republic. \u2047 Ashish Agrawal is with me for today's call and will take us through the safe harbor statement. \u2047 To the extent that today's discussion refers to any non-GAAP measures under Regulation G, the required explanations and reconciliations are available in the Investors section of the CTS website. \u2047 I will now turn the discussion back over to our CEO, Kieran O'Sullivan. \u2047 As we navigate to COVID-19, our employees are supporting and helping the less fortunate in our local communities, something we're very proud of. \u2047 Our employees also continue to demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness throughout our operations to support all customers. \u2047 Our first focus continues to be the safety of our employees and compliance with state and local regulations. \u2047 We are adapting our business and processes to focus on our priorities, driving profitable growth, strengthening our go-to-market, enhancing our operational capabilities and advancing our leadership talent and culture. \u2047 The restructuring plan we announced on the last earnings call is progressing to plan and is expected to deliver an annualized earnings per share improvement of $0.22 to $0.26 by the second half of 2022. \u2047 More importantly, we are focused on returning to growth, targeting 10%, in line with our strategic plan, 5% organic and 5% through strategic acquisitions. \u2047 We remain focused on our strategic growth investments as part of our planning for 2025. \u2047 Growing our business and expanding our range of products that sense, connect and move is the priority. \u2047 New business awards were $127 million for the quarter, the best quarterly performance this year. \u2047 We added seven new customers in the quarter, four in industrial and one each in defense, medical and telecom. \u2047 In transportation, we were awarded a large passive safety sensor award for an electric vehicle application in the China market. \u2047 We also secured multiple OEM accelerated awards with customers in Asia, Europe and a global platform win with a North American OEM. \u2047 These recent wins are leveraging our inductive technology, which is a key enabler for growth to meet mid- and high-end product requirements. \u2047 We secured an additional ride height sensing award with the same customer. \u2047 Cumulative, EV and hybrid wins this year are approximately $75 million, and we expect further gains. \u2047 Last quarter, we reported our first win with current sensing. \u2047 We aim to expand this application in other regions. \u2047 In defense, we were awarded contracts with several Tier one customers for sonar applications. \u2047 More recently, we developed and secured a new sample order for an ordinance application. \u2047 In Europe, we seek to gain share by building relationships with new customers. \u2047 We are leveraging our footprint and capabilities in Denmark and the Czech Republic, where we recently received sample orders with two new defense Tier one customers. \u2047 With temperature sensing, we secured a small initial order for an application in electric vehicles. \u2047 The sensor is part of the charging circuit for the battery management system. \u2047 In the precision frequency product line, we were selected for a design win in a 5G small cell application for systems in multiple countries, and also secured the distribution order. \u2047 We secured a multiyear design award for a low-power crystal product in a defense application. \u2047 We continue to advance product innovations. \u2047 Our focus in the transportation market, as we have stated previously, is to develop sensor solutions that are agnostic to the underlying propulsion technology, strengthening our growth in the next decade as hybrid and electric vehicle penetration grows. \u2047 EVs are expected to be less expensive than internal combustion engines in the 2025 time frame as battery costs decline. \u2047 15 countries and two U.S. states have announced phase outs of internal combustion engines in the 2030 to 2040 time period, with Norway aiming for 2025. \u2047 We expect EV penetration to reach 9% by 2025 and 22% by 2030. \u2047 Our innovations are in the areas of electronic braking, new accelerator interfaces and high-performance temperature applications. \u2047 We continue to research new material formulations as we target growth in defense, industrial and medical markets. \u2047 In defense, our primary focus is on the solar market for forward and towed arrays. \u2047 In industrial, we target in-jet printing, flow and position as well as nondestructive testing. \u2047 In medical, the primary focus is medical ultrasound, intravascular medical ultrasound, ultrasonic therapy and scalpel applications. \u2047 We continue to advance our traditional position sensing for industrial applications and new encoder product for medical equipment. \u2047 The developments for ultra-low life high frequency TCXOs and OCXOs for millimeter wave and sub-6 gigahertz systems are progressing as we continue to gain design awards through a major telecom OEM. \u2047 While the M&A environment has become a little more challenging due to COVID and associated travel restrictions, we are adapting and continue to strengthen our pipeline of opportunities. \u2047 We seek to expand our range of technologies, products, customers and geographic reach. \u2047 We continue to make progress on our foundry operations and expect to have completed the improvements this year. \u2047 The team is making steady progress on process controls into subsequent efficiencies. \u2047 The Focus 2025 initiative has an important emphasis on building stronger customer relationships. \u2047 As part of this initiative, we are improving our go-to-market capabilities, skills and sales incentive plans to place a stronger focus on profitable growth. \u2047 We are working to improve the quality of the sales funnel, optimize our end market approach, target new accounts and align our functional areas to be more responsive and solution-oriented in line with our core values. \u2047 As part of our realignment on profitable growth, we are evaluating the product portfolio for longer-term growth and margin expansion. \u2047 We have moved from a period of sharp decline in the second quarter to a time of uncertainty as the inventory levels are rebalanced and the market responds to high unemployment and other economic challenges. \u2047 In the U.S., the seasonally adjusted growth rate for 2020 is closer to 13 million units, down 21% for last year. \u2047 We expect next year to be in the 14 million unit range. \u2047 On-hand days of supply are now at 55 days, down from 65 days of supply in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 European sales are forecasted to decline 24% from last year, and we expect 18.7 million unit levels in 2021. \u2047 The China market continues to be more robust, with volumes predicted to be down 9%, in the 21 million to 22 million range for this year and up to 24 million units next year. \u2047 There are signs, the commercial vehicle market may be on an improving trend as freight fundamentals continue to improve. \u2047 It's a little early to say how sustainable this improvement will be. \u2047 We continue to see stronger growth in industrial and defense markets. \u2047 We remain cautious on market conditions in the next several quarters. \u2047 We expect to resume annual guidance for fiscal year 2021 in February. \u2047 Our liquidity remains solid. \u2047 We view this challenging time period as an opportunity to strengthen our capabilities. \u2047 Now Ashish will walk us through our financial performance in more detail. \u2047 Third quarter sales were $113.8 million, down 2% compared to last year. \u2047 Sequentially, sales rebounded strongly, up 35% from the second quarter. \u2047 Sales to transportation customers decreased by 9% year-over-year. \u2047 However, sequentially, we grew by 71%. \u2047 Sales to other end markets increased by 10% versus Q3 of 2019 and 5%, sequentially. \u2047 Our temperature sensing acquisition had solid growth and added $6.6 million. \u2047 Organic sales to non-transportation customers were up 4% versus last year. \u2047 We experienced double-digit growth in sales to both the defense and industrial end markets. \u2047 As expected, the medical end market was soft. \u2047 Our gross margin was 32.4% for the third quarter, up 80 basis points compared to last quarter and up 40 basis points compared to last year. \u2047 Conditions remain uncertain due to the impact of COVID. \u2047 And we are maintaining a focus on cost efficiency and capability to ramp production up or down. \u2047 As a result of improved revenue and careful cost management, adjusted operating earnings were 13%, up 170 basis points from last year and up 450 basis points sequentially. \u2047 As Kieran mentioned, we are making progress on the restructuring plan we initiated a few months ago. \u2047 We will update you on the improvements as we complete various parts of the plan in the coming quarters. \u2047 Our year-to-date tax rate was approximately 24%, and we expect the full year rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%, excluding discrete items. \u2047 Third quarter 2020 earnings were $0.34 per diluted share. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per diluted share were also $0.34 compared to $0.16 last quarter and $0.29 in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Focusing on the balance sheet. \u2047 Our working capital -- our controllable working capital as a percentage of sales was 15.6% at the end of the third quarter. \u2047 This represents a significant improvement from 21.2% last quarter, and the team recognizes that we still have much work ahead of us to further improve our working capital performance. \u2047 We generated $25.6 million in operating cash flow in the third quarter. \u2047 Year-to-date, we have generated $49 million in operating cash flow, up 21% compared to 2019. \u2047 The strong cash performance in the third quarter enabled us to reduce debt by $35 million. \u2047 capex was $3.2 million. \u2047 For the full year, we are expecting capital expenditures to be below 4% of sales. \u2047 On liquidity, our net cash position was $25 million, an improvement of approximately $20 million from the second quarter. \u2047 We have access to an additional $192 million through our revolving credit facility. \u2047 And at this time, we expect to remain well within our debt covenants. \u2047 We are continuing to implement SAP. \u2047 As we communicated earlier, more than 80% of our revenues come from sites that are running on SAP. \u2047 We are expecting to complete the implementation around the middle of 2021. \u2047 However, COVID-related travel limitations could cause some delays. \u2047 This concludes our prepared comments. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share $0.34.  \u2047  q3 adjusted
