As required by applicable SEC rules, the company provides reconciliations of any such non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on its website. \u2047 I'd now like to take the time -- to take -- hand the call over to Earl. \u2047 I'm pleased to report that for the quarter, Group one generated adjusted net income of $103 million. \u2047 This equates to adjusted earnings per share of $5.57 per diluted share, an increase of 236% over the prior year and an increase of 170% over the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Our adjusted net income results exclude noncore items of $1.7 million of after-tax disaster pay provided to employees who couldn't work during our February Texas store closures partially offset by an $800,000 after-tax benefit from legal settlements and a $200,000 after-tax net gain on dealership and real estate transactions. \u2047 These profit results were particularly impressive given the fact that our Texas operations, which typically represent around 40% of our total revenues, were severely impacted due to a record-setting February winter weather event. \u2047 Our stores effectively lost about the equivalent of a full week of business. \u2047 It is likely that vehicle sales were largely deferred into subsequent months, but the available service shop hours were permanently lost. \u2047 Also the U.K. remained under lockdown throughout the entire first quarter. \u2047 With so many restrictions in all our markets in 2020, it was difficult to generate revenue growth. \u2047 This improvement was driven by new and used vehicle revenue increases in the U.S., of well over 20% in the first quarter. \u2047 Of course, we should remember that the pandemic did start to negatively impact traffic and sales during the second half of March last year. \u2047 But the important fact is that consumer demand for vehicles in the U.S. remains extremely strong and hit an even higher year in March. \u2047 It is true that sales have and will be hampered to a certain degree by low inventory levels. \u2047 But this continues to support above-average margin levels. \u2047 Daryl will speak more about our inventory situation shortly. \u2047 Our aftersales business has suffered throughout the pandemic from less driving and a variety of lockdown conditions in all our markets. \u2047 In particular, our U.S. business started 2021 very slowly in January and February, but exploded in March. \u2047 Again, Daryl, will provide more detail, but this gives us great confidence that we will enjoy very strong parts and service business this spring and summer in both the U.S. and also likely the U.K. as those facilities are now completely open. \u2047 In the U.S., we are especially pleased that our service results have now returned to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 On a same-store basis, our U.S. total aftersales gross profit increased 3% versus the first quarter of 2019, and customer paid gross profit increased 14% over that same pre-pandemic time period. \u2047 These are very encouraging signs for continued aftersales improvement in 2021. \u2047 Daryl will provide more detail on our U.S. results in a moment. \u2047 Relative to the U.K., mandatory lockdowns began on November 5, 2020, and lasted through the entire first quarter. \u2047 They have since been lifted as of April 12. \u2047 Like the U.S., our U.K. operations have shifted heavily to online selling via our Acceleride platform since our showrooms have been closed for five months. \u2047 Despite not having the benefit of physical sales departments, or the ability to conduct test drives, we were able to deliver over 13,000 new and used vehicles during the quarter. \u2047 Limited new vehicle availability increased our same-store new vehicle margins by 160 basis points to 5.6% during the first quarter. \u2047 Our aftersales margin increased by almost 400 basis points to 58.4% as most service work at our dealerships was heavy repair work as customers chose to defer routine maintenance until after the lockdown. \u2047 The strong new vehicle and aftersales margins combined with strong cost discipline, evidenced by an 1,800 basis point same-store SG&A improvement over last year, enabled us to generate a meaningful level of profit in the U.K. despite closed showrooms. \u2047 As we were permitted to open showrooms again on April 12, we've seen very strong sales and service traffic levels back in our dealerships. \u2047 This gives us a high level of confidence in our U.K. business during the remainder of 2021. \u2047 A number of factors contributed to our outstanding U.S. first quarter results, namely, new and used vehicle sales growth, aftersales growth and continued strong cost discipline, all of which are a continuation of the trends from the second half of 2020. \u2047 Compared to the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019, our same-store new and used unit sales increased by 11% and 5%, respectively. \u2047 This 11% increase in new outperformed the retail industry. \u2047 U.S. new vehicle inventory levels finished the quarter at 14,500 units, of 34 days supply. \u2047 We anticipate inventories remaining tight and we'll continue to adjust our operations as necessary. \u2047 Our same-store used vehicle unit sales improved sequentially by 14%, along with a 5% growth over the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Used inventories remain constrained as well. \u2047 However, we've made a number of changes in our merchandising, sourcing, reconditioning and acquisition processes that have resulted in higher velocity and better inventory return. \u2047 Although we are around record high monthly levels of 90 units sold core rooftop, in the quarter, we continue to believe there is a great deal of opportunity in used vehicles in our dealerships going forward. \u2047 The second and most encouraging profit driver was our aftersales performance. \u2047 Warranty and collision sales were still very depressed in January and February, but we saw improvement in March. \u2047 Our customer pay business is very strong. \u2047 As Earl mentioned, our same-store CP customer pay gross profit was up 14% versus the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 This allowed us to grow total aftersales gross profit by 3% versus pre-pandemic levels, despite the significant headwinds in warranty and collision, both of which will reverse in time. \u2047 We saw a significant expansion in gross profit per repair order in the quarter, offsetting RO declines. \u2047 In March, traffic counts increased and our same-store customer pay RO count grew 23% versus March of 2020. \u2047 We foresee aftersales continuing to ramp-up in the near term. \u2047 The third major factor driving our outstanding profit performance was continued cost discipline. \u2047 Our first quarter adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 63%, down from 74% in the pre-pandemic first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Part of the decline is certainly due to higher vehicle margins, which we don't believe to be fully permanent, but a material part of the improvement is due to productivity gains. \u2047 For example, because of tools like Acceleride, our salespeople are more productive. \u2047 Because of our mix, the higher mix of flat rate techs, our techs are more productive. \u2047 These examples of permanent productivity gains will allow for us a significant ongoing reduction in our cost structure. \u2047 I would like to provide another quarterly update on Acceleride, our digital retailing platform. \u2047 We continued our upward trajectory in the first quarter by selling a record 4,000 vehicles through Acceleride, an increase of 124% over the prior year and 7% of total retail units sold. \u2047 Customers choosing Acceleride continue to close at a much higher rate than our other sources. \u2047 Additionally, I would like to share with you a number of enhancements we have made or will make soon to the Acceleride platform. \u2047 First, we've integrated real-time loan payoff quotes within the platform. \u2047 Second, we launched an Android App in addition to our existing Apple App. \u2047 Third, customers now have the ability to toggle between English and Spanish. \u2047 And fourth, in addition to be able to reserve a vehicle with a credit card, customers also now have the ability to process down payments for any amount directly through the app. \u2047 And fifth, over the next couple of months, we will introduce dynamic delivery fees live within the customer workflow. \u2047 This will introduce delivery fees earlier in the process and include them in the monthly payment calculation based on the customer's delivery address. \u2047 We're also working through numerous other enhancements and will provide future updates as appropriate. \u2047 We believe our digital retailing process is second to none in the industry, and we continue making improvements to remain at the forefront of this transformative technology. \u2047 Turning quickly to Brazil. \u2047 Despite a 7% decline in new vehicle industry sales driven by tight inventories and additional COVID lockdowns, our team did a tremendous job of growing margins and aggressively thinning the cost structure in order to realize a very strong quarterly profit in what is seasonally the weakest quarter of the year. \u2047 We easily set a record for the most profitable first quarter over the entire eight years of Group 1's ownership and are well positioned to benefit from a sales rebound coming out of the pandemic. \u2047 As of March 31, we had $83 million of cash on hand and another $245 million invested in our floorplan offset accounts bringing total cash liquidity to $328 million. \u2047 There was also another $283 million of additional borrowing capacity on our U.S. syndicated acquisition line bringing total immediate liquidity to over $600 million. \u2047 We also generated $157 million of adjusted operating cash flow in the first quarter and $134 million of free cash flow after backing out capex. \u2047 Our rent adjusted leverage ratio as defined by our U.S. syndicated credit facility which reduced to two times at the end of March, leaving plenty of flexibility for capital deployment. \u2047 On a net basis, which considers all U.S. cash on hand, our leverage was 1.6 times as of March 31. \u2047 Finally, related to interest expense. \u2047 Our quarterly floorplan interest of $7.6 million was a decrease of $5.3 million or 41% from the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 This decline was primarily driven by lower inventory levels and related borrowings. \u2047 Non-floorplan interest expense decreased by $4.3 million or 24% from prior year, primarily due to the last year's bond debt refinancing. \u2047 As a reminder, we continue to manage our interest risk conservatively. \u2047 We have floorplan swaps averaging $550 million in place through 2026. \u2047 We also considering our mortgage swaps on bond debt, over 75% of our debt is at fixed rates. \u2047 As a result, a 100-basis point increase in interest rates would only have an approximate $0.20 negative impact on our annual EPS. \u2047 Our balance sheet and liquidity position have never been stronger, and we look forward to growing the company through M&A. \u2047 We are seeing a strong flow of potential deals and anticipate closing or entering into contracts to acquire additional dealerships this year. \u2047 Related to our corporate development efforts, we previously announced the March acquisition of two Toyota franchises on Cape Cod that increased our new England platform to 10 stores and will contribute $120 million in incremental annual revenues. \u2047 We also previously announced the January dispositions of the Cadillac franchise in the Dallas-Fort Worth market area and a mini franchise in the El Paso market. \u2047 We've also since completed the termination of the U.K. Ford franchise in March and the disposition of a Mississippi Kia franchise in April. \u2047 As Daniel mentioned, we continue to prioritize external growth in our capital allocation process and we're optimistic that we will have beneficial opportunities as the year progresses. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname announces record first quarter 2021 financial results.  \u2047  q1 adjusted non-gaap earnings per share $5.57.
