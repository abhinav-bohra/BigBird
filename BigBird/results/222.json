{"article": ["I will start by going through some of the highlights of the quarter, then Jack will go through the third quarter results and guidance for the fourth quarter. \u2047 And I'll then share some concluding thoughts before we start our Q&A session. \u2047 But before we start, Jack will now cover the Safe Harbor language. \u2047 These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs. \u2047 Following our announcement and special investor call in late August, we were very pleased to recently announce the successful and timely completion of the ettain group acquisition. \u2047 ettain was one of the largest privately held IT resourcing and services provider in North America and, since October 1st, is now operating as part of our Experis business. \u2047 In addition to expanding our IT services in the financial and healthcare sectors, this acquisition also improves our geographic diversification in the U.S. and increases our strength in the digital workspace and business transformation practice areas. \u2047 Turning to our financial results. \u2047 In the third quarter, revenue was $5.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year in constant currency. \u2047 Our operating profit for the quarter was $151 million. \u2047 Excluding Mexico restructuring and ettain acquisition transaction costs, operating profit was $162 million. \u2047 Operating profit was up significantly year-over-year as the pandemic had a significant financial impact in the prior year. \u2047 Reported operating margin was 2.9%, and after excluding Mexico restructuring and acquisition costs, operating profit margin was 3.2%. \u2047 Reported earnings per diluted share was $1.77 and $1.93 after excluding Mexico restructuring and acquisition costs and both were significantly above the prior year. \u2047 The global economic recovery continued in the third quarter. \u2047 As vaccine rollouts progress in many countries, and pandemic-related restrictions ease, we continue to see very strong hiring demand. \u2047 This strong demand is again evident in our Q4 ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey of more than 40,000 employers in 43 countries. \u2047 All countries are reporting improved hiring intentions year-on-year and in 14 of the 43 countries, employers are reporting hiring intentions at the highest levels in more than 10 years. \u2047 That said, during the third quarter, we have also seen some levelling off in the rate of recovery in some markets. \u2047 Concerns about the Delta variant contribute to parts of the workforce not coming back into the labor market and exacerbating worker shortages in many industries and markets, making it more difficult to meet the strong demand for workers. \u2047 The impact related to supply chain challenges caused by the pandemic have also become a more visible factor impacting many manufacturers in various industries. \u2047 As we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we view supply chain challenges and the impact of the Delta variant as transitory factors, and we remain optimistic and confident in the demand outlook once the effects of the pandemic normalize. \u2047 Companies all over the world need access to skilled human capital to meet their business objectives and fully participated in the economic global recovery. \u2047 With our operational and strategic workforce solutions and services, we help them meet the strong demand for their goods and services today and into the future. \u2047 Revenues in the third quarter came in just below our constant currency guidance range, driven by a slowdown in the rate of improvement in France, due to supply chain disruptions, notably in the automotive sector, and Delta variant disruptions. \u2047 Gross profit margin came in well above our guidance range. \u2047 As-adjusted operating profit was $162 million, representing a significant increase from the prior year period which was heavily impacted by the pandemic. \u2047 As-adjusted operating profit margin was 3.2%, which was at the top end of our guidance. \u2047 Breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail, after adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 1%, our constant currency revenue increased 11%. \u2047 Due to the impact of net dispositions and slightly fewer billing days, the organic days-adjusted revenue increase was 12%. \u2047 Comparing to pre-pandemic levels, our third quarter revenues were below 2019 levels by 5% on an organic days-adjusted constant currency basis, which is slightly lower than the second quarter trend on this same basis due to the impact of new regulations in Mexico and the exiting of a low-margin arrangement in Australia. \u2047 Turning to the earnings per share bridge on Slide 4, earnings per share was $1.77, which included $0.07 related to Mexico restructuring costs and $0.09 related to acquisition transaction costs. \u2047 Excluding these costs, adjusted earnings per share was $1.93 which exceeded the mid-point of our guidance range. \u2047 Walking from our guidance mid-point, our results included: improved operational performance of $0.02; slightly lower than expected foreign currency exchange rates which had a negative impact of $0.03; a slightly better than expected effective tax rate that added $0.02; and favorable other expenses which added $0.02. \u2047 Looking at our gross profit margin in detail, our gross margin came in at 16.6%. \u2047 Underlying staffing margin contributed 20 basis point increase. \u2047 Permanent recruitment contributed an 80 basis point GP margin improvement as hiring activity was strong across our largest markets. \u2047 A lower mix of Right Management career transition business this year drove 30 basis points of GP margin reduction. \u2047 Other and accrual adjustments included a 10 basis point margin improvement from our Experis managed services business in Europe and a 10 basis point improvement from consulting and MSP services, partially offset by a 10 basis point reduction from lower direct cost adjustments in the current year as favorable direct cost adjustments in Latin America were less than the prior year favorable adjustments in France. \u2047 Next, let's review our gross profit by business line. \u2047 During the quarter, the Manpower brand comprised 63% of gross profit. \u2047 Our Experis professional business comprised 22%, and Talent Solutions comprised 15%. \u2047 During the quarter, our Manpower brand reported an organic constant currency gross profit year-over-year growth of 15%. \u2047 Compared to pre-pandemic levels, this represented a decrease of 4% from the third quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 Gross profit in our Experis brand increased 24% on an organic constant currency basis year-over-year during the quarter. \u2047 This represented a flat trend from the third quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 Talent Solutions includes our global market leading RPO, MSP and Right Management offerings. \u2047 Organic gross profit increased 16% in constant currency year-over-year. \u2047 This represented an increase of 14% from the third quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 Our RPO business posted high double-digit GP growth during the quarter on significant hiring activity. \u2047 Our MSP business, which has grown through the entire pandemic, continued to experience double-digit growth in gross profit in the quarter. \u2047 As the recovery strengthens, our Right Management business continues to see significant run-off in outplacement activity, primarily in the U.S., and experienced a reduction in gross profit of 42% year-over-year. \u2047 Our SG&A expense in the quarter was $703 million and represented a 6% increase on a reported basis from the prior year. \u2047 Excluding Mexico restructuring charges and acquisition costs in the current year and restructuring charges and a loss from dispositions in the prior year, SG&A was 13% higher on a constant currency basis. \u2047 This compares to an increase in gross profit of 17% in constant currency and reflects investment in incremental recruiters and sales talent based on increased market activity, as well as ongoing technology initiatives. \u2047 The underlying increases consisted of operational costs of $78 million and currency changes of $6 million. \u2047 SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue, after excluding restructuring and acquisition costs, represented 13.4% in the third quarter. \u2047 The Americas segment comprised 19% of consolidated revenue. \u2047 Revenue in the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 8% in constant currency. \u2047 OUP was $41 million. \u2047 Excluding Mexico restructuring costs and ettain acquisition costs, OUP was $52 million and OUP margin was 5.2%. \u2047 The U.S. is the largest country in the Americas segment, comprising 65% of segment revenues. \u2047 Revenue in the U.S. was $645 million, representing an 11% increase compared to the prior year. \u2047 Excluding ettain acquisition costs in the current year and restructuring charges in the prior year, OUP for our U.S. business is flat year-over-year at $34 million in the quarter as decreases from Right Management's career placement run-off was offset by improvements across all other businesses. \u2047 Excluding the acquisition costs, OUP margin was 5.3%. \u2047 Within the U.S., the Manpower brand comprised 33% of gross profit during the quarter. \u2047 Revenue for the Manpower brand in the U.S. increased 9% during the quarter. \u2047 While the U.S. Manpower business continues to recover, the labor shortage experienced in the second quarter continued into the third quarter through the summer months. \u2047 The Experis brand in the U.S. comprised 33% of gross profit in the quarter. \u2047 Within Experis in the U.S., IT skills comprise approximately 80% of revenues. \u2047 Experis U.S. revenues grew 17% during the quarter and we anticipate continued strong double-digit organic growth in the fourth quarter. \u2047 We are encouraged by the current trends in our U.S. Experis business and the recent acquisition of ettain which significantly increases our presence in the convenience market for IT professional services. \u2047 Talent Solutions in the U.S. contributed 34% of gross profit and experienced revenue growth of 9% in the quarter. \u2047 This was driven by RPO which experienced record revenue levels as hiring programs continued to strengthen. \u2047 MSP business continued to perform well and experienced double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, on an organic basis, we expect ongoing underlying improvement and revenue growth for the U.S. in the range of 1% to 5% year-over-year. \u2047 This represents a 1% decline compared to 2019 levels using the midpoint of our guidance. \u2047 Separately, we estimate ettain revenues within a range of $175 million to $185 million in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our Mexico operation experienced a revenue decline of 46% in constant currency in the quarter. \u2047 The decline was driven by the new labor legislation which prohibits certain types of temporary staffing not considered specialized services. \u2047 The actual reduction in demand from our clients from the regulation was more severe than originally anticipated. \u2047 The restructuring actions we have taken in the third quarter have quickly right-sized this business for the impact of new regulations. \u2047 Although this will result in significant revenue reductions over the next few quarters, we believe the mix shift toward more specialized staffing will improve the margin profile of our Mexican business over time. \u2047 We also believe there may be additional revenue opportunities over time as clients adjust their workforce strategies. \u2047 We estimate that fourth quarter revenues in Mexico will decrease by approximately 55% to 60% year-over-year. \u2047 Mexico represented 2.8% of our 2020 revenues. \u2047 Revenue in Canada increased 15% in constant currency during the quarter. \u2047 Southern Europe revenue comprised 46% of consolidated revenue in the quarter. \u2047 Revenue in Southern Europe came in at $2.4 billion, growing 12% in constant currency. \u2047 OUP equaled $111 million and OUP margin was 4.6%. \u2047 France revenue comprised 55% of the Southern Europe segment in the quarter and increased 8% in constant currency. \u2047 Compared to the same period in 2019, France revenues were down 10%. \u2047 Automotive supply chain constraints and the Delta variant slowed the rate of recovery in the third quarter for our French business. \u2047 OUP was $62 million in the quarter and OUP margin was 4.7%. \u2047 As we begin the fourth quarter, we are estimating a year-over-year constant currency increase in revenues for France in the range of 2% to 6%. \u2047 Comparing estimated fourth quarter revenues to pre-crisis levels in constant currency, this represents an 8% decline compared to 2019 levels in the fourth quarter using the midpoint of our guidance. \u2047 Revenue in Italy equaled $456 million in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 28% in days-adjusted constant currency. \u2047 Through the third quarter, revenues in Italy continued to exceed 2019 levels. \u2047 OUP equaled $31 million and OUP margin was 6.7%. \u2047 We estimate that Italy will continue to perform very well in the fourth quarter with year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in the range of 7% to 11%. \u2047 Revenue in Spain increased 1% in days-adjusted constant currency from the prior year and revenue in Switzerland increased 21% in days-adjusted constant currency. \u2047 Our Northern Europe segment comprised 23% of consolidated revenue in the quarter. \u2047 Revenue increased 19% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, driven by all major markets. \u2047 OUP represented $17 million and OUP margin was 1.4%. \u2047 Our largest market in Northern Europe segment is the U.K., which represented 37% of segment revenues in the quarter. \u2047 During the quarter, U.K. revenues grew 26% in constant currency. \u2047 We expect continued growth in the 4% to 8% constant currency range year-over-year in the fourth quarter. \u2047 In Germany, revenues increased 13% in days-adjusted constant currency in the third quarter. \u2047 We expect to see ongoing revenue improvement in Germany in the fourth quarter. \u2047 In the Nordics, revenues grew 19% in constant currency. \u2047 Revenue in the Netherlands increased 5% in constant currency. \u2047 Belgium experienced days-adjusted revenue growth of 10% in constant currency during the quarter. \u2047 The Asia Pacific Middle East segment comprises 12% of total company revenue. \u2047 In the quarter, revenue grew 4% in constant currency to $611 million. \u2047 OUP was $23 million and OUP margin was 3.7%. \u2047 Revenue in Japan grew 13% in constant currency which represents an improvement from the 10% growth rate in the second quarter. \u2047 Our Japan business continues to lead the market in revenue growth, and we expect ongoing high single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Revenues in Australia were down 29% in constant currency, reflecting the exit of a low-margin client arrangement during the second quarter. \u2047 I'll now turn to cash flow and balance sheet. \u2047 During the first nine months of the year, free cash flow equaled $343 million compared to $685 million in the prior year reflecting significant accounts receivable declines in the prior year period. \u2047 Our third quarter free cash flow of $172 million exceeded the prior year free cash flow of $108 million, representing strong current period cash collections. \u2047 At quarter end"], "gold_summary": ["q3 earnings per share $1.93 excluding items.  \u2047  sees q4 earnings per share $1.99
