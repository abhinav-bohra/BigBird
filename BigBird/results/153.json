{"article": ["We are very pleased with our third quarter results, which once again demonstrates the strength of Reliance's resilient business model. \u2047 Our diverse product mix and end-market exposures, along with our decentralized operating structure, enabled us to quickly respond to varying fluid market conditions. \u2047 Our gross profit margin expanded 200 basis points from the prior quarter to a record 32.4%, significantly exceeding our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30% on net sales of $2.09 billion. \u2047 Our increased gross profit margin, combined with diligent expense control, increased our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to $1.80, a 37.5% increase from the prior quarter, and generated strong cash flow from operations of $296.3 million. \u2047 Even more importantly, we would once again like to express our gratitude to all of our outstanding folks for their hard work and perseverance through one of the most challenging time in our company's history. \u2047 Our people are truly the key ingredient of the secret sauce of Reliance, and we would not be where we are today without their unwavering commitment and support. \u2047 Our managers maintain their focus on the employee health and safety, including adherence to strict procedures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and improve our safety performance on a year-to-date basis compared to the same period in 2019. \u2047 We continue to support our employees and their families as well as our customers, suppliers and communities in a safe, positive, sustainable manner. \u2047 Getting back to our third quarter financial results. \u2047 Our shipments surpassed our expectations, increasing 5.9% over the prior quarter despite typical third quarter normal seasonal customer shutdowns and vacation schedules. \u2047 Improved demand in the major in the majority our end markets as the economy continued to slowly reopen following COVID-19-related shutdowns and project delays in the second quarter of 2020 drove this strength. \u2047 In addition, our toll processing volumes increased materially compared to the second quarter levels as automotive production continued to ramp up. \u2047 As a reminder, since we do not take ownership of the metal, our toll processing volumes are not reflected in our tons sold metric. \u2047 Metal pricing began to improve in the third quarter as mill price increases from many of the products we sell were implemented, with announcements for further price increases continuing into the fourth quarter. \u2047 Despite these mill price increases, our average selling price per ton sold in the third quarter was down 4.3% compared to the second quarter, primarily as a result of product mix changes that Karla will discuss in more detail. \u2047 The 200 basis points improvement in our gross profit margin to a record 32.4% was the major highlight of our third quarter financial performance, which drove a 40.6% increase in our non-GAAP pre-tax income over the prior quarter. \u2047 The primary contributor to our record gross profit margin was a significant rebound in our tolling businesses that service the automotive market, which generally operate at higher gross profit margins than our companywide average. \u2047 In addition, shifts in our diverse product mix, along with our ability to implement price increases at the time of mill announcements, collectively drove incremental increases in our third quarter gross profit margin. \u2047 While we expect that the impact of certain of these factors will be temporary, we believe our managers will continue to successfully leverage the significant investments we have made to expand our value-added processing capabilities to support a sustainable higher gross profit margin. \u2047 In regard to conditions in our key end markets. \u2047 Demand in nonresidential construction, the largest market we serve, continue to slowly increase during the third quarter due to healthy bidding activity for new projects and the restart of projects that had previously been put on hold. \u2047 Quoting activity remains strong for projects related to transmission towers and military, schools and municipalities as well as large warehouses, data processing centers and assisted living facilities. \u2047 We have also seen an increase in certain infrastructure projects, such as roads and highways and water treatment plants. \u2047 As such, we remain cautiously optimistic that demand for nonresidential construction activity will continue to improve through the end of the year based on healthy backlogs and positive customer sentiment. \u2047 Demand for the toll processing services we provide to the automotive market rebounded significantly in the third quarter as automotive OEMs and steel and aluminum mills continued to ramp up production following COVID-19 shutdowns in the second quarter. \u2047 We simultaneously increased our processing volumes at our toll processing operations in both the U.S. and Mexico to support increased activities, and we were pleased to be able to recall the majority of our furloughed employees to our tolling operations. \u2047 We remain committed to expanding our presence in toll processing in response to ongoing solid demand trends. \u2047 Earlier this month, we commenced operations at a new facility in Kentucky. \u2047 We will also soon break ground on a new greenfield tolling facility in Texas. \u2047 These new facilities expand our carbon steel tolling capacity and will position us to better service our toll processing customers, primarily metals producers and their end users in the Ohio Valley and the Eastern United States as well as in the Southwestern U.S. and Mexico. \u2047 Needless to say, our outlook for our tolling operations remains positive. \u2047 Demand in heavy industry for both agriculture and construction equipment remained generally consistent with the second quarter. \u2047 Production schedules in some areas have begun to increase, and we remain cautiously optimistic our businesses servicing the large industrial market should improve from current levels through the remainder of the year. \u2047 Semiconductor demand steadily improved from the second quarter of 2020, and the market continues to be strong. \u2047 Leading indicators for semiconductor space currently points to a more positive development in the fourth quarter and early 2021, and we believe we are very well positioned to participate in any improvement. \u2047 I'd like to start by noting that our aerospace businesses service diverse segments. \u2047 Commercial aerospace represents about half of our aerospace exposure. \u2047 In the third quarter, commercial aerospace demand continued to decline as reductions in travel due to COVID-19 persisted. \u2047 In response to reduced commercial airline build rates that we expect to continue at low levels in the near term, we recorded impairment and restructuring charges related to facility closures, workforce reductions and a negative outlook at certain of our businesses servicing the commercial aerospace market. \u2047 Conversely, demand remains strong in the military, defense and space portions of our aerospace business, which represents the other half of our aerospace exposure. \u2047 We continue to see opportunities to expand our participation in defense, which will help offset some of the weakness on the commercial side. \u2047 We will continue to monitor and assess the health of each of our aerospace businesses and take appropriate cost-reduction actions, if and when needed, to ensure the continued long-term profitability of these businesses. \u2047 Finally, demand in the energy sector, which is mainly oil and natural gas, remains under significant pressure. \u2047 As I highlighted on our last call, we have taken proactive cost reduction measures throughout 2020, including the consolidation of certain facilities and head count reduction. \u2047 As a result, we believe we are well positioned to maintain our presence as a dominant player in the energy spaces and support any further recovery in that market. \u2047 One bright spot, in particular, is the renewable energy space in which we sell a significant amount of metal for solar and wind power projects. \u2047 Turning to capital allocation. \u2047 Our countercyclical cash flow generation enables us to remain flexible and opportunistic as we allocate capital for both growth and stockholder return opportunities in both good times and bad. \u2047 Our capital expenditure budget for 2020 is weighted toward growth activities that supports our customers through the addition of innovative equipment and advanced technology to further expand and strengthen our value-added processing capabilities. \u2047 We have increased our 2020 capital expenditure budget by $80 million to a total of $270 million in response to opportunities to better service our customers, including the toll processing expansion in Texas and to maintain and upgrade our equipment to provide our customers with the highest-quality products and services. \u2047 On the M&A front, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of prospective opportunities. \u2047 As always, we evaluate potential candidates using stringent criteria to ensure the best possible fit within our family of companies. \u2047 We continue to seek well-run profitable businesses that possess strong management teams and superior levels of customer service with a focus on safety. \u2047 Acquisitions must also complement our product and end-market diversification strategy and be immediately accretive to our earnings. \u2047 In regard to stockholder returns, we are pleased to maintain our payment of a regularly quarterly dividend, as we have for 61 consecutive years, without ever suspending payment or reducing our dividend rate. \u2047 We've increased our dividend 27 times since our 1994 IPO, including the most recent increase of 13.6% in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 We also repurchased a small amount of our common stock during the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Another key highlight during the quarter was our diligent inventory management. \u2047 We continue to rightsize our inventory to reflect current demand levels through reduced buying as well as cross-selling inventory within our expansive network of service centers. \u2047 And we are pleased to have achieved our companywide goal of 4.7 inventory turns during the third quarter. \u2047 In summary, we are very proud to have improved our financial results amid the unprecedented global uncertainty that continues to materially impact the economy. \u2047 Our decentralized structure afforded us the flexibility to immediately respond to rapidly changing demand trends and help preserve our long-term profitability. \u2047 It is through their efforts that the unique aspects of our business model were able to really shine through, enabling us to achieve significant gross profit margin expansion to a record 32.4%. \u2047 The consistent execution our -- of our resilient business model is a testament to, not only the diversity of our products, end markets and geographies, but also our commitment to: strong pricing discipline; diligent expense control, when needed; inventory management and leveraging our investments in organic growth and innovation. \u2047 We believe customers realize increased value in our model during challenging markets as they confidently rely on us to do more for them, often in smaller sizes or on a more frequent basis. \u2047 As Reliance continues to evolve as a leading diversified metal solution provider, we will leverage both the knowledge we have acquired while navigating the pandemic and our commitment to continuous improvement and innovation to provide enhanced solutions to our customers and drive stockholder value through increased efficiencies and profitability. \u2047 America is going to need Reliance to rebuild. \u2047 Our net sales of $2.09 billion for the third quarter of 2020 decreased 22.4% from the third quarter of 2019, with our tons sold down 13.1% and our average selling price down 11%. \u2047 Compared to the second quarter of 2020, net sales increased 3.3%, with our tons sold up 5.9% and our average selling price per ton sold down 4.3%. \u2047 Our tons sold exceeded our expectations of flat to up 2% from the prior quarter as demand in many of our end markets improved, with the most notable strength in nonresidential construction. \u2047 Although not included in our tons sold metric, the significant rebound in our toll processing operations contributed meaningfully to our increased sales, with toll processing volumes up 81.5% from the lows experienced in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 And our average selling price per ton sold declined 4.3% compared to the second quarter. \u2047 Our lower average selling price in the third quarter was mainly due to shifts in our product mix rather than overall metal pricing trends. \u2047 The most significant shift was a 14.9% decrease in our aerospace tons sold in the third quarter, the majority of which was heat-treated aluminum and titanium products, which represent some of the higher-priced products we sell. \u2047 Meanwhile, our shipments of flat-rolled carbon steel, which are among our lowest-priced products, increased as a percent of our total shipments, which also reduced our average selling price. \u2047 And lastly, our alloy sales now represent a lower portion of our total tons shipped due to the closure of certain of our energy businesses. \u2047 Our gross profit margin for the third quarter of 2020 was a record at 32.4% and well above our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30%. \u2047 This ties our record gross profit margin set in the fourth quarter of 2019 when we recorded LIFO income of $81 million compared to LIFO income of $12.5 million in the current quarter. \u2047 On a non-GAAP FIFO basis, which we believe is the best measure of our day-to-day operations, our gross profit margin of 31.8% increased 300 basis points from 28.8% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 160 basis points from 30.2% in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 As Jim highlighted, this is a direct result of the outstanding performance by our managers in the field who, despite challenging circumstances, maintained pricing discipline by focusing on higher-margin orders and providing more value to our customers through our expanded value-added processing capabilities. \u2047 And these actions are the key drivers behind our ability to increase and sustain our strong gross profit margin. \u2047 During the third quarter, certain other factors contributed to our increased gross profit margin, the impacts of which we believe may be more temporary. \u2047 First, a significant rebound in our toll processing volumes drove a meaningful increase in our gross profit margin as our tolling businesses operate at higher margins than our companywide average. \u2047 Second, changes in our product mix contributed as our lower-margin contractual commercial aerospace sales declined, while shipments of lower-priced carbon flat-rolled products increased. \u2047 Given a lower average overall selling price, value-added charges are a larger component of our sales, which has a positive impact on our gross profit margin. \u2047 And third, we were able to enhance our gross profit margin for certain of our carbon steel products as mills announced price increases late in the third quarter. \u2047 We recorded LIFO income of $12.5 million or $0.15 of earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2020 compared to LIFO income of $40 million or $0.44 of earnings per share in the third quarter of 2019 and LIFO income of $5 million or $0.06 of earnings per share in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 And given our current estimate of $50 million of annual LIFO income in 2020, we expect to record $12.5 million of LIFO income in the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 As a reminder, we will true-up to our actual LIFO adjustment at December 31. \u2047 And our LIFO reserve was $100.1 million at September 30. \u2047 Our third quarter non-GAAP SG&A expenses decreased $75.2 million or 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2019 on a 13.1% reduction in shipments. \u2047 The decline in SG&A expense was mainly due to reduced variable expenses, such as plant supplies and freight costs, along with lower average head count, which was down 13.8%; as well as lower performance-based compensation. \u2047 When compared to the second quarter of 2020, our non-GAAP SG"], "gold_summary": ["sees q4 2020 non-gaap earnings per share $1.30 to $1.40.  \u2047  q3 non-gaap
