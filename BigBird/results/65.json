earthquakes we experienced in January and occurred while we were in the process of integrating the Scotiabank acquisition. \u2047 Certainly, no small challenge. \u2047 But by acting quickly and with foresight, we produced excellent results for our customers, communities and people, and continue to help them build better financial futures. \u2047 In March, governments in Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands shut down businesses and personal activities. \u2047 Restrictions were eased in late May. \u2047 But recent spikes in new cases have forced Puerto Rico to reduce some of the flexibility. \u2047 The Federal Reserve Bank cut rates 150 basis points in March, following the 75 basis points reduction in the second half of 2019. \u2047 Our commitment and preparation enabled us to successfully manage these challenges facil, rapido, hecho; easy, fast, done, as we say at OFG. \u2047 All our branches operated safely throughout the quarter, enhanced by our technology platform. \u2047 Our full-service ATMs and ITMs, mobile app, and online bill paying tools facilitated routine transactions in a contactless manner. \u2047 Online and mobile appointment scheduling helped make COVID safe customer meetings possible at branches. \u2047 We deployed a 100% digital client-friendly application and funds disbursement process for PPP loans. \u2047 About half of our team members are still working remote. \u2047 We also implemented extensive new safety protocols for our customers and people on site. \u2047 And we continued to offer new benefits for our people such as free COVID on-site testing and daily online health check-ins, as well as incentives. \u2047 The results speak for themselves. \u2047 We provided high levels of customer service, safety and knowledge throughout all channels. \u2047 Loan production in the second quarter totaled more than $500 million. \u2047 Customer deposits increased $760 million. \u2047 Our online loan deferral tool and call centers processed relief for more than 44,000 retail customers. \u2047 We reduced higher-cost wholesale funding, maintained a strong level of net interest margin and continued to build liquidity and capital. \u2047 And we secured $100,000 in Federal Home Loan Bank of New York grants to support local non-profit and small businesses in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. \u2047 Please turn to Page 4. \u2047 We have continued to see strong technology utilization trends among both our retail and business customers since the beginning of the year and, in particular, since March. \u2047 Online bill enrollment -- bill pay enrollments were up 12% as of March and 24% as of June. \u2047 Mobile banking users jumped 17% by the end of the second quarter from the beginning of the first. \u2047 The number of remote deposit capture users are up 68% from the end of March. \u2047 In another area of success for us, during the second quarter, we scheduled more than 18,000 COVID safe appointments with our customers through our online and mobile tool. \u2047 We are very pleased with this -- to see these trends. \u2047 Technology is a core part of our overall corporate strategy. \u2047 We continue to look into new ways and innovative ways to use it to help our customers. \u2047 Please turn to Page 5. \u2047 Looking at our SBA PPP program, we continue to exceed our market share in Puerto Rico. \u2047 We generated a total of $286 million in new loans. \u2047 This enabled us to help more than 4,000 small businesses save more than 50,000 jobs. \u2047 It also enabled us to attract new accounts in this strategically important customer base. \u2047 And we were able to distribute these funds electronically within five days of application approval. \u2047 This is a great example of our ability to act quickly in response to changing conditions to the benefit of both existing and new customers and the communities we serve. \u2047 Let's talk about our results on Page 6. \u2047 We reported earnings per share of $0.39, and $0.37 on a non-GAAP basis. \u2047 Total core revenues were $128 million. \u2047 Most of that was due to a large increase in interest earning assets, chiefly loans and cash. \u2047 This was partially offset by a decline in yield due to significantly lower rates on cash and lower yields on variable rate commercial loans. \u2047 In addition, we have lower investment security balances. \u2047 As a result, we generated net interest income of $105 million with a net interest margin of 4.78%. \u2047 Banking and wealth management revenues totaled $23 million. \u2047 Non-interest expenses were $86 million, primarily due to the addition of the Scotiabank acquisition. \u2047 Second quarter results included several items. \u2047 $9.5 million in revenues from Scotia Bank interest recoveries and bargain purchase gain. \u2047 We added $5 million in provision for the pandemic. \u2047 And within non-interest expenses, we had a $5 million in merger and restructuring charges and COVID-related operating costs. \u2047 Please turn to Page 7. \u2047 The effects of these results is that we're building tangible book value, and our return on asset and return on equity continued to improve sequentially from the fourth quarter. \u2047 Please turn to Page 8 for operational highlights. \u2047 Average loan balances increased 52% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Average core deposits, excluding brokered, increased 76% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Loan generation was strong. \u2047 Increased production from PPP and other commercial loans was partially offset by reduced production in our retail categories, primarily due to the economic shutdown. \u2047 We ended the quarter with good momentum and good pipelines in the mortgages and auto businesses. \u2047 Loan yield at 6.97% continued to hold up well despite the recent Federal Reserve cuts. \u2047 The cost of core deposits declined 4% -- 4 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 Net interest margin declined to 4.78%. \u2047 Please turn to Page 9 to review credit quality. \u2047 The net charge-off and non-performing loan rate declined year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, reflecting loan paydowns and the effects of deferrals. \u2047 Provision for credit losses of $18 million was level with last year. \u2047 I'd like to note the year-ago provision included an extra $9 million related to loans transferred to held for sale. \u2047 Please turn to Page 10 to review our loan deferrals. \u2047 After disruptions in economic condition caused by COVID-19, we offered several loan payment deferral programs ranging from one to four months. \u2047 As I've mentioned, we've enhanced this effort by quickly developing unique and first-to-market digital tools to help consumers apply for forbearance on an individual basis. \u2047 Our online loan deferral tool and call centers processed relief for more than 44,000 retail customers. \u2047 In total, we have about $1.4 billion or 32% of our retail loans on deferral. \u2047 The pace of retail requests is significantly slow. \u2047 In addition, we have about $685 million or 26% of our commercial loans on deferral. \u2047 Please turn to Page 11. \u2047 The allowance for loan and lease losses of $233 million increased $70 million year-over-year. \u2047 And we have almost doubled the level of reserves from December 31, 2019. \u2047 Compared to March 31, 2020, the allowance increased $2 million. \u2047 Excluding SBA guaranteed PPP loans, second quarter 2020 allowance was 3.49% of loans, 8 basis points higher than the first quarter. \u2047 Please turn to Page 12. \u2047 We are in a strong capital position. \u2047 Our CET capital ratio, as you see on that slide, of 12.03% is up 112 basis points since last year. \u2047 Please turn to Page 13. \u2047 While we still face much uncertainty regarding COVID and the economy, we are in a strong financial position, ready to help our customers during these trying times. \u2047 Once we get through this, Puerto Rico stands to benefit significantly from COVID stimulus and still unspent and undistributed Maria and earthquake-related stimulus programs. \u2047 At OFG, we believe our results and our history demonstrate our ability to quickly respond and adapt to changing economic environments. \u2047 During the second quarter, we continued to build momentum in our core businesses and developed a good pipeline of new loans. \u2047 From a liquidity, capital and balance sheet point of view, we are well positioned both financially and strategically. \u2047 Our agenda going forward is clear. \u2047 We plan to continue integrating the former Scotiabank operations and finish by the end of this year. \u2047 At the same time, we must achieve the full benefits of the acquisition by the end of 2021. \u2047 We also plan to continue to invest in the future to further simplify our operations and enhance our ability to serve customers. \u2047 And ultimately, we intend to continue to play a significant role in the recovery in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. \u2047 Crises bring out the best in people to help others. \u2047 Our people demonstrate that with purpose every single day. \u2047 Operator, please open the call for the Q&A session. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname
