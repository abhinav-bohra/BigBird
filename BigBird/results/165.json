{"article": ["During the call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures such as total segment operating income, adjusted EBITDA, total adjusted segment EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted share, adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA margin, and free cash flow. \u2047 With these formalities out of the way, I'm joined today by Steven Gunby, our president and chief executive officer; and Ajay Sabherwal, our chief financial officer. \u2047 I hope everyone and your families continue to be well. \u2047 I know we all can see light at the end of the tunnel regarding the pandemic but I also know that in no place around the world, no place around the world are we yet fully in that light so I'm hoping everybody remains safe. \u2047 I'm also hoping that we are -- is there a binging in the background there? \u2047 Well, I'm in a new place doing the call. \u2047 So unfortunately, we might have a little background noise. \u2047 So, look, I'm hoping everybody stays safe. \u2047 I'm also hoping that we all are getting a chance to reconnect with our loved ones and our colleagues in a somewhat deeper way. \u2047 Over the last several weeks, like this week, I've had the pleasure of starting to see clients in person and traveling to just some of our offices to see our people. \u2047 And I hope you have begun to have the equivalent. \u2047 For me, it has been wonderful to get the chance to see people, person-in-person again. \u2047 Obviously, technology is incredibly terrific about connecting us. \u2047 It changes our ability to feel connected when we're apart. \u2047 Now some technologies are better than others. \u2047 I think letter writing from my youth wasn't that great, notwithstanding the fact that my parents then celebrated the fact that I sent them a postcard from summer camp. \u2047 And telegrams, except for emergencies, weren't much better but telephones obviously helped, right? \u2047 They were real time. \u2047 They allowed you to talk with somebody and stay connected. \u2047 And Zoom and Teams are incredibly better. \u2047 They also give us eye contact. \u2047 They give us the ability to see authenticity in somebody's face. \u2047 It's a powerful thing. \u2047 But when we get back out in the world, I, for one, am rediscovering the fact that, even today, even today, nothing is better than getting a chance to see someone in person and maybe giving that person a hug. \u2047 Turning to our results. \u2047 I'm going to let Ajay give you all the details of this, yet again terrific quarter. \u2047 It is a terrific quarter, and there's lots of details but I'm going to leave that to him. \u2047 What I'd like to do, with your permission, is share a bit of a longer-term perspective. \u2047 On these earnings calls, we often are talking about market forces. \u2047 The forces that are external to our firm. \u2047 Last year, for example, we talked about the courts being closed and travel restrictions and the impact of each of those. \u2047 In other times, we've talked now about the restructuring markets either being up or down or whether the transaction market is booming or not. \u2047 Obviously, those discussions are important. \u2047 We wouldn't be talking about them if they weren't. \u2047 Markets do affect our individual businesses, and they can affect them sharply over any short period of time. \u2047 What is also true, and to me far more powerful, is how little the markets determine our performance over an extended period of time. \u2047 How much -- when you look back over two years, four years, six years, seven years of our history, how much of our business is not driven by quarters or by market factors but is driven by us, by what our teams do. \u2047 It's about what -- our ability over any extended period of time to not get driven by quarterly market forces but rather for us to control our destiny. \u2047 Now I know there's some longtime observers of our company on the call, and some of you have suggested that at one point this company was never up unless the restructuring business was up, and the restructuring business was not up unless the restructuring market was up. \u2047 And as a consequence, at one point we were also seen by some as a cork that floats up and down with the restructuring wave. \u2047 I don't know whether that was ever fully true but I believe our track record over the last two, four, five-plus years suggests it is not the case today. \u2047 Our teams have been, and are, building businesses that are global, diverse but, most important, powerful. \u2047 Each 10, as we've seen, be whipsawed by markets in just the short term. \u2047 But over the last years, we have shown that if we do the right things over any extended period of time, we are not corks on the wave but rather folks who determine our future. \u2047 By now, I believe that you can see examples of this in every one of our businesses and every one of our regions. \u2047 For example, our technology business. \u2047 This quarter is being helped by the strong M&A markets. \u2047 Having said that, by far, the more fundamental change in our trajectory in this business wasn't driven by markets. \u2047 It was driven by the teams driving strategic changes that they engineered four years ago. \u2047 At that point, some of you might remember, the business was headed in the wrong direction even with solid markets. \u2047 The strategic changes the team drove reversed that. \u2047 Our business started to move up even before the M&A boom. \u2047 And as a consequence, I believe, we have been the fastest-growing major player -- at least organically, in the e-discovery business over the last few years, not because of the market but because of what our teams have done. \u2047 Similarly, in E-con -- yes, the M&A and the antitrust clearance markets are hot. \u2047 If you look underneath that, you see the cornerstone of our multiyear growth that we have driven is actions taken by teams that support and add to the fabulous positions we have in the U.S. and extend those clear positions abroad, not market phenomena but the phenomenon of great people attracting other great people. \u2047 FLC, obviously, saw the market's effects last year due to the halted court activities and travel. \u2047 As a consequence, as I think many of you remember, the business operated at a loss at some point last year. \u2047 As you know, we remain convinced that we have a very good business in FLC with terrific professionals and we hired even in the face of that downturn. \u2047 A side note, look, in my experience, you can hurt a business seriously by overreacting to short-term headwinds. \u2047 For example, by failing to hire great people or getting rid of good people. \u2047 But my experience also is that if you don't make those steps, if instead you support great people in a downturn, you see ultimately that the short-term headwinds dissipate and the powerful underlying strength and potential for that great group of people emerges, and we are seeing that this year with FLC. \u2047 In strat coms, you saw our teams beginning six years ago and since, drive a set of strategic changes that turned the business from one what was once a declining business into a terrific growth engine. \u2047 A business that's really growing its brand, in revenue and capability, not on every dimension perfectly every quarter, but robustly and powerfully over any extended period of time, including this year. \u2047 I saved corp fin for last. \u2047 Some, I suspect, worry that corp fin is a counterexample. \u2047 Since at least this year, the market forces seem to be trumping everything. \u2047 I would argue that corp fin, in fact, fully reinforces the overall point. \u2047 Yes, this restructuring market is down a huge amount. \u2047 And we are, therefore, down in restructuring substantially versus last year. \u2047 But it's worth noting that our restructuring business, in the face of this terrible market, is still up substantially from six years ago. \u2047 For example, my first year here, reflecting the team's strengthening of that business, strengthening an already strong creditor rights business we had in the U.S., expanding substantially our U.S. company-site business and demanding -- dramatically strengthening our restructuring positions abroad in multiple markets. \u2047 And the CF results today also reflect the efforts of our team made over the same period to build business transformation and transactions business that today are soaring. \u2047 The result is if you look out over multiple years, not just this year versus last year, you look through the ups and downs of the market, we have been able to develop and attract great professionals in the U.S. and around the world. \u2047 And as a result, though the CF results are down year on year, they are not over an extended period of time. \u2047 For example, the profits in the first half of this year, even with the hit to the market, the restructuring, are still at a run rate that is essentially triple my first year here. \u2047 So are we affected by markets? \u2047 But are we determined by those markets? \u2047 I don't think the data suggests that. \u2047 I think the data explicitly suggests otherwise. \u2047 Market forces affect us sometimes that's dramatically over short periods of time in our individual businesses. \u2047 They cause zig and zag. \u2047 But we have also seen that if we don't overreact to the zigs and zags, if instead we assess our businesses and when we find that we have confidence in those businesses and in the teams driving them and we commit to investing in those businesses even in a slow period, even if it hurts those financials in that slow period, as we did back in FLC and are fully willing to do so in CF, our experience is over any longer period of time, we get rewarded powerfully. \u2047 We end up building businesses that great people want to stay in and help build, that great people want to be part of. \u2047 Businesses that attract great people, that support their ambitions and their development and allows them to build businesses they're proud of and client relationships that make an impact. \u2047 And when you have great people doing great work and feeling supported, you end up with people who are developing this themselves, feeling good about themselves, and great people outside your firm who want to be part of that. \u2047 You create businesses that through the zigs and zags, become sustainable, powerful, durable, resilient and exciting growth engine. \u2047 That is what our teams through the zigs and zags, to me, have demonstrated. \u2047 And together, I believe we will continue to do so. \u2047 Beginning with our second-quarter results. \u2047 Revenue growth more than offset increased costs, primarily from our investments in both organic head count growth and in acquisition. \u2047 Earnings per share were further boosted by lower weighted average shares outstanding, or WASO, and from a lower tax rate, resulting in a 39.4% increase in GAAP earnings per share and a 31.8% increase in adjusted EPS. \u2047 The strength in our M&A and litigation-driven businesses that more than offset the impact of lower demand for restructuring globally. \u2047 Overall, we are pleased with these results, which give us even greater confidence in our increased guidance ranges for the year. \u2047 Revenues of $711.5 million were up $103.6 million, compared to revenues of $607.9 million in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 GAAP earnings per share of $1.77 in 2Q '21, compared to $1.27 in 2Q '20. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $1.74, which compared to $1.32 in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 The difference between our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share in 2Q '21 reflects $3.1 million in a fair value remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, which increased GAAP earnings per share by $0.09, and a $2.4 million of noncash interest expense related to our convertible notes, which reduced GAAP earnings per share by $0.06. \u2047 Net income of $62.8 million, compared to $48.2 million in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 The year-over-year increase was primarily due to high operating profits in our Forensic and Litigation Consulting or FLC segment, as well as our technology and economic consulting segments, which was only partially offset by lower operating profits in our Corporate Finance & Restructuring segment compared to the prior-year quarter. \u2047 SG&A of $133.9 million were 18.8% of revenues. \u2047 This compares to SG&A of $126.9 million or 20.9% of revenues in the second year -- in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 The dollar increase in SG&A was primarily due to an unfavorable impact related to foreign currency translation, or FX, increased compensation primarily related to nonbillable head count growth, and the higher rent, which was partially offset by lower bad debt and the previously mentioned fair value remeasurement. \u2047 Second-quarter 2021 adjusted EBITDA of $92.3 million or 13% of revenues, compared to $75.8 million or 12.5% of revenues in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 Our second-quarter effective tax rate of 19.3%, compared to 23.1% in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 Our tax rate for the quarter was favorably impacted by a discrete tax adjustment from the remeasurement of our deferred tax asset in the U.K., following the proposed U.K. tax rate increase that's effective April 2023. \u2047 Without this change, our second-quarter '21 effective tax rate would have been 23.3%. \u2047 For the balance of '21, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 22% and 25%. \u2047 Fully diluted WASO for Q2 of 35.4 million shares declined 2.5 million shares, compared to 37.9 million shares in 2Q '20. \u2047 Our convertible notes had a potential diluted impact on earnings per share of approximately 872,000 shares for the quarter. \u2047 Included in WASO, as our average share price of $140.72 this past quarter was above the $101.38 conversion threshold rate. \u2047 Billable head count increased by 470 professionals or 10.1% that's compared to the prior-year quarter. \u2047 Noteworthy, in May, we closed on our acquisition of The Rhodes Group, welcoming 38 billable professionals to our construction solutions practice within our FLC segment. \u2047 And in July last year, we acquired Delta Consulting, adding 151 billable professionals. \u2047 Sequentially, billable head count decreased by 27 professionals or half of 1%. \u2047 Now I will share some insights at the segment level. \u2047 In Corporate Finance & Restructuring, revenues of $231"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings
