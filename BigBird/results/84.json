{"article": ["I'd like to start by first congratulating Steve on being named ALLETE's CFO last week. \u2047 Steve is a familiar face to you all, and he is an integral member of ALLETE's executive leadership team. \u2047 With his breadth of experience and strategic and technical expertise always founded on strong integrity, Steve is the perfect person for this next era as ALLETE continues to advance the nation's clean energy transformation. \u2047 Steve succeeds Bob Adams as CFO. \u2047 As we announced earlier this year, Bob is retiring in June after more than 35 years at ALLETE. \u2047 We're all grateful Bob will be with us over the next several months. \u2047 These financial results were firmly within our 2021 earnings guidance range of $3 to $3.30 per share. \u2047 I couldn't be more proud of our entire team for these results and all of our accomplishments in 2021. \u2047 Our businesses had an incredibly strong fourth quarter, ending the year on a high note. \u2047 We delivered on many operational, positioning, and financial successes driven by ALLETE's amazing employees and strong culture, as together we advance sustainability in action. \u2047 These accomplishments are providing value to our customers and our shareholders today and will continue to do so for years to come. \u2047 In a few moments, Steve will provide details of the 2021 financial results and 2022 guidance, and Bob will provide his thoughts on our growth trajectory. \u2047 Before that, I would like to highlight just a few of the accomplishments we achieved during the year. \u2047 While we serve our customers with excellence and provide exciting opportunities for our employees, we take great pride in creating value for our shareholders, and ALLETE soundly executed in 2021, hitting our earnings target and paying an attractive dividend while strategically positioning all of our businesses for sustainable growth well into the future. \u2047 We're committed to ALLETE's long-term five-year objective of achieving consolidated average annual earnings per share growth within a range of 5% to 7%, and I'm confident in our ability to achieve this for our investors. \u2047 During 2021, a year we characterized early on as a transitional year for ALLETE. \u2047 We highlighted several initiatives we put in motion to improve returns on capital and to provide avenues for additional investments in clean energy infrastructure. \u2047 I'm pleased with our success on these key strategic initiatives. \u2047 First, regarding improving returns. \u2047 In late 2021, Minnesota Power received an interim rate order to begin charging new rates, which support the quality and reliability of electric services provided to our customers. \u2047 The interim rates were approved as filed and went into effect at the beginning of 2022. \u2047 Although there's more to play out during the year, we view this as a very constructive outcome that supports Minnesota Power's financial health and ability to continue our clean energy transformation while delivering safe, resilient, reliable, and affordable service to our customers. \u2047 Superior water, light, and power is also preparing to file a rate case later in 2022. \u2047 And this will support the company's ability to continue to upgrade infrastructure and maintain the resiliency, reliability, and high quality of services for its customers. \u2047 Onto new clean energy investments driven by our sustainability in action strategy. \u2047 We're making significant progress on Minnesota Power's vision to provide 100% carbon free energy to customers by 2050. \u2047 This bold vision reflects our commitment to the climate, our customers, and our communities through Minnesota Power's Energy Forward strategy. \u2047 Minnesota Power's clean energy transition, detailed in its Integrated Resource Plan, is moving forward in the process, including extensive engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, from customers to communities, to regulators, to employees, and many others, and we expect a decision in the second half of 2022. \u2047 Today, we're pleased to provide updated information regarding our capital expenditure plans to effectuate this transition, and Bob will share some additional comments on all of that in a moment. \u2047 And it has been great to see that Minnesota Power's taconite customers finished 2021 at full production of approximately 40 million tons. \u2047 We anticipate 2022 production to be closer to average at around 35 million tons as reflected in Minnesota Power's rate case. \u2047 But the ongoing investments by these customers in existing production and in product enhancements, including sustainability as well as the prospect of new customers, clearly support the long-term viability and attractiveness of the natural resource based economy of the region that Minnesota Power is privileged to serve. \u2047 ALLETE Clean Energy is also making significant progress in our sustainability in action strategy. \u2047 ALLETE's second largest business with operations that spanned from coast to coast is well positioned to drive additional clean energy sector growth. \u2047 With the recently completed 303 megawatt Caddo wind facility now in service, ALLETE Clean Energy's total wind capacity has increased to more than 1,300 megawatts. \u2047 We've also made significant progress in our work to expand ALLETE Clean Energy's focus beyond wind to provide additional growth engines in the clean energy space. \u2047 We've identified several promising opportunities for investment that would augment ALLETE's existing clean energy solutions and expand our capabilities into solar and storage. \u2047 We anticipate sharing more on this effort this year. \u2047 Along with creative solutions for our customers and great opportunities for our employees, ALLETE's mix of businesses offers differentiated value to investors with earnings growth, an attractive dividend, and strong positioning to thrive in the clean energy future. \u2047 Today ALLETE reported 2021 earnings of $3.23 per share or net income of $169.2 million. \u2047 Earnings for 2020 were $3.35 per share or net income of $174.2 million. \u2047 As Bethany mentioned, we finished the year well within our guidance range with both our regulated operations and ALLETE Clean Energy and corporate and other near the upper end of their respective original guidance range. \u2047 A few significant highlights impacting the full year ended 2021. \u2047 Earnings in 2021 reflected a $0.16 per share gain recorded in the fourth quarter for the sale of a portion of the Nemadji Trail Energy Center by South Shore Energy, ALLETE's non-rate regulated Wisconsin subsidiary. \u2047 Earnings in 2021 reflected a $0.07 per share charge resulting from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission decision to order refunds in Minnesota Power's fuel adjustment clause filing, covering the periods of July 2018 through December 2019. \u2047 Net income in 2021 also included a $0.10 per share negative impact of ALLETE Clean Energy's Diamond Spring wind energy facility related to the extreme weather in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 Turning to the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 Overall, ALLETE's consolidated results for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations with earnings at $1.18 per share, compared to $0.90 per share for the same quarter in 2020. \u2047 At least regulated operations segment recorded net income of $29.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, as compared to $25.3 million in 2020. \u2047 Earnings reflected higher net income at Minnesota Power, primarily due to higher megawatt hour sales to retail and municipal customers, including a 10% increase from taconite customers and positive income tax expense timing differences. \u2047 The fourth quarter did include a reserve for the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission decision to order refunds in Minnesota Power's fuel adjustment clause filing related to prior years. \u2047 ALLETE Clean Energy recorded fourth quarter 2021 net income of $14.6 million, compared to $13.1 million in 2020. \u2047 And income in 2021 include a full quarter contribution from the Diamond Spring wind energy facility, which commenced operations in December of 2020, and earnings from the new Caddo wind energy facility, which was in service in December. \u2047 Offsetting these increases was an anticipated loss on the Northern Wind power project due to higher than expected total estimated cost to complete this project. \u2047 I will provide additional details on this in a moment. \u2047 Our corporate and other businesses recorded net income of $17.6 million in 2021, compared to net income of $8.7 million in 2020. \u2047 2021 included an $8.5 million after-tax gain from South Shore Energy sale of a portion of its interest in the Nemadji Trail Energy Center. \u2047 Also positively impacting 2021 results are higher earnings from our investment in the Nobles 2 energy facility, which commenced operations in December 2020, and higher net income from land sales at ALLETE properties. \u2047 I'll now turn to our 2022 earnings guidance. \u2047 Today, we initiated 2022 earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.90 per share, a net income of $195 million to $210 million. \u2047 The midpoint of our guidance range represents a 16% increase over 2021 results and reflects our expectations of improving returns and positive momentum around our clean energy investments. \u2047 This guidance range is comprised of our regulated operations within a range of $2.60 to $2.80 per share in ALLETE Clean Energy and our Corp. and other businesses within a range of $1 to $1.10 per share. \u2047 Recall in February 2021, we shared at a high level that 2021 was expected to be a transition year with continued economic impacts from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and preparations for a much-needed Minnesota Power rate case. \u2047 To provide visibility into 2022, ALLETE provided a preliminary estimated earnings guidance range of $3.70 to $4 per share. \u2047 The reason for the approximately $0.10 difference between our preliminary guidance estimate and our 2022 guidance issued today relates primarily to ALLETE Clean Energy's expectation of lower megawatt hour generation from its legacy wind energy facilities. \u2047 At a high level, our actual megawatt hour generation at these facilities has been lower than our recent projections. \u2047 And to better reflect recent historical results and updated models, we have refined our estimates and expectations. \u2047 A few comments on a regulated operations outlook for 2022. \u2047 Our guidance reflects interim rates for the Minnesota Power retail rate case of approximately $87 million. \u2047 Interim rates are subject to refund. \u2047 Our guidance assumes we will achieve reasonable outcomes in regulatory proceedings. \u2047 Minnesota Power's investor sales are expected to range between 6 million to 6.5 million megawatt hours, which reflects anticipated production from our taconite customers of approximately 35 million tons. \u2047 Our taconite customers started the year with full production. \u2047 However, recent customer announcements signaled some curtailments during the year, which would result in production in line with our estimates. \u2047 As you might recall, Minnesota Power has asked for a large power sales true-up mechanism in its recently filed rate case to fairly balance this type of variation in sales between customers and investors. \u2047 A few highlights from ALLETE Clean Energy outlook for 2022. \u2047 ALLETE Clean Energy expects total wind generation of approximately 4 million megawatt hours this year, compared to 3 million megawatt hours last year with the expectation of normal wind resources. \u2047 The increase in megawatt hours is primarily related to the Caddo wind energy facility in service for the full year. \u2047 Our guidance reflects the downward adjusted megawatt hour generation from ALLETE Clean Energy's legacy wind energy facilities, which is more in line with 2021 actual megawatt hour generation. \u2047 For our Corp. and other businesses, we expect slightly higher earnings from our investment in the Nobles 2 wind energy facility and earnings from a new Minnesota solar project expected to be completed later this year. \u2047 Earnings per share reflects $50 million of additional equity issuances to fund the Caddo project and other growth initiatives. \u2047 A further update on ALLETE Clean Energy projects, which is detailed on Slide 9. \u2047 As previously disclosed, we plan to repower and sell the now 100 megawatt Northern Wind project, which consists of the existing Chanarambie and Viking facilities to a subsidiary of Xcel Energy. \u2047 This transaction remains on track for completion in late 2022 and will provide a significant cash contribution for redeployment. \u2047 ALLETE Clean energy has experienced inflationary increases and significant cost pressures related to this project, and as a result, now anticipates a slight loss on the eventual sale of this project, which resulted in an approximately $2 million after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 We will be working to maximize the value of this project and minimize costs as we further navigate supply chain options and work with vendors to make this project profitable. \u2047 The 20 megawatt Rock Aetna portion of this project is positioned to move forward in tandem with the Northern wind power as a shovel-ready project with attractive future profit potential. \u2047 We are finalizing development plans to begin and complete construction of the 92 megawatt Red Barn build-on transfer project, the closing expected in early 2023. \u2047 This project will utilize some of our safe harbor turbines while expanding our customer base and presence in another geographic region of the country. \u2047 The extension of this project, and a testament to our strong relationships with optionality to serve C&I customers or regional utilities, the 68 megawatt whitetail development project is also advancing with its advanced transmission Q position and landowner relationships for either a long-term PPA or build-on transfer project. \u2047 Leveraging ALLETE Clean Energy safe harbor turbines, we continue to advance the 200 megawatt Ruso wind project in North Dakota and are working with various regulators on permitting and citing for this facility. \u2047 First of all, I too would like to begin by congratulating Steve on his promotion to senior VP and CFO of ALLETE. \u2047 I have worked with Steve for over 20 years, and I found him to be an individual of very high integrity and rock solid in terms of his financial expertise, leadership qualities, and strategic mindset. \u2047 He has worked closely with me in recent years on numerous major initiatives aimed at improving our overall returns, growth profile and competitiveness on behalf of our investors and customers alike. \u2047 Steve is supported by one of the strongest teams in the industry, and I have no doubt that Bethany, Steve, and the rest of the management team will continue to succeed as the company prosecutes its clean energy vision and strategy. \u2047 As Steve just shared with you, 2021 was a highly successful year, evident not just by the strong financial results, but the advancement of many key sustainability-in-action initiatives on both the regulated and non-regulated parts of our business that will pay dividends in future years. \u2047 These results came even despite ongoing challenges from the pandemic, as well as significant volatility in weather and lower-than-expected wind production levels at ALLETE Clean Energy. \u2047 We begin 2022 with a strong balance sheet, conservative capital structure at approximately 40% total debt, and an excess of $260 million in operating cash flow. \u2047 A notable achievement on the financing side was our ability to secure approximately $240 million in tax equity financing of the $450 million project under very competitive terms. \u2047 Of the $200 million in total equity investment, $50 million will be raised through our ATM program, as Steve noted earlier in his 2022 guidance overview. \u2047 As Bethany stated, we are committed"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports 2021 earnings of $3.23 per share.  \u2047  compname reports 2021
