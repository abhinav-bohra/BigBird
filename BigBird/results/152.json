{"article": ["I'll begin on Slide 3. \u2047 In the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.30 and generated total revenue of $5.9 billion. \u2047 Our linked quarter pre-tax pre-provision net revenue growth of 2.7% was driven by continued momentum across our fee businesses, growth in average loan balances, and continued focus on expense management resulting in positive operating leverage. \u2047 We released $310 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, supported by our outlook on the economy and better-than-expected credit quality metrics. \u2047 Our book value per share totaled $32.22 at September 30, which was 1.5% higher than June 30. \u2047 Our CET1 ratio was 10.2% at September 30. \u2047 Slide 4 provides key third quarter performance metrics, including a return on tangible common equity of over 20%. \u2047 Slide 5 highlights strong trends in digital engagement. \u2047 On Slide 6, we are providing an initial information about our Business Banking and payment relationships, which we plan to update every quarter. \u2047 Our complete payments ecosystem is a competitive advantage for us and provides a number of cyclical and secular growth opportunities. \u2047 Over the next few years, we believe there is a significant potential to expand and deepen relationships within this ecosystem. \u2047 Our starting point is that, we have about 1.1 million Business Banking relationships, which we define as businesses with under $25 million in revenue. \u2047 Currently, about half of our payments customers of this size have a Business Banking product and just under one-third of our Business Banking customers have a payments product. \u2047 The opportunity is to both increase the number of Business Banking relationships and to deepen these relationships by connecting our banking customers with our payments products and services, and connecting our payments customers with our banking products and services. \u2047 As we discussed previously, we believe we can grow our small business relationships by 15% to 20% and related revenue by 25% to 30% over the next few years. \u2047 Average loans increased 0.8% compared with the second quarter, driven by growth in other retail loans, primarily installment loans, as well as growth in credit card and residential mortgages. \u2047 This growth was partially offset by lower commercial loan balances which was impacted by lower levels of PPP loans. \u2047 At September 30, PPP loan balances totaled $2.4 billion compared to $4.9 billion at June 30. \u2047 Excluding PPP loans, third quarter average loans grew by 1.8% on a linked quarter basis. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8, average deposits increased 0.5% compared with the second quarter and 6.4% compared with a year ago. \u2047 On both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis, we continued to benefit from favorable mix shift as average non-interest bearing deposits increased while higher cost time deposits declined. \u2047 Slide 9 shows credit quality trends. \u2047 Non-performing assets declined on both a linked quarter and year-over-year basis and our net charge-off ratio hit a record low of 20 basis points. \u2047 Our reserve release was $310 million this quarter, primarily reflecting strong credit quality metrics. \u2047 Our allowance for credit losses as of September 30 totaled $6.3 billion, or 2.1% of loans. \u2047 The allowance level reflected our best estimate of the economic outlook and trajectory of credit quality within the portfolios. \u2047 Slide 10 provides an earnings summary. \u2047 In the third quarter of 2021, we earned $1.30 per diluted share. \u2047 These results include a reserve release of $310 million. \u2047 Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of $3.2 billion increased by 1% compared with the second quarter. \u2047 The growth was primarily driven by higher loan fees associated with the Paycheck Protection Program. \u2047 Excluding PPP-related fees, net interest income would have been stable, reflecting lower loan yields and the impact of change in loan mix, offset by the beneficial impact of core loan growth, lower premium amortization, and an additional day in the quarter. \u2047 Our net interest margin was stable compared with the second quarter. \u2047 Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income. \u2047 Compared with a year ago, non-interest income declined 0.7% as decreases in mortgage revenue and commercial products revenue more than offset strong growth in payments revenue, trust and investment management fees, deposit service charges, and treasury management fees. \u2047 On a linked quarter basis, non-interest income increased 2.8% reflecting higher-than-expected payments revenue and a 20% increase in mortgage revenue driven by growth in production volume and related gain on sale margins, as well as higher loan sales. \u2047 Slide 13 provides information on our payment services business. \u2047 Our payments business continues to benefit from improving economic conditions and spend activity. \u2047 In the third quarter, sales volumes for both our credit card and our merchant processing businesses exceeded the pandemic compared period in 2019, while CPS volume was about in line. \u2047 As expected, prepaid card volume declined in the third quarter as the impact of government-related stimulus continues to diminish. \u2047 The reduced prepaid volume resulted in a slight decline in credit and debit card revenue on a linked quarter basis. \u2047 However, corporate payment revenues increased by 13%, which was better-than-expected, driven by improving business spend activity. \u2047 Merchant processing revenue increased by 4.8% due to higher merchant and equipment fees, as well as higher sales volumes. \u2047 Turning to Slide 14, non-interest expense increased 1.2% compared to the second quarter. \u2047 This increase primarily reflected higher revenue-related compensation and performance-based incentives. \u2047 Slide 15 highlights our capital position. \u2047 Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at September 30 was 10.2%, which increased slightly compared to June 30. \u2047 At the beginning of the third quarter, we suspended our share buyback program due to our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire MUFG's Union Bank. \u2047 We expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until the second quarter of 2022. \u2047 After the closing of the acquisition, we expect to operate at a CET1 capital ratio between our target ratio and 9%. \u2047 As PPP winds down and we approach the end of the forgiveness period, we expect PPP fees to decline $60 million to $70 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. \u2047 Excluding the impact of PPP fees, we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively stable on a linked quarter basis. \u2047 We expect PPP to be immaterial to both net interest income and the net interest margin in 2022. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we expect total payments revenue trends to continue to strengthen, driven by improving sales volumes. \u2047 However, the fourth quarter is typically seasonally lower than the third quarter, which affects linked quarter comparisons. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we expect to see a seasonal increase in amortization of tax-advantaged investments of approximately $60 million, as well as some seasonal impacts in marketing and in business investments. \u2047 Credit quality remains strong. \u2047 Over the next few quarters, we expect the net charge-off ratio to remain lower than normal. \u2047 For the full-year of 2021, we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately 22%. \u2047 I'll hand it back to Andy for closing remarks. \u2047 To summarize our third quarter results, we're positive on several fronts, highlighted by a solid growth in core loans, good fee revenue momentum, and strong credit quality. \u2047 We are finishing off the year in a strong position heading into 2022 and we're excited about the many organic growth opportunities we see across the franchise, supported by our continued investment in people, digital, technology, and data analytics. \u2047 Our three payments businesses will continue to benefit from the improved spend activity, particularly as consumer and business travel recovers toward pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 More importantly, we believe our secular growth initiatives aimed at connecting payments with banking provide a meaningful potential for market share gains over the immediate and longer-term. \u2047 Our Business Banking initiatives are still in the early innings but we're gaining traction and our partnership with State Farm continues to evolve and grow. \u2047 We are encouraged by the results we're seeing. \u2047 Aside from our organic growth opportunities, our recently announced acquisition of Union Bank provides a platform to achieve cost synergies, expand our distribution network in demographically attractive West Coast markets, and leverage our broad product set in leading digital capabilities across a loyal but underpenetrated customer base. \u2047 All of this will enable us to accelerate revenue and earnings growth, and continue to deliver the industry-leading returns on equity that our shareholders have come to expect. \u2047 We'll now open up the call to Q&A. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["u.s. bancorp q3 earnings per share $1.30.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $1.30.  \u2047  q3 revenue $5.9 billion.
