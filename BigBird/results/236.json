{"article": ["We refer to certain of these risks in our SEC filings. \u2047 Participating in today's call with me will be Paul McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Riffee, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Taryn Fielder, Senior Vice President and General Counsel; Drew Hammond, Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer; and Grant Montgomery, Vice President and Head of Research. \u2047 I hope you and your families are keeping safe and well. \u2047 Last evening, we released our fourth quarter earnings results, which rounded out a year, dedicated to stabilizing our operating fundamentals and maintaining and preserving future growth drivers against the backdrop of one of the most challenging operating environments in recent history. \u2047 With the vaccine roll-out that commenced toward the end of last year, we are seeing signs of increased activity across both our multifamily and commercial portfolios. \u2047 For multifamily, net applications were up 30% year-over-year in January for our urban properties, and year-to-date trends already reflect improvement in occupancy as we head into the spring leasing season. \u2047 We are focused on growing occupancy to begin reducing concessions and increasing rents. \u2047 Currently, multifamily occupancy is over 95%, excluding our two rent-controlled properties where we are not emphasizing occupancy gains as they offer limited rent growth potential in the current environment. \u2047 Multifamily credit performance continues to remain very strong at both our urban and suburban properties and has consistently outperformed the national average by a wide margin over the past year. \u2047 While multifamily lease rates declined 3.6% and 5.7% on a gross and effective blended basis during the fourth quarter, we believe that December represented the height of rental rate pressure as lease rate changes improved in January on a month-over-month basis and concession declined. \u2047 Furthermore, new and renewal lease executions with commencement dates in February and March indicate continued improvement and effective lease rate growth. \u2047 Our renewal rates were strong during the fourth quarter and that strength has continued into 2021. \u2047 Both urban and suburban renewal lease rate growth increased by 90 basis points during the fourth quarter to 1.7% and 3.1% respectively, and those renewal rate increases remained stable through January. \u2047 The continued pricing power that we are experiencing at our suburban assets, combined with the ability to influence lease terms with concessions, has allowed us to roll more leases into future spring and summer lease maturities at our newest multifamily assets. \u2047 As a result of the strategic management of our lease expiration schedule, only 20% of our leases expired during the fourth quarter and only 17% expire in the first quarter. \u2047 We think December marked the low point for pricing given the improving year-to-date trends that we are seeing. \u2047 We believe the vaccine-led recovery will lead to an inflection in 2021 heading into 2022. \u2047 However, it is too early to know the precise timing and extent of this benefit in 2021. \u2047 Approximately two-thirds of our multifamily leases expire in the stronger spring and summer months, and we anticipate that these leases will benefit from an increased number of vaccinations. \u2047 In the meantime, we plan to continue to focus on building occupancy and maximizing our retention rates, which continue to outperform our region. \u2047 Moving onto commercial, our credit performance continues to hold up very well as Steve will discuss in greater detail. \u2047 And we expect that the vast majority of our commercial credit losses are behind us. \u2047 Our forecast indicates that commercial occupancy could increase by nearly 4% by year-end although there is still too much uncertainty to accurately forecast occupancy gains over the course of the year. \u2047 However, our outlook is improving, and we are seeing signs that tenant decision-making is accelerating. \u2047 Leasing activity picked up significantly in January and active long-term renewal discussions with significant tenants are progressing well. \u2047 For example, in January, we've received the signed LOI from Sunrise Senior Living to renew their space at Silverline, which currently represents approximately 1.5% of office revenue. \u2047 We also have signed LOIs with B. Riley and then an accredited third-party at Arlington Tower. \u2047 B. Riley has a termination option in December 2022 and will exercise this option on only one of its three floors, which allow the third-party to enter into a sublease for this entire floor through 2022 and then, enter into a direct lease with us through 2029. \u2047 B. Riley will extend the balance of their premises through 2026. \u2047 Additionally, in January, we signed a 45,000 square foot five-year lease renewal with Giant Food that at Takoma Park, which represents our second largest retail tenant and over 6% of other rental income. \u2047 We also signed a 15,000 square foot 10-year lease renewal with our grocery-anchored at Montrose Shopping Center. \u2047 These two lease renewals represent approximately 10% of our retail rental income. \u2047 Heading into the recovery, our office portfolio offers substantial growth potential given that much of the available space is high-quality, move-in ready and located in our best assets. \u2047 We have a weighted average lease term of approximately five years, limited near-term lease expirations, and our price points and floor layouts are well positioned for our market. \u2047 The average tenant size in our market and the space requirement that seizes the most volume is about 4,000 to 6,000 square feet, which is both our medium tenant size and the tenant size with the highest demand in the current environment. \u2047 We have zero exposure to co-working operators, no co-working tenants and no single-tenant risk. \u2047 We continue to see good traction with Space Plus, which is our proprietary flexible office program that is managed in-house with spaces strategically located in our portfolio. \u2047 Space Plus represents approximately 3% of our office portfolio and is very well positioned once decision-making picks up. \u2047 Space Plus is move-in ready space that is private, not co-working space that allows tenants to control the health and safety of their environment and it offers more flexibility than traditional leases. \u2047 Additionally, Space Plus offers premium pricing compared to traditional leases and on average, has much longer terms than co-working providers achieve allowing us to participate in the increasing demand for flexible office space, while preserving our weighted average lease term, and thus our opportunities for future portfolio transformation. \u2047 While uncertainty about the timing and pace of reopening remains, the resilience of our region provides relative stability compared to other major metropolitan areas. \u2047 Since the onset of the pandemic, the Washington Metro has benefited from fewer job losses than other major metropolitan areas and has already gained back roughly 180,000 jobs or 56% of the jobs lost from February to May. \u2047 Additionally, those job losses have been largely contained to non-office-using sectors as office-using sector employment in the Washington Metro market declined only 2% year-over-year in 2020 according to BLS data. \u2047 As we continued down the path toward a vaccine-driven recovery, our region has several unique catalysts to accelerate the rebound in demand. \u2047 The growing, high-tech labor pool, federal investments in cloud, cyber and artificial intelligence as well as affordable office rents continue to drive information sector leasing activity in Northern Virginia. \u2047 Amazon continues to expand their regional office footprint and remains on pace with HQ2 hiring. \u2047 Over the course of 2020, the tech sector contributed 36% of total leasing volume and more than 800,000 square feet of occupancy growth in Northern Virginia according to CBRE. \u2047 Tech-driven leasing demand drove positive absorption for the sector in the fourth quarter and that momentum has continued into January with the announcement of Microsoft's new 180,000 square foot sales headquarters in Rosslyn, next door to Arlington Tower and strategically located at the nexus of four bridges, five major road networks and three metro lines and offers easy access to the Pentagon and Downtown DC. \u2047 Government contract awards should remain at record highs in 2021 and the cloud market alone is forecasted to grow 9% to 10% annually over the next three years according to JLL. \u2047 Lot of Virginia's diversification over the past decade, blending government contracting with direct federal leasing, technology sector growth, investments in higher education, and medicine have set it up for a quicker-than-average office market recovery in 2021 and beyond according to Newmark. \u2047 With the arrival of our newly aligned administration, the Washington Metro market is positioned to benefit from a surge in activity. \u2047 Historically, alignment between the executive and legislative branches has resulted in a higher number of legislative bills passed with increased lobbying and legal presence in DC to influence, write and then implement legislation resulting in higher absorption in the DC office market. \u2047 A historical correlation to office absorption in years with aligned[Phonetic] branches of the government is very strong. \u2047 Additionally, the election should have a positive effect on our local partner market and may even accelerate a shift back into the city for renters. \u2047 Data analyzed by CBRE over the past six Presidential elections indicates that on average DC Metro rent growth was more than double the US average during the six months subsequent to each election. \u2047 Furthermore, market-level data indicates that urban submarkets, which have underperformed suburban areas during this downturn, will likely benefit the most from the boost of activity associated with the Presidential election. \u2047 Again these are catalysts historically unique to the Washington Metro area as opposed to other gateway metropolitan markets. \u2047 It has been an eventful and unexpected year and alongside the challenges that we have successfully navigated, we continue to make progress on derisking and improving our portfolio. \u2047 This pandemic has reaffirmed our commitment to and the direction of our capital allocation strategy as part of the WashREIT transformation. \u2047 Following our fourth quarter office asset sales and including stabilized income from Trove, multifamily comprises 53% of our NOI, while office and retail comprise 41% and 6% respectively. \u2047 I'll start off today by reviewing the balance sheet before discussing our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance and future outlook. \u2047 In the midst of the uncertainty that dominated the capital markets during 2020, we took steps to strengthen our balance sheet and increase our operational flexibility, which has put us in a stronger position as we head toward the recovery phase of the pandemic. \u2047 First, we made sure that we had ample liquidity at the onset of the pandemic by entering into a $150 million one-year term loan with extension rights. \u2047 Second, we closed and funded in December a $350 million 10-year Green Bond at 3.44%, and we used the proceeds to pay off the new $150 million term loan and our other $150 million term loan that was scheduled to expire in March of 2021. \u2047 These actions address all of our debt maturities through the fourth quarter of 2022 and turned out our maturity ladder. \u2047 Third, we fully unencumbered the balance sheet, allowing us optimal flexibility as we continue to allocate capital to further multifamily growth. \u2047 Finally, we increased our balance sheet flexibility heading into 2021 with our strategic office asset sales and issued some equity through the ATM program to be ready to continue our capital allocation when visibility into the recovery is more clear. \u2047 In that regard, at year-end, we only had $42 million outstanding on our fully available $700 million line of credit, underscoring that we increased our liquidity further during the pandemic. \u2047 All of our covenant ratios remained strong, and we maintained our Baa2 and BBB flat investment-grade ratings with Moody's and S&P. \u2047 Now, I'll turn to our cash collection performance. \u2047 Our multifamily collections continue to be excellent trucking well above national averages. \u2047 We collected 99% of cash and contractual rents during the fourth quarter, and our rent collections through January are in line with our quarterly trend. \u2047 We've offered deferred payment programs to residents who've been financially impacted by the pandemic and only a very small amount, about $15,000 of deferred multifamily rent remains outstanding. \u2047 Our office and retail collections for the fourth quarter improved sequentially, continuing the trend of steady quarterly improvement since the beginning of the pandemic. \u2047 We collected 99% of cash rents from office rents -- from office tenants during the fourth quarter and over 99% of contractual rents, which excludes rent that has been deferred. \u2047 We deferred rent associated with office tenants and that amount was $1 million as of January 31. \u2047 And we expect to collect approximately 75% of that rent that was deferred by year-end with the balance thereafter. \u2047 We collected 94% of retail cash rents in the fourth quarter and excluding deferred rent, our collection rate was approximately 97%. \u2047 Net deferred rent associated with retail tenants was $1 million as of January 31, 2021 and we expect to collect 40% of that rent at year-end. \u2047 Overall, we've only deferred a small portion of rent and the expected cumulative cash NOI impact is less than $0.01 per share through year-end 2021. \u2047 Now turning to our financial performance. \u2047 Net loss for 2020 was $15.7 million or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to net income of $383.6 million or $4.75 per diluted share in the prior year. \u2047 The largest decrease is primarily due to the net gains on asset sales that were executed during 2019 compared to small losses recorded on sales in 2020. \u2047 Core FFO of $1.45 per diluted share for full-year 2020 was in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, core FFO per share declined by $0.26 due to the strategic transactions completed during 2019 as well as the impact of the pandemic on leasing activity, parking income and credit losses. \u2047 Overall, same NOI declined 5.4% year-over-year on a GAAP basis and 4.9% on a cash basis for the full-year 2020. \u2047 Multifamily same-store NOI declined 0.9% and 1% on a GAAP and cash basis for the year and 7.2% and 7.3% on a GAAP and cash basis for the fourth quarter. \u2047 The full-year and fourth quarter declines were primarily driven by the year-over-year new lease rate declines at our urban assets, which comprise 100% of our same-store portfolio during 2020. \u2047 The impact of lease rate declines has an outsized impact on our same-store results during the fourth quarter as the impact of urban flight[Phonetic] on overall demand levels had a greater impact on lease rates during the winter months that were weaker. \u2047 Our suburban properties where lease rate performance has been the best will be included in the same-store results in 2021. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we focused on maintaining occupancy and ended at 94.3%, excluding Trove. \u2047 Office same-store NOI declined 7.1% and 6.4% on a GAAP and cash basis for the year and 12.7% on a GAAP and cash basis for the fourth quarter. \u2047 The full Year and fourth quarter declines were primarily driven"], "gold_summary":
