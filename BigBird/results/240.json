{"article": ["We've revised our full-year 2021 estimate for DCF and EBITDA substantially upward. \u2047 Steve, Kim, and David will explain the underpinnings of that change. \u2047 We also increased our dividend to an annualized rate of $1.08 per share as we promised when we released our original outlook for 2021 back in December. \u2047 In my judgment, this increase is an indicator of the significant parts of our corporate financial policy. \u2047 First, it shows we are intent on returning value to our shareholders. \u2047 Second, it demonstrates the consistent strength of our cash flow. \u2047 To put this in perspective, this is the fourth consecutive annual increase in our dividend since 2017, when we were paying an annual dividend of $0.50 per share. \u2047 And we have accomplished that while maintaining a real focus on our balance sheet, having reduced our debt from its peak of almost $43 billion in 2015 to $30.7 billion today, a decrease of over $12 billion, quite an improvement. \u2047 Now we're doing all this while continuing to pursue opportunities with our natural gas assets to firm up deliverability and supply to our customers, opportunities that were highlighted by the recent winter storm in Texas, and also while examining opportunities in the energy transition effort. \u2047 At Kinder Morgan, we remain guided by what we believe is a sound corporate philosophy, fund our capital needs internally, maintain a healthy balance sheet, and return excess cash to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. \u2047 We think this is a recipe for long-term financial success for KMI and its shareholders. \u2047 I'll focus on our performance during Winter Storm Uri, which is what drove our financial results in the quarter. \u2047 So starting with the performance during the February winter storm. \u2047 We were prepared, and that preparation served us well. \u2047 Our previous investments in our assets, particularly on our gas storage assets, were a huge help. \u2047 We were on maximum withdrawal for days at several of our fields. \u2047 Also helpful were our investments in backup generators at key compressor stations on our system. \u2047 Another real key for us was our team. \u2047 Our operations team deployed in advance to keep our facilities running and quickly repair them if they went down. \u2047 We deployed additional generators and tested our generators before the storm got here. \u2047 Our people were at locations that are normally automated, and they were there in the bitter cold, and undoubtedly, many of them have their own families at home without power and water. \u2047 Our team went to key compressor stations, storage facilities, and delivery points to keep gas flowing, including a key delivery point to the city of Austin. \u2047 Our people kept us going. \u2047 Our investments and especially our team winterized us against a terrible storm. \u2047 We also purchased additional gas, some at very high prevailing prices, to serve power plants and gas utilities. \u2047 The result of all this was that we enabled our wholesale customers to serve needs that would have otherwise gone unmet, mitigating the tragedy that too many Texans endured. \u2047 We performed well operationally and commercially across our entire gas network, but our financial performance was especially strong in our Texas intrastate pipeline and storage network. \u2047 And as I'll mention in a minute, in our CO2 business for reasons I'll explain. \u2047 A key difference between our Texas intrastate system and our interstate gas pipeline systems is that we have a purchase and sale business in Texas, supported by high deliverability storage assets. \u2047 In contrast, our interstate pipelines are nearly exclusively selling unbundled transportation and storage services. \u2047 We do that in Texas, too, but we also have a purchase and sale business. \u2047 That business is generally done with reference to an index price. \u2047 For example, we sell gas at the Houston Ship Channel index plus something and buy at Houston Ship Channel minus something. \u2047 In normal circumstances, we're effectively getting a transport margin on our purchases and sales and using our proprietary storage to extract margin from price differences across time periods. \u2047 When prices are in a normal range, this is a very stable business. \u2047 And we view our Texas intrastates as roughly 80% or so take-or-pay. \u2047 In February, supply and demand conditions caused prices to go up by more than 100x and back down by the same order of magnitude over the course of a week. \u2047 Market volatility like we experienced that week reveals the value of reliable pipeline and storage assets and a reliable operations team. \u2047 It reveals the value of having gas in storage and previous purchase arrangements in place. \u2047 It also reveals the value of preparation in such circumstances in which supply and demand conditions causing prices to go up by more than 100 times, we were able to perform well financially, as well as operationally. \u2047 Many of our additional sales, whether as a result of higher takes under our existing contracts or incremental sales that we were able to do during that week, took place at prevailing market prices. \u2047 which during that week at the Houston Ship Channel, range from $180 MMBtu to $400 versus $3 earlier in the same month. \u2047 What does this mean for our business longer term? \u2047 We transact with sophisticated customers who have choices. \u2047 One of those choices is to purchase firm services from us on a long-term basis, and many of them do. \u2047 While we view the events in our financial results as largely nonrecurring, we are already pursuing more long-term firm capacity sales and some associated capital investments that will help our customers to be even better positioned for future extreme weather and create incremental value for Kinder Morgan. \u2047 There is substantial interest in our services following the storm, which should help us in our base business and in new origination. \u2047 The results could be long-term, additional, and more consistent earnings and investment without the extraordinary and rare gain that we experienced in the first quarter. \u2047 The big lesson that should be taken away is that an appropriate amount of contracting for firm deliverability should be in everyone's portfolio. \u2047 And February's event reveals the value of storage and firm transport capacity. \u2047 And we would hope that any changes made in the market structure would adequately compensate and incent parties to do so. \u2047 I mentioned our CO2 business also. \u2047 This is a bit of a different effect. \u2047 That's our biggest power consuming business in the state of Texas. \u2047 Our power contract with our provider enables us to shed load and be compensated at the prevailing power prices. \u2047 When they started to see where power prices were headed, Jesse Arenivas and his team started looking at shedding load. \u2047 So we shut down oil production and shed the load back into the market, where it could be allocated to higher priority human needs. \u2047 The contract work, as designed and particularly with prices as high as $9,000 a megawatt hour, we earned a substantial financial benefit, while letting those megawatts be made available to serve human needs. \u2047 Also notable, for the longer term, Jesse and his team were able to restore production quickly and fully following the storm. \u2047 That's a great accomplishment. \u2047 They had some practice when oil prices went drastically down last year, and we've gotten better at it since then. \u2047 Our flexibility is greater. \u2047 This is great flexibility that we've now built into a part of our business that consumes about 340 megawatts in the state of Texas. \u2047 So good flexibility to have in the power market in the state of Texas. \u2047 So we're very proud of our whole team's performance, but we have lessons to learn too. \u2047 And we'll use those lessons to get even better at severe weather performance for us and for our customers. \u2047 So what will we do with the proceeds? \u2047 Initially, of course, it's a reduction to our net debt. \u2047 But as we repeated many times, our financial principles remain the same. \u2047 First, maintain a strong balance sheet. \u2047 Second, we maintain our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution, and by self-funding our investments. \u2047 And as I mentioned, we may see some incremental investment opportunities as a result of the storm. \u2047 We don't expect those to be significant for 2021. \u2047 Finally, we are returning value to our shareholders with a dividend increase that Rich mentioned. \u2047 It's a well-covered dividend. \u2047 And our approach to share repurchases remains exactly the same. \u2047 We'll be selective, not programmatic. \u2047 We'll base our decisions on the returns versus the alternative uses for the cash that we generate, including projects or assets. \u2047 So strong balance sheet, capital and cost discipline, returning value to shareholders. \u2047 Those are our principles. \u2047 We put together a team with financial, commercial, and engineering talent to focus on analyzing and quantifying opportunities for additional assets and service offerings tailored to the ongoing energy transition, including things like renewable natural gas and carbon capture and sequestration. \u2047 This group reports to Jesse Arenivas, who continues as president of our CO2 business and is headed by Anthony Ashley, who previously served as treasurer and vice president of investor relations. \u2047 While still in our early days for this effort, they've already identified and are working on a number of specific opportunities. \u2047 Also, as I said last time, our business units continue to focus on the energy transition opportunities that fit in with their operations, such as midstream services for renewable diesel and including our -- using our gas transportation and storage services to support renewable power. \u2047 We are also marketing our low methane emissions performance as responsibly produced and transported natural gas. \u2047 That's a good synergy between our ESG performance, our low methane emissions, and our commercial opportunities. \u2047 We participated in our first one of these transactions with Colorado Springs Utilities, which they announced in the first quarter. \u2047 And we're working on another as we speak. \u2047 We believe the winners in our sector will have strong balance sheets, low-cost operations that are reliable, safe, and environmentally sound, and the ability to get things done in difficult circumstances. \u2047 We're proud of our team and our culture. \u2047 And as always, we'll be prepared to meet the challenges and opportunities to come. \u2047 First, I'm going to go through the business fundamentals for the quarter, and then I'll talk at a very high level about our full-year forecast. \u2047 Starting with the natural gas fundamentals. \u2047 Transport volumes were down about 3% or approximately 1.1 million dekatherms per day versus the first quarter of '20. \u2047 And that was driven primarily by declines in Rockies production, increase in transportation alternatives, and lower production out of the Permian, those two things impacting our volumes on EPNG and contract expiration on our joint venture pipe coming out of the Fayetteville. \u2047 These declines were partially offset by higher volumes, which were driven by increased deliveries to LNG export facilities, winter weather in the northeast, and the PHP in service. \u2047 Physical deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipeline averaged approximately 4.7 million dekatherms per day. \u2047 That's greater than a 25% increase versus the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 LNG volumes were down from the approximately 5 million dekatherms per day in the fourth quarter of '20. \u2047 And that was due to the impact of Winter Storm Uri and some coastal fog in February. \u2047 During the storm, total LNG exports dropped to under 2 million dekatherms per day. \u2047 In the first quarter, Kinder Morgan pipes moved approximately 47% of the volume going to LNG export facilities. \u2047 Exports to Mexico on our pipes were up about 3% when compared to the first quarter of '20. \u2047 Our share of Mexico deliveries in the first quarter ran about 55%. \u2047 Deliveries to power plants, they were down due to higher natural gas prices. \u2047 Deliveries to LDCs were up due to colder weather. \u2047 One, on our natural gas gathering volumes, they were down about 25% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of '20. \u2047 But for gathering volumes, I think the more informative comparison is the sequential quarter. \u2047 So compared to the fourth-quarter volumes, first-quarter volumes were down about 11%. \u2047 Approximately two-thirds of that 11% reduction are related to KinderHawk, which is our gathering asset in the Haynesville. \u2047 But given that there are 45 rigs deployed in that basin, we expect that our volumes will increase sequentially each quarter for the balance of the year, although it will be a little bit slower than what we've budgeted. \u2047 Eagle Ford volumes were also down versus the fourth quarter, and we expect that those will be down versus our budget. \u2047 The Eagle Ford remains a very tough market, given the oversupply of takeaway options. \u2047 On the positive side, we expect volumes in the Bakken and Altamont to be on plan or better for the year. \u2047 In our products pipeline segment, refined products volumes were down about 10% for the quarter versus the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 And that's just the result of the continued pandemic impact. \u2047 Gasoline volumes were up 6% versus the first quarter of '20. \u2047 That's an improvement from the fourth quarter when they were off about 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 Jet volumes remain weak off about 29%, but that's a big improvement from the fourth quarter when they were off 47% versus the fourth quarter of '20. \u2047 And diesel volumes were up 6%, and that's relatively flat to the percentage in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Total volumes moving through our pipes did improve each month during the quarter. \u2047 March volumes were up slightly versus 2020, and they were down about 6% versus 2019. \u2047 Currently, we're forecasting refined products to be down versus our plan, and I'll go through that a little bit later in my comments. \u2047 Crude and condensate volumes were down about 28% in the quarter versus the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Sequentially, they were up 2%. \u2047 Our terminals business fundamentals have been impacted by two events: the winter storm and the continued impact of the pandemic. \u2047 The winter storm was short lived, with the impact limited to the first quarter. \u2047 The pandemic is lingering, and it continues to impact our petroleum product volumes as well as demand for our Jones Act tankers. \u2047 However, as we've mentioned in prior quarters, the impact of reduced petroleum product demand on our tankage is more muted than in our product pipeline, given the fixed take-or-pay contracts for tank capacity. \u2047 Our liquids utilization percentage, which reflects the tanks that we have under contract remains high at 95%. \u2047 If you exclude tanks out of service for required inspection, utilization is about 98%. \u2047 On the tankers, we have a number of ships that have contract expirations this year, and the market is relatively weak, given the weakness in refined product volumes. \u2047 The reduction in crude oil production and the tightening WTI Brent spread also impacts this market, but to a much lesser extent, given a smaller percentage of the fleet engaged in that service. \u2047 We expect"],
