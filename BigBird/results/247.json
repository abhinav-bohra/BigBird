{"article": ["Regarding today's program, we will first review our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2021 financial and operating results. \u2047 After that, we will take a short break, we will then begin the Investor Day portion of the program where we will provide an update on our strategic positioning, discuss our newly announced Elevate initiative and provide a multi-year outlook. \u2047 After that, we will host a Q&A session. \u2047 Following our comments, we are hosting a virtual Investor Day, where we will provide a long-range strategic update and financial outlook, including a comprehensive discussion of our Elevate investment initiative. \u2047 Fiscal 2021 was an exceptional year for ABM, highlighted by continued strong financial performance and the acquisition of Able Services, a key transaction that substantially expanded our geographic footprint and broadened our capabilities. \u2047 Throughout the year, our global team continued to execute at the highest level, successfully navigating a dynamic environment with agility, resiliency and dedication to serve our clients. \u2047 Fourth quarter revenue grew over 14% to $1.7 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 23%, representing a great finish to our fiscal 2021 year, where revenue of $6.2 billion was accompanied by an adjusted earnings per share increase of 47% to $3.58. \u2047 Our strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven by one month of contribution from Able, as well as organic growth in our B&I, Aviation and Technical Solutions verticals, which more than offset a modest decline in our Education segment. \u2047 I'm pleased with the progress we've made in enhancing our overall profitability as full year adjusted EBITDA margins reached a record 7.3% and fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins increased 40 basis points from prior year. \u2047 Throughout the year, we continued to experience demand for disinfection and virus protection services as clients prioritized our EnhancedClean protocols to maintain hygiene in high traffic spaces. \u2047 In addition, we continued to manage our labor cost efficiently as office occupancy trends increased gradually through the year. \u2047 As anticipated, overall demand for our higher margin work orders and EnhancedClean services eased as the year progressed, yet we maintained elevated in the fourth quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Going forward, we expect that ongoing concerns around COVID-19 variance will lead to incremental opportunities for our disinfection services, providing support for our adjusted EBITDA margins exceeding 6% in fiscal 2022 per our guidance. \u2047 Turning to our segment performance. \u2047 Fourth quarter revenue growth was led by a continued rebound in aviation. \u2047 This industry group, which was most impacted by the pandemic, generated 43% year-over-year revenue growth in the fourth quarter as air travel trends improved markedly over the prior year and we capitalized on new business opportunities, including the expansion of our parking operations at airports. \u2047 Our fourth quarter was also benefited from 21% growth in Technical Solutions revenue, reflecting growth in our emerging e-mobility business and improved access to client-site. \u2047 Technical Solutions backlog increased by 20% sequentially compared to the third quarter and reached a record level in the fourth quarter, driven by the transition to electric vehicles and the associated need for charging stations, our e-mobility business has significant long-term growth potential. \u2047 Key growth drivers for this business include federal stimulus funds designated for energy efficient projects as well as the recent passage of the federal infrastructure bill that included $7.5 billion toward deploying EV charging stations nationwide. \u2047 Our B&I segment continued to perform well as revenue grew at a double-digit rate in the fourth quarter, benefiting from the addition of Able, new contract wins and continued client demand for work orders. \u2047 While office occupancy trended higher over the past year, office occupancy levels remained low by historical standards, which should lead to a continued tailwind from labor efficiencies perspective in this segment during the first half of fiscal 2022 and possibly longer. \u2047 Fourth quarter revenue and margins declined compared to the prior year. \u2047 Earlier this year, we communicated that the return of students to school on a full-time basis with diminished Education segment labor efficiency, as increased staffing would be required to accommodate educational institutions reopenings in the fall. \u2047 This[Indecipherable] we expected, though the unusual rapid staffing ramp combined with the state of the labor markets resulted in higher labor costs, dampening segment margins in the quarter. \u2047 With this staffing increase now behind us, we believe Education segment profitability will return to more normalized levels starting in the first quarter. \u2047 Five years ago, we announced 2020 vision, a long-range strategic plan to drive profitable growth and shareholder value. \u2047 Today, we are building on the success of that initiative with Elevate, a multi-year comprehensive investment initiatives that will enhance our strategic and competitive positioning, leverage the advantages of leading-edge technologies, inclusive of data and analytics and enable us to capture incremental growth and profit opportunities arising from macro shifts in demographics, rapidly changing workplace dynamics and the heightened need for increased corporate sustainability. \u2047 Elevate will include strategic investments in revenue growth initiatives, team member development, workforce management and digital transformation. \u2047 These investments will accelerate our organic growth, strengthen profitability and create a more rewarding experience for both clients and team members. \u2047 The total Elevate investment is estimated to be $150 million to $175 million and the initiatives is expected to be largely completed by the end of fiscal 2025. \u2047 In fiscal '22, we expect to invest approximately $80 million in Elevate, enabling us to significantly advance the implementation of our digital transformation. \u2047 With these foundational elements in place, by the end of fiscal 2022, we anticipate lower levels of Elevate investments in subsequent years. \u2047 We are excited about the opportunities that Elevate will provide and we'll share more detail with you on this whole initiatives in a few minutes on the Investor Day portion of the program. \u2047 We are entering fiscal 2022 from a position of strength, supported by a healthy balance sheet, solid cash flow and favorable growth trends across our businesses. \u2047 We continue to support our clients by providing high value services and solutions that have enabled them to navigate unprecedented challenges over the past couple of years and with the recent acquisition of Able, we significantly expanded our capabilities to comprehensively address our clients' evolving needs across the spectrum of facilities management and engineering solutions. \u2047 Now I'd like to comment briefly on our guidance. \u2047 For fiscal 2022, we forecast GAAP earnings per diluted share of $2.05 to $2.30 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.30 to $3.55. \u2047 Within this guidance, we assume an easing of COVID related disinfection services and work orders, leading us to project fiscal '22 adjusted EBITDA margins of 6.2% to 6.6%, inclusive of synergies from Able Services acquisition. \u2047 While earnings per share and margins are projected to decline from fiscal 2021, they are significantly above pre-pandemic levels and above our targeted long-term metrics we outlined in 2019 when we signaled an aspirational margin range of 5.5% to 6%. \u2047 We'll provide more detail on our outlook and fiscal 2022 guidance later during our virtual Investor Day portion of the program. \u2047 I'll now turn over the call to Earl for a discussion of our financials. \u2047 Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.2% to $1.7 billion, primarily driven by one month of contribution from the acquisition Able Services, continued client demand for disinfection services and a generally improving economic environment. \u2047 GAAP income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter was $34.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $53.1 million or $0.78 per diluted share in the same period last year. \u2047 The decrease in GAAP income reflects higher operating and corporate expenses, which included acquisition related costs of $19.7 million, initial investments in our Elevate initiative and a lower benefit from self-insurance adjustments related to prior years. \u2047 On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter income from continuing operations grew 25% to $58.2 million or $0.85 per diluted share compared to $46.7 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 The increase in adjusted earnings per share reflects revenue growth and a benefit from the absence of a reserve for notes receivable related to a single project within the company's Technical Solutions segment recorded last year, partially offset by reduced labor efficiencies and disinfection work. \u2047 Corporate expenses were $40.9 million higher compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to acquisition-related expenses, a lower benefit from prior year self-insurance adjustments and costs related to hiring initiatives. \u2047 Corporate expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were also impacted by $10.3 million of initial investments in the Elevate transformation initiative that Scott mentioned, and that we will discuss more fully later on. \u2047 Now turning to our segment results in the fourth quarter. \u2047 B&I revenue increased 17.5% year-over-year to $933 million, driven primarily by a one-month contribution from Able Services, increased office occupancy and the expansion of key accounts. \u2047 Excluding the contribution from Able, B&I revenue increased 4.7% from the prior period. \u2047 Operating profit in B&I declined 3% to $82.1 million from the same period last year, reflecting an easing in higher margin work orders. \u2047 Aviation revenue increased 43% to $201.7 million, marking the second consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year revenue growth. \u2047 This improvement was driven largely by increased airline passenger volume and the expansion of our airport parking operations. \u2047 Aviation operating profit increased to $13.2 million, compared to $3.5 million in last year's fourth quarter, driven by the significant rebound in revenue as well as our efforts to emphasize higher margin airport facility services. \u2047 Revenue within our Technology & Manufacturing segment was essentially flat year-over-year at $245.5 million, as new business starts were offset by reduced client demand for COVID related work orders and EnhancedClean. \u2047 However, operating margins for T&M improved to 10% in the fourth quarter, up 40 basis points from last year's fourth quarter benefiting from efficient labor management and contract expansions. \u2047 Education revenue declined 3.7% to $204.4 million, largely reflecting the timing of contract rebids. \u2047 While client retention rates remain consistent on a year-over-year basis, certain contract rebids were not completed in the fourth quarter, impacting segment revenue. \u2047 Operating profit totaled $7.7 million, down from $15.1 million in last year's fourth quarter. \u2047 The decline in segment operating profit was in part due to normal seasonality. \u2047 However, the magnitude of the decline this year was amplified by the widespread reopening of educational institutions that necessitated a near instantaneous ramp-up of staff, as Scott has discussed. \u2047 Moving forward, we anticipate Education segment profit margins will be approximately 6% in fiscal 2022, representing an increase of more than 100 basis points compared to pre-COVID levels, resulting from a sustained uplift in labor efficiency and higher disinfection revenue. \u2047 Revenue within our Technical Solutions segment grew 21% to [Technical Issues] million, aided by continued strong growth in our emerging electric vehicle charging infrastructure business, improved access to client sites and strengthened client demand for energy efficient solutions. \u2047 Segment operating income returned to profitability and generated an operating profit margin of 12.8%. \u2047 We ended the fourth quarter with $62.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $394.2 million with total debt of $1.06 billion as of October 31, 2021. \u2047 Our total debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA, including standby letters of credit was 1.9 times at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. \u2047 As for our dividends, I am pleased to report the Board approved a 2.6% increase in our quarterly dividend to $19.5 to be paid out in February. \u2047 Now, I'll briefly discuss our outlook. \u2047 As Scott mentioned, our guidance for full year fiscal 2022 adjusted income from continuing operations is a range of $3.30 to $3.55 per diluted share. \u2047 Our adjusted earnings forecast reflects a favorable growth outlook across our business segments in fiscal 2022, as well as an expected easing in COVID-19 related disinfection work and a reduction in labor efficiencies from anticipated rising office occupancy rates. \u2047 Please note that our adjusted earnings guidance excludes approximately $72 million in Elevate related expenses that are planned in fiscal 2022. \u2047 These are general and administrative expenses for delivering and implementing technology and process solutions related to our digital transformation. \u2047 We plan to exclude these expenses from adjusted earnings to provide for more accurate comparisons regarding operating performance. \u2047 We expect that fiscal 2022 tax rate to be approximately 30% excluding any discrete items. \u2047 Fiscal 2022 will have one additional workday compared to fiscal 2021. \u2047 As a reminder, each workday represents approximately $7 million of labor expense. \u2047 In terms of the timing of quarterly workdays throughout the year, we will have one additional work day in both the first and fourth quarters versus the comparable periods in fiscal 2021 and one less workday in the second quarter. \u2047 Capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately $54 million, including $8 million related to Elevate investments. \u2047 We forecast depreciation to be approximately $50 million for the year. \u2047 I'm super excited to kick off the Investor Day portion of our program, especially in light of the incredible results we shared earlier. \u2047 Joining me are the members of our executive leadership team, who you'll be hearing from later today. \u2047 This team brings an incredible mix of industry experience and diverse backgrounds. \u2047 We'll share our strategic plan that will unlock significant long-term value for our shareholders and strengthen our industry-leading position through end market repositioning and building on our core services. \u2047 Our new strategic plan will transform ABM from a position of strength, using what we learned from 2020 vision and our COVID response to launch our organization into the next phase of our journey. \u2047 We're going to leverage the market trends that will impact our business over the next five years. \u2047 This will not only sharpen our focus, but also inform the investments we'll be making and we're going to optimize our portfolio of services and markets and geographies to better position our businesses to thrive as society evolves and moves forward, and we will innovate in the areas of technology and data to modernize service delivery. \u2047 This will improve the productivity of our frontline workforce and create digital connections with our clients and our teammates and will drive profitable growth, will accelerate organic revenue growth rates by close to 50% with sustainable adjusted EBITDA margins almost double where we started in 2015, while building on our significant cash flow. \u2047 Over the course of the next hour, we'll dive into each one of these elements. \u2047 But before we jump into our strategic plan and tell you how we're going to elevate A"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted
