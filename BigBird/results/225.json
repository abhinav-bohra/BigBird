{"article": ["We begin with our Safe Harbor statement. \u2047 You should listen to today's call in the context of that information. \u2047 Today, we will discuss our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. \u2047 For the second quarter, the difference between our GAAP results and adjusted results consist of the following item: amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and purchase accounting adjustments to commission expense. \u2047 As usual we'll leave plenty of time to talk to all your question toward the end. \u2047 As we turn to Page five, we deliver an excellent second quarter with strength across all four of our segments. \u2047 Specific to the financial metrics, which Rob will detail shortly, revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow, all grew north of 20% in the quarter. \u2047 Also during the quarter, we are encouraged to see the post-pandemic recovery gain momentum and broaden at the same time. \u2047 Specifically, not only that we experienced continued improvement across virtually all of our businesses, the strength within each business was broad. \u2047 Our software businesses, which now make up over 55% of our revenue base performed very well in the quarter. \u2047 Specifically, on an organic basis, we grew our Application Software segment 9% and grew our software businesses within our NSS segment 10%. \u2047 Across our software businesses, we saw the acceleration of our recurring revenue growth, approximately 80% of our soft revenues from mid-singles to high-singles and a solid recovery of perpetual license activity. \u2047 Relative to our product businesses, a very similar pattern acceleration and recovery of our consumables revenue sources and very nice ordering patterns for our capital equipment type products. \u2047 In addition, our 2020 acquisition cohort led by Vertafore is performing very well. \u2047 Importantly, and consistent with our guidance over the last three quarters, we continue to delever our balance sheet at a rapid pace now under 4 times debt to EBITDA. \u2047 And finally before handing things over to Rob, just a great first half to the year. \u2047 Our teams have performed magnificently. \u2047 Given the great start in the positive momentum across our enterprise, we are once again increasing our full-year guidance. \u2047 Rob, let me hand it over to you. \u2047 And congrats again on the lightening winning[Indecipherable] go. \u2047 Turning to Page six, looking at some of the key financial highlights for Q2. \u2047 Total revenue increased 22% to $1.59 billion another record for any Roper quarter. \u2047 Q2 organic revenue growth was 7% versus last year's comp of minus 3. \u2047 All four segments performed well, with strong organic growth across our portfolio of software and product businesses. \u2047 Q2 EBITDA grew 26% to $579 million and EBITDA margin increased to 110 basis points to 36.4%. \u2047 Adjusted DEPS was $3.76, 28% above prior year and also above our Q2 guidance range of $3.61 to $3.65. \u2047 Free cash flow was $409 million, up a very strong 30% versus last year. \u2047 As a reminder, last year we adjusted our Q2 cash flow to account for the income tax payments that were deferred from Q2 to Q3, due to 2020 delayed tax deadlines. \u2047 Net working capital was negative 8%, we continue to benefit from Roper's transformation to a high recurring revenue, majority software business model that is structurally designed to consistently drive high cash conversion. \u2047 Lastly, we have been laser-focused on debt reduction this year after last year's record capital deployment and we continue to make great progress on that front with an additional $375 million paid down in Q2. \u2047 So in summary, an excellent second quarter wrapping up a very strong first half for Roper. \u2047 Turning to Page seven, an update to the charge we introduced last quarter, showing our rapid deleveraging. \u2047 Through the first half of 2021, we have now reduced our net debt by nearly $900 million, raising the total debt reduction to approximately $1.4 billion, since completing the 2020 acquisitions late last year. \u2047 Our debt reduction along with the meaningful contributions from our 2020 acquisitions has enabled us to rapidly lower our net debt to EBITDA ratio from 4.7 times to 3.8 times in only six months. \u2047 We expect this downward trend in leverage ratios to continue moving forward, which positions us well for a return to meaningful capital deployment in the coming quarters. \u2047 Let's turn to Page nine and walk through our Application Software segment. \u2047 Revenues in this segment were $592 million, up 9% on an organic basis. \u2047 As a reminder, this segment grew 1% organically last year aided by strong results from our lab software franchises that were critical to the COVID response. \u2047 EBITDA margins were 43.7% in the quarter. \u2047 Across the segment, we saw organic recurring revenue, which is a touch north of 75% of the revenue for the segment increased approximately 9%. \u2047 This recurring revenue strength is based on strong customer retention, continued migration to our SaaS delivery models, new products cross-selling activity and new customer adds. \u2047 To that end, the non-recurring organic revenue in this segment grew 9% as well. \u2047 Specific to business unit performance Deltek, our enterprise software business that serves the US federal contractor, architect, engineering and other services end-market had an excellent quarter. \u2047 Their strength was rooted in large scale GovCon customer wins and expansion activity. \u2047 Deltek was further benefited by the recovery in the professional services end markets, terrific job by Mike and the entire team at Deltek. \u2047 Aderant our legal software business continues its momentum and market share gains. \u2047 In addition and encouragingly, their customers are beginning the journey of migrating to Aderant's cloud solutions. \u2047 This will take many years for the entire customer base to migrate, but will result in increased customer intimacy and higher levels of recurring revenue. \u2047 CliniSys and data Innovations continue their long string of market share gains in the quarter and CBORD grew based on strength in healthcare and in particular their higher education product offerings. \u2047 Finally, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well both at Vertafore and EPSi. \u2047 As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect high single-digit organic growth for this segment based on strength in both our recurring and non-recurring revenue streams, a solid quarter here for sure. \u2047 And with that let's turn to our next slide. \u2047 Turning to Page 10. \u2047 Revenues in our network segment were $459 million, up 5% on an organic basis, and EBITDA margins were 42.5% in the quarter. \u2047 Our software businesses in this segment about 65% of the revenues were, up 10% on an organic basis. \u2047 This growth was broad-based among our software businesses and driven by organic recurring revenue growth of approximately 11%. \u2047 At the business level, our Freight Match businesses, both in the US and Canada, continue to be solid growers. \u2047 As a reminder, our Freight Match networks are critical and necessary elements to help organize interact and transact the trucking, shipping spot markets. \u2047 Strength in our businesses has been on both sides of the network; brokers and carriers, but with particular strength in this quarter on the carrier side of the network. \u2047 We also continue to see nice organic gains at ConstructConnect as their network enables commercial construction planning and bidding to occur in a more efficient and transparent manner. \u2047 Foundry, our media and entertainment software business, which enables the combination of live action and computer generated graphics to be combined into a single frame, recovered nicely in the quarter with particular strength in the mid-market. \u2047 Importantly, we continue to see very strong customer retention levels across each and every one of our network software businesses. \u2047 The strong growth in our software businesses was partially offset by project delays and our Transcore New York congestion pricing project. \u2047 These delays are based on pending federal environmental approvals, while we all believe the federal approval will be granted, the approval process to complete our work is taking longer than originally anticipated. \u2047 Conversely TransCore tag demand appears to be normalizing for the balance of the year. \u2047 As we look to our second half outlook, we expect to see high single-digit growth in this segment. \u2047 The growth will be underpinned by strength in our network software businesses, which we expect to grow in the low double-digit range in the second half of the year. \u2047 Based on the New York TransCore project pushing to the right, we now expect about $40 million of this projects revenue to push-out of the second half of the year and into 2022. \u2047 All in all, high single-digit organic increases in this segment for the balance of the year. \u2047 Please turn to the next slide. \u2047 As we turn to Page 11, revenues and our MAS segment were $397 million, up 7% on organic basis. \u2047 Organic growth in this segment excluding Verathon was north of 20%. \u2047 EBITDA margins for the segment were 33.4% in the quarter. \u2047 Verathon coming off unprecedented demand for their intubation family of products a year ago is roughly 40% larger today versus 2019. \u2047 The momentum within this business continues given the larger installed base of intubation capital equipment, which enables recurring consumable pull through volumes. \u2047 In addition Verathon continues to experience impressive growth within their Bronchoscope product family and the recovery in their bladder scan ultrasound product group. \u2047 EBITDA margins in the segment were lower due to Verathon's extraordinary prior-year quarter and the associated margin benefit. \u2047 Our other medical product businesses accelerated nicely in the quarter based on hospitals and hospital equipment OEMs resuming normal levels of activity. \u2047 Demand at Neptune was very strong as well. \u2047 The Northeast opened up and the balance of the country experienced normalizing levels of activity. \u2047 Our industrial businesses were strong. \u2047 As I mentioned in the opening the strength was buoyed by improving consumables activity and solid returns to capital equipment spending. \u2047 Our businesses within this segment have done a nice job navigating the difficult supply environment. \u2047 And supply environment like the one we are in right now are decentralized, highly nimble organization tends to perform quite well. \u2047 This quarter was no exception. \u2047 For the balance of the year, we expect double-digit growth for this segment. \u2047 This is based on broadly improving conditions both in medical and industrial markets and easing prior year comps for Verathon. \u2047 Now let's turn to our final segment Process Tech. \u2047 As we turn to Page 12, revenues in our Process Tech segment were $140 million, up 13% on an organic basis. \u2047 EBITDA margins improved by over 500 basis points to 32.8% in the quarter. \u2047 The short story here is we're seeing improving end market conditions across virtually every one of our businesses in this segment after over nearly two years of declines. \u2047 Our upstream oil and gas business is starting to recover nicely. \u2047 Cornell continues to perform well for us. \u2047 This is partially based on market conditions, but also based on Cornell's product innovation as they are seeing very nice demand pickup for their IoT connected pumping solutions. \u2047 And finally at CCC, we're seeing the resumption of previously deferred projects and the demand for field services to come back online. \u2047 Also greenfield bidding activity is back in full swing, especially on an international basis. \u2047 As we turn to the outlook for the balance of the year, we expect 20%-plus organic growth based on improving market conditions and continued easing comps. \u2047 Now please turn to Page 14 and I'll highlight our increased guidance for 2021. \u2047 Based on strong first half performance improvement to our recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions, we are raising our full-year adjusted DEPS to be in the range of $15 and $15.20 per share. \u2047 Of note, our prior high-end DEPS guidance was 15% now the bottom end of our range. \u2047 Also, we are increasing our guidance notwithstanding pushing roughly $40 million of the TransCore New York City project into next year, providing everyone a good sense of how strong the balance of our portfolio is performing. \u2047 Our full-year organic growth is expected to be 7% or a touch higher. \u2047 This full-year growth outlook implies low double-digit organic growth in the second half. \u2047 Our tax rate should continue to be in the 21% to 22% range. \u2047 For the third quarter, we're establishing adjusted DEPS guidance to be between $3.80 and $3.84. \u2047 Turning to Page 15, and our closing summary. \u2047 This is a very strong quarter for enterprise with softer revenues growing on an organic basis 9% in our Application Software segment and 10% for our software businesses and our NSF segment. \u2047 In addition, the recovery pattern is characterized as gaining momentum and being broad, strength in product and software, strength in recurring and non-recurring. \u2047 We performed very well virtually in every financial metric, growing 20% plus in revenue, EBITDA, DEPS and cash flow. \u2047 EBITDA margins expanded by 110 basis points and free cash flow increased 30%, to $409 million in the quarter. \u2047 As promised, we continue to delever our balance sheet, reducing debt by $375 million in the quarter and by $1.4 billion, since completing our 2020 acquisitions in Q4 of last year. \u2047 As we look forward, positive momentum continues to build. \u2047 Over the last decade, we have worked to improve the quality of our portfolio to be more software base resulting in enterprise having higher levels of recurring revenue and be increasingly asset light. \u2047 In addition to having this improved quality within our business portfolio, we're seeing our recurring revenue growth rates improve from mid-singles to high-singles. \u2047 Finally, our businesses will benefit from improving end market conditions. \u2047 Given each of these improved portfolio quality, improving recurring revenue growth rates and improving market conditions we expect to see double-digit organic growth in the second half of the year. \u2047 Also, our 2020 cohort of acquisitions continue to perform very well and solidly contribute to and improve the quality of our enterprise. \u2047 Given all of these factors, we are increasing our outlook for the full-year. \u2047 Finally while we continue to focus on deleveraging our balance sheet, we also remain committed to our long-term capital deployment strategy. \u2047 To this end, our pipeline of M&A candidates is active, robust and has many high-quality opportunities. \u2047 As our balance sheet becomes more offensive toward the end of the year, our active pipeline of M&A targets will enable us to resume capital deployment and our usual process oriented and disciplined manner. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["sees fy adjusted earnings per share $15.00 to $15.20.  \u2047  sees q3 adjusted earnings per share $3.80 to $3.84.  \u2047
