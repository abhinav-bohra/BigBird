{"article": ["Neil, you may begin. \u2047 We understand it's a busy last few days of the earnings season, and everyone is quite familiar with the environment, so we will jump right in. \u2047 During the first weeks of this pandemic, we took decisive action and focused on capital pricing through several critical steps. \u2047 We suspended dividend distributions on both our common and preferred securities, preserving approximately $72.5 million, and we deferred all planned capital expenditures for the balance of the year, saving approximately $20 million. \u2047 Additionally, at the corporate level, we reduced our SG&A run rate by 25% for 2020. \u2047 While at our properties, we suspended operations at 21 of our 48 hotels, which led to a reduction in operating expenses, approximating 80% on a go-forward basis. \u2047 These were difficult but necessary moves, and we undertook these actions to ensure we had sufficient flexibility through this pandemic. \u2047 Early in the quarter, we amended our credit facility to access our senior revolving credit facility and received a full financial covenant holiday for five quarters with the next covenant test on June 30, 2021. \u2047 We've had a decade-long relationship with the lead banks in our bank group, and we appreciate their partnership during this unique time. \u2047 We have spent most of the most of the second quarter reopening hotels. \u2047 Each of them adapted to a highly efficient operating model, provided anticipatory service from behind plexiglass and engaged a completely new guest profile. \u2047 And they did so safely, graciously and effectively. \u2047 The lion's share of the 27 hotels that were opened in April and May consisted of our limited service drive-to resort offerings that were able to drive rate and occupancy, exceeding our internal forecasts. \u2047 Early April is when we saw the trough for our open portfolio, bottoming out around 19% occupancy but incrementally growing through the balance of the quarter, ending June at 39% occupancy. \u2047 Most of the 27 hotels that have remained open throughout the pandemic and the seven hotels that have opened since June one are able to run with a marginally sized staff, allowing for lower breakeven levels and the ability to generate gross operating profit with occupancies around 25% to 30% or a 60% to 70% RevPAR decline for EBITDA level breakeven at properties. \u2047 Our focused service portfolio, whether branded or independent, offer significantly more flexibility as it relates to staffing levels and job sharing opportunities, minimizing costs and ultimately allowing us to either profitably maintain operations or reopen assets more expeditiously. \u2047 As we've discussed on past calls, our franchise model and close alignment with HHM and our operating teams also allows us to adapt our staffing and operating models in real time. \u2047 This close relationship, coupled with our cluster strategy to maximize revenues and generate marketing advantage and economies of scale for cost efficiencies and sales, has yielded consistent market share outperformance versus our comp set prior to the pandemic. \u2047 This relationship has proven to be critically beneficial over the past five months in determining which hotels to open, consolidating demand to optimize breakeven and driving local decisions. \u2047 This will continue to drive outperformance throughout the recovery phase. \u2047 We expect to have substantially all of our hotels operating by the end of September. \u2047 And now more than ever, our ability to stay nimble and leverage our flexible operating model in close connection with our independent franchise operator, allows us to reopen and operate our hotels in a cost-efficient manner, gives us the opportunity to reduce our cash burn rates and breakeven levels meaningfully and sets up our portfolio to generate cash flow as we navigate this recovery. \u2047 Drive-to resorts have been our strongest performers. \u2047 Local regulations and travel bans dictated our opening of these hotels. \u2047 But with each month of performance, we are seeing meaningful growth in occupancy and strong rate integrity. \u2047 We expect a longer leisure season this year with disrupted schools, work-from-home employees, low gas prices and continued stimulus. \u2047 Our Sanctuary Beach resort was the best-performing asset during the second quarter, ending the period at 71% occupancy with a $340 ADR, and success continued in July with RevPAR growth of 12.4% for the month. \u2047 The ramp began in mid-April and extended throughout the quarter as travelers became more comfortable leaving their homes and socially distancing on the California coast. \u2047 We opened Hotel Milo in Santa Barbara more recently, but it is ramping up quickly, particularly around the weekends, where ADR is close to prior years. \u2047 On the East Coast, the Annapolis Waterfront hotel on the Chesapeake and the Mystic Marriott, which opened in mid-June, are delivering operating profits this summer. \u2047 South Florida has been more choppy. \u2047 Government-mandated closures impacted our portfolio as Key West was closed to visitors and nonessential personnel, and Miami Beach hotels were mandated to close to prohibit the spread of the virus. \u2047 Restrictions at both municipalities were lifted on June 1, and this led us to reopening our Parrot Key hotel in Key West and two of our Miami Beach hotels, the Winter Haven and the Cadillac. \u2047 Early results in both locations were promising, but notably at the Parrot Key, which saw travelers arrive from the Southeast and even from the Northeast and Midwest. \u2047 But the recent rise in case counts across the Sunbelt led to the closure of Miami Beach and restrictions at bars and restaurants in Key West over the July four weekend, which hampered the rapid ramp-up we were seeing in these markets. \u2047 We believe occupancies at these hotels will reaccelerate in conjunction with decreasing case counts and easing restrictions across the southern states, but the third quarter may still be challenged with weather or headlines in Miami Beach. \u2047 But judging from the number of New Yorkers still coming to Miami in even these conditions, we expect a seasonally high fourth and first quarters to be robust once again in Miami Beach. \u2047 Our urban gateway markets have been hard at work. \u2047 The headlines surrounding corporate travel, international travel and events remain bleak. \u2047 But fortunately, the domestic travel restrictions and quarantines instituted by major coastal cities should ease in the coming weeks and months on a city-by-city basis and should open us up for more leisure travel. \u2047 Our operating model alignment with the teams at each of our hotels provides the speed of decision-making on innovative ways to drive operating profits from each of our locations. \u2047 We've been able to open hotels as we source new business in each of our clusters, and our limited service business model allows us to staff very efficiently during this low demand period. \u2047 Our sales and marketing teams have stayed nimble throughout the pandemic, remaining cognizant of travelers' increased selectivity as it pertains to authentic and relevant experiences, but also proactively staying connected with local demand generators. \u2047 This approach was very productive during the second quarter as our team secured contracts with local hospitals and frontline personnel across our portfolio, with perhaps the biggest success in New York City. \u2047 We housed government groups and medical staff at our JFK assets, police and fire department crews in Brooklyn and at our Hilton Garden Inns in Tribeca and Midtown East, and lastly, contracted with a leading medical institution in lower Manhattan at our Hampton Inn in the Seaport. \u2047 All of this led to 61% occupancy for our seven open New York City hotels during the second quarter. \u2047 Our sales team has since pivoted from first responder business to more normal business. \u2047 Despite the bleak headlines on corporate travel among the largest companies, some parts of the economy are beginning to travel. \u2047 Our sales in our local property teams directly have had success sourcing new business to our hotels. \u2047 In Philadelphia, the team secured Major League Baseball and the NFL to build a base for transient compression; in New York, baseball and hockey teams for shorter stays. \u2047 In each of our markets, we have sourced significant design and construction business. \u2047 There are a lot of buildings to prepare for a post-COVID build-out or projects under development. \u2047 In Boston, we contracted a buyout for the Boxer to a local university to house their students from September through May. \u2047 For universities and even a hybrid model, travel demand will increase relative to the spring or summer. \u2047 We have secured business with TV broadcasters and news organizations in Washington, D.C. Content production and studios are beginning to mobilize in Southern California near our Courtyard West side, and Netflix and other producers are producing on the East Coast cities as well. \u2047 All of our submarkets are seeing a more general purpose healthcare business, patients and family for elective surgeries, but also medical equipment and other technology vendors. \u2047 Consulting and financial services has been slower to get on the road, but we hear of the first banks beginning to travel or consider buyouts for meetings or allocating inventory hotel inventory for employees to avoid commutes or simply arranging daywork rooms. \u2047 Early results from July are promising, with ADR only down 25% across the portfolio year-over-year as occupancy showed some signs of growth, especially in our urban markets outside of New York. \u2047 A few more thoughts on New York. \u2047 Prior to COVID-19, New York was one of the toughest markets in the U.S. to achieve rate growth despite record visitation year-over-year as the city was seeing new supply increasing approximately 4% each year over the last several years. \u2047 We have already seen the headlines of big-box hotels in New York closing their doors forever as many as 5,000 rooms among them so far, and we think of this as the tip of the iceberg in terms of hotel closures. \u2047 Industry researchers have estimated that 20% of New York's total room count, about 25,000 keys, could permanently close. \u2047 New York City is dominating the headlines as it pertains to hotel closures, but there are corners of every market filled with distressed assets that were troubled to produce margin even before the pandemic. \u2047 They are now obsolete and will improve the supply picture. \u2047 The pandemic is also bringing about a decline in short-term rental demand as seen in recent data showing the top 25 markets experiencing significant year-over-year decline in inventory available. \u2047 Five of the top MSAs, including Boston, New York and Los Angeles, are seeing year-over-year declines from 25% to 40%. \u2047 Travelers are choosing the proven cleanliness of hotels versus the unknown of short-term rentals, and cities and landlords are finally enforcing current regulations and forcing transparency. \u2047 The pandemic will fundamentally change the models of these platforms as we've already seen in Airbnb strategy's shift to longer duration stays versus short-term offerings, and these changes will be materially positive for hotel portfolios with urban gateway market exposure like Hersha's. \u2047 Hersha has been a developer, owner and operator in New York for over 20 years. \u2047 Post 9/11, we increased our development pipeline in Manhattan. \u2047 Post GFC, we acquired troubled developers hotels under construction. \u2047 This time, we have sufficient exposure to Manhattan, but expect to enjoy a strong recovery in New York in the next 12 to 24 months. \u2047 After 9/11 and after the GFC, New York rebounded with the highest growth rates in the country for the early years of the recovery. \u2047 After 9/11, there were significant deletions from supply. \u2047 So after a steep recovery in 2003 and 2004, the market continued to produce double-digit RevPAR for three more years. \u2047 Post 2009, New York rebounded quickly in 2010 and continue to grow in mid-single digits for three to four more years, but new supply made the rest of the cycle a bit more choppy, although values continue to reach new highs. \u2047 This time, as demand returns, the supply story will be very different. \u2047 More permanent hotel closures, no construction financing, zoning restrictions for hotel development,etc. \u2047 And we expect our category killing select service portfolio in New York can meaningfully outperform. \u2047 Before transitioning to Ash to discuss our expense savings and burn rate reductions, I want to update you on our pending asset sales. \u2047 As a quick reminder, we announced accretive binding sales agreements on four assets in our portfolio: the Duane Street Hotel in New York City; the Blue Moon hotel on Miami Beach; and the exit of the 50% ownership in two South Boston Hotel, two hotels: The Courtyard South Boston, the Holiday and Express South Boston. \u2047 Since our last earnings call, we've had follow-up discussions with each of the buyers who have asked for additional time to close on the individual transactions. \u2047 In conjunction with these requests, we negotiated the right to sweep the deposits on each of the consolidated asset dispositions and a buy sell right for our JV. \u2047 Along with the extensions, we have provided a reduction in purchase price for the buyers at each of these assets, resulting in total expected net proceeds of $70 million. \u2047 We remain cautiously optimistic that these transactions will close as the buyers are not reliant on material financing, but we now anticipate these agreements will close in the fourth quarter or in early 2021. \u2047 In addition to these four asset sales, we have multiple levers to pull should the impact to the travel industry remain at depressed levels into the second half of next year, and we continue to explore various strategies to fortify our balance sheet. \u2047 Some investors have asked if we would raise additional common equity. \u2047 It's hard to see a scenario where that level of dilution would make sense. \u2047 We are more likely to sell additional hotels as a private debt market emerges in 2021. \u2047 We are encouraged by a thawing, at least in the transaction markets that should gain momentum in the coming three to four months. \u2047 Our hotels are differentiated in the acquisitions market. \u2047 Nearly all of our hotels are unencumbered of ground leases, management and often brand. \u2047 They are newly built or recently repositioned with very little capex required for the foreseeable future. \u2047 They are high-quality and well-located in prominent innovation-oriented submarkets in the leading gateway markets of the U.S. Difficult times like these demonstrate the hustle and the accountability of our team. \u2047 We have visited most of our hotels across the last few months and are grateful for the quality and character of our team at our hotels and our offices. \u2047 It's a tighter group today, but it reminds us that small groups of committed people can do great things. \u2047 For Jay, Ash and I, this is our 21st year in the public markets. \u2047 We have navigated three cycles and nearly a dozen major demand troughs together. \u2047 Past demand troughs have proven that cities and economies rebound and America grows. \u2047 Domestic and international travelers get comfortable getting back on planes, trains and automobiles to visit the cities that make up this great nation. \u2047 The last several weeks have showed that the recovery for lodging is unlikely to be linear, and near-term forecast indicated it's difficult to pinpoint how business travel will resume after Labor Day. \u2047 But the steps we have taken to date and"], "gold_summary": ["suspended its full-year 2020 guidance."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share $0.23.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.23.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.23."]}
