{"article": ["The fourth quarter of 2021 was a fitting year -- a fitting way to end the year where Oxy's operational and financial performance advanced from strong to stronger. \u2047 Our focus on consistently delivering outstanding operational results, combined with our steadfast dedication and patience in improving our balance sheet, has positioned us to begin increasing the amount of capital returned to shareholders. \u2047 Our new shareholder return framework, which we will detail today, includes a dividend that is sustainable in a low price environment. \u2047 We are pleased to implement this new framework, beginning with an increase in the quarterly common dividend to $0.13 per share. \u2047 The position of strength that we are in today stems from our team's hard work and accomplishments last year. \u2047 Throughout 2021, we strived tirelessly to improve our already exceptional operational performance. \u2047 We capitalized on efficiency improvements by embedding innovative techniques across our operations. \u2047 Our focus on learning, implementing change, where needed, and maximizing opportunities for improvement enabled us to accelerate time to market for our products while generating notable capital saving. \u2047 We will continue to maximize operational efficiencies in 2022 by executing on the capital plan that invest in our highest-return assets to generate long-term sustainable free cash flow. \u2047 Rob and I will then discuss our shareholder return framework, and Rob will provide guidance for the first quarter and year ahead. \u2047 Before turning to Q&A at the end, I will provide a preview of the Low Carbon Ventures investor update that we have planned for next month. \u2047 Now to talk about delivering cash flow priorities. \u2047 Those who have followed us at Oxy's journey over the past several quarters know that our cash flow priorities have centered around derisking our balance sheet and reducing debt. \u2047 We diligently delivered on these cash flow priorities throughout 2021, including the repayment of approximately $6.7 billion of debt. \u2047 We now expect that our net debt will be below $25 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2022, which will mark a change in how excess cash flow will be allocated going forward. \u2047 Before I detail our updated cash flow priorities and shareholder return framework, I would like to first touch on a few of the many operational and financial successes that enabled us to reach this significant turning point. \u2047 2021 was a year of continuous operational improvements, which drove record free cash flow generation, rapid debt reduction and a return to profitability. \u2047 One of Oxy's core strengths is our ability to develop assets in a way that efficiently maximizes production and recovery while generating significant cash flow, and that is just what we did in 2021. \u2047 Multiple drilling and completion records were set across our domestic and international businesses as our production for the year averaged 1.167 million BOE per day. \u2047 That's 27,000 BOE per day higher than our initial guidance. \u2047 2021 was also a more conventional year in terms of commodity prices, operations and planning, all of which was helpful in providing a reserve update that reflects a more normalized price environment. \u2047 Our reserves for year-end 2021 increased to 3.5 billion BOE, representing a reserve replacement ratio of 241%. \u2047 Our reserves position means that we have a vast supply of low-breakeven projects and inventory available. \u2047 Over the last year, we significantly advanced our commitments toward a low-carbon future. \u2047 We are proud to be one of only a few oil and gas companies with net-zero goals that are aligned with the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree Celsius pathway. \u2047 In December, Oxy became the first U.S. upstream oil and gas company to enter into a sustainability-linked revolving credit facility, which includes absolute reductions in our combined Scopes 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent emissions as the key performance indicator. \u2047 We set additional interim emission targets to further refine our net-zero pathway, including a short-term target to reduce our CO2 equivalent emissions to approximately 3.7 million metric tons per year below our 2021 level and to accomplish that by 2024. \u2047 We set a medium-term target to facilitate the geologic storage or use of 25 million metric tons per year of CO2 in Oxy's value chain by 2032. \u2047 We also endorsed the Methane Guiding Principles and Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0, a climate and clean air coalition initiative led by the United Nations Environment program. \u2047 This is consistent with our commitment to enhance methane emissions reporting and reducing those emissions. \u2047 Our journey toward net zero is underway, and we look forward to discussing in greater detail at our Low Carbon Ventures investor day next month. \u2047 Now the fourth quarter highlights. \u2047 The strong operational and financial performance that we delivered throughout last year continued in the fourth quarter. \u2047 We set a fourth consecutive record for quarterly free cash flow generation before working capital, which contributed to generating our highest-ever annual level of free cash flow in 2021. \u2047 We continue to apply free cash flow toward reducing debt and strengthening our balance sheet, repaying an additional $2.2 billion of debt in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Operationally, all three business segments excelled in driving our robust financial performance. \u2047 OxyChem delivered record earnings for the second consecutive quarter as performance throughout the year culminated in 2021 being OxyChem's strongest in over 30 years. \u2047 The fourth quarter, which is typically lower due to seasonality, even exceeded the record third quarter. \u2047 And in our oil and gas segment, our Permian, Rockies and Oman teams set new operational records and efficiency benchmarks in the fourth quarter, further improving on their third quarter record. \u2047 Our midstream business outperformed by maximizing gas margins during the fourth quarter. \u2047 While short-term opportunities in the commodity markets are difficult to predict, our midstream team exceed at finding and taking full advantage of such opportunities when they arise. \u2047 Now I'm pleased to say that our fourth quarter results continued to demonstrate the commitment of all of our employees, no matter their position or location, to find ways to further create value by lowering costs, improving efficiencies and maximizing recoveries. \u2047 They truly are driving our strong financial results and providing a solid foundation for free cash flow generation. \u2047 Now on to 2021 oil and gas operational excellence. \u2047 On each of our last several calls, I've enjoyed highlighting the many operational achievements our teams continuously deliver. \u2047 The magnitude of these achievements is striking when viewed on a combined basis over the last year. \u2047 We established record drilling cycle times in the Gulf of Mexico, the Permian, Rockies and in Oman, and set new efficiency benchmarks across our portfolio in 2021. \u2047 We intend to maintain our focus on continuous improvement in the year ahead as we work to maximize the value our portfolio can generate for shareholders. \u2047 Now our 2022 capital plan. \u2047 Our 2022 capital plan invests in cash flow longevity while building on the capital intensity leadership we demonstrated in 2021. \u2047 We have sized our capital plan to sustain production in 2022 at 1.155 million BOE per day while investing in high-return projects that will provide cash flow stability throughout the cycle. \u2047 We have also incorporated an expectation for inflation and a capital range to reflect the potential for fluctuations in our third-party-operated assets and our low-carbon opportunities during the year. \u2047 Our sustaining capital, which we define as the capital required to sustain production in the $40 WTI environment over a multiyear period, remains industry-leading. \u2047 Our multiyear sustaining capital is expected to increase from our 2021 capital budget of $2.9 billion, the reduced inventory of drilling uncompleted wells and additional investment in our Gulf of Mexico and EOR assets, to optimize the long-term productivity of our reservoirs and facilities. \u2047 If the macro environment requires spending below our multiyear sustaining capital, we have the ability to reduce it further and hold production flat for shorter periods of time, as we've demonstrated. \u2047 We are also investing in attractive mid-cycle projects that will provide cash flow stability through the cycle in future years. \u2047 For example, these projects include the Al Hosn expansion, which began last year. \u2047 And OxyChem is in the process of completing a FEED study to modernize certain Gulf Coast chlor-alkali assets from diaphram to membrane technology. \u2047 Our capital plan also includes investments to advance our net zero pathway, including reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency and developing our carbon sequestration initiative. \u2047 We are allocating capital in the budget to 1PointFive to begin construction on the first direct air capture facility. \u2047 We continue to make progress on both the engineering and commercial needs for direct air capture development. \u2047 We are improving both of these aspects and believe Oxy's capital helps retain value for our shareholders. \u2047 As the construction phase and technology of this new project advance, we will continue to consider strategic capital partnerships and structures to address financing. \u2047 We'll provide more comprehensive update on 1PointFive and direct air capture at our March 23 LCV investor update. \u2047 We benefited greatly from commodity price rebound last year and appreciate how swiftly the price environment can change. \u2047 The optionality that our scale and asset base provide enables us to retain a high degree of flexibility in our capital and spending plans. \u2047 The majority of our capital program is comprised of short-cycle investments, meaning that we have the ability to quickly adapt to changes in the macro environment. \u2047 Within six months or less, if necessary, we can reduce capital spending to sustaining levels. \u2047 And if oil prices remain supportive this year, our intent is to follow our cash flow priorities and capital framework that we will share with you today. \u2047 We have no need and no intent to invest in production growth this year. \u2047 Having a flexible capital budget that includes investment and cash flow longevity provides us and puts us in a strong position to implement shareholder return framework that will benefit shareholders over the long term. \u2047 With respect to cash flow priorities, our priorities for 2022 remain largely unchanged, with a continuing emphasis on reducing debt while maintaining our asset base integrity and sustainability. \u2047 The objective of strengthening our financial position remains the same: Enable us to confidently increase the amount of capital that we may sustainably return to shareholders throughout the cycle. \u2047 As we expect net debt to fall below $25 billion by the end of the first quarter, our focus has expanded to returning capital to shareholders, beginning with the increase in our common dividend to $0.13 per share and the reactivation and expansion of our share repurchase program. \u2047 The increase in the dividend to $0.13 per share is consistent with our intention to initially increase the dividend to a level that approximates the yield of the S&P 500. \u2047 We believe establishing framework for returning capital to shareholders through a sustainable common dividend, combined with an active share repurchase program and continued debt reduction, creates an attractive value proposition for shareholders while also improving the company's long-term financial position. \u2047 For the first phase of our shareholder return framework initiated, we have the options in future years to invest in cash flow growth. \u2047 We have the ability to grow oil and gas cash flow through higher production, but also have multiple investment opportunities across our other businesses. \u2047 As evidenced by our guidance for 2022, we do not intend to grow production in 2022. \u2047 At the point where it is appropriate to invest in future cash flow growth, we will only do so if supported by long-term demand. \u2047 Any future production growth will be limited to an average annual rate of approximately 5%. \u2047 As Vicki mentioned, the first phase of our shareholder return framework consists of the debt reduction; an increase in the common dividend to $0.13 per share; and the reactivation, expansion of our share repurchase program. \u2047 With net debt expected to be below $25 billion by the end of the first quarter, we are ready to begin returning more capital to shareholders, but we'll continue to prioritize debt reduction to focus on our medium-term goal of regaining our investment-grade credit rating. \u2047 We place high importance on debt reduction for the reasons I highlighted last quarter, mainly that as debt is reduced, our company's enterprise value rebalances to the benefit of our shareholders. \u2047 We recognize that oil prices are uncertain and may remain volatile, particularly in the current environment. \u2047 We then prioritized retirement of an initial $5 billion of debt to drive our net debt toward our next milestone of $20 billion. \u2047 When this milestone is achieved, our balance sheet will improve significantly even from where we are today. \u2047 We intend to provide our shareholders with a competitive common dividend while maintaining a long-cycle cash flow breakeven at $40 WTI or less. \u2047 The long-term sustainability of our dividend will be enhanced by continued deleveraging and share repurchases, as well as our best-in-class capital efficiency and a deep low-cost portfolio of assets. \u2047 As debt is retired, our cash interest payments will decrease, freeing up cash that can be used to support future common dividend growth. \u2047 In addition to increasing the common dividend to $0.13 per share, we intend to purchase approximately $3 billion of outstanding shares of common stock. \u2047 Maintaining an active share repurchase program with the benefit of a healthy balance sheet will potentially enable us to grow the dividend on a per-share basis at a faster rate. \u2047 As evidenced by our progress reducing debt last year, debt retirement remains a higher cash flow priority than our share repurchase program. \u2047 We intend to make substantial progress toward retiring an additional $5 billion of debt before initiating share repurchases. \u2047 It is our goal to reward shareholders with the triple benefit of: A sustainable common benefit, an active share repurchase program and a continuously strengthening financial position. \u2047 I'll now turn to our fourth quarter results. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we announced an adjusted profit of $1.48 and a reported profit of $1.37 per diluted share. \u2047 Our adjusted income improved significantly through 2021, with the fourth quarter being the strongest quarter of the year. \u2047 The increase in earnings was primarily driven by higher commodity prices and volumes, as well as OxyChem's excellent financial performance. \u2047 Our domestic oil and gas expenses experienced a sizable reduction on a BOE basis from the previous quarter and reflected a more normalized environment absent any significant weather disruptions. \u2047 The strong performance of our businesses, combined with the benefit of a healthy commodity price, enabled us to deliver another consecutive quarter of record free cash flow. \u2047 On our third quarter call, we announced the completion of our large-scale divestiture program, but reiterated our intention to continue seeking opportunities to optimize our portfolio to create shareholder value. \u2047 In November, we completed a bolt-on acquisition to increase our working interest in EOR assets that we'd operate. \u2047 And in January 2022, we divested a small package of Permian acreage that had yet no immediate plan to develop. \u2047 The purchase and sale prices of these transactions largely offset each other, while the EOR acquisition added approximately 5,000 BOE per day of low-decline production, as well as increasing our inventory of potential CCUS opportunity. \u2047 We exited the fourth quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of unrestricted cash on the balance sheet after repaying approximately $2.2 billion of"], "gold_summary": ["occidental increases dividend.
