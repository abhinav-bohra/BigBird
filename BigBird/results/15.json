{"article": ["I'd like to start by recognizing our colleagues, the people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare, for delivering strong results throughout 2021 and creating the momentum that is carrying us through as we enter into this year. \u2047 For example, performance in two key elements of our growth strategy, accelerating the transition of patients to Optum-led value-based care and strong United Healthcare growth in serving Medicare Advantage consumers, are both tracking well with the expectations we shared with you at our recent investor conference. \u2047 These, and the broader performance across the enterprise, confirm our confidence in our ability to advance our stated growth strategies and to support our long-term 13% to 16% earnings per share growth rate. \u2047 When you look back at the prevailing themes for 2021, you see a story of accelerating growth, strong collaboration between Optum and UnitedHealthcare and with our many external partners helped us grow in serving both commercial and government markets, unlock new innovation, introduce integrated products and services to the marketplace and significantly increased the number of people benefiting from value-based models of care. \u2047 Last year, we leveraged our technology capabilities to help physician and hospital systems better serve their patients and communities. \u2047 And we sharpened our focus on the consumer, working to elevate and improve the end-to-end experience. \u2047 Taken together, these efforts helped us add more than $30 billion in revenue for the year, about $10 billion above our initial outlook. \u2047 And you should expect similar growth in the year ahead. \u2047 We see an even greater demand for integration to bring together the fragmented pieces of the health system, to harness the tremendous innovation occurring in the marketplace, to help better align the incentives for providers, payers, and consumers, and to organize the system around value. \u2047 A healthcare system that is more connected, more informed, more human, and more responsive to every person's unique needs. \u2047 At our investor conference, we shared five key areas for growth and for differentiated experiences across our portfolio. \u2047 These growth opportunities will guide our strategy this year and for many years to come. \u2047 First is care delivery, more specifically, value-based care. \u2047 For UnitedHealth Group, this is more than a primary care strategy. \u2047 It's a comprehensive clinical strategy encompassing our growing behavioral, home, ambulatory, and virtual care capabilities. \u2047 Our second growth area is health benefits, advancing the quality, innovation, and consumer appeal of our benefit offerings and bringing our value-based strategy to life. \u2047 We enter '22 having generated strong consumer growth in Medicare Advantage and saw further progress in Medicaid and growing momentum in our commercial business. \u2047 Our major partnerships across the country help health systems improve their performance and returns, all to better support their missions. \u2047 We're energized by the potential to bring these comprehensive tailored solutions to a greater number of system partners in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Fourth, health financial services, vastly improved in the health payment sector, streamlining and simplifying payments for providers, payers and consumers while reducing friction and increasing speed and convenience. \u2047 And finally, pharmacy services, where people interact most often with the healthcare system. \u2047 We can better use the significant breadth, volume, and value of our foundational pharmacy services and data capabilities and integrate our medical pharmacy and behavioral capabilities, all of this to provide whole person care, support the discovery of new drugs and treatments and support value-based models of care. \u2047 In sum, we enter 2022 with heightened confidence in our ability to execute upon the objectives we set forth in late November. \u2047 I thought I would take a few minutes providing you with some additional details on our first growth priority: value-based care, how we have prepared for it, the investments we have made and how we see it working in the near future. \u2047 This has been something we have been working on and building over the course of a decade. \u2047 For example, there was significant operational groundwork and investment that went into supporting the half-million new patients for whom OptumHealth will become accountable in 2022. \u2047 Successful execution requires a lot of detailed planning, investing, and building. \u2047 It has become a distinctive competency of our enterprise, which we can now increasingly apply at scale. \u2047 So what does it take to prepare for moving to a fully accountable arrangement? \u2047 Investments can be significant. \u2047 As an example, in '21, we incurred over $100 million in preparation expense. \u2047 Within this, there are three major workstreams involved: clinical training and staff preparation, technology and data enhancement and third is network coordination. \u2047 The first workstream focuses on physician education. \u2047 It begins well more than a year prior. \u2047 It's important to provide the resources and knowledge for physicians to begin approaching their patients differently. \u2047 They engage in their patients' whole health, well ahead of taking on greater accountability. \u2047 We find it to be an essential and sometimes complex shift in what our long-held fee-for-service practices. \u2047 Beyond education, we ramp up our capacity in the form of physicians, nurses, and other clinicians to meet the requirements of our business. \u2047 The second area focuses on the technology systems and information needed to support patient care and effective clinical management. \u2047 This includes things like patient portals and utilization management systems as well as reporting systems for teams to effectively manage. \u2047 Finally is the planning and network coordination work to support clinical oversight beyond primary care and ensure true continuity of care. \u2047 This planning and coordination includes initiatives such as identifying the patients most in need and ensuring a seamless transition to high-touch clinical care services that improve health and quickly pairing patients with a personal care navigator to assist in supporting complex health needs, appointment scheduling, and timely medication support on day one. \u2047 These foundational preparations and investments have been critical in creating strong results across the variety of geographies and practices we have transitioned. \u2047 We expect this expertise will serve us well as we transition even larger groups of patients in the years to come. \u2047 Before handing it over to John, I'd like to update you on how COVID has impacted our operations. \u2047 Like other businesses, we have experienced moderately higher levels of attrition and more unplanned absences. \u2047 We had prepared for this situation through increased recruiting capacity as well as meaningfully upgraded digital capabilities to improve customer experience and reduce call volumes. \u2047 As a result, in the first two weeks of '22, traditionally our most demanding period, we were able to service the needs of our patients and customers. \u2047 At the same time, we responded swiftly to the federal mandate for cash-free COVID test for consumers, a highly complex undertaking. \u2047 With four days' notice, UnitedHealthcare created a customer digital experience for ease of reimbursement and established a partnership with Walmart and now Rite Aid that eliminates cash outlays by consumers at point of purchase. \u2047 We expect more partnerships in the days ahead. \u2047 As we look forward, we believe we have the right capacity in place to execute our business priorities and meet our customers' expectations. \u2047 I'll start by expanding a bit upon Dirk's comments on the COVID impacts we're seeing. \u2047 In the most recent weeks, inpatient hospitalization levels for our members are similar to the January 2021 levels, even with national COVID case rates about four times higher. \u2047 For those people needing inpatient care, severity is seemingly lower as we are seeing shorter lengths of stay compared to that earlier period. \u2047 At the same time, we are observing familiar correlations of care activity patterns to other periods of elevated infection rates experienced over the past two years. \u2047 For example, in these early weeks of January, we are seeing slowing in primary care, elective visit, and procedural volumes. \u2047 Activity over the past several weeks shows primary care visits having declined about 10% and an even higher rate of decline in specialist visits. \u2047 As always, our prime focus is on helping people get the care they need when they need it. \u2047 Moving now to our specific business performance. \u2047 OptumHealth's revenue per consumer grew by over 30% in '21, driven by the increasing number of our patients served under value-based arrangements. \u2047 Consistent with the expectations we shared in late November, we had a strong start to the year and continue to expect to add 500,000 new patients in accountable value-based relationships, benefiting from the groundwork laid over the past many years. \u2047 OptumInsight's earnings grew 25% in '21, with operating margins approaching 28% for the year. \u2047 We ended the year with a revenue backlog of $22.4 billion, an increase of $2.2 billion over the prior year. \u2047 Our expanding relationships serving health systems has been a key factor driving this growth, and we expect these partnerships to continue to grow in '22 and beyond. \u2047 OptumRx earnings grew 6% for the year, driven by the continued expansion of our pharmacy services businesses, supply chain initiatives and strong cost management activities and benefiting from strong customer retention. \u2047 In addition, we continue to see the impact of OptumRx's movement to a higher-value pharmacy care and specialty services orientation. \u2047 Full-year revenues of $223 billion grew 11%. \u2047 As noted, our 2022 Medicare Advantage member growth outlook is very positive and consistent with the objectives we established at our November investor conference. \u2047 Within the up to 800,000 new members we will serve in '22, about three-quarters will be in individual and group Medicare Advantage and the remainder in dual special needs plans. \u2047 And given the steady strides we've made in quality performance, we have the opportunity to enroll people in our newly rated five-star plans throughout the entirety of this year. \u2047 Our Medicaid membership outlook for '22 continues to incorporate an expectation that states resume eligibility redeterminations, resulting in modest net attrition. \u2047 In January, we began serving the citizens of Minnesota and continue to support the Missouri expansion this year as well as renewed relationships with Ohio, Tennessee, and Nevada. \u2047 Over the course of the year, we will look to continue to expand upon the nearly 8 million individuals we serve across 31 states. \u2047 We concluded '21 with commercial membership about 200,000 people ahead of the original outlook provided. \u2047 Creating this momentum is the strong response we are seeing to the new innovative products you have heard us discuss, products such as NavigateNOW, which use the Optum virtual network as a first option. \u2047 Our capital capacities remain strong. \u2047 Full year '21 cash flow from operations was $22.3 billion or 1.3 times net income, about $2 billion above the initial outlook we shared a year ago. \u2047 We continue to expect our 2022 cash flow to approach $24 billion, about 1.2 times net income. \u2047 And we ended '21 with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 38%. \u2047 These ample capital capacities allow us to continue to accelerate our investments, while remaining committed to an advancing shareholder dividend and supporting our expected repurchase of between $5 billion and $6 billion of stock in '22. \u2047 Our 2022 adjusted earnings per share outlook of $21.10 to $21.60 is consistent with the view we offered seven weeks ago. \u2047 From this distance, and in contrast to the past two years, we expect the seasonal pattern to be more consistent with our historical experience, with just under 50% of full-year earnings in the first half and the first two quarters comparably even. \u2047 Before we transition to the Q&A portion of the call, I hope you've already taken away the strong sense of confidence John, Dirk, and I share in the growth potential of this company, rooted in the growing number of people we're serving in value-based models, the depth of relationships we're building with local health systems, our pharmacy capabilities and the innovation and consumer focus that's driving growth across our government programs, individual and commercial businesses. \u2047 As demand for innovation and integrated solutions, products, and services only continues to grow, we've never been in a better position to help bring together the fragmented pieces of healthcare and create more value for the people we try to serve. \u2047 One per caller, please. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["affirmed 2022 growth and performance objectives established at its november 30, 2021 investor conference.  \u2047
