{"article": ["I will be presenting today with Eric Thornburg, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer; and Andrew Walters, chief financial officer and treasurer. \u2047 For those who would like to follow along, slides accompanying our remarks are available on our website at www. \u2047 These statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by the company in light of its experience, historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that the company believes are appropriate under the circumstances. \u2047 I'm Eric Thornburg, and it is my honor to serve as chair, president and CEO of SJW Group. \u2047 I'm pleased to report that 2021 was a strong year for SJW Group. \u2047 Our talented and passionate employees and leaders rose to the challenges, and positioned us well for 2022 and coming years. \u2047 We were solid in the key areas of our long-term growth strategy, delivering a reliable supply of high-quality water and world-class service to customers, investing in drinking water and wastewater systems to serve customers and communities and seeking a return of and on that investment, focusing on drinking water and wastewater continuing to acquire water and wastewater utilities, maintaining constructive relationships with our stakeholders and adding shareholder value through prudent growth. \u2047 In 2021, we delivered earnings of $2.03 per share, invested more than $230 million in our water and wastewater systems, successfully processed our general rate case in Connecticut, obtained approval for a Step 1 of a multiyear rate plan for the new water treatment facility in Maine, and grew our customer base in our Texas operation by 20% through acquisitions and organic growth. \u2047 In January of 2022, we reached a constructive settlement agreement with the Public Advocates Office and our California general rate case. \u2047 Our success has its roots in our culture of teamwork and service, and the commitment to excellence in environmental, social and governance strategies. \u2047 Our teams collaborate across our national footprint and are passionate about serving customers efficiently and sustainably. \u2047 We view all aspects of our operations, planning and construction through an ESG lens. \u2047 In 2021, we had an emphasis on supporting the drive of our people who understand our social and environmental responsibilities and wanna be a positive force for good in the communities where we live, work and serve. \u2047 We intend to emphasize this even more in 2022. \u2047 Our accomplishments have been recognized with prime status by ISS ESG. \u2047 Among our U.S. water utility peers, SJW Group is tied for the lead in overall social score from ISS, and tied for second in the overall environmental score. \u2047 The company has the best overall governance score possibly. \u2047 SJW Group's 2021 corporate sustainability report, which is now available on our website, demonstrates how ESG is reflected throughout our organization, our diversity equity inclusion efforts are a good example. \u2047 SJW Group has signed on to the CEO action for diversity and inclusion. \u2047 We embrace each person's unique background traits and personality so that they will bring their true selves to our teams. \u2047 We have a commitment to supplier diversity. \u2047 Our efforts in California were recognized by the Public Utilities Commission. \u2047 Veterans Magazine honored SJW as one of the nation's top supplier diversity programs in 2020. \u2047 With California as the model, programs have been implemented, and supplier diversity goals established for our operations in other states. \u2047 SJW Group also adopted a vendor code of conduct that applies our values across the supply chain. \u2047 Likewise, we've been committed to being responsible stewards of the environment by sustainably managing and protecting water resources, which is critical to maintaining adequate supplies of high-quality water. \u2047 We know that focusing on water resources is no longer enough. \u2047 That is why we've committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 50% by 2030 when compared with a 2019 baseline, a science-based target that aligns with the Paris Agreement to limit the warming of the planet. \u2047 It's the right thing to do, and we will report on our progress. \u2047 We are seeing extreme weather across our operations. \u2047 A year ago, our Texas operation experienced ice, and prolonged temperatures below freezing causing widespread power and water outages. \u2047 In Connecticut this summer, we saw tropical storms and record rainfall. \u2047 In California, we experienced extreme dry conditions into last fall and the early part of 2022. \u2047 Precipitation in California has since we saw between above average and below average. \u2047 We plan to issue 2022 guidance after the rainy season has concluded on our first quarter financial results call. \u2047 There was enough precipitation in late 2021 to bring our Montevina drinking water treatment facility back online in mid-December 2021. \u2047 we're hopeful that California's reservoirs continue to replenish through the rainy season. \u2047 Our customers are still under a mandatory conservation order that requires a 15% reduction in water usage compared with 2019. \u2047 We will continue to promote water conservation aggressively in our California operations as long as necessary. \u2047 Water Conservation Memorandum and water conservation expense memorandum accounts have been established that allow for the potential future recovery of the revenue and expense impacts of such water use reductions. \u2047 We offer and actively promote financial assistance programs to customers in need. \u2047 Our utilities work with customers experiencing onetime or ongoing financial hardships through bill forgiveness, flexible payment arrangements and in California and Connecticut through our Water Rate Assistance Programs that provides a 15% reduction on water bills for income eligible customers. \u2047 SJW Group is also committed to ensuring that our customers are aware of state and federal assistance programs such as the federally funded Low Income Household Water Assistance Program. \u2047 In California, we applied for funds on behalf of our customers in need and received a check for almost $10 million from the California Water and Wastewater Arrearage Payment Program that will provide immediate relief for our customers who have been in arrears. \u2047 We believe that customer assistance programs and innovative rate-making are at the core of water equity. \u2047 Artificially keeping rates low by deferring investment is shortsighted, and it's unsustainable and does not really serve customers who all deserve quality water and service for the long term. \u2047 Our subsidiaries will continue to make investments in infrastructure so that customers at all income levels will have access to the high-quality and reliable water service they deserve. \u2047 Through prudent planning and rate-making, such as the low income rates, the cost and rate impacts of these investments will be incurred gradually so they could be managed more easily by the utility and customers. \u2047 Building and retaining our workforce of water professionals is also critical. \u2047 We invest in the training and development of our people so they can have rewarding careers at SJW Group utilities. \u2047 They are the foundation. \u2047 Our success is built on. \u2047 We strive to provide a safe and productive work environment, support the training and development of our teams and measure employee satisfaction and engagement through independent surveys. \u2047 Earlier this month, Connecticut Water was recognized as a top workplace in the United States, one of just 1,100 companies across the country to achieve that distinction. \u2047 And after Jim's remarks, we will address regulatory and other business matters. \u2047 Our 2021 operating results benefited from authorized rate increases in each of our four operating utilities. \u2047 These increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage, most notably in our California utility as a result of the drought emergency declarations by the state governor in Valley Water, our local wholesale water agency, as well as a decrease in the availability of surface water supplies in our California surface area. \u2047 In addition, we experienced higher general and administrative expenses, due primarily to rate case activity in three of our four water utilities, and increases in other operating costs. \u2047 Also, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we benefited from property sales in California and recorded a long-lived asset impairment in Texas that together provided a net benefit to our reported results. \u2047 Diversification, coupled with our strong local operations, and supported by our national framework, enable us to provide high-quality water and reliable water service to our customers and communities, protect our employees and deliver solid results for our shareholders. \u2047 Fourth quarter revenue was $139.7 million, a $4 million increase over reported fourth quarter 2020 revenue. \u2047 Net income for the quarter was $18 million or $0.60 per diluted share. \u2047 This compares with net income of $13.3 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was primarily driven by cumulative rate increases of $0.34 per share, decreased production cost due to lower customer usage of $0.30 per share, the sale of nonutility property of $0.29 per share, and recognition of the impact of our California Water Conservation Memorandum Account, or our WCMA, of $0.12 per share. \u2047 These increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.40 per share, an increase in per unit production cost of $0.20 per share and the impairment of a long-lived asset of $0.09 per share. \u2047 In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of $0.14 per share related to flow-through items and the impact of such items on lower fourth quarter pre-tax earnings. \u2047 No similar rate impact occurred in 2021 due to higher fourth quarter pre-tax income. \u2047 Turning to our comparative analysis for the quarter. \u2047 The $4 million increase in revenue was primarily due to $10 million in cumulative rate increases and $3.4 million in the recognition of balancing and memorandum accounts in California, which includes $3.2 million attributable to the WCMA. \u2047 These increases were partially offset by a $10.5 million decrease in customer usage. \u2047 The cumulative rate increases include the impact of final decisions on our general rate case and reconsideration proceeding in Connecticut, which we received at the end of July and November of 2021, respectively. \u2047 While these decisions occurred later in the year than we anticipated, when coupled with our WICA, or our WICA filing, that was approved by PURA in December of 2021. \u2047 Our Connecticut utility will benefit from an increase in our annual revenue requirement by approximately $9.9 million beginning January of 2022. \u2047 Water production expense decreased $1.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 The decrease included $7.8 million due to lower customer usage partially offset by $5.3 million in higher average per unit water production cost. \u2047 Other operating expenses decreased $1.5 million during the quarter, primarily due to a gain on the sale of nonutility property of $7.5 million, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses of $1.6 million and the recognition of an impairment on a long-lived asset of $2.2 million. \u2047 The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the cost of rate case proceedings in the three of our four operating utilities, as well as higher compensation, consulting and insurance costs. \u2047 The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 15%, compared to net negative 7% for the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 The higher effective tax rate in 2021 was primarily due to the impact of flow-through items on the change in profit before income taxes as compared to 2020. \u2047 On November 17, 2021, SJW Group entered into an equity distribution agreement whereby the company may offer the sale of shares of its common stock from time-to-time in at-the-market offerings. \u2047 SJW Group sold and issued approximately 355,000 shares of common stock with a weighted average price of $70.4 per share, and received approximately $24 million in net proceeds under the agreement in 2021. \u2047 Proceeds from the sale of the shares were used to finance the acquisitions of Kendall West and Bandera East Water utilities in Texas, which closed on December 17, 2021. \u2047 On December 1, 2021, San Jose Water Company issued $50 million in its Series O senior notes. \u2047 The notes are unsecured, accrue interest at 3% and mature 30 years from the issue date. \u2047 In addition, on December 1, Connecticut Water Company issued $50 million of its Series 2021 Senior B notes. \u2047 These notes are also unsecured, accrue interest at 3.10%, and mature 30 years from the issue date. \u2047 Turning to our annual results. \u2047 2021 revenue was $573.7 million, a $9.2 million increase over the prior year. \u2047 Net income in 2021 was $60.5 million or $2.03 per diluted share, compared to $61.5 million or $2.14 per diluted share in 2020. \u2047 The change in diluted earnings per share for the year was due to many of the same factors noted for the quarter. \u2047 Cumulative rate increases contributed $0.86 per share, decreased production costs due to lower customer usage added $0.51 per share, and the sale of nonutility property contributed $0.28 per share. \u2047 In addition, various regulatory mechanisms and balancing and memorandum accounts added $0.21 per share, and the recognition of the California WCMA contributed $0.12 per share. \u2047 These increases were offset by a decrease in customer usage of $0.93 per share, a production cost price increase of $0.44 per share, and an increase in administrative and general expenses of $0.25 per share. \u2047 In addition, depreciation expense increased $0.20 per share. \u2047 California surface water production resulted in a decrease of $0.15 per share and the long-lived asset impairment in Texas decreased earnings by $0.08 per share. \u2047 The 2021 increase in revenue was primarily due to $25.2 million in cumulative rate increases, $2.5 million in the net recognition of certain regulatory mechanisms in Connecticut and Maine, and $3.9 million in the recognition of balancing and memorandum accounts in California, including $3.2 million attributable to the WCMA, and $2.9 million in revenue from new customers. \u2047 These increases were partially offset by $24.7 million in decreased customer usage. \u2047 Water production expenses increased $3.3 million in 2021. \u2047 The increase was primarily due to $11 million -- $11.6 million in higher average per unit water production cost, $3.9 million due to a decrease in surface water supply production, and a $1.3 million increase in California cost recovery balancing and memorandum accounts. \u2047 These increases were partially offset by $13.5 million in lower customer water usage. \u2047 Other operating expenses increased $12.4 million in 2021, primarily due to $7.6 million in higher general and administrative expenses, $5.1 million in increased depreciation and amortization expenses, and $3.9 million in higher maintenance costs. \u2047 As noted earlier, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an impairment on a long-lived asset of $2.2 million and a gain on the sale of nonutility property of $7.5 million. \u2047 The change in other income and expense for the year was primarily the result of the $3 million TWA holdback"],
