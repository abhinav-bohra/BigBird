Lower, our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 I will be available by phone following the call to address any additional questions that you may have. \u2047 Today, we reported all-time record quarter results with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.79, an increase of 207% compared to last year. \u2047 These outstanding results were driven by strong performance in new, used and customer financial services and disciplined expense management. \u2047 Demand continues to exceed supply for new vehicles, and we expect this to continue through 2021 in part due to the production disruption. \u2047 More importantly, low interest rates and consumer preference for vehicle ownership versus ridesharing and public transportation are supporting demand. \u2047 We expect our shipments from the manufacturers to double in the second quarter compared to the prior year. \u2047 AutoNation same-store new vehicle units were up 22% year-over-year and up 12% compared to 2019. \u2047 We remain focused on our pre-owned vehicle procurement strategy, nearly 90% of our pre-owned vehicles retailed in the first quarter were self- sourced, meaning, we acquired through trade-in, switch returns. \u2047 We'll Buy Your Car or service loaners and avoided auctions. \u2047 Acquiring vehicles at the right price, speed to the front line, a fair one price environment and leading digital capabilities are winning formula for our customers, which shows in our results. \u2047 AutoNation same-store pre-owned units were up 28% year-over-year and 20% compared to 2019. \u2047 We continue to leverage our digital capabilities to drive cost reductions and increase efficiency. \u2047 Tools like Customer 360, which has over 10 million active customer records, enable us to provide a truly comprehensive and personal experience for our customers, which leads to higher close rates and increased vehicle sales. \u2047 These efforts allowed us to deliver adjusted SG&A as a percent of gross profit, a 62.7% in the first quarter of 2021 which represents a 1,120 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Our target is to operate at or below 65% SG&A as a percent of gross profit for '21. \u2047 We are committed to our business growth strategy through investment in our existing franchise business. \u2047 Expansion of AutoNation USA and future acquisitions. \u2047 We are on track to open five new AutoNation USA stores in 2021 and 12 additional new stores in 2022. \u2047 Our target is to have over 130 AutoNation USA stores in operation from coast to coast by the end of 2026. \u2047 Today, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire 11 stores and one collision center for Peacock Automotive Group in Hilton Head and Columbia, South Carolina and Savannah, Georgia, representing approximately $380 million in annual revenue. \u2047 The brands acquired are Porsche, Jag[Phonetic], Land Rover, Audi, Subaru, Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Volkswagen

combined new and pre-owned vehicles annually. \u2047 AutoNation remains committed to delivering value to our shareholders, which includes opportunistic share repurchase. \u2047 During the quarter we bought back 3.8 million shares or 5% of our shares outstanding. \u2047 Today we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $234 million or $2.79 per share versus $82 million or $0.91 per share during the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 This represents an all-time high quarterly earnings per share and a 207% increase year-over-year. \u2047 During the quarter, we sold our remaining stake in Vroom for a gain of approximately $6 million after tax or $0.07 per share, which was excluded from our adjusted results. \u2047 Our first quarter same-store revenue increased $1.3 billion or 27% compared to the prior year due to strong growth in new, used and customer financial services. \u2047 While prior-year comparisons are impacted by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to see strong consumer demand exceed supply for new vehicles. \u2047 Given this backdrop, we remain focused on optimizing our business in the current environment. \u2047 For the quarter, same-store total variable gross profit increased 52% year-over-year, driven by an increase in total combined units of 25% and an increase in total variable PVR of $767 or 21%. \u2047 Our customer care business continues to gradually improve with same-store customer care gross profit increasing 1% year-over-year. \u2047 Taking together, our same-store total gross profit increased 27% compared to the prior year. \u2047 First quarter SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 62.7%, as Mike stated a 1,120 basis point improvement compared to the year-ago period. \u2047 This strong performance was driven by a combination of strict cost discipline, leverage of our digital capabilities and healthy vehicle margins. \u2047 As measured against gross profit, overhead decreased 590 basis points, compensation decreased 320 basis points and advertising decreased 210 basis points. \u2047 Based on current business conditions, we project SG&A as a percentage of gross profit to be at or below 65% for the full year 2021. \u2047 Floorplan interest expense decreased to $9 million in the first quarter of 2021 due to lower interest rates and lower average floorplan balances. \u2047 This, combined with lower non-vehicle interest expense, a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding generated record adjusted EPS. \u2047 Regarding our balance sheet and liquidity, we have ample capacity to continue investing in our business, including our AutoNation USA expansion as well as opportunistic share repurchases and acquisitions. \u2047 Our cash balance at quarter end was $350 million which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of approximately $2.1 billion. \u2047 Our covenant leverage ratio of debt to EBITDA declined to 1.3 times at the end of the first quarter, down from 1.8 times at the end of the fourth quarter. \u2047 Including cash and used floorplan availability, our net leverage ratio was 1.1 times at the end of March. \u2047 Our AutoNation USA expansion continues to provide a very attractive growth opportunity. \u2047 During the first quarter, our five existing AutoNation US stores generated over $3 million in pre-tax profit. \u2047 As Mike referenced earlier, we plan to open five new stores by the end of this year and 12 new stores in 2022 and targeting over 130 total locations by the end of 2026. \u2047 And we will
