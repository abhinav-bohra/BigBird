{"article": ["I will provide comments on the strong start that we had to 2021, including the advancement of a number of strategic priorities to make DuPont a premier multi-industrial company, equipped for growth and value creation. \u2047 The health and well-being of our people remains our top priority. \u2047 The principles and protocols we've implemented globally and locally to help to protect our people and ensure business continuity as countries face multiple waves of infection and lockdowns. \u2047 As an innovation-led company, we believe in science and we're encouraging all employees to get vaccinated. \u2047 And where possible, we're working with public health authorities to facilitate access and distribution. \u2047 Starting on Slide 2, I will note that one of our priorities for generating value is consistent operating performance and financial results. \u2047 Lori will take you through the details in a moment. \u2047 But I'd like to highlight the 7% organic revenue growth that we reported, reflecting broad and strong demand in key markets such as semiconductors, smartphones, water, residential construction and automotive. \u2047 This revenue growth, along with continued cost discipline, led to strong operating leverage and EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. \u2047 Our first-quarter financial results reflect the agility of our teams to navigate through a challenging environment while facing escalating raw material and logistics costs, as well as global supply constraints of key raw materials, most notably in our M&M segment. \u2047 With strong order trend continuing and confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges, we are raising our full-year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. \u2047 I will provide more details regarding this increase shortly. \u2047 In addition to our financial results, we advanced a number of our strategic priorities during the quarter. \u2047 First, as previously announced, we completed the merger of our nutrition and biosciences business with IFF, creating an industry-leading company in the food and beverage, home and personal care and health and wellness markets. \u2047 As you know, this transaction also unlocks significant value for DuPont and our shareholders. \u2047 As part of the transaction, we received 7.3 billion cash from IFF and retired slightly more than 197 million coupon shares, or about 27% of our outstanding shares at the time with no cash outlay. \u2047 We strengthened our balance sheet during the quarter by paying down our $3 billion term loan, and we will redeem $2 billion of our long-term debt later this month. \u2047 As a reminder, our next debt maturity will not be due until the fourth quarter of 2023. \u2047 In line with our balanced approach, we returned about 660 million of capital to shareholders during the first quarter through share repurchases and dividends. \u2047 Under our existing share buyback program, we executed 500 million in share repurchases during the first quarter. \u2047 As a reminder, we have about 500 million of repurchase authorization remaining under that program, which we intend to utilize by June 1 of this year. \u2047 Earlier this quarter, we also announced that our board of directors authorized a new 1.5 billion share buyback program, which expires on June 30, 2022. \u2047 We plan to be opportunistic under the new program as we move throughout the year. \u2047 With respect to dividends, we returned about 160 million in cash to shareholders during the quarter. \u2047 As we previously mentioned, going forward, we will target a payout ratio between 35 and 45%. \u2047 And we intend to work with our board to increase our dividend annually as we grow our earnings. \u2047 In March, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Laird Performance Materials for $2.3 billion. \u2047 When completed, a planned acquisition of Laird advances DuPont's strategy of growing as a global innovation leader and strengthens our leadership position in advanced electronic materials. \u2047 The Laird business will complement our interconnect solutions business within E&I, and it will add critical capabilities and market-leading offerings in thermal management and electromagnetic shielding, which are essential to emerging electronic applications. \u2047 Our E&I team, along with our customers, are excited for this opportunity. \u2047 We recently received regulatory approval for the transaction in Germany and Brazil and cleared HSR in the U.S. last month. \u2047 As previously indicated, we expect the transaction will close in the third quarter of this year. \u2047 Finally, we announced previously that we have signed definitive agreements to sell our Biomaterials, Clean Technologies and Solamet businesses. \u2047 We anticipate receiving more than 900 million in gross proceeds from those divestitures, and we expect those transactions to close in the second half of this year. \u2047 Before turning it over to Lori to go through the details of the first quarter, I'd like to take a moment to provide some context regarding what we saw during the quarter in our key end markets that we serve. \u2047 Combined, the electronics and automotive markets account for nearly half of our revenues. \u2047 Electronics continues to perform very well, and auto is recovering nicely from its 2020 lows. \u2047 Within electronics, demand continues to be broad-based as the ramp-up of advanced technology nodes and a need for more memory to servers and data centers has accelerated. \u2047 The server market, which is a large consumer of semiconductor chips and circuit board chemistries, continues to show strength and is expected to remain robust as Internet network traffic continues to grow. \u2047 Furthermore, the deployment of 5G infrastructure by leading telecom companies in preparation for the next generation of ultra high-speed data transmission should help sustain demand for premium smartphones, which is further enhanced by our favorable content play. \u2047 With respect to the automotive end market, demand is well above the lows of 2020 but not yet back to 2019 levels, which sold 22.9 million vehicles produced in the first quarter and nearly 90 million units for the year. \u2047 The lack of stable supply of critical components, mainly semiconductors, impacted the ability of the auto OEMs to produce more vehicles and rebuild inventories during the quarter. \u2047 Even where we participate in the value chain within M&M, I think it's important to note that our first quarter engineering polymers volumes were not materially affected by the chip shortages as our demand from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers was not lessened as a result of the chip shortage. \u2047 However, our ability to supply customers was affected by supply constraints of key raw materials, predominantly in our nylon and polyester product lines. \u2047 This supply situation is gradually improving while we anticipate several critical products will continue to constrain our production through the end of the second quarter. \u2047 We expect that annual sales as a result of raw material constraints will be captured in the second half of the year. \u2047 Additionally, we believe that the automotive market will remain strong for the balance of the year as OEMs look to meet robust demand, as well as replenish global inventories, which are currently below historical averages. \u2047 Moving on to the water and construction end markets. \u2047 Collectively, these two markets account for approximately 20% of our total company sales. \u2047 Versus first quarter of 2019, demand for advanced water filtration and purification has strengthened, driven by solid growth in Asia Pacific. \u2047 Strength in residential and commercial water markets, as well as industrial and desalination segments has shown growth. \u2047 For construction, North America residential and do-it-yourself markets are up versus first quarter 2019. \u2047 And while demand within the commercial construction segment has improved from the lows experienced in 2020, it is not back to 2019 levels. \u2047 Lastly, demand within our industrial end markets versus 2019 levels is mixed. \u2047 Within the electrical infrastructure and Tyvek protective garment markets, demand is at or above 2019 levels. \u2047 However, demand in end markets such as aerospace and oil and gas is still below 2019 levels, but it's improved since the lows of the second and third quarter of last year. \u2047 Sequentially, our sales in the aero and oil and gas were up over 40%. \u2047 Our diversified portfolio of products and technologies will serve us as the global economy continues to recover from the pandemic. \u2047 We are continuing to invest at competitive levels in R&D and innovation to further solidify our strong market positions and maintain our position as the partner of choice for our customers in 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Let me cover our first-quarter financial results on Slide 4. \u2047 Net sales of 4 billion were up 8% versus the first quarter of 2020, up 7% on an organic basis. \u2047 Overall sales growth was driven by strong volume, up 7% versus first quarter of last year, with volume increases in all three reporting segments. \u2047 Currency provided a 3% tailwind in the quarter led by the euro. \u2047 Portfolio was a 2% headwind, primarily due to the sale of the trichlorosilane business last year. \u2047 Sales were up in all three segments, with E&I, M&M and W&P reflecting organic growth of 14%, 8% and 1%, respectively. \u2047 On a regional basis, organic sales were up 20% in Asia Pacific, our largest region from a sales perspective, with strong results in all three reporting segments. \u2047 Partially offsetting gains in Asia Pacific were organic sales decline in the U.S. and Canada and EMEA of 4 and 2%, respectively. \u2047 and Canada and EMEA were driven by softness for aramid fibers, specifically continued softness in aerospace and timing delays in defense, as well as auto builds, which were down in these regions. \u2047 I'll provide more color on our segment top line results on the next slide. \u2047 From an earnings perspective, we delivered operating EBITDA of 1.05 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 per share, up 15 and 90%, respectively. \u2047 Volume gains, as well as benefit from prior-year cost initiatives and currency drove 160 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion and 1.9 times operating leverage. \u2047 Incremental margins for the quarter were 46%. \u2047 I will walk you through the earnings per share later call in a moment. \u2047 Our total company gross margin for the quarter was 36.8%, flat on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Gross margin improvement in E&I and M&M on higher volume and manufacturing productivity was offset by a margin decline in W&P, resulting from higher unit rates versus the prior year, driven primarily by lower production volumes of aramid fibers. \u2047 Gross margin expanded about 280 basis points sequentially, with margin improvement in all three segments. \u2047 From a segment perspective, E&I delivered operating EBITDA margin of 33.5% and 420 basis points of margin expansion versus the year-ago period on strong volume growth and a onetime discrete gain related to an asset sale. \u2047 Excluding the benefit of the asset sale, operating EBITDA margin would have been 31.7%, a year-over-year improvement of 240 basis points. \u2047 M&M delivered operating EBITDA margins of 22.9% and 320 basis points of margin expansion versus the year ago period on higher volumes and savings from productivity actions. \u2047 In W&P, operating EBITDA was flat versus the year ago period as sales gains and cost productivity actions were offset by higher manufacturing costs, primarily higher unit rates, driven by lower production of aramid fibers and increased supply chain costs. \u2047 For the quarter, cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow were 378 million and 95 million, respectively. \u2047 These amounts include one month of cash flow from our N&B business compared to three months of N&B cash burn in the prior year. \u2047 In addition, cash flow and free cash flow conversion was negatively impacted by a working capital headwind of about 300 million, led by higher accounts receivable balances, which were up in line with sales. \u2047 For the year, we continue to target free cash flow conversion of greater than 90%. \u2047 Slide 5 provides more details on the year-over-year changes in net sales. \u2047 Leading the way for the quarter was E&I with 15% volume growth, which had a record quarter. \u2047 Volume gains were led by double-digit growth on robust demand for semiconductors across Asia. \u2047 High fabrication utilization rates, driven by demand for new technologies and advanced nodes, along with the ongoing shift in digital transformation drove strong top line growth. \u2047 In addition, share gains from recent wins for CMP slurry and lithography materials improved results. \u2047 In interconnect solutions, double-digit growth was driven by higher material content in premium next-generation smartphones partially resulting from timing shifts that select OEM demand shifted earlier in the year this year, along with broader printed circuit board market recovery. \u2047 Within industrial solutions, double-digit volume gains in display materials due to new time launches more than offset continued weakness in aerospace. \u2047 The end markets within W&P were generally consistent with our expectations. \u2047 Sales gains were led by water solutions with double-digit volume growth, reflecting strong demand for our reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration technology, led by Asia. \u2047 Shelter solutions had low single-digit organic growth versus the year ago period, reflecting high single-digit organic growth in residential construction and retail channels for do-it-yourself application, offset partially by softness in commercial construction market. \u2047 Within safety solutions, pricing gains, favorable currency and strengthening demand for aramid fibers in industrial and automotive end market was more than offset by continued weakness in aerospace and year-over-year volume declines for Tyvek. \u2047 Lower Tyvek production volumes were a result of higher planned downtime in the quarter. \u2047 Also contributing to strong first-quarter top line growth was continued recovery of the global automotive market, which represents about 60% of our M&M segment from an end market perspective. \u2047 The most recent estimate of 1Q global auto builds were about 20.3 million units toward the quarter, up approximately 14% versus the first quarter of last year. \u2047 As a result, volume in our performance resins business was up over 20% versus the year-ago period. \u2047 Another bright spot in M&M was improved demand for microcircuit materials, which we aligned to the M&M segment earlier this year. \u2047 These specialized materials, along with adhesive growth, helped drive over 20% organic growth in advanced solutions growth in the year ago period. \u2047 Demand in our engineering polymers business was strong. \u2047 However, global supply constraints for key raw materials resulted in low single-digit volume decline. \u2047 Our teams are experienced in navigating trading challenges and have worked diligently with our customers and suppliers to help mitigate the impact incurred as a result. \u2047 Additionally, we expect to recover volume lost in the quarter due to these disruptions and raw material constraints as part of this unit. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6. \u2047 I mentioned that adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.91 was up 90% versus the prior year. \u2047 The largest driver of our year-over-year growth was a significantly lower share count, mainly resulting from the N&B exchange offer. \u2047 The lower share count provided a $0."], "gold_summary": ["qtrly earnings per share from continuing operations $0.89; qtrly adjusted earnings per share $0.91.  \u2047  qtrly net sales $3.98 billion versus $3.67 billion.  \u2047  raises full year 2021 guidance for net sales, operating ebitda and adjusted eps.  \u2047  on a regional basis, organic sales growth in quarter was led by asia pacific more than offsetting declines in us & canada and emea.  \u2047  electronics & industrial reported a record quarter with net sales of $1.3 billion, up 17%.  \u2047  expect similar top-line trends continuing from q1 into q2 coupled with slight escalation in raw materials and logistics costs."],
