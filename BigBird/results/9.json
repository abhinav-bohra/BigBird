{"article": ["Additionally, David Bray, group president, poultry; Noelle O'Mara, group president, prepared foods; Shane Miller, group president, fresh meat; and Chris Langholz, group president, international, will join the live Q&A session. \u2047 Earlier today, we announced our first quarter fiscal 2022 results. \u2047 Tyson Foods once again delivered strong financial results. \u2047 At our Investor Day, I shared our plan to grow our top and bottom lines aggressively over the next three years. \u2047 This meant earnings per share growth of high single digits relative to a 2019 baseline and volume growth ahead of the market. \u2047 Our results this quarter put us firmly on that path. \u2047 We achieved double-digit sales and earnings growth, both of which were driven by ongoing demand strength, productivity savings, and improving execution across our segments. \u2047 Our diverse protein portfolio, omnichannel capabilities, leading brands, and value-added products contributed to our results. \u2047 Strong performance in our beef segment, earlier-than-expected recovery in prepared foods, and improvement in chicken and pork all supported strong earning results. \u2047 Our retail core business lines, which include our iconic brands, Tyson, Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, and Ball Park maintain their volume share position even as we work through price increases to address inflationary pressure. \u2047 And our foodservice Focus 6 product lines grew share year over year in broad-line distribution. \u2047 This growth was driven in large part by value-added chicken, which outperformed industry recovery and breakfast sausage where we were seeing improved fill rates. \u2047 Importantly, and despite the continued impact of COVID-19, our volumes improved slightly across the company relative to the same quarter last year. \u2047 Chicken was a bright spot, where we saw our volumes improved 3.6%. \u2047 While this is a good start, we are not where we want to be on volume. \u2047 So we're taking actions segment by segment to improve our volume performance. \u2047 These actions include investing in our team members, in additional capacity, and in brands and product innovation. \u2047 As discussed at Investor Day, we are also in the process of building 12 new plants. \u2047 Each of these is progressing and each will enable Tyson to address capacity constraints and meet the growing global demand for protein. \u2047 Bottom line, we're committed to improving our total company volumes during the year. \u2047 We're also making sure that our pricing incorporates inflationary cost pressures on our business. \u2047 In the quarter, our cost of goods sold was up 18% relative to the same period last year. \u2047 We are seeing higher costs across our supply chain, including higher input costs, such as feed and ingredients. \u2047 We're also managing the higher cost of labor, transportation due to strong demand and limited availability. \u2047 With these higher costs, we work closely with our customers to achieve a fair value for our products. \u2047 As a result, our average sales price for the quarter increased 19.6% relative to the same period last year. \u2047 This helped us capture some of the unrecovered costs due to the timing lag between inflation and price. \u2047 Finally, our balance sheet and overall liquidity position are strong, providing optionality to pursue strategic growth priorities and invest in growth across our portfolio. \u2047 We have a disciplined approach to deploying capital to support capacity expansion while achieving improved returns on invested capital. \u2047 Our first-quarter results clearly demonstrate that we are making progress on our growth objectives, that we remain focused on outpacing the overall market, improving operating margins, and driving strong returns for our shareholders. \u2047 While we're growing our business, we are mindful of our corporate responsibilities around environment, social, and governance goals. \u2047 For example, we committed to investing in and supporting our communities in rural America and around the world. \u2047 Last year, Tyson Foods donated more than 16 million pounds of protein, the equivalent of 64 million meals to fight hunger. \u2047 We're incredibly proud of this work and the people that make it possible. \u2047 Tyson is a great company with a great team doing great things, and I'm pleased that this was recognized just last week by Fortune Magazine, who announced that for the sixth year in a row, Tyson Foods was No. \u2047 1 in our sector in their rankings of the world's most admired companies. \u2047 Now let's look at a few financial highlights from the first quarter. \u2047 Our results included double-digit top and bottom-line growth. \u2047 We delivered solid operating income performance, up 40% for the quarter. \u2047 This performance was broad-based across segments where continued strong consumer demand and effective pricing to mitigate the impact of inflation drove higher earnings. \u2047 On volume, we are up slightly. \u2047 And while we're working to achieve optimal throughput across our segments, labor challenges are still impacting our volumes and the ability to achieve optimal mix across our network. \u2047 Compared to pre-pandemic levels, our volume performance is outpacing our peer set. \u2047 In retail, despite substantial market pressures, core business lines held share in the first quarter, led by strong performance in lunch meat, hotdogs, snacking, and bacon. \u2047 We also realized strong e-commerce results with Tyson Foods outpacing total food and beverage growth in our core lines gaining share in the quarter. \u2047 Still, customer demand continues to outpace our ability to supply products. \u2047 So we have targeted actions in each segment to improve volumes. \u2047 This is key to delivering on our commitments. \u2047 To realize our volume goals, we must be able to fully staff our plants across the company. \u2047 We continue to take meaningful action toward becoming the most sought-after place to work. \u2047 For example, we provided our hourly team members with more than $50 million in bonuses during the first quarter. \u2047 We are piloting subsidized and on-site child care and we are adjusting schedules to flex with workforce needs. \u2047 These actions are bearing fruit as we see some improvement on the labor front. \u2047 And while we have seen some labor challenges during the omicron surge, we are generally seeing lower turnover in absenteeism. \u2047 We saw chicken volumes grow 3.6% in the quarter, driven by strong fundamental demand and improved live production. \u2047 What is important to note is that we grew ahead of the market and gained market share. \u2047 In prepared foods, volumes were down 2.6% in the first quarter. \u2047 About half of the decline was related to pet treats divestiture. \u2047 We expect to sequentially improve these results over the remainder of fiscal year '22 as we take actions to expand and improve capacity utilization. \u2047 In beef, volumes were down 6.2%, driven by labor shortages previously mentioned. \u2047 In addition, port congestion has also dipped in export volumes in the segment. \u2047 We expect these headwinds on volume to normalize over the course of fiscal 2022. \u2047 In pork, we have sequentially improved our capacity utilization. \u2047 We are still working to optimize the mix. \u2047 In international/other, while we are starting from a relatively small base, our investment in capacity, innovation, and brands are supporting our market share growth objective. \u2047 Overall, we expect to grow our total company volumes by 2% to 3% in FY '22, outpacing protein consumption growth. \u2047 Chicken remains a top priority and we continue to execute against our road map to achieve an operating income margin of 5% to 7% on a run-rate basis by mid-fiscal '22. \u2047 I remain confident we will meet this goal. \u2047 In the first quarter, we've started to see profitability improvement resulting from our actions. \u2047 For example, we're investing aggressively in automation and technology to help us address some of the most hard-to-fill roles. \u2047 This is not a series of projects but is a well-planned program with automation designed to use common designs and equipment across our plants to optimize cost, maintenance, and asset utilization. \u2047 The second imperative is to improve operational performance and critical to improving performance is maximizing our fixed cost leverage, which means having enough furs to run our plants full. \u2047 Since September, we've seen an improvement in our hatch rate ahead of our expectations. \u2047 We continue to expect full recovery in this year. \u2047 We were pleased with our volume growth in the quarter and expect further improvements as we grow our harvest capacity utilization from an average of 37 million head per week in FY '21 to 40 million head per week by year end. \u2047 We've noted previously that strength in spot prices for commodity chicken products put our buy versus grow program at a relative disadvantage. \u2047 We have reduced our reliance on outside meat accordingly. \u2047 We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our volumes and be the best in the business. \u2047 The plan we have continues to be the right plan and our commitment to winning with our team members, winning with our customers and consumers, and winning with operational excellence is delivering results. \u2047 Last year, we announced the launch of a new productivity program designed to drive a better, faster, more agile organization that is supported by a culture of continuous improvement and faster decision-making. \u2047 The program aims to deliver $1 billion in recurring productivity savings by the end of fiscal '24 relative to a fiscal 2021 cost baseline and has three critical focus areas, which are operational and functional excellence, digital solutions, and automation. \u2047 We're making some good progress on this front. \u2047 I spoke just a minute ago about our investments in automation, but we've also attacked other issues. \u2047 In Prepared Foods, we're making use of supply chain, digitization, and advanced analytics. \u2047 Our digital manufacturing platform allows us to analyze real-time data to take actions to optimize process conditions that drive better yields, lower costs, consistent quality, and increased output. \u2047 In transportation and logistics, we have established ongoing optimization of the mix and allocation of our private fleet, dedicated fleet, and third-party fleet, mitigating inflationary pressures and supporting better on-time deliveries to our customers. \u2047 In addition, we continued the expansion of our direct shipment program, reducing miles driven, and product touches in our supply chain. \u2047 As a result of projects like these, we're on track to deliver $300 million to $400 million of savings in fiscal 2022. \u2047 We shared at our Investor Day that we are taking actions to accelerate our growth and drive disciplined return on invested capital. \u2047 The five imperatives on this slide show how we will achieve our commitments and drive value creation. \u2047 This starts first with our commitment to our team members with a focus on ensuring their health, safety, and well-being as well as ensuring an inclusive and equitable work environment. \u2047 We are proud of our COVID-19 vaccine policy implemented last year in the U.S. and of the broader investments that we have made to keep our team members, their families, and our communities safe. \u2047 Because of our policy, our team members are better protected and the cases we do see have been mild or asymptomatic, resulting in an extremely low number of hospitalizations. \u2047 We are strongly encouraging boosters and are hosting clinics to make it easier for our team members and their families to get boosted. \u2047 Second, we are working to enhance our portfolio and capacity to better address demand. \u2047 This includes increasing the contribution of branded and value-added sales. \u2047 As a result, we expect our volume to outpace this growing market. \u2047 Third, we are aggressively restoring competitiveness in our chicken segment. \u2047 This starts by returning our operating margin to the 5% to 7% level by the middle of fiscal 2022. \u2047 Fourth, we're driving operational and functional excellence and investing in digital and automation initiatives. \u2047 This is at the heart of our new productivity program. \u2047 We're working diligently to drive out waste, minimize bureaucracy and enhance decision-making speed across the organization. \u2047 Fifth, to address projected demand growth over the next decade, we are using our financial strength to invest in our business. \u2047 On capital alone, we're expected to invest $2 billion in fiscal year '22 with a disproportionate share focused on new capacity and automation objectives. \u2047 And we continue to return cash to shareholders. \u2047 During the quarter, we returned over $500 million in dividends and share repurchases. \u2047 To wrap it up, we are committed to winning with our team members, customers, and consumers as well as winning with operational excellence. \u2047 I'm more excited about the future of Tyson Foods with each passing day. \u2047 Let me turn first to a summary of our total company financial results. \u2047 We're pleased to report a strong overall start to the year. \u2047 Our sales were up approximately 24% in the first quarter, largely a function of our pricing initiatives to offset inflationary pressures. \u2047 Volumes were also up slightly, although impacted by continued labor challenges. \u2047 Looking at our sales results by channel, retail drove almost $350 million of top-line improvements versus last year. \u2047 Improvements in sales through the foodservice channel drove an increase of $1 billion and our export sales were nearly $333 million stronger than the prior-year period as we leveraged our global scale to grow our business. \u2047 First-quarter operating income of $1.4 billion was up 40% relative to the same quarter last year due to increased earnings in beef, pork, and chicken. \u2047 Driven by the strength in operating income, first-quarter earnings per share grew 48% to $2.87. \u2047 Higher operating income led to higher adjusted earnings per share compared to the same period last year. \u2047 And first-quarter earnings per share also benefited from lower net interest expense and taxes. \u2047 Slide 10 bridges year-to-date operating income, which was $407 million higher than fiscal 2021. \u2047 Volumes were up slightly during the year, primarily a result of improvement in chicken, pork, and international/other, offset by declines in beef and prepared foods. \u2047 Declines in beef and prepared foods were largely due to continued labor challenges in those segments. \u2047 Our pricing actions led to approximately $2.1 billion in sales and price/mix benefits during the quarter. \u2047 which offset the higher cost of goods sold of $1.6 billion. \u2047 We saw continued inflation across the business, in some instances, up 20% to 30%. \u2047 Notable examples were labor, grain costs, live cattle and hog costs, and freight costs. \u2047 And finally, SG&A was $88 million unfavorable to the same period last year, which was largely a result of cycling a $55 million benefit recorded last year for the recovery of cattle. \u2047 Moving to the beef segment. \u2047 Segment sales were more than $5 billion for the quarter, up 25% versus the same period last year. \u2047 Sales growth was driven by continued strong demand for beef products, which has supported higher average sales price. \u2047 Partially offsetting higher sales prices were higher capital costs during the first quarter versus the comparable prior-year period. \u2047 We had sufficient livestock available in the quarter driven by strong front-end supplies. \u2047 We have good visibility into cattle availability through fiscal year 2022 and continue to expect it will also be sufficient to support our customer needs."], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 adjusted earnings per share $2.87.  \u2047  q1 adjusted earnings per share $2.87.  \u2047  currently on track to achieve our
