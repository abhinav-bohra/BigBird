{"article": ["I hope everyone is staying healthy and safe. \u2047 Joining me on the call today is Walter Ulloa, chairman and chief executive officer; and Chris Young, chief financial officer. \u2047 We appreciate you joining us today for Entravision's fourth-quarter and 2020 earnings call. \u2047 Entravision had a very strong fourth quarter. \u2047 As a result, we are well positioned for growth in the first quarter and full-year 2021. \u2047 Beginning with the top line, revenues for the quarter totaled $171.7 million, up 142% year over year and 173% sequentially. \u2047 On a pro forma basis, including Cisneros Interactive, revenues improved 51% over the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 Our digital segment performed well due in large part to our acquisition of Cisneros Interactive. \u2047 While I will speak to the digital segment in further detail shortly, we are particularly pleased with our performance of Cisneros Interactive led by Victor Kong. \u2047 Cisneros Interactive continues to be additive to our cash flow and EBITDA, and we have the utmost confidence that they will successfully execute their business plan in 2021. \u2047 As highlighted last quarter, political ad sales were all a strong driver of our fourth-quarter revenues. \u2047 In total, political advertising revenue for the fourth quarter was $14.2 million, surpassing our prior record set in the fourth quarter of 2012. \u2047 Excluding political ad sales, and including Cisneros Interactive on a pro forma basis, revenue increased by 39% in the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $32.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 195% compared to $11.1 million in the prior year period. \u2047 On a pro forma basis, EBITDA increased 159% in 2020 versus 2019. \u2047 Moving beyond the fourth quarter and turning to the full-year results. \u2047 For 2020, revenues totaled $344 million, up 26% over 2019. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $60.4 million for full-year 2020 as compared to $41.2 million in 2019 or a 47% EBITDA growth in 2020 versus 2019. \u2047 We entered 2021 primed for growth. \u2047 With the onset of COVID-19, we made a number of expense cuts in anticipation of a prolonged economic impact from the virus. \u2047 Fortunately, due in part to these proactive reductions in our SG&A, our business continued to grow quarter over quarter. \u2047 As a result, we were able to reinstate certain expenses back in the business, namely employee salaries. \u2047 I could not be prouder of the team we have assembled at Entravision. \u2047 Their commitment to both our clients and our company this past year never wavered. \u2047 I was pleased to be able to reinstate our well-deserved employee salaries to the pre-COVID-19 levels. \u2047 Even though salary expenses have been reinstated, the rest of our expense cuts remain in place, and we will continue to operate as a leaner, more efficient business, with strong free cash flow generation. \u2047 As Chris Young, our CFO, will discuss shortly, in Q4, we more than doubled our prior record of free cash flow set in the second quarter of 2006. \u2047 This strong cash flow generation should help offset some of the revenue loss from the lack of political ad sales in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 With that as a background, let's turn to our three operating segments in further detail. \u2047 Our television division generated revenues of $50.5 million for the quarter, up 37% compared to the prior year and up 34% sequentially. \u2047 Breaking this down further, television advertising and multicast revenue was up 48% over the prior year fourth quarter, while retransmission consent revenues were up 1% year over year. \u2047 Excluding political spend, our core television revenues increased by 10%, with television political revenues totaling $11.1 million in the quarter versus the nonmaterial amount of political revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 Excluding political revenue, national advertising revenues were up 20% driven mainly by Tier 2 automotive and healthcare, while local advertising revenues, excluding political, were up 2% driven by legal services and healthcare. \u2047 On a full-year basis, television revenues totaled $154.5 million, up 3% year over year. \u2047 Excluding political ad sales, core television revenues for 2020 were $131.9 million, a decrease of 12% over full-year 2019. \u2047 Turning to our top 10 television ad categories. \u2047 Although several advertising categories did see year-over-year revenue declines, many experienced improvements sequentially, another indication that our business continues on an upward trend. \u2047 Auto, our largest television ad category, increased 3% year over year, but improved 28% from Q3 2020. \u2047 Services, our second largest advertising category, was up 17% compared to the prior year period. \u2047 Health care, our third largest category, was up 26% over the prior year and also improved 102% sequentially. \u2047 Media was up 22% year over year and up 26% sequentially. \u2047 Retail, while still down 21% year over year, posted a strong gain sequentially of 60%. \u2047 Next, let's discuss our television ratings performance for the quarter. \u2047 Our Univision television affiliates built upon their market leadership in November 2020. \u2047 For adults 18 to 49 in early local news, our Univision television stations finished ahead of or tied their Telemundo competitor in 11 of 17 markets where we have head-to-head competition. \u2047 In late local news, we finished ahead of or tied Telemundo competitors in 10 markets among the 17 markets where we have head-to-head competition. \u2047 Additionally, our early local news ranked No. \u2047 1 or 2 against English and Spanish language television competitors in nine markets, and we built up audience levels from the 15-minute lead-in in eight markets. \u2047 Our late local newscasts ranked No. \u2047 1 or 2 against English and Spanish language television competitors in six markets. \u2047 Our local news teams reported the latest on the COVID-19 pandemic and an unprecedented election year. \u2047 During the full week, our Univision and UniM\u00e1s television stations combined have a cumulative audience of 3.8 million persons of two plus in our markets combined compared to Telemundo's 3.1 million persons two plus. \u2047 We have 22% more viewers than Telemundo in our television footprint. \u2047 During weekday primetime, when comparing to all stations in total, we had a higher ratings than at least one of the big four networks in nine markets among adults 18 to 49 and 10 markets among adults 18 to 34. \u2047 Telecast for Univision's Latin GRAMMY Awards show on November 19 was among the top 10 broadcast television primetime programs for the night among adults 18 to 49 and adults 25 to 54 in 13 markets. \u2047 Among adults 18 to 34, the show ranked among the top 10 in 15 markets. \u2047 Our sales teams did a remarkable job selling the Latin GRAMMYS, setting a revenue record for this signature TV special, with revenues up 25% over 2019. \u2047 Now, let's turn to our audio operating segment. \u2047 Audio revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $16.2 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year period and up 41% sequentially. \u2047 Local audio revenues decreased 3% over the prior year fourth quarter, while national revenues were up 51% over prior year, largely bolstered by political ad sales. \u2047 Excluding political spend, core radio revenues declined 5% versus the prior year fourth quarter, with political revenues totaling $3 million in the quarter versus a nonmaterial amount of political revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 Excluding political spend, national advertising revenues were up 8% driven by the service category, while local advertising revenues were down 11% in our audio unit as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 On a full-year basis, audio revenues totaled $46.3 million, down 16% year over year. \u2047 Excluding political ad sales, core audio revenues for 2020 were down 26% over full-year 2019. \u2047 The 12 markets where we subscribe to Miller Kaplan data, we outperformed the market by 34.6 points in total revenue combined. \u2047 We outperformed the total market in 11 out of the 12 markets where we subscribe to Miller Kaplan. \u2047 Turning to radio advertising categories. \u2047 Services, our largest category, representing 26% of our total audio revenue, improved 31% over the prior year fourth-quarter period. \u2047 Legal services, including those related to immigration as well as government messaging regarding COVID-19 safety, continue to represent a large portion of the services add in this past quarter. \u2047 Auto, our second largest advertising category, declined 28% for the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of '19, but was up 49% sequentially. \u2047 Auto repair advertising was up a healthy 34% year over year as was grocery store advertising, which improved 3% over the prior year period. \u2047 We also saw increases in the product brand and paid programming categories. \u2047 The remaining top 10 advertising categories were all down year over year in the fourth quarter, with the exception of political ads, where revenues totaled $3 million in the fourth quarter compared to an immaterial amount in the prior year period. \u2047 Of particular note, during the quarter, we announced the launch of our new streaming destination, El Bot\u00f3n. \u2047 Listeners can now stream their favorite Entravision radio shows and stations directly on their mobile phones or desktops. \u2047 We are positioning El Bot\u00f3n as a hub to direct our audiences across different genres, while also aggregating content to provide our listeners a seamless search and discovery experience. \u2047 The addition of digitally streaming content to our radio offering fits with Entravision's overall positioning as an omnichannel audio solutions expert. \u2047 The firm deployment of our podcast offering, mobile app presence and first-party data subscription services are also part of Entravision's vision. \u2047 On this front, it is important to note that our recent investment in the digital space includes the acquisition of a controlling stake of Audio. \u2047 Ad, the strongest audio network and digital audio publisher platform in Latin America. \u2047 This investment enhances our proprietary Audio. \u2047 Ad network AudioEngage, currently serving the U.S. Latino market. \u2047 In addition, with the Super Bowl just a month ago, Entravision has now completed its fifth season as the NFL's exclusive nationwide Spanish language radio broadcaster. \u2047 The NFL has been an exceptional partner, and we look forward to continuing to share their programming with our radio listenership. \u2047 Looking at our audio division ratings performance for fall 2020, among the Spanish language radio stations, the Erazno y La Chokolata show is ranked No. \u2047 1 in nine out of 14 markets, including Los Angeles, released for fall among Hispanic adults 18 to 49, including ties; and No. \u2047 1 in 11 markets, including Los Angeles, among Hispanic adults 25 to 54. \u2047 Across our 14 O&O radio stations, the Erazno y La Chokolata show reached more than 608,000 Hispanics 18 to 49 in the fall 2020 survey. \u2047 For fall 2020, Piolin ranked as the No. \u2047 1 or 2 Spanish language midday show, including Los Angeles, in 10 out of our 13 markets released among Hispanic adults 18 to 49, including ties. \u2047 El Show de El Genio Lucas was No. \u2047 1 or 2 among Spanish language radio stations in eight out of our 11 El Genio markets among Hispanic adults 18 to 49 and Hispanic adults 25 to 54. \u2047 In Entravision's audio markets, the Hispanic list is recovering at a faster rate than the total market average. \u2047 All 2020 Hispanic adults 18 to 49 weekly reach was at 95% of 2019 levels, while fall 2020 reach for total adults 18 to 49 was at 91% of 2019 levels. \u2047 Now, moving on to digital. \u2047 Our third and final operating segment is digital. \u2047 Digital revenues totaled $105 million for the fourth-quarter 2020, a substantial increase of 424% as compared to the prior year period. \u2047 Sequentially, digital revenues improved 669%. \u2047 On a pro forma basis for Cisneros Interactive, digital revenue increased 67% compared to the prior year period. \u2047 On a quarterly basis, digital revenues surpassed that of our television segment. \u2047 On a full-year basis, digital revenues totaled $143.3 million, an increase of 108% compared to 2019. \u2047 Throughout the past year, we made a number of strategic moves aimed at furthering Entravision's digital segment by building a portfolio of exceptional digital service offerings with creative and programmatic capabilities that meet our clients' needs around the globe. \u2047 First, in May, we brought our digital capabilities together through the launch of Entravision Interactive, which provides advertisers and agencies a single source to engage consumers globally. \u2047 Then in October, we announced our strategic majority investment in Cisneros Interactive. \u2047 Through our majority investment in Cisneros Interactive, we represent the strongest global audience in ad tech platforms such as Facebook, Spotify and LinkedIn across Latin America. \u2047 Last, but not least, in November, we announced the appointment of Juan Saldivar as our new chief digital strategy and accountability officer. \u2047 Juan has over two decades of experience in media, marketing, technology, venture capital and e-commerce industries as a result of working for Bertelsmann in Germany, Spain and Mexico and as Executive Director of Televisa's digital interactive for 7 years. \u2047 Juan has been a member of our board since 2014, and he and his team were instrumental in the acquisition of Cisneros Interactive and its integration into Entravision. \u2047 Prior to Juan's appointment, we did not have a single leader running all of our digital business units. \u2047 With Juan, a fluent Spanish speaker at the helm of our U.S. and global digital businesses, we expect to be able to grow our solutions, technology and talent pool that serve today more than 4,000 clients in 21 countries. \u2047 Entravision believes it is critical to understand, participate and build technology to serve the programmatic advertising space. \u2047 On this front, Smadex, our Barcelona-based machine learning DSP platform with proprietary technology has continued to grow and serve the most demanding clients in the gaming, mobile performance and app space by matching the strongest transparency, contextual demographic features and performance standards. \u2047 Due to the impact of COVID-19, digital platform usage has increasingly increased all over the world and specifically in Latin America, where it has accelerated Internet adoption and penetration. \u2047 Digital video is also a core pillar within our digital and interactive strategy. \u2047 Our video network continues to expand and close exclusive connections with Tier 1 publishers. \u2047 In 2021, Entravision will continue exploring the most prominent growth markets around the globe as it deploys its digital services and considers strategic and complementary investments and acquisitions. \u2047 Overall,"], "gold_summary": ["entravision communications corp - expects to file form 12b-25
