{"article": ["Neil, you may begin. \u2047 Before turning it over to Ash to provide some further details on our recent capital raise, the newly amended credit facility and what we are seeing in our portfolio year-to-date and through the first quarter. \u2047 The conclusion of the fourth quarter closes the most challenging year in Hersha's history. \u2047 And our above property team members, many here in our offices today, enabled us to remain nimble, make prudent decisions and execute multiple levers to provide financial flexibility for the foreseeable future. \u2047 Jay, Ash and I stand it out on our team shoulders as we share some good news today. \u2047 We begin 2021 with optimism toward the recovery as the rollout of vaccinations gains momentum and more and more people choose to travel. \u2047 January started off stronger than we anticipated for our portfolio returning to greater than $60 RevPAR with South Florida and Washington DC offsetting lock downs on the West Coast and the Northeast. \u2047 We had our first month of hotel level positive EBITDA in January, and we are encouraged with February performance to date. \u2047 The booking pace for President's Day weekend across the portfolio was the strongest since the pandemic one year ago. \u2047 We agree that leisure demand aided by continued government stimulus will again come first, but with significantly more pent-up demand than was actualized last summer. \u2047 We are also encouraged by data from the airlines. \u2047 Most corporate accounts anticipate returning to at least 50% of pre-COVID travel by the end of 2021 and more than 40% of these accounts expect a full recovery in corporate travel by 2022. \u2047 The return of leisure travel will kick-start this year's recovery to be sure, but the industry should see meaningful acceleration with the return of business travel, which we believe could begin as early as the second quarter and ramp up through the back half of the year. \u2047 Drive-to resorts have been our strongest performers since the inception of the pandemic. \u2047 This portfolio of hotels is about 25% of our pre-pandemic EBITDA, had a weighted average occupancy nearing 40% and realized ADR growth of 2% for the full year 2020. \u2047 Government mandated shutdowns in California impacted performance in December and January for our coastal California properties, but we are seeing immediate improvement in February with the lifting of these restrictions. \u2047 Not only have leisure travelers returned, but we are also seeing early signs of business and small group activity. \u2047 New corporate accounts for near-term projects and deposits for spring and fall weddings are building a base at the Sanctuary Beach Resort and Hotel Milo. \u2047 Across the country in Key West the Parrot Key Hotel and Villas was our best performing asset during the fourth quarter, generating 55% occupancy and 8.4% year-over-year ADR growth to $306 for the period. \u2047 The holiday weeks were especially strong, most notably the period between Christmas and New Year's which had greater than 90% occupancy and saw ADR exceed 2019 levels at the hotel. \u2047 We are expecting several strong quarters ahead at this exceptionally positioned resort. \u2047 Our largest asset the Cadillac Hotel and Beach Club on Miami Beach is seeing increased demand on weekends entering special events, generating occupancies approximating 90% with rate on pace to improve incrementally throughout the balance of the quarter. \u2047 Momentum has been has been building year-to-date in Miami from leisure demand, and recent announcements around major corporate relocations highlight the tremendous draw to the region, which leaves us optimistic for this year's recovery and substantial market growth for years to come. \u2047 Urban destinations were essentially shut down from March to September of last year and then again from November through January. \u2047 We believe that the reopening of museums, national parks, theaters, sports venues and more bars and restaurants in the coming months will lead to a pickup in both pent up leisure and business demand to our great cities. \u2047 As travel begins to resume, which we have already seen in warmer climates such as South Florida and even at our lifestyle hotels up north over President's Day weekend, our unique portfolio provides us multiple levers to capture market share while continuing to operate in a cost-efficient manner as occupancy builds toward normalization. \u2047 Washington DC has been a very strong performing market, despite the significantly abbreviated inauguration activity. \u2047 Although the public was unable to attend the event the St Gregory Hotel contracted with media outlets including CBS, BBC and Al Jazeera. \u2047 The Hilton Garden Inn, M Street and the Hampton Inn Mason serve the men and women of the National Guard who were deployed to the city leading up to and through the event. \u2047 The Ritz Carlton Georgetown was able to hold a $1,000 ADR for the peak nights for the few leisure guests in town. \u2047 Washington has begun 2021 on strong footing ending January with portfolio revenues more than double our expectations at the beginning of the month. \u2047 The new presidential administration is expected to lead through a pickup in activity among the lobbying, federal government and diplomatic segments, and we are also looking forward to the upcoming Cherry Blossom Festival in the coming quarter. \u2047 One of our better performing markets during the fourth quarter from our forecast perspective was our New York City portfolio, finishing the quarter with close to 40% occupancy, which came in spite of having few leisure oriented attractions open in the city. \u2047 We continue to see strong performance from our JFK submarket, but also saw an uptick in first responder business at our Brooklyn and lower Manhattan asset. \u2047 These customers, the New York Fire and Police Departments and a few medical groups continue to get rest at the new hotel Brooklyn and the Hampton Inn Seaport resulting in January occupancy of 97% and 51% respectively. \u2047 Although this business is transitory and related to the ongoing COVID-19 spread we are grateful that these frontline workers are able to utilize our hotels to stay safe and guide us through this homestretch of this pandemic. \u2047 Urban market recovery is not only driven by vaccine distribution and the return of business and international travel, but as meaningfully enhanced with reductions or deterioration of supply. \u2047 In markets around the country aging hotels are being rendered obsolete the Wardman Park in D.C, the Embassy Suites in Philadelphia, the Buckminster in Boston. \u2047 New York more than anywhere else consultants of forecasted an array of figures regarding the permanent supply reduction in New York. \u2047 It may not actualize as high as 25% as some of predicted, but the confirmed closures in 2020 alone provide a concrete realism that the supply will contract. \u2047 Adding to this is the newly announced proposal requiring special permits for new hotels and expansions in zoning districts throughout the city by the Department of Planning. \u2047 Public hearings on this proposal have commenced, and if passed will materially impact hotel construction across the five boroughs and provide a significant tailwind for hotel owners for years to come. \u2047 Before Ash takes a deeper dive into our balance sheet and burn rates, I want to spend a few minutes on our capital allocation strategy and sources of additional liquidity. \u2047 As we've outlined on our previous earnings calls, dispositions represented the lowest cost of capital as we considered alternatives to raise liquidity and increase our financial flexibility. \u2047 We ran wide and robust marketing processes with multiple brokers beginning this fall. \u2047 Our strong locations in major gateway markets attracted tremendous interest from private equity firms, family offices and residential developers. \u2047 These were fee-simple hotels that have remained open throughout the pandemic unencumbered of management and onerous labor contracts, many were unencumbered of brand, all of which made the bidding process quite competitive. \u2047 Our goal is to generate $150 million to $200 million in proceeds from asset sales to pay down our senior credit facility. \u2047 The 6 recently announced asset sales will generate net proceeds of approximately $191 million. \u2047 The Sheraton Wilmington closed in December while the Courtyard San Diego closed last week. \u2047 The residents in Coconut Grove, Capitol Hill Hotel Washington and Holiday Inn Express Cambridge are all expected to close by the end of the first quarter, while the sale of the Duane Street Hotel is slated to close in early Q2. \u2047 Many of these hotels represented those with capital intensive projects on the horizon and the successful completion of these sales will lower our capex budget by approximately $20 million over the coming years. \u2047 As part of a long-term capital recycling strategy, the dispositions achieve liquidity and flexibility at a reasonable cost. \u2047 We transacted at a discount to pre-COVID value, but we focused our sales on mature hotels, hotels that we don't for nearly 10 years, hotels that would require additional capital investment during the recovery, and the slowest growth hotel in each of our geographic clusters. \u2047 The successful sale of these hotels marginally improves the absolute RevPAR and EBITDA per key of the remaining portfolio, but meaningfully enhance this portfolio quality, EBITDA growth rate and reduces capex spending and disruption at these assets in the recovery. \u2047 We were also pleased to announce last week and fund just yesterday our strategic financial commitment with affiliates of Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank providing a $150 million unsecured term loan, which can be expanded to $200 million. \u2047 This capital infusion in conjunction with asset sales led to the successful amendment of our credit facility, extending our covenant waiver until June 2022 and eliminating term loan maturities in 2021. \u2047 We are pleased to have cleared the runway and provided the financial flexibility to focus on the ramp up of our portfolio in the coming year. \u2047 As we've discussed on prior calls and in investor meetings, we've been steadfast in our approach to capital allocation. \u2047 Considering the cash flow profile and liquidity of our assets and the upcoming recovery and travel and lodging, we were loads to pursue a transaction that would be unnecessarily dilutive to shareholders or constrain our strategic alternatives in the future. \u2047 For this capital raise, we ran a fulsome process. \u2047 We were delighted with the depth and quality of investors interested in financing our portfolio and look forward to future transactions with many of them. \u2047 Ultimately, the Goldman Merchant Bank offered the prepayment flexibility to draw and pick features and importantly the potential for future partnership in the coming cycle. \u2047 As we navigate through the tail end of the crisis and into the recovery we remain bullish on our portfolio positions in the markets where we operate, innovation oriented urban gateway markets and regional resorts, a short drive away from them. \u2047 2020 showcase the allure of drive-to resorts for all segments of the traveler, and we believe this trend will not go away soon, but we remind investors that innovation markets provided strong results prior to the pandemic, and these markets have the most to recover with the rollout of the vaccine. \u2047 Since the pandemic Facebook and Google have expanded office space near our hotels on Manhattan's West side and our Tribeca, Union Square and Midtown East hotels will all have major new office developments opening in the coming years. \u2047 Amazon announcing the addition of 3,000 jobs in the Boston Seaport, walking distance from our Envoy Hotel. \u2047 Our Courtyard LA is well positioned in Culver City for the booming tech and studio related office growth[Indecipherable]. \u2047 Philadelphia has attracted several new life science and pharma companies downtown in state-of-the-art new space. \u2047 Even our locations in Miami are attracting new Class A office space, in Coconut Grove and on Miami Beach as there is increasing momentum from Northeastern asset management firms and West Coast technology firms. \u2047 All of this proving out the corporate expansion remains intact and will add to the already robust demand generators in our gateway markets, particularly for our carefully assembled submarkets and locations. \u2047 Our disposition announcements this year should also reinforce the high quality nature of our portfolio. \u2047 Our hotels are precisely the kind of hotel sophisticated investors seek. \u2047 Our hotels have a high absolute RevPAR, while still producing sector-leading margins. \u2047 The hotels are young and purpose-built for today's traveler with minimal capex requirements for the foreseeable future. \u2047 Our hotels are fee simple and have prepayable financing and have few management or brand encumbrances all located in the most valuable markets in the United States. \u2047 Our portfolio has proven to be attractive to a vast buyer pool and still offers incredible operational and financial leverage to this recovery. \u2047 And with the increased financial flexibility from our capital infusion and no near-term encumbrances following our credit facility amendment, we are able to focus on capturing market share and operating our hotels in a cost-efficient manner to drive cash flow. \u2047 As Neil mentioned, I'm going to do a deeper dive on our recently announced capital transactions, bank amendment, and their impact on our balance sheet and interest expense before closing with an update on our operating results and current outlook. \u2047 Last week, we announced a strategic financing commitment with affiliates of Goldman Sachs Merchant Bank to provide a $150 million in unsecured notes, which can be upsized to $200 million at any point on or before September 30th of this year with a maturity date on the notes of February of 2026. \u2047 We successfully closed on this financing yesterday and look forward to furthering our partnership with GS's Merchant Bank. \u2047 When we began our capital raising process earlier this year to provide us additional liquidity and optionality we prioritize two items, capital that was not dilutive to our equity and significant prepayment flexibility, and this bespoke solutions satisfied both of these key criteria and several others that we had prioritized. \u2047 This capital is unsecured and fully subordinated to our bank facility and allows us to defer cash interest on 50% of our financing for the first year, creating substantial near-term cash savings and providing us additional runway during this period of recovery. \u2047 This capital does not prohibit supplementary junior capital and allows us additional unsecured debt as long as we maintain compliance with certain incurrence test. \u2047 These unsecured notes do not place any further restrictions on our ability to operate the business or enter into strategic ventures that may be available to us. \u2047 Last week, we also highlighted that we went under contract to sell two additional hotels, bringing our year-to-date total asset value of disposition to $178.5 million. \u2047 The successful closing closing of these sales in addition to the Sheraton Wilmington, which closed in December and the Duane Street Hotel, which is expected to close during the second quarter will generate total proceeds of $216 million, and following the repayment of the $25 million mortgage loan on the Capitol Hill Hotel net proceeds from these dispositions will amount to approximately $191 million, which we will utilize in tandem with the proceeds from our unsecured notes to pay off our 2021 term loan and reduce our overall debt by approximately $150 million. \u2047 With the resulting reduction of overall leverage and the payment in current feature of our unsecured notes we estimate that our cash interest expense will decrease by approximately $4 million in 2021, and that our total interest expense including the deferred interest from the notes will remain similar to our 2020 interest expense. \u2047 We completed these asset sales and closed on the unsecured notes placement contemporaneously with the amendment of our revolving credit facility, and we're very pleased with the continued support from our consortium of over"], "gold_summary": ["will forego providing full-year 2021 guidance at this time.  \u2047  completed full year and q4 2020 with
