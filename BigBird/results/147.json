{"article": ["Carter's is making good progress, recovering from the market disruption caused by the pandemic. \u2047 We achieved a record gross profit margin in the quarter with improved price realization and fewer and better promotions. \u2047 We reduced our spending and inventories below prior year levels. \u2047 We also strengthened cash flow and liquidity in the quarter and gained market share. \u2047 With respect to business trends, we got off to a good start in July with sales running more than 90% of prior year sales. \u2047 We had substantially all of our stores opened heading into the 4th of July weekend and retail sales over that holiday shopping period comped up 7%. \u2047 In August, we saw sales trend to about 87% of prior year sales as schools delayed reopening. \u2047 With children starting their school year learning virtually at home, there was less of a need to shop for back-to-school outfits. \u2047 September was the largest month so far this year in sales and earnings contribution. \u2047 September sales ramped up to 95% of prior year sales. \u2047 That's the best performance we've seen since the pandemic began to impact us in March. \u2047 Our Labor Day holiday sales were the strongest in the past three years, with comparable retail sales up 15% during that shopping period. \u2047 And in October, sales are trending over 90% of prior year sales. \u2047 With respect to product performance, we continue to see good demand for our baby apparel and sleepwear product offerings. \u2047 Our baby apparel and sleepwear contributed about 70% of our total apparel sales. \u2047 We own five times the share of our nearest competitors in each of these product markets. \u2047 Our playwear sales improved in July as families prepared for the beginning of a new school year. \u2047 Sales dipped in August when it became clear that schools would not reopen and then rebounded in September as consumers shopped for cooler weather outfitting. \u2047 We launched our Little Baby Basics product offering in late June to coincide with the store reopenings. \u2047 This is the core of our baby product offerings and the best-selling newborn apparel in the United States. \u2047 It's a high-margin replenishment program and one of our strongest performing launches in recent years. \u2047 Replenishment trends since the launch are much better than last year. \u2047 In the third quarter, our retail sales improved to 97% of third quarter sales last year. \u2047 That's the strongest recovery in sales relative to our Wholesale and International segments. \u2047 Understandably, the pandemic has accelerated the shift to online purchases. \u2047 With fewer store visits, we reduced our hours of store operations by over 20% in the quarter. \u2047 On a per hour basis, our store sales were better than last year. \u2047 Though store traffic was lower, we saw higher conversion rates and higher units purchased per transaction. \u2047 We believe those better metrics reflect the strength of our product offerings, our compelling value proposition and a high service level provided by our store associates. \u2047 Our stores that historically benefited from tourism, including international guests, saw the largest decline in traffic. \u2047 These stores only represent about 11% of our U.S. stores, but drove about 40% of the decline in comparable sales in the quarter. \u2047 Until tourism and cross-border travel resume to pre-pandemic levels, these stores will likely underperform our other stores. \u2047 Given the mix and level of eCommerce inventories, we were less promotional than last year. \u2047 And as a result, we significantly improved price realization and eCommerce profitability in the quarter. \u2047 Similar to our store experience, online demand from international customers continues to trend lower than last year. \u2047 The biggest declines in demand were from Brazil, Argentina and Europe. \u2047 Historically, these were three of our best sources of international demand on our U.S. websites. \u2047 These markets were particularly hard hit by the pandemic and stronger dollar. \u2047 We continue to benefit from significant investments made in recent years in our online shopping experience. \u2047 In the third quarter, our stores fulfilled 24% of our eCommerce orders. \u2047 We've invested in technology that helps us optimize the profitability and speed of delivering those purchases. \u2047 To improve the convenience of shopping with us, we now offer same-day pickup and curbside pickup services in over 600 of our stores in the United States. \u2047 These new omni-channel services are margin accretive relative to shipping from our distribution center to the consumer's home. \u2047 Our omni-channel customers, those who enjoy both the online and in-store experience, are our highest value customers with annual spending more than twice that of our single-channel customer. \u2047 Going forward, we expect our stores will play an important role supporting our eCommerce customers. \u2047 Currently, about 85% of our stores in the United States are located in open air centers, which we believe gives us an advantage relative to our mall-based competitors. \u2047 Open Air centers provide a better, more convenient experience for same-day pickup and curbside pickup of online purchases. \u2047 We plan to continue opening stores located in more densely populated areas and plan to close stores in more remote and declining centers. \u2047 We currently plan to open less than 100 co-branded stores over the next five years. \u2047 We also plan to close about 25% of our stores as leases expire. \u2047 Nearly 60% of those closures may occur by the end of next year. \u2047 80% of those closures are planned by the end of 2022. \u2047 These are generally older, lower margin stores in declining centers and less likely to support our focus on high-value omni-channel customers. \u2047 Carter's is an attractive tenant. \u2047 Our brands are viewed as traffic drivers and bring families with young children into the shopping centers. \u2047 As other retailers struggle and downsize, new and more attractive real estate opportunities become available to us. \u2047 It's a buyer's market, and we plan to pursue those better opportunities in better centers that provide convenience for our consumers and a high-return on investment for our shareholders. \u2047 Our Wholesale business also showed good progress recovering from store closures earlier this year. \u2047 Sales in the third quarter were about 86% of prior year sales. \u2047 The operating margin on those sales was better than last year. \u2047 In the third quarter, we had growth with three of our top-five wholesale customers. \u2047 We continue to see good growth with our exclusive brands with sales collectively up 10%. \u2047 E-commerce demand for our brands through our wholesale customers was up over 40% in the third quarter, including triple-digit growth rates with some of our exclusive brands. \u2047 The trend in online demand improved each month in the quarter. \u2047 Together with our wholesale customers, the online purchases of our brands is up over 50% year-to-date. \u2047 Within the next few weeks, we expect to achieve a new milestone for our company with annual online purchases of our brands exceeding $1 billion this year. \u2047 Our Carter's brand wholesale sales were down about 25% in the quarter, driven by retailers cautiously planning for second half sales and our decision earlier this year to curtail fall and holiday inventory commitments. \u2047 Generally speaking, most of our wholesale customers are lean on inventories, seeing better sell-throughs, higher margins and in a chase mode, given better-than-expected demand for our brands. \u2047 Given the pandemic-related uncertainty in consumer demand, we believe operating with leaner inventories is a better strategy through the balance of this year, even if it comes at the expense of fewer sales. \u2047 Our decision to run lean around inventories may impact second half wholesale sales by as much as $50 million or less than 3% of our total second half sales. \u2047 One benefit of running leaner on inventories this year is fewer low-margin sales to off-price retailers. \u2047 Our sales to off-price retailers were down 18% in the quarter and down over 50% year-to-date. \u2047 We use our stores and websites in the United States and Canada to sell through excess inventories which were caused by store closures and related wholesale order cancellations earlier this year. \u2047 As a result, we offer consumers a compelling value through our stores and websites and avoided losses that would have been incurred, selling the excess inventory to off-price retailers. \u2047 International sales in the quarter were about 90% of last year's sales and contributed over 13% of our total company sales, which is comparable to last year. \u2047 The strength of our International segment is in our direct-to-consumer business, which represented over two-thirds of our international sales in the quarter. \u2047 We saw high single-digit growth in our retail sales, driven by a nearly 70% increase in eCommerce sales in Canada and Mexico. \u2047 Many of our international wholesale relationships are with several smaller retailers, representing our brands throughout the world. \u2047 These retailers have historically been a good source of sales and profitability. \u2047 They've been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, stronger dollar and other local market challenges. \u2047 We currently expect that sales to these wholesale customers will be the slowest to recover from the global pandemic. \u2047 Just for context, these customers contributed less than 2% of our company's annual sales in 2019. \u2047 We expect a better recovery with our multinational retailers, including Walmart, Costco and Amazon. \u2047 Amazon is seeing good performance from its expansion of our Simple Joys brand in Europe this past year. \u2047 That should be a good source of growth for us in the years ahead. \u2047 With respect to our supply chain, our team did an excellent job working with our suppliers to reduce our exposure to excess inventories. \u2047 Inventories at the end of September were down over 10% compared to last year. \u2047 As we shared with you in July, we're seeing delays in the receipt of products from Asia. \u2047 We believe those delays were caused by reduced capacity by carriers earlier this year when demand slowed due to store closures. \u2047 The delays also reflect inadequate capacity to support the surge in demand when stores reopened this summer and the precautions being taken to keep manufacturing and transportation workers protected from the coronavirus. \u2047 They have been very supportive and recognize that the delays are a function of the market disruption. \u2047 As we head into the holidays, the flow of products has improved, and we do not expect shipping delays to have a material impact on fourth quarter sales. \u2047 We're also managing the exposure to freight surcharges imposed by inbound and outbound carriers due to the surge in eCommerce sales and constrained capacity. \u2047 Our best analysis suggests these surcharges may impact fourth quarter earnings by about $2 million. \u2047 With lower input costs and excess manufacturing capacity in Asia, our supply chain team has negotiated lower product costs for spring 2021. \u2047 Demand for that product offering is planned comparable to last year, and the related shipments began later this quarter. \u2047 In summary, we're making good progress recovering from the disruption caused by the pandemic. \u2047 We've endured a historically challenging market this past year with the unprecedented scope and duration of store closures, record unemployment and a highly contagious and deadly virus. \u2047 We expect the road ahead will be bumpy. \u2047 That said, we believe we have a strong product offering and good marketing plans as we head into the final weeks of the year. \u2047 No one knows how long the market disruption will last. \u2047 What we do know is that the fundamental strength of our brands and business model should help us continue to weather the storm. \u2047 We own the largest share of the young children's apparel markets in the United States and Canada with twice the share of our nearest competitors. \u2047 Children's apparel is a less discretionary purchase. \u2047 We focus on essential core products bought in multiple quantities on a frequent basis in those early years of a child's life. \u2047 Our average price points are less than $10, providing a great value to consumers in a weaker economic environment. \u2047 We are the largest supplier of children's apparel to the largest retailers in the United States. \u2047 We are also the largest young children's apparel specialty retailer with one of the strongest and most profitable eCommerce platforms in children's apparel. \u2047 I'm grateful for their commitment to strengthen our brands and to serve the needs of families with young children. \u2047 Over the next few months, we will refresh our growth plans based on our experiences this year. \u2047 Based on our current estimates, we are planning good growth in sales and earnings next year. \u2047 I'll begin on Page 2 with our GAAP income statement for the third quarter. \u2047 As Mike noted, our third quarter results were meaningfully better than we had planned. \u2047 Net sales in the quarter were $865 million, down 8% from last year. \u2047 Reported operating income was $114 million, an increase of 35%. \u2047 And reported earnings per share was $1.85 compared to $1.34 a year ago, representing growth of 38%. \u2047 Our third quarter and year-to-date results for both 2020 and 2019 contained unusual items, which we've detailed on Page 3. \u2047 We've treated these items as non-GAAP adjustments to our reported results to enable greater comparability. \u2047 My remarks today will speak to our results on an adjusted basis, which excludes these unusual items. \u2047 Moving to Page 4 and our adjusted P&L for the third quarter. \u2047 Net sales declined 8% to $865 million, which is a meaningful improvement over the 30% decline we saw in the second quarter. \u2047 We continue to see strong demand online with our U.S. eCommerce business achieving a 17% comp and eCommerce comps in Canada up nearly 60%. \u2047 While gross profit dollars declined 5% due to lower sales, gross margin rate improved by 180 basis points versus last year to 44.4%. \u2047 This represented record quarterly gross margin and was driven by improved price realization and continued progress in reducing excess inventory. \u2047 Royalty income was roughly comparable to last year at $9 million. \u2047 Spending was very well managed during the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted SG&A declined to $24 million or 8% across a broad range of expense categories. \u2047 Adjusted operating income grew 4% to $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 13.8%, driven by our strong gross margin performance and management of spending. \u2047 Below line, we had higher net interest expense than last year due to the $500 million in new senior notes which we issued earlier this year. \u2047 We had other income of approximately $3 million in the quarter, largely foreign currency gains. \u2047 And our effective tax rate was about 19% in the quarter, up from about 18% last year. \u2047 Average share count declined 2%, driven by share repurchases in 2019. \u2047 Recall that we suspended share repurchases earlier this year as part of our liquidity improvement initiatives. \u2047 So, on the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 5% to $1.96, up from $1.87 last year. \u2047 Turning to Page 5 with some balance sheet and cash flow highlights. \u2047 Our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong. \u2047 Total liquidity at the end"], "gold_summary":
