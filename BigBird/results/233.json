{"article": ["We appreciate you joining us today to review our first quarter 2021 results. \u2047 We announced our financial results for the quarter yesterday. \u2047 As you saw, our strong financial results indicate we continued growing and operating effectively, serving our customers, identifying and finalizing new investment projects and keeping our employees as safe as possible. \u2047 As shown on Slide 2, participating with me on the call today are Jeff Householder, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Moriarty, Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and Chief Policy and Risk Officer. \u2047 We also have other members of our management team joining us virtually. \u2047 We've had a very strong start to 2021 with continued profitable growth initiatives across our business units. \u2047 As shown on Slide 4, earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.96, an increase of $0.19 or 10.7% compared to our first quarter 2020 earnings per share of $1.77. \u2047 Gross margin increased more than $17 million over the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Our results were driven by growth across the Company. \u2047 We also experienced increased consumer consumption resulting from weather that more closely resembled normal temperatures. \u2047 Some of the key margin drivers included: pipeline expansion projects; the Hurricane Michael regulatory settlement; organic natural gas distribution customer growth; contributions from Elkton Gas and Western Natural Gas; increased retail propane margins per gallon; and increased business in Marlin Gas Services. \u2047 As our General Counsel, Jim Moriarty, is fond of saying, we are the beneficiaries of geography. \u2047 We're fortunate to provide energy delivery services to communities that are experiencing significant growth. \u2047 [Technical Issues] initiatives that signal support for continued expansion of our systems in Florida. \u2047 In all of our service areas, the demand for natural gas, propane and electricity has never been higher. \u2047 We continued to see customer additions at a rate that's more than twice the national average. \u2047 In the past year, our utility distribution and customer count increased by 7.4%. \u2047 Growth opportunities to serve new customers was the primary driver of our capital investment in the first quarter. \u2047 We projected capital investments for 2021 at approximately $200 million, and we're on track to achieve that target. \u2047 Our first quarter capital investment totaled just under $49 million. \u2047 Earlier today, our Board of Directors have approved an annualized dividend payment of $1.92 per share, a $0.16 per share or 9.1% dividend increase. \u2047 The $0.16 per share increase in the annualized dividend closely aligns our five-year earnings growth rate of 9.4% through December 31, 2020, with our five-year dividend growth rate of 9.5%, as shown on Slide 5, including this most recent increase. \u2047 The Board's decision to raise the dividend reflects the Company's ongoing commitment to dividend growth that is supported by earnings growth, while maintaining a payout ratio that enables our healthy reinvestment of earnings for growth and ensures liquidity to fund operations. \u2047 Chesapeake Utilities has paid dividends to its shareholders without interruption for 60 years and has increased its annualized dividend every year since 2004. \u2047 I will add more about our continued growth initiatives and capital investment projects across our business units in just a few minutes. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6, net income from continuing operations for the quarter was $34.5 million compared to $29 million for the same quarter of last year. \u2047 This represents a growth in net income of $5.5 million or approximately 19%. \u2047 As I'm sure you all recall, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we exited the natural gas marketing business and recognized gains on the sales associated with that exit. \u2047 There were some minor lingering impact associated with the sales of this business both in 2020 and also the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 As a result, I will focus our discussion today largely on continuing operation. \u2047 EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter compared to the first quarter last year grew by $0.19 to $1.96 per share from $1.77, representing growth of just under 11%. \u2047 Growth initiatives and customer consumption drove the growth rate in net income by 19%, while the earnings per share growth rate of 11% is a result of the significant amount of equity we successfully issued in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 via the ATM program and our various stock plans. \u2047 Higher income was the result of increased performance across the enterprise, as Jeff mentioned earlier, coupled with continued expense management, business efficiencies, and standardization and collaboration across the Company. \u2047 Gross margin increased 17.1% compared to the first quarter last year, while operating income grew, because of these impacts, by 22.5%. \u2047 As Slide 7 also highlights, the growth in operating income was fairly split between the two segments, Regulated Energy and Unregulated Energy, for the quarter. \u2047 The key drivers of gross margin and expenses for quarter one compared to quarter one of last year are highlighted on Slide 8. \u2047 Gross margin net of specific expense attributes grew $0.65 per share after tax. \u2047 Higher earnings for the quarter reflect increased earnings across the business from: first, customer consumption, as Jeff mentioned primarily weather focused, was $0.26 per share; pipeline expansion projects another $0.11 per share; higher retail propane margins per gallon increased margin by $0.06 per share; organic growth in our natural gas distribution operations added $0.04 per share; contributions from recent acquisitions, including Elkton Gas and Western Natural Gas added $0.04 per share; the Hurricane Michael regulatory settlement also added $0.04 per share after associated depreciation and amortization of associated regulatory assets; and margin from Marlin increased by $0.03 per share; lastly, from our Florida GRIP Reliability and Infrastructure Program, we added $0.02 per share. \u2047 These increases were offset by the absence of property sales that occurred in the first quarter of last year, which represented $0.14 per share and the increased shares we added, that I just referred to, another $0.12 per share. \u2047 Given our opportunistic equity issuances over the past 12 months to take advantage of our strong equity market position. \u2047 Finally, depreciation, payroll and facilities expenses basically drove our earnings per share down by $0.20 per share because of the growth in our business. \u2047 I would like to spend a few minutes highlighting our capital spending thus far in 2021. \u2047 As you can see though first on Slide 9, the forecast for 2021 capital expenditures remains at our previously announced guidance of $175 million to $200 million. \u2047 Again, the investment is concentrated with approximately 80% budgeted in new regulated energy assets. \u2047 Year-to-date, as Jeff mentioned, we've invested just under $49 million in new capital investments. \u2047 So, what are some of the key 2021 projects? \u2047 They include our Delmarva Natural Gas Distribution expansion into Somerset County; Eastern Shore's Del-Mar Energy Pathway project, which is well under way; Florida's Western Palm Beach County; Florida expansion; our Florida GRIP program; and other natural gas distribution and transmission system projects. \u2047 In addition, we have expenditures for natural gas and electric system infrastructure improvement activities, Marlin Gas Services expansion of their CNG transport and their expansion into RNG and LNG, and technology system in support of our business transformation and other strategic initiatives and investments. \u2047 To support the growth we have experienced and ensure we have the capital capacity to fuel our future growth, we maintain a strong balance sheet with access to sufficient competitively priced capital. \u2047 As you can see on Slide 10, as of the end of March, total capitalization was $1.4 billion, comprised of: approximately 52% stockholders' equity, which is now $726 million; we had 37% in long-term debt at an average fixed rate of 3.62%; and $156 million in short-term debt under our revolver at an average interest rate of 1.2%. \u2047 Our recent equity issuance moved this further along within our target equity to total capitalization range. \u2047 We continue to utilize our traditional equity plans this year to issue stock and increase equity beyond our earnings retained and reinvest it in the business. \u2047 Chesapeake Utilities current market capitalization is approximately $2 billion. \u2047 As Beth noted, our capital capacity and the strength of our balance sheet continues to support growth. \u2047 We're very comfortable that our previously updated capital guidance remains on target. \u2047 Slide 11 is a reminder from earlier earnings calls of the key strategic initiatives that focus our project development and transaction interest. \u2047 As I noted a moment ago, we continue to experience significant demand for the energy services, provided by our existing business units. \u2047 Let me highlight a few of our major initiatives on Slide 12. \u2047 A significant portion of projected capital investment is devoted to expanding our existing core businesses. \u2047 We also have several relatively small-scale transmission pipeline projects under development that will potentially increase investment in this area. \u2047 Our propane business continues to grow and we will keep looking for acquisition opportunities in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. \u2047 And we see growth at Marlin Gas Services and in the rapidly developing renewable natural gas market that I'll discuss in greater detail in a few moments. \u2047 I'm running[Phonetic] this margin table showing key projects and initiatives, as shown on Slide 13, including pipeline expansion, CNG, RNG transportation, acquisitions and regulatory initiatives. \u2047 Key projects are expected to generate approximately $60 million and $67 million in gross margin for the years 2021 and 2022, respectively. \u2047 Pipeline expansions are expected to generate $6.7 million in incremental margin in 2021. \u2047 The Hurricane Michael proceeding settlement will again generate $11 million in gross margin in 2021, it remains at that level in 2022. \u2047 We're particularly pleased with the full integration of margin estimates of $5.8 million and $6.1 million for 2021 and 2022, respectively, from the acquisitions of Elkton Gas and Western Natural Gas. \u2047 In total, the incremental margin growth from these key projects and initiatives represents approximately $14.1 million for 2021 and $7.5 million for 2022. \u2047 As a reminder, we only include definitive projects in this table once they reach maturity, and do not include organic margin growth from our traditional distribution, customer additions, rate adjustments in our unregulated businesses, etc. \u2047 Accordingly, the RNG transportation margin, for example, will be adjusted as new projects are definitive and announced. \u2047 I realized that we've included a $1 million placeholder for RNG transportation on the slide for a couple of quarters, and have not yet disclosed the extent of anticipated RNG production-related investments. \u2047 These projects take considerable time to develop, especially related to securing full project financing. \u2047 That reminds me of the early days of solar and wind project financing. \u2047 However, there is positive movement on RNG project financing as interest increases among both financial and strategic participants, and we're hopeful that more details of the projects we're involved in can be made public over the next several weeks. \u2047 As a final note, the Auburndale Pipeline, $679,000 and Boulden acquisition $3.9 million became fully in service in 2020, so these ongoing mature projects have been removed from this table. \u2047 Over the past several quarters, we've outlined a number of renewable natural gas initiatives. \u2047 To begin, Slide 14 outlines the types of projects and ownership structures that we are actively assessing. \u2047 Let me provide an update on our progress for several of these initiatives. \u2047 We continue to work with CleanBay renewables on two utility scale poultry waste, RNG and organic fertilizer production facilities on the Delmarva Peninsula. \u2047 We previously described our existing agreement with CleanBay to own the gas processing equipment at the Westover Maryland facility, with an option to convert the equipment investment to equity in the total plant. \u2047 Last month, our Board Investment Committee authorized management to negotiate economic and governance terms with CleanBay with Chesapeake's equity participation in the project. \u2047 We hope to finalize an agreement with CleanBay and other equity providers over the coming weeks, and ensure that the anticipated project in-service date of Q4 2023 remains viable. \u2047 In addition to the Westover RNG facility, we're in discussions with CleanBay and other potential investors on a second Delmarva RNG facility, which is under development in Sussex County, Delaware. \u2047 Similar to the Westover plant, the Sussex facility will produce RNG at a utility scale along with organic fertilizer. \u2047 The property for the Sussex plant has been acquired and most land use permits have been approved. \u2047 Upon completion, the Westover and Sussex plants will be among the largest RNG facilities in the country. \u2047 As you may recall, we have several additional investments either under contract or in final negotiations associated with the Westover plant. \u2047 The Marlin Gas Transport agreement is in place, an interconnect agreement with our Eastern Shore Natural Gas transmission pipeline has been finalized, and the interconnect scheduled for construction in conjunction with the in-service date of the Westover plant. \u2047 Our Delmarva distribution business has finalized an agreement for off-take the[Indecipherable] RNG from Westover to purchase non-frac non-fossil RNG molecules for distributions to our -- distribution, excuse me, to our customers. \u2047 In addition to purchasing RNG from Westover's production, our Delmarva distribution operations will provide conventional gas supply service to Westover to support driving the organic fertilizer produced by the plant. \u2047 It's a lot of fertilizer and a lot of natural gas. \u2047 Westover will likely become our largest Maryland gas distribution customer. \u2047 Eastern Shore Natural Gas Del-Mar Energy Pathway expansion project currently under construction and our related distribution system expansion will bring our pipelines to within 1.5 mile of the Westover plant, and we will extend the distribution system to provide service. \u2047 We anticipate providing similar Marlin and conventional gas distribution services to the CleanBay Sussex site. \u2047 Chesapeake is exploring opportunities to develop renewable electric micro-grids at both the Westover and Sussex RNG sites. \u2047 We're working with a third party to potentially develop solar photovoltaic generation systems to serve the electric needs of the RNG facilities. \u2047 Property suitable for solar PV installation is owned respectively by the third party in close proximity to the Westover site, and similarly by Chesapeake close to the Sussex site. \u2047 Chesapeake has engaged Southern Company Energy Services and Southern's PowerSecure Company to assist in preliminary design and engineering of the solar PV systems, battery storage, protection protocols for the plants and related facilities to support in renewable electric micro-grid at each facility. \u2047 On Delmarva, we continue to work with the Bioenergy DevCo Company as they also move forward on development of a poultry waste RNG facility in Sussex County, Delaware. \u2047 The County Commission has recently approved the Bioenergy DevCo conditional land use permit. \u2047 Chesapeake will own and operate the gas processing equipment"], "gold_summary": ["q1 earnings per share $1.96 from continuing operations."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $1.96.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $1.96.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $1.96."]}
