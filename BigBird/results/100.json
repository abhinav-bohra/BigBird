{"article": ["Today's discussion is being broadcast on our website. \u2047 Participating in today's call are Bob Wetherbee, Board Chair, President and CEO; and Don Newman, Senior Vice President and CFO. \u2047 Bob and Don will focus on our second quarter highlights and key messages, but may refer to certain slides within their remarks. \u2047 These slides are available on our website. \u2047 They provide additional color and details on our results and outlook. \u2047 Here we are over a year since the world went into lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 So much has changed in the last four quarters, and it's easy to focus on the more challenging aspects of this period. \u2047 At the same time, it's important to remember that we also changed some things, those within our control for the better. \u2047 Like many, we quickly innovated within our digital technology infrastructure to thrive on remote collaboration. \u2047 Technology allowed us to streamline our processes and work more efficiently overall. \u2047 We'll continue to drive these improvements utilizing new skills and tools to provide more flexibility to our employees and create better connections with our customers, and we'll capture the associated structural cost savings. \u2047 I'm pleased to see millions of people returning to the skies for the summer travel season. \u2047 Every day seems to bring another sign of recovery in airframe and jet engine demand. \u2047 The current economic reawakening and everything from travel to consumer goods to energy is real. \u2047 Despite lingering pandemic-related uncertainties, I'm confident the desire to travel is significant and growing worldwide. \u2047 Ultimately, that drives the sustained lengthy backlog for any airliner programs. \u2047 At ATI, we're ready to produce what our customers need. \u2047 With that as a backdrop, we generated second quarter financial results that showcase the improving trends in our end markets. \u2047 At the same time, they reflect the negative impact of the recently concluded strike by the United Steelworkers at our Specialty Rolled Products or SRP business. \u2047 Excluding the $40 million cost attributed to the strike and a small improvement in our restructuring reserves, we lost $0.12 per share in the second quarter. \u2047 Despite the earnings loss, the aerospace recovery is readily apparent beneath the headline numbers. \u2047 Our jet engine product revenues were up over 20% compared to the first quarter 2021. \u2047 The High Performance Materials & Components segment, or HPMC, saw its margins improve by more than 200 basis points sequentially and nearly 300 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 Very good news that Don will cover in more depth in a few minutes. \u2047 As we discussed on the first quarter earnings call in April, we were incredibly disappointed that the union leadership chose to call a strike at our major SRP operating locations. \u2047 Our robust continuity plans allowed us to maintain operations during the strike. \u2047 The new 4-year labor agreement was ratified on July 13. \u2047 Many represented employees returned to their positions within a week of ratification. \u2047 We're safely and efficiently ramping up operations to their prior production levels. \u2047 We're on track and expect to be back to full production capabilities in September. \u2047 I've been asked many times by many people inside and outside of ATI, some form of the question, was the strike worth it? \u2047 Clearly, we would have preferred to continue negotiating to reach an agreement without a work stoppage. \u2047 A competitive cost structure for this business is imperative. \u2047 Left unresolved, we'd be facing rapidly escalating healthcare costs that were on a trajectory to double every seven years. \u2047 Product pricing can increase fast enough to offset that level of healthcare inflation. \u2047 The SRP business would have fallen behind its competition. \u2047 We were compelled to act now to find a solution. \u2047 Under this contract, annual healthcare cost inflation will be capped at 3.5%. \u2047 The represented employees are responsible to take any necessary actions required to cover annual overage amounts. \u2047 The SRP business is now appropriately focused on getting back to full speed, providing our customers with the materials and components they need. \u2047 To close out my comments related to the SRP business, I have two pieces of good news to share. \u2047 First, the transformation initiative to exit standard stainless sheet products is on track and will be completed by year-end 2021 as planned. \u2047 We're making excellent progress on consolidating our footprint. \u2047 Second, we recently signed a long-term agreement with JSW Steel USA to toll convert a significant percentage of their Ohio-produced carbon steel slabs through our hot rolling and processing facility in Pennsylvania. \u2047 This multiyear agreement provides a meaningful opportunity to increase our asset utilization and cash flow. \u2047 We're happy to partner with JSW to bring the exceptional quality and gauge control of our world-class HRPF to their customers. \u2047 We're currently ramping up production. \u2047 Congratulations to the operating team for setting a production record for carbon steel toll conversion volume in the month of June, even in the midst of the strike at this facility. \u2047 So what are we seeing in our key end markets? \u2047 Well, for the first time in several quarters, the news is encouraging across most of our portfolio. \u2047 This removes the strike impact from the comparison. \u2047 I believe this provides the most realistic view of our underlying performance and the true market demand. \u2047 Using that context, sales increased sequentially in each of our major end markets with the exception of electronics, which is being compared to record results in Q1. \u2047 On a year-to-year basis, we grew sales in most of our key end markets, most notably Energy, up 60%; and Defense, up 22%. \u2047 We continue to gain momentum in our largest key market, commercial jet engines. \u2047 This is principally driven by the recovery of narrowbody platforms, particularly engine programs used on the A320 and A321 aircraft families. \u2047 As we said on the last few calls, the demand recovery began in our Forgings business where lead times are six to nine months ahead of engine production. \u2047 Due to the market recovery and our recent share gains, our Forgings revenue exceeded both the prior year and the prior quarter levels. \u2047 We expect this positive growth trend to continue and expand as increased production rates on the 737 MAX become a larger part of our order book. \u2047 The return to growth in Jet Engine Specialty Materials has lagged Forgings, largely due to pockets of stranded inventory throughout the supply chain. \u2047 As expected, this inventory is depleting, albeit at an uneven pace, according to customer and product form. \u2047 In the second quarter, sales of our Specialty Materials like Rene 65 for LEAP engines grew significantly compared to the first quarter, but were still below prior year. \u2047 We anticipate demand for materials to continue to increase for narrowbody engines, but lag for widebody engines. \u2047 This uneven pull, coupled with any remaining channel inventory will make for a somewhat choppy growth trajectory quarter-to-quarter for the balance of the year. \u2047 Rounding out commercial aerospace, the airframe market continues to be soft. \u2047 This is largely due to the much discussed sluggish demand for widebody aircraft due to subdued international travel and stranded supply chain inventory. \u2047 We expect this trend to continue throughout 2021 and possibly into early 2022 as the industry awaits the catalyst for increased widebody production rates. \u2047 Our newly won European OEM Airframe business begins production in the second half of 2021, initially at low levels. \u2047 This will partially offset the anticipated destocking pressure at our primary domestic airframe customer. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, Defense continues to be a growth market for ATI. \u2047 Our broad materials portfolio serves customers with a wide range of demanding applications, ensuring we can be successful under almost any defense budget or economic backdrop. \u2047 Our second quarter growth was driven by naval nuclear applications and rotorcraft products to support increased demand for U.S. navy ships and heavy-lift helicopters. \u2047 We expect our Defense business to continue to grow and are seeing titanium armor plate demand return in the second half of 2021, in support of a new U.K. armored vehicle program. \u2047 Turning to the Energy markets. \u2047 We experienced significant growth, largely in our specialty energy portfolio. \u2047 These increases primarily supported land-based gas turbine production in Asia where energy demand is increasing. \u2047 Sales to civilian nuclear customers added to this growth. \u2047 Looking ahead, we see continued improvements in Energy markets as the world slowly reopens from pandemic lockdowns and economic growth drives increasing energy needs. \u2047 Wrapping up the market's discussions, results were mixed in our two smaller differentiated markets. \u2047 We saw the expected return to growth in medical applications as hospitals perform more elective surgeries and diagnostic testing procedures. \u2047 Both our MRI and Implant Materials sales increased sequentially. \u2047 We expect demand to improve modestly over the coming quarters, led by MRI. \u2047 In the Electronics market, sales decreased from record levels in the first quarter of 2021, but grew year-over-year. \u2047 Sales of ATI's specialty alloy powders increased versus both prior periods. \u2047 We expect demand to remain strong for these products for the balance of 2021. \u2047 I'd like to cover several areas, including our Q2 financial performance, our balance sheet and our outlook. \u2047 On a reported basis, ATI lost $0.39 per share in the second quarter. \u2047 Excluding $40 million of costs associated with the strike and a small favorable true-up to our restructuring reserves, the company lost $0.12 per share in the second quarter. \u2047 To get a true sense of our performance, you have to go beyond the headlines. \u2047 As we told you on the last two earnings calls, the commercial aerospace recovery, particularly in jet engines, is gaining momentum and becoming more broad-based within our business. \u2047 This is readily apparent in our HPMC segment results where jet engines account for more than 40% of overall segment revenues. \u2047 As Bob shared, jet engine revenues increased by more than 20% sequentially for ATI as a whole and for HPMC. \u2047 Volumes in our Forgings business continue to expand, building on growth in the prior two quarters. \u2047 Underlying demand for our Specialty Materials accelerated meaningfully for the first time since the pandemic began. \u2047 In addition to jet engines, revenues in each of HPMC's key end markets grew versus the first quarter, led by specialty energy, including materials for land-based gas turbines produced in Asia. \u2047 As a result of our profitable jet engine growth and increased asset utilization, HPMC EBITDA margins increased by 220 basis points compared to the first quarter and nearly 300 basis points versus the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 We anticipate third quarter growth across HPMC's key end markets, most notably jet engine and specialty energy and further utilization benefits from increasing production rates across our network. \u2047 We expect robust incremental margins over the coming quarters as profitable jet engine revenues increased and structural cost improvements executed throughout 2020 are maintained. \u2047 Q2 financial results were clearly impacted by the 105-day strike in the SRP business. \u2047 It should be noted that while we removed strike-related costs from segment earnings, segment revenues also declined nearly $140 million versus the first quarter due to plant outages and resulting production declines. \u2047 No adjustments were made for these revenue headwinds. \u2047 Despite the short-term impacts to 2021 performance, we achieved the needed long-term cost structure changes that will help SRP compete more effectively in the specialty materials marketplace. \u2047 Sticking with the AA&S segment, our Precision Rolled Strip business in Asia continues to operate at robust levels with revenues in line with its record-setting first quarter, well above prior year. \u2047 Earnings from this business were below first quarter levels due to unfavorable mix. \u2047 Earnings from our SA&C business were below the first quarter and prior year, largely due to unfavorable mix and the elevated production costs. \u2047 Looking ahead in the AA&S segment, we expect the SRP business to begin to recover in August. \u2047 As a result of the strike continuing throughout most of July and the inefficiencies associated with the production reramp, we anticipate approximately $25 million of additional third quarter costs. \u2047 We expect the Asian Precision Rolled Strip business to produce solid results in what is generally its strongest seasonal quarter as device manufacturers prepare for the year-end holiday season. \u2047 Our SA&C business will likely have marginally lower sequential earnings due to its traditional third quarter preventive maintenance outages. \u2047 It's worth noting that second quarter corporate costs and closed company expenses were elevated compared to prior year and prior quarter. \u2047 Corporate costs were above prior year largely due to incentive compensation accruals and higher than the prior quarter, mainly due to foreign exchange losses. \u2047 Closed company expenses were above first quarter and prior year, primarily due to nonrepeating benefits in both prior periods. \u2047 As we've discussed over the past several quarters, our decisive 2020 cost actions continue to benefit the business. \u2047 They serve to limit decremental margins while year-over-year revenues declined. \u2047 We fully expect them to benefit the bottom line when revenues return to year-over-year growth. \u2047 The HPMC segment's second quarter results offer a preview of what is expected in future quarters. \u2047 While HPMC revenues were flat versus prior year, earnings grew 30%. \u2047 We achieved this earnings growth largely as a result of increasing production rates at many segment facilities coupled with streamlined cost structures. \u2047 However, we still have room to improve. \u2047 Some facilities such as our nickel powder operations at Bakers, North Carolina, continue to operate on limited schedules due to low demand levels. \u2047 While others still produce large quantities of lower-margin transactional products as commercial aerospace markets recover. \u2047 Now let's move to the balance sheet and liquidity. \u2047 As has been the case throughout the pandemic, we've taken actions to improve our debt profile and have prioritized our balance sheet to ensure an ample cushion to weather any storm. \u2047 Despite the recent strike, we ended the quarter with roughly $830 million of total liquidity, including at least $475 million of cash. \u2047 Our second quarter managed working capital levels increased, partially from elevated inventories in our SRP business due to strike-related inefficiencies. \u2047 Accounts receivable and accounts payable balances also contributed to the second quarter's higher working capital levels. \u2047 We continue to focus on inventory velocity as we ramp production. \u2047 We expect working capital levels as a percent of sales to improve significantly in the second half of the year. \u2047 Looking ahead, we anticipate contributing up to $50 million to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan in the third quarter to improve our funding status and long-term leverage profile. \u2047 The deposit is above and beyond minimum contribution requirements, but it is consistent with our intent to reduce our pension exposure. \u2047 Additionally, we'll continue to actively manage our debt maturity profile in the coming quarters. \u2047 As I said earlier, we expect our Jet Engine business to continue to improve, led by growth in Specialty Materials and our ongoing cost structure benefits. \u2047 In the AA&S segment, we anticipate higher sequential S"], "gold_summary": ["q2 loss per share $0.39.  \u2047  qtrly
