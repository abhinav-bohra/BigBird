{"article": ["Today, I am joined by President and Chief Executive Officer, Lal Karsanbhai; Chief Financial Officer, Frank Dellaquila; and Chief Operating Officer, Ram Krishnan. \u2047 Colleen joins us from the Automation Solutions finance organization and will be your main point of contact going forward as I transition to a new role in the operating business units. \u2047 I certainly wish you health and success. \u2047 Please join me on slide two. \u2047 I certainly have big shoes to fill. \u2047 As Pete mentioned, I'm coming into this role from our Automation Solutions finance organization, and I've been with Emerson for over 13 years. \u2047 I'm certainly excited and humbled to be joining the Investor Relations team during this dynamic time for our organization. \u2047 I look forward to speaking with all our investors and partners very soon. \u2047 Now I would like to take a moment to highlight two areas of real ESG impact within Emerson. \u2047 First, on slide three, in keeping with environmental sustainability framework of greening of, by and with Emerson that we introduced in February, our first topic is about greening by Emerson. \u2047 It is a great example of how Emerson solutions are relevant in enabling our customers' sustainability initiatives. \u2047 Emerson recently signed a multiyear agreement with PureCycle Technologies, which has a novel technology and process for fully recycling plastic number five polypropylene back to a clear pellet. \u2047 As some of you may know, polypropylene is a common form of plastic that has not had great recycling options. \u2047 Emerson is serving as their born digital automation partner going forward with initial plant projects in Ohio, Georgia and a remote operation center in Florida. \u2047 Now please join me on slide number four. \u2047 Our second topic is the greening with Emerson example. \u2047 Leveraging our Helix Innovation Center in Dayton, Ohio, Emerson has collaborated with the Department of Energy and their Oak Ridge National Laboratory to advance next-generation HVACR technology. \u2047 Expanding the applicability of heat pump technologies, redesigning refrigeration architectures to maximize efficiency in food retail and working to minimize energy use and leaks in commercial HVAC applications are just a few of the exciting areas of cooperation. \u2047 We have a number of collaborations with the Department of Energy and their labs. \u2047 We look forward to continuing to build these relationships and support the development of novel solutions and real sustainability road maps going forward. \u2047 God speed and have a good luck in your new opportunity. \u2047 Great to have you here. \u2047 Colleen and I had the opportunity to spend couple of years together in Automation Solutions, and we're very blessed to have her join our Investor Relations team. \u2047 And we have a lot of energy and momentum behind us, which was very exciting to see as we executed through the last three months. \u2047 I had the opportunity over the last six months to meet many of you, and I look forward to meeting more of you as I go through the next part of the year. \u2047 But I appreciate your continued confidence, your challenges and of course, your investment. \u2047 A few things just that are not financially related that I want to mention to the team here. \u2047 First of all, our cultural work is well underway. \u2047 We will be announcing our new Chief People Officer later this month. \u2047 We're all very excited about the selection process. \u2047 It will be an outside hire and somebody who fundamentally will have the opportunity to come in here and really help us as we navigate some of the challenges and create many of the pathways that we have as we evolve the culture of Emerson into the future. \u2047 Secondly, our portfolio work is complete. \u2047 We have -- we are now getting ready to review it with the Board, which will occur at the October Board meeting. \u2047 We discussed briefly with the Board yesterday. \u2047 And essentially, what we have defined is multiple paths for our business to drive higher underlying sales growth and diversification of the portfolio. \u2047 We're all very excited about the process that we underwent. \u2047 It was very exhaustive, and we have turned over a lot of different stones, defining broad markets with high growth and lots of optionality in terms of M&A and organic activity. \u2047 I'll mention on the M&A side that industrial software continues to be critical as we think about share of wallet, as we think about the potential for underlying growth acceleration and our many pathways there. \u2047 Our SI acquisition is performing incredibly well and ahead of our internal synergy board plans. \u2047 So that's been very, very well done. \u2047 But what stands out to me most above all is the execution by the team. \u2047 Yes, there were market tailwinds, and we'll talk about those, particularly as they accelerated in Automation Solutions and continued across our Commercial & Residential businesses and they are relevant, but the execution was absolutely phenomenal. \u2047 There were a lot of hurdles to overcome through the quarter, material inflation, material availability. \u2047 We did a lot of expediting. \u2047 We had to get very creative in qualifying suppliers, logistics and management of cargo around the world and of course, labor availability in the United States. \u2047 But the team just did a great job. \u2047 And we're seeing, despite these operational headwinds, the value of that work being reflected in the incrementals of the company. \u2047 The operating leverage -- profit leverage at 34% was very strong and now most importantly, has given us the room to accelerate investment in differentiating technologies and further -- that will further, I think, drive relevance -- increased relevance at our customer base. \u2047 So very exciting headroom that's created, and we started those investments. \u2047 And I'll share a number of those with you, and we'll talk about that more as we go through the year. \u2047 We're especially pleased with the results in the quarter, especially in light of the operations challenges that Lal just described and Ram will talk about a little later in the call. \u2047 If you please go to slide six. \u2047 So a continued recovery in our end markets, combined with the benefits of the cost reset actions, and it drove strong operating performance and financial results in the third quarter. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $1.09, up 36% from the prior year. \u2047 Demand continues to strengthen with sales coming in ahead of our expectations with underlying growth of 15%, and June trailing 3-month orders were at 26%. \u2047 Automation Solutions notably turned positive this quarter in both sales and orders, up 9% in sales and 17% on an underlying basis. \u2047 Commercial & Residential Solutions continues to experience robust demand across the business and geographies with 29% sales growth and 43% orders growth on an underlying basis. \u2047 The cost reset benefits continued to be realized as planned reading through to the margins. \u2047 And along with the additional volume and leverage, they drove adjusted segment EBIT growth of 40%, 280 basis points of increased margin to 19.6%. \u2047 Cash flow continues to be very strong with operating and free cash flow up approximately 30% year-over-year and free cash flow conversion exceeding 150% of net earnings. \u2047 We're continuing to implement the remaining elements of the cost reset program. \u2047 In this quarter, we initiated $32 million of restructuring actions. \u2047 The program is on schedule and delivering the projected savings as we've planned. \u2047 This is a bridge of the earnings per share increase from the prior year. \u2047 The operational performance was very strong. \u2047 So the noteworthy thing on this chart is the green bar. \u2047 Operations added 33% to adjusted EPS, and it was balanced between the platforms. \u2047 They both delivered strong profit leverage on the strength of volume increases and cost reduction benefits, as Lal mentioned. \u2047 Leverage was 34% across the enterprise. \u2047 Tax, currency, pension, stock comp netted to a $0.05 headwind, and there was a minor favorable impact from share repurchase. \u2047 Again, in total, adjusted earnings per share was $1.09, up 36%. \u2047 Please go to the next chart, Chart number eight. \u2047 So as I mentioned, underlying sales is up 15%. \u2047 Gross profit increased 90 basis points to 42.4%, driven mainly by the benefits of the cost reduction actions and then the leverage on the volume across the enterprise. \u2047 We did offset the impact of price/cost headwinds, which we are beginning to see intensify and which we will see in the next couple of quarters and we will talk about a little later in the call. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%, up 310 basis points. \u2047 Effective tax rate was 19.2% versus 11% in the prior year. \u2047 Last year, we had several favorable discrete items, mostly around R&D credits that we described at the time. \u2047 This was a $0.10 headwind year-over-year that we overcame. \u2047 Adjusted EPS, as mentioned, was $1.09 versus $0.80 last year. \u2047 If you go to slide nine, please, we'll talk about earnings and cash flow. \u2047 Adjusted segment EBIT again increased 40%, margin up 280 basis points. \u2047 The leverage on volume and cost reset benefits offset material cost headwinds in the Climate Technologies business. \u2047 Adjusted pre-tax earnings increased 350 basis points to 17.6%. \u2047 Operating cash flow was very strong, up 31% at $1.1 billion. \u2047 Free cash flow was $977 million, also up a little over 30%, driven by strong earnings growth and effective working capital management. \u2047 Lastly, the trade working capital ratio improved to 15.4% of sales. \u2047 Turning to slide 10, we'll look at Automation Solutions. \u2047 Underlying sales turned positive this quarter at 8%. \u2047 Trailing 3-month orders accelerated to 17%. \u2047 The improvement in the Americas is particularly encouraging and notable with continued momentum in life sciences, food and beverage and medical markets and a return to growth more broadly across the traditional process automation markets and sustainability-related business. \u2047 We're seeing increasing KOB three activity across our process automation customer base mainly driven by shutdown turnaround and outage activity and opex spend. \u2047 MRO spend is returning to pre-pandemic levels from pent-up demand and delayed STOs. \u2047 capex spending is recovering at a slower rate with tailwinds from site-based emissions and optimization projects. \u2047 The platform continues to implement the comprehensive restructuring actions that have been ongoing, and the benefits are flowing through to the financial results. \u2047 Adjusted EBIT margin increased 320 basis points and 310 basis points at adjusted EBITDA, driven mainly by the flow-through of the cost reset savings and by the volume leverage. \u2047 The integration of OSI continues to go very well. \u2047 We're very pleased with the acquisition and the results to date, and we have increasing confidence in the synergy plan that we have. \u2047 Backlog increased to $5.5 billion. \u2047 It is up 17% year-to-date. \u2047 We'll talk a bit about the project funnel and other opportunities later in the call. \u2047 Turning to slide 11, we'll review Commercial & Residential Solutions. \u2047 Sales were up on an underlying basis 29% versus the prior year. \u2047 Orders continue to be strong and very broad-based in their strength. \u2047 The June trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 43%, and it was very balanced across both Climate Technologies and Tools & Home products. \u2047 All our businesses and geographies showed strong double-digit growth. \u2047 Residential markets continue to be strong and growth has accelerated in Cold Chain and Professional Tools. \u2047 The Americas were up 29% with continued strength across all end markets. \u2047 Europe was up 37%, driven by continued heat pump demand and increasing sales of professional tools. \u2047 Asia, Middle East and Africa was up 25%, driven by Cold Chain and various heating technologies. \u2047 Margins improved by 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT and 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA driven by the strong volume leverage and the cost reset savings, which more than offset the price/cost headwinds that we are seeing in the business. \u2047 I'm going to pass this over to Ram, and he's going to talk a bit about operations, what we've done in the quarter to deliver the results and some of the challenges that we face. \u2047 Clearly, as you can see, our operating environment remains very challenging as commodity inflation, electronic supply and labor availability continues to impact our global operations. \u2047 Steel prices are at record highs with 11 months of consecutive increases and in our estimation, have not peaked yet. \u2047 Plastic resin prices remain elevated as our global teams have maneuvered expeditiously defined alternatives to maintain supply. \u2047 And while copper pricing has receded off record highs, it is still up over $1.40 a pound year-over-year. \u2047 Our hedge positions lessened the impact to 2021, but the inflation impact in terms of copper will carry over into most of 2022. \u2047 Electronics shortages are proliferating in most of our businesses, impacting both platforms, and supply is expected to remain constrained well into 2022. \u2047 Very little component inventory on microprocessors, controllers, linear integrated circuits are available in the open market, and the number of shortages faced by our EMS suppliers is growing, severely impacting lead times. \u2047 And finally, labor availability continues to be an issue across many industries in the U.S., and our businesses are impacted as well. \u2047 Our V-shaped demand recovery in many of our Commercial & Residential Solutions businesses, local competition driven by tight labor markets in many cities and rolling labor constraints as waves of COVID disruptions impact our sites has added a new level of complexity to our operational plans. \u2047 It is important to note that price/cost remains at an unfavorable $75 million as we estimated last quarter. \u2047 No change, but we expect the maximum impact of the commodity inflation to be felt in the next two quarters. \u2047 Now despite these challenges, turning to slide 13, I'd like to highlight some of the outstanding work by our global supply chain and operations teams to combat these challenges and help deliver phenomenal operational results to date as they remain flexible, creative and nimble in a dynamic environment to serve the needs of our customers. \u2047 Our supply chain teams have worked tirelessly in this environment to ensure continuity of material supply to our global plants. \u2047 As you can see on the chart, many creative solutions are being implemented on a real-time basis quickly and effectively. \u2047 Our regional footprint, both on the manufacturing side as well as supply chain that we spent many years developing, has certainly been an advantage for us in these challenging times. \u2047 Many of our global plants are producing at record levels while ramping up capacity to meet surge demand and in many cases, in-sourcing critical elements of the supply chain to address sudden disruptions. \u2047 Let's turn now to slide 15. \u2047 We are improving our sales outlook for the year based on the continued strength in our orders, the pace of business and the year-to-date profit performance. \u2047 We now expect underlying"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted earnings per share of
