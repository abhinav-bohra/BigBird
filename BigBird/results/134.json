Also note that the content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today. \u2047 The company does not intend and undertakes no obligation to update this information to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. \u2047 Finally, today's call is being recorded and will be available on the company's website later today. \u2047 Though we are closely monitoring the latest Delta variant of the coronavirus, the entire organization has been energized to see the reopening of the economy, continued strength in the housing market and exceptional performance and growth in our business. \u2047 Strong operating income and rising portfolio valuations drove exceptional financial results for the second quarter, including GAAP earnings of $0.66 per diluted share, well in excess of our $0.18 per share dividend for the second quarter. \u2047 This contributed to a 6.5% increase in our GAAP book value to $11.46 per share at June 30th. \u2047 The results we've generated thus far in 2021 are reflective of a business that can expand profitably, while successfully serving it's mission of making quality housing accessible to all American households. \u2047 As you know this mission emphasizes borrowers whose needs are not well served by government loan programs or potentially not at all. \u2047 Our residential and business purpose lending teams together target the non-agency mortgage market, the segment of the market that many who recently ignored in large part due to the absence of Federal Reserve stimulus. \u2047 The non-agency market represents the residential mortgage universe outside of government-backed mortgage programs. \u2047 By targeting this market rather than a specific borrower profile as we had in the past, our business is not tied to the direction of the homeownership rate. \u2047 Instead Redwood now offers a comprehensive product mix that serves both non used to be consumers and housing investors alike, and it's a big market. \u2047 Many of forecasted residential non-agency origination volumes have significantly increased in 2021 from the $435 billion of originations in 2020. \u2047 That's only beginning to reflect the potential from a regulatory pullback for non-owner occupied loans, something that can provide a significant tailwind to our sector going forward. \u2047 Our results remain strong in the second quarter despite market conditions that were significantly more challenging than they were in the first quarter. \u2047 Rising interest rates reemerged in the residential lending space, largely as the result of uncertainty and whether the Fed will alter it's support for the agency mortgage market. \u2047 The sharp competitive forces that arose as a result along with the corresponding decline in refinance activity triggered a contraction in margins across the industry. \u2047 Exaggerating the effects of strong competition were signs of pro-cyclical and supply chain inflation with the shift in yield curve driving significant hedging and execution costs for those managing large mortgage pipelines including for us. \u2047 Against this backdrop, in the second quarter, we still locked close to $4 billion of jumbo loans at margins in the high end of our historical target range. \u2047 The business purpose lending market also became more crowded in the second quarter with new competitor using the rate sheet to buy their way into the space, particularly for lower balance bridge and rental loan products. \u2047 The shift out of apartment living and toward single family detached homes as a trend had shown no sign of ebbing despite the recent reopening of most major metros. \u2047 This has led to a shortage of high quality homes with aggressive demand from both investors and consumers alike. \u2047 In many regions rent growth has been significantly outstripped by home price appreciation highlighting the scarcity value of quality housing in the multiple constituencies focused on acquiring single-family homes. \u2047 Leveraging a well-earned reputation as a nimble and reliable lifecycle lender, CoreVest our BPL platform eclipse $500 million of fundings for the quarter and a balance of single family rental and bridge originations. \u2047 The sustained performance through this challenging backdrop showcased our strategic foundation and is the essence of what makes Redwood unique. \u2047 Our mortgage banking businesses offer highly complementary products that drive durable earning streams. \u2047 And our investment portfolio continues to offer significant upside as the economy recovers. \u2047 Our credit discipline and ability to create our own assets remain key differentiators. \u2047 Our strategic foundation has facilitated returns that are significantly outpacing our growing dividends. \u2047 In the first half of 2021 approximately 70% of Redwood's adjusted revenue was driven by our mortgage banking operations with the remaining 30% from our investment portfolio. \u2047 We expect mortgage banking and by extension our taxable subsidiaries to continue to be a strong earnings driver going forward. \u2047 The revenue generated through mortgage banking is nearly double the percentage contribution of recent years and highlights the ongoing shift in our business model as we adapt to changing market conditions. \u2047 It also supports continued expansion of book value over time, the retain earnings acting as a zero cost avenue for capital formation that has reduced our marginal need for funding and stands in contrast to others in the space, manage their balance sheets. \u2047 By continuing to reinvest in our infrastructure, both organically and through partnerships our path to realizing transformative scale is clear. \u2047 Across our enterprise, we've cultivated a talented and inspired workforce, we have embraced technology to serve our customers more quickly than ever before. \u2047 One great example of this approach is last quarter's launch of our early stage investment platform RWT Horizons. \u2047 This is something Dash will touch on in more detail. \u2047 As we look ahead, we continue to raise our game, invest in our people and infrastructure and attack our markets with the service standard that continues to separate us from our competition. \u2047 We're excited by recent changes in the regulatory landscape that have made the non-agency mortgage market more relevant than it's been in many years. \u2047 Our goal is to build a business that serves an important public mission and scale profitably and generates a very attractive return profile for our shareholders. \u2047 Our second quarter results reflect continued strategic progress and strong operating momentum. \u2047 While our comprehensive non-agency market footprint benefited from ongoing strength in the housing and credit markets, we coupled these macro tailwinds with homegrown ingredients, both new and familiar. \u2047 Our team's usual crisp execution was complemented by meaningful progress with our technology infrastructure, both organic and through new partnerships already bearing fruit. \u2047 In sum, the final product was another quarter of significant outperformance. \u2047 As Chris referenced, benchmark rates remain an area of acute focus for the markets. \u2047 The uptick in rates during the second quarter has almost fully retraced, however, uncertainty around the level of government support for agency mortgages may very well moderate the amount of borrower refinance activity, we typically see in this kind of rally. \u2047 Against this backdrop, it's important to unpack the key drivers of profitability across our platforms. \u2047 As Chris noted, the markets we serve continue to grow as the path of home prices, evolution and consumer demand for housing, and important regulatory trends are driving an expansion of non-agencies true potential footprint. \u2047 And while we're not immune from moves in MBS prices versus benchmark rates, our diverse distribution channels and unique product mix allow us to benefit from different drivers of demand. \u2047 Case in point, while margins compressed elsewhere in the market during the second quarter we enjoyed durability in our margins with sustained strength in volume across both residential and business purpose lending. \u2047 In fact an ebb in demand for agency mortgages represents another potential tailwind for our business. \u2047 Mortgage originators are still ramping up capacity to address the pent-up demand from jumbo borrowers, and as home price appreciation has increased nationwide along with consumer preference for single-family detached rental housing, our suite of BPL offerings remains in high demand and our residential business geographic footprint continues to expand. \u2047 Our equity is now at its highest level in at least a decade pushing more loan demand above the conforming loan limits and into Redwood's addressable market. \u2047 As we note in our updated investor supplement, there are now 13 states in which we have a lot more loans year-to-date than in each of the two years prior to the pandemic. \u2047 Collectively, locks in these states represent 35% of our year-to-date volume, a trend we continue to track with great interest. \u2047 Overall market observers now forecast single family home price appreciation for 2021 to be 14% and 16% for existing and new homes respectively. \u2047 Even if this moderates is expected into 2022 we expect the trend to continue of more locations across the country evolving into non-agency markets. \u2047 Another key driver is the regulatory environment. \u2047 The evolving rules are likely to meaningfully increase the Qualified Mortgage or QM cohort a significant boon for high quality expanded credit borrowers. \u2047 Furthermore, caps in place since earlier this year on GSE purchases of non owner-occupied loans could expand on non-agency market by an estimated $25 to $35 billion per year. \u2047 And there is likely more of the non-agency market can do to help address broader access to credit and the associated impact on first time homebuyers and low-to-moderate income borrowers overall. \u2047 Also critical to the equation is the availability of high quality rental housing including single family detached, an issue solved in part by an increase in custom built projects. \u2047 As we discussed on prior calls, housing supply has not kept up with demand and building material costs moderating remain high contributing to significant price escalation on home. \u2047 Single-family homes for rent can meet the demand for expanded space in desirable neighborhood at a monthly payment that more consumers can afford. \u2047 Reflecting these supply demand dynamics, single-family rental occupancy rates remain at record highs with a weighted average of 95% for all US single-family rental homes, and single-family rents have remain meaningfully more than multifamily rents since early last year. \u2047 Our second quarter results reinforce this broader backdrop. \u2047 Operating highlights for the quarter included reaching our second highest level of jumbo locks ever and our highest BPL volume since late 2019. \u2047 As Brooke will elaborate on book value increased 6.5% driven by a mix of asset appreciation through fair value changes and retained earnings from mortgage banking income earned at our taxable REIT subsidiary. \u2047 Collectively, our platforms distributed $3.6 billion of loans through direct loan sales and 4 securitizations. \u2047 Following a historic first quarter, our residential business registered $3.9 billion of lock volume in Q2. \u2047 As anticipated, purchase money loans were a key driver and represented a 60% share of the quarter lock volume. \u2047 Despite the interest rate backdrop and competitive pressures impacting GSE eligible production, the business delivered margins at the high end of our historical target range of 75 to 100 basis points reflecting the diversity of our distribution channels and strength of our pipeline management amid broader market volatility. \u2047 During the second quarter, we sold $1.8 billion of loans and completed 3 Sequoia securitizations for $1.5 billion. \u2047 While we saw moves in rates during the quarter and a dramatic flattening of the yield curve after the June Fed meeting, the end-to-end coordination and efficiency with which our teams function remain a true competitive advantage. \u2047 The flexibility of our securitization program coupled with whole-loan distribution facilitates further scale as collectively they allow us to be in the market consistently. \u2047 During the second quarter, we were once again faster to market than the competition and distributing our pipeline. \u2047 Another encouraging metric was the contribution that Redwood Choice, our expanded prime product made to volumes. \u2047 Choice represented 15% of our locks in the second quarter, up materially from 5% in Q1. \u2047 Choice represented as much as 40% of our locks pre-pandemic, a reminder of how meaningful this channel can be. \u2047 In recent public remarks we continue to emphasize changes to the QM rules that we believe will be a key tailwind to Choice's reemergence. \u2047 If adopted safely the new roles focus on mortgage rate as the determinant of QM status will allow another sleeve of high quality borrowers to qualify more easily for competitive rates, an important step that underscores the true potential of the non-agency market to serve a deeper bench of consumers. \u2047 We are actively engaging with our seller base to bring this to fruition. \u2047 These macro trends also reflect meaningful talents for CoreVest, our business purpose lending platform. \u2047 The second quarter was particularly productive in BPL as we advanced several key initiatives, most notably completing our strategic investment in Churchill Finance. \u2047 CoreVest originated $527 million overall in the second quarter, up 37% from Q1. \u2047 Our funding mix consisted of $312 million of single family rental loans and $215 million of bridge loans. \u2047 Bridge production was up over 60% from Q1, an increase for the fourth consecutive quarter driven by increased usage by borrowers on lines of credit and several build-for-rent and multifamily loans coming online for funding. \u2047 The origination mix for BPL. \u2047 In the second quarter reflects the strength of our multi-product strategy, which results in high levels of repeat borrowers, including those that utilize more than one of our loan products. \u2047 In all, 67% of total originations in the second quarter were from repeat customers and the pipeline remains strong with a consistent mix of new loans and refinance opportunities. \u2047 SFR production remains strong in the second quarter with fundings up 23% from Q1. \u2047 As we discussed on our last call, the pipeline remains robust and execution has benefited from increasingly constructive securitization market. \u2047 We completed our first broadly syndicated CoreVest securitization of the year in April. \u2047 achieving all time tights on credit spreads with a deep bench of investors. \u2047 That record proved short-lived. \u2047 Last week's follow on transaction once again priced at all time tights including a spread of 57 basis points on the AAA-rated securities. \u2047 As we've seen many times before, this type of execution inevitably breeds additional competition, which we view as an opportunity for CoreVest to continue differentiating itself as the BPL market's lender of choice. \u2047 We have high expectations for our forthcoming refresh client portal, especially it's new user interface, which will make it even easier for our clients to upload documents and track progress of their loans. \u2047 Additionally, we continue to press our advantages as a nimble lifecycle lender, we're finding a product suite to continue serving the end-to-end needs of a deepening cohort of sophisticated housing investors. \u2047 Highlighting this progress is our partnership with Churchill which we expect will diversify our sourcing channels with a particular emphasis on smaller balanced single-family rental and bridge loans. \u2047 We have now closed our first purchase of bridge loans and SFR loans from Churchill and see an attractive near-term pipeline to complement our direct lending products. \u2047 In periods of increased competition, it's important to reinforce the value of an institutional platform like CoreVest in a market that in many ways is still"], "gold_summary": ["q2 gaap earnings per share $0.66.  \u2047  gaap book value per
