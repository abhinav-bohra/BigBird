{"article": ["With that, I'll now turn things over to Mike. \u2047 Let me start with an update on our ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of our workforce and have implemented policies and procedures that follow the guidelines established by the CDC, OSHA, and local health and governmental authorities to protect our workforce and contractors. \u2047 Our COVID-19 task force continually monitors and evaluates the evolving situation and responds and adjusts as the environment develops. \u2047 Turning to our third quarter performance. \u2047 Cokemaking operations performed well despite operating at turndown levels. \u2047 All of our facilities demonstrated excellent cost discipline and delivered results in line with our expectations despite the challenging macro environment. \u2047 Another significant achievement for SunCoke during the quarter was the extension of the Haverhill II contract with AK Steel for an additional two years. \u2047 That contract now expires on June 30, 2025. \u2047 This extension further illustrates the strength and long-term nature of our relationships with our customers. \u2047 During our previous quarter's earnings call, we announced that SunCoke would enter the foundry coke market. \u2047 The testing, development and capital deployment activities necessary for profitable foundry coke market production are going well, and we are excited to enter this new market with a high-quality product. \u2047 We have tested our foundry coke in Cupolas with a number of potential customers, and the results have been very encouraging. \u2047 We are now well positioned to profitably enter the foundry coke market in 2021. \u2047 We continue to execute on our revised 2020 objectives and are well positioned to achieve our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance. \u2047 Moving on to third quarter performance. \u2047 As you could see on slide four, diluted earnings per share was a loss of $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of $1.81 per share in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 The prior year period included $1.94 per share impairment charge related to our logistics goodwill and long-lived assets at CMT. Excluding this noncash charge, earnings per share was down quarter-over-quarter by $0.16, mainly due to lower volumes across the segments. \u2047 Looking at adjusted EBITDA, this came in at $47.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 versus $66.7 million in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA from the coke operations decreased $11.8 million compared to the prior year period. \u2047 Domestic sales volumes were approximately 190,000 tons lower than the prior year due to customer turndowns. \u2047 The volume shortfall was partially offset by lower operating costs. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA from the Logistics segment decreased by $5.3 million versus third quarter of 2019. \u2047 The throughput volumes at CMT and the domestic terminals were lower by approximately 1.4 million tons versus the prior year. \u2047 Slide five bridges the third quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA to the third quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 As we discussed on our second quarter conference call, in response to a challenging and unprecedented environment, we partnered with our coke customers to address their near-term coke needs. \u2047 In exchange for the extension of several coke contracts, we agreed to reduce our coke production in 2020 by approximately 550,000 tons. \u2047 Substantially all of this reduction will occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. \u2047 This volume decrease contributed to lower adjusted EBITDA from coke operations in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to the prior year. \u2047 Strong cost control partially offset the impact of these lower volumes. \u2047 The logistics operations were $5.3 million lower quarter-over-quarter due to lower volumes and lower pricing, which was again offset by lower operating costs. \u2047 Corporate expenses in the quarter includes foundry-related research and development costs of approximately $1 million. \u2047 And we're also impacted by period-over-period mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation, driven by changes in the company's share price. \u2047 Slide six details the Domestic Coke operating performance. \u2047 We sold 868,000 tons of coke in the quarter. \u2047 Sales volumes for all facilities were impacted by the volume relief provided to our customers. \u2047 Q3 2020 adjusted EBITDA per ton was approximately $56 per ton compared to $57 per ton in Q3 of 2019. \u2047 The decrease in adjusted EBITDA per ton was due to lower sales volume but was largely offset by favorable cost recovery and strong cost management. \u2047 Our plants have been diligent in lowering costs where possible by managing supplies and services, overtime, contractor usage, postponing capital work and various other efforts. \u2047 Moving to slide seven. \u2047 Logistics adjusted EBITDA was $4.3 million in Q3 of 2020 versus $9.6 million in Q3 of 2019. \u2047 CMT contributed $1.7 million to Q3 2020 adjusted EBITDA as compared to $7.4 million in Q3 2019 on comparable volume. \u2047 The deterioration of adjusted EBITDA at CMT is due largely to lower pricing. \u2047 The domestic terminals handled approximately 2.2 million tons in Q3 of 2020 versus 3.4 million tons in Q3 of 2019. \u2047 The lower volumes at domestic logistics terminals were more than offset by the measures taken to reduce costs, including a meaningful workforce reduction. \u2047 Moving on to the next slide. \u2047 You could see on the chart that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $86 million. \u2047 In the quarter, cash flow from operations generated $74.5 million, and we had capex of $16.5 million. \u2047 We paid down a portion of the revolver borrowing as working capital charges were a source of cash this quarter. \u2047 We expect working capital to reverse in the fourth quarter as we build coal inventories going into the winter and as we prepare for an increase in production for 2021. \u2047 Additionally, we paid a $0.06 per share dividend in the quarter, which was a use of cash of $5 million and today, announced the declaration of the third quarter dividend. \u2047 We established the dividend at a rate that we believe is sustainable even during challenging market conditions. \u2047 And while this is a decision made quarterly by our Board of Directors, we believe we have ample liquidity to maintain this dividend. \u2047 At the end of the quarter, on an LTM basis, our gross leverage was 3.37 times, and our net leverage was 2.98 times. \u2047 We intend to continue executing on our long-term capital allocation priorities with the primary focus on reducing gross leverage to three times or lower. \u2047 To that end, we repurchased $7.5 million face value of SXCP notes in the third quarter and an additional $33.2 million here in Q4. \u2047 Wrapping up on slide nine. \u2047 As we continue to operate during these extraordinary times, our first priority continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors. \u2047 We will continue to do everything possible to ensure that they are well-positioned, are well-protected and able to perform their jobs with confidence. \u2047 We remain focused on our core businesses and how to best-optimize our operations, including our logistics assets. \u2047 As we announced in the previous quarter, we have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure and adding near-term stability by working collaboratively with our customers to address both current market challenges and longer-term supply requirements. \u2047 We also continue to maintain our asset base to ensure that we are able to operate efficiently in the long term, even as operating levels may fluctuate in the near term. \u2047 We are proud of the investments we have made, creating the highest quality assets in the industry, which we are committed to fully utilizing and maintaining. \u2047 Finally, we are confident in the revised financial targets we have put forward and our entire organization is focused on achieving these results. \u2047 With that, we can open up for Q&A. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 loss per share $0.03.  \u2047  q3 loss per share $0.03."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports
