{"article": ["I'm Hallie Miller, Evercore's Head of Investor Relations. \u2047 These factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Evercore's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K. \u2047 We continue to believe that it's important to evaluate Evercore's performance on an annual basis. \u2047 As we have noted previously, our results for any particular quarter are influenced by the timing of transaction closings. \u2047 Let me begin by expressing my affection and respect for Ralph. \u2047 He's been an outstanding leader, partner, and friend. \u2047 I will have a lot more to say about Ralph at the end of our comments. \u2047 But first, let's talk about the quarter. \u2047 The positive environment for M&A and capital raising experience during the first half of the year extended into the third quarter. \u2047 Our results reflect this momentum and the success of our strategic initiatives aimed at broadening and diversifying our platform. \u2047 The strength and depth of our talented teams, coupled with our broad and expanding platform of capabilities, provides us with the tools and the intellectual capital to advise our clients on their most important strategic capital and financial needs. \u2047 Dollar volume of announced M&A globally was more than $1.5 trillion in the third quarter, representing a 9% sequential increase. \u2047 It was also the fifth straight quarter that announced M&A activity surpassed $1 trillion. \u2047 Strong economic conditions and thematic trends around growth and technological disruption continue to drive activity. \u2047 The ongoing high level of activity has positively affected our results, and it has sustained our backlogs as well. \u2047 Activist activity remains high with a 23% year-over-year increase in the number of new activist positions in the last 12 months. \u2047 Equity issuance continues to outpace historical levels with a greater total amount raised year-to-date than any year other than 2020 and larger than 2019 and 2018 combined. \u2047 Levels have stabilized somewhat from earlier in the year when SPAC underwriting activity was substantial. \u2047 In the private capital advisory space, momentum in capital raising for financial sponsors continues, and secondary market activity remains high, particularly activity related to single-asset structures. \u2047 The strong availability of credit and the pace of economic recovery has limited the need for traditional restructuring work. \u2047 The leverage remains elevated. \u2047 There continue to be opportunities for bespoke financings and assignments with financial sponsors and creditors. \u2047 In equities, despite the usual third quarter seasonality, we benefited from heightened volatility at the end of the quarter and our expanded offering set for clients. \u2047 In summary, with the backdrop of a strong economic environment. \u2047 Our business continues to perform exceptionally well. \u2047 Our teams are busy helping clients, and we are pleased to have the majority of our workforce back in the office in some form. \u2047 We did not see anything that would indicate an imminent pullback in the momentum, but we continue to monitor inflation, Fed actions, interest rates, the regulatory environment, supply chain disruption, and COVID's impact on the reopening process. \u2047 Of course, our results are always affected by the timing of deal closings. \u2047 With that, let me turn to key business highlights from the quarter. \u2047 We ranked number 1 in the Refinitiv League Tables for dollar volume of announced M&A, both globally and in the U.S. among independent firms for the latest 12-month period, and we rank 7 among all firms in the U.S. for the same period. \u2047 Celeste will discuss our financials in more detail later in the call. \u2047 However, I would like to highlight that we achieved a fourth straight quarter of Advisory revenues greater than $500 million, and our year-to-date advisory revenues of $1.78 billion are more than all of 2020, which was a record year for us. \u2047 Based on current consensus estimates and actual results, we expect to maintain our number 4 ranking based on advisory fees among all publicly traded investment banking firms over the last 12 months and to grow our market share relative to these same firms. \u2047 We are working on several of the top 25 announced global M&A transactions this year, including advising GE Capital Aviation on its pending $30 billion sale to AerCap Holdings, advising the board of directors of Canadian Pacific on its pending $29 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern, serving as the lead advisor to Grab on its $40 billion SPAC merger, serving as the sole advisor to Nuance on a pending $19.7 billion sale to Microsoft, and advising MGM Growth Properties on its $17.2 billion sale to VICI Properties. \u2047 Our underwriting business had another solid quarter booking more than $50 million in revenues and the pipeline for activity remained strong. \u2047 It's clear that further investment on our ECM business, including building out our sector coverage and enhancing our capabilities with convertibles, is contributing meaningfully to the growth of this business and the firm overall. \u2047 We continue to achieve increasingly better leadership positions in the ECM transactions in which we participate. \u2047 We served as active bookrunner on, approximately, 60% of the 24 equity deals and equity-linked deals we completed during the quarter. \u2047 We continue to diversify the mix of our revenues. \u2047 While healthcare still makes up the bulk of our underwriting revenues, we are seeing more variety within healthcare sector beyond biotech, as well as greater contribution from sectors such as TMT, industrials, and consumer, which in aggregate, more than tripled their share of ECM revenues in the third quarter compared to this time last year. \u2047 A few notable transactions from the quarter include: in pharma, active book runner on Ascendis Pharmacy's $450 million follow-on offering; in consumer, passive bookrunner on Olaplex's $1.8 billion IPO; in TMT, passive bookrunner on Bumble's $1.1 billion follow-on offering; in consumer, we were financial advisor to Warby Parker for its direct listing. \u2047 Even with the slowdown in the market for SPAC underwriting, we completed five during the quarter, including three as lead-left bookrunner. \u2047 We once again ranked in the top 20 for underwriting revenue as estimated by Dealogic for the latest 12-month period for deals listed on the U.S. exchanges, excluding bought deals and ATMs. We remain focused on working our way toward the top 10 for the market share. \u2047 Our work with financial sponsors in our private capital advisory groups, our secondary[Phonetic] advisory business and our primary fundraising business continue at a strong pace. \u2047 These businesses continue to show significant momentum, and their impact on our results continues to grow. \u2047 Our success here is driven by three things: first, our strong client relationships; second, our strong track record; and third, our comprehensive coverage approach, which includes the sale of assets, LP positions, and GP stakes and our capability in raising capital. \u2047 As I commented, our momentum continues to build as many of our clients are repeat clients and our reputation attracts more opportunities. \u2047 The breadth and interconnectivity of our platforms means that we can work with financial sponsors on the fundraising side, then work with them on the advisory side as they deploy capital which can then lead to the next fund raise. \u2047 In restructuring, the strong economic recovery and access to capital is enabling companies to restructure out of court. \u2047 Our team continues to work through prior assignments. \u2047 liability management engagements and creditor assignments and continues to partner with our debt advisory team in private financing activity. \u2047 In equities, we remain engaged with our clients and focused on producing and delivering high-quality research and service for them. \u2047 Clients continue to use our excellent research and value the service we provide them through our core product. \u2047 Independent third-party data indicates that while the market wallet declined in the second quarter both sequentially and year-over-year, we successfully increased our market share versus both prior periods. \u2047 In fact, we were the largest share gainer of any firm globally transacting in U.S. cash equities. \u2047 We are extremely proud that Evercore ISI was once again highly ranked in Institutional Investor's All-America Research survey. \u2047 Highlights include top-ranked independent research firm for the eighth straight year; number 2 ranked firm among all firms for analysts; record 43 individual positions and 40 team positions; and Ed Hyman and was awarded the number 1 position in economics for the 41st time. \u2047 The convertibles business that we added a year ago continues to gain momentum as we build out the team and integrate it with our capabilities in research and sales. \u2047 Finally, AUM and our Wealth Management business finished the quarter at $11.3 billion as long-term performance remains solid and new business continues to be positive. \u2047 John and I will remain in our current roles until then, at which time he will become the sole Chairman and CEO of Evercore, and I will become Chairman Emeritus. \u2047 I will have more to say about my almost 13 years here on my last earnings call in early February, but I want to say that John and I have been partners in running Evercore for the last five years, for the first 3.5 years with John as Executive Chairman and I as CEO, and for the last 15 months as Co-Chairman of the Board and Co-CEOs. \u2047 It has been a great partnership. \u2047 When I convinced John to un-retire five years ago, and it took me 18 months to convince him, it was my deep hope that he would succeed me as CEO. \u2047 Today that hope has been fulfilled. \u2047 He is beyond ready to take on this role. \u2047 He is excited about taking on this role, and I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of the firm under his leadership. \u2047 I'm also very proud that we have put in place a next generation of leadership in almost every part of the firm. \u2047 Of the four leaders of U.S. advisory, three are in their 40s. \u2047 Of our two leaders of our advisory business in Europe, one is in his early 50s. \u2047 Our CEO of Evercore ISI is in his early 50s. \u2047 Our new see FFO and our General Counsel are in their 40s. \u2047 Our new Head of ECM is in her early 40s, and our new head of Evercore Wealth Management is in his early 50s. \u2047 With these extraordinarily capable young men and women in leadership positions, our firm is in a great position for the next decade or two. \u2047 I'm also proud of the incredible strength of our culture, which truly has allowed us to thrive over the last 20 months and the last 12.5 years. \u2047 Our core values of clients first, excellence, integrity, teamwork, respect for each other, investment in our talent, and diversity, equity, and inclusion have sustained us during this very challenging period, and they will allow us to continue to gain market share in the coming years. \u2047 He often jokes about our founder, Howard Evercore, who of course never existed. \u2047 But from the beginning, he simply wanted the firm to provide high-quality honest advice to clients and to maintain the highest standards of integrity. \u2047 Roger and I have worked together in four different places, and this is the first time that we've worked closely together. \u2047 And like my partnership with John, it has been a great partnership. \u2047 Roger's a very modest man, but I don't think he would mind me saying that he is today the single best person on the planet at what he does, and he has been a great partner to me over the last 12.5 years. \u2047 Let me now talk about our growth aspirations and our return of capital approach. \u2047 Our growth aspirations have evolved over the years from our goal of achieving $1 billion in advisory revenues to becoming the largest independent investment banking advisory firm in the world and the fourth largest in advisory fees among all firms, a goal that we first achieved in 2018 and have achieved every year since. \u2047 And our goal lately is to steadily gain market share and to narrow the gap between Evercore and the top 3 global firms by advisory revenues, all of whom, of course, are universal banking firms. \u2047 The breadth and diversity of our capabilities and, of course, a strong environment for M&A and capital raising have supported our growth trajectory and our industry-leading advisory SMD productivity. \u2047 But we believe that we certainly have meaningful growth opportunities in both revenues and market share gains in the future. \u2047 We have many opportunities to seize, but let me highlight three: first, we are highly focused on filling sector and geographic white space, both in North America and in Europe in our advisory business; and on continuing our client coverage initiatives focused on financial sponsors and large multinational corporations. \u2047 Second, we are deepening and broadening our product capabilities, particularly in ECM and debt advisory, including the addition of SPAC expertise and convertibles capability so that we have more fee opportunities with each of our clients and can increase our share of fees paid by our clients. \u2047 And third, we are investing heavily in advisory capabilities that serve the fastest growing segments of the economy, including the four techs: FinTech, Biotech, Cleantech, and traditional tech, particularly software. \u2047 Hiring A-plus talent and developing strong talent from within is critical to continuing to grow, and we have made notable progress on our hiring objectives this year. \u2047 Two new advisory SMDs joined us earlier this year, Kristy Grippi as our new Head of ECM and Juan Pedro Cozar as our Head of Iberia, and they already are having significant and positive impact on our business. \u2047 Three additional Advisory SMDs, Brad Wolff covering Biotech, Brad David covering financial sponsors, and Adi Jayaraman covering FinTech have joined us, and we expect them to begin to have an impact soon. \u2047 Three additional Advisory SMDs have left their firms and will join Evercore later this year covering the power and renewable space and basic materials. \u2047 These SMD additions in 2021 put us at the top end of our historical range of four to eight Advisory SMD recruits per year, and we continue to have meaningful and ongoing conversations with other potential recruits in areas of strategic significance. \u2047 Add to that the two Advisory SMDs who were promoted earlier this year, and we have 10 new SMDs in Advisory that are ramping up in areas of strategic importance to us. \u2047 In addition to hiring at the most senior levels, we are adding talent at all levels of seniority to continue to enhance our coverage, to meet the needs of our clients, and to support the elevated pace of activity that John described. \u2047 If we can continue to hire strong talent at all levels and offer more capabilities to serve clients, we will be able to enhance our already-strong and industry-leading Advisory SMD productivity levels and continue to grow the firm. \u2047 And, of course"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts
