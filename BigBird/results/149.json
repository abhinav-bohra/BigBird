{"article": ["I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. \u2047 We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. \u2047 I hope you and your loved ones are all staying healthy. \u2047 As we all know, we're still experiencing hard times in many regions as COVID cases continue, and new variants of the virus emerge. \u2047 But I hope you share my optimism that with progress in vaccinations and continued adherence to safety protocols, better days are ahead. \u2047 The year 2020 will be remembered for COVID-19, but for Zoetis, it also reaffirms the resilience of our business, the essential nature of animal health and the agility and dedication of our colleagues in the face of industry and personal challenges. \u2047 Throughout the year, we successfully ensured colleague safety and maintained reliable supply for our customers. \u2047 We kept driving innovation and strengthening our diverse portfolio of 13 blockbusters and more than 300 product lines across eight species and seven major product categories. \u2047 We successfully launched our triple combination parasiticide, Simparica Trio. \u2047 We also achieved approvals for the first ever long-acting monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats. \u2047 With Librela's authorization for dogs in the European Union and several other markets, and Solensia's authorization for cats in Switzerland. \u2047 We also continue to build on our vaccine portfolio in livestock with the approval of our CircoMax Myco swine vaccine in the European Union. \u2047 Meanwhile, in diagnostics, we successfully launched VetScan Imagyst, a breakthrough platform using cloud based artificial intelligence for veterinary clinics. \u2047 We were able to do all this while staying anchored to our purpose and advancing the five long-term priorities, that I set out at the beginning of the year, including sustainability, where we made important progress in our ESG programs and metric reporting. \u2047 We look forward to sharing our long-term ESG goals in the coming weeks. \u2047 And finally, we delivered financial results for 2020 that were in line with the guidance we provided last February, before the impact of the global pandemic was known. \u2047 For the full year, we generated 9% operational growth in revenue primarily based on new products in our companion animal business, the continued strength of our key dermatology portfolio and growth in China. \u2047 And as part of our long-term value proposition, we once again grew revenues faster than the anticipated growth for 2020, and faster than the historical industry rates of 4% to 6%. \u2047 As part of our value proposition, we also delivered on growing our adjusted net income faster than revenue. \u2047 For the full year, we delivered operational growth of 10% in adjusted net income while adapting our operations in the pandemic and continuing investments in our pipeline and new product launches. \u2047 We generated strong fourth quarter results which Glenn will discuss in a minute, and these performance trends give us confidence in our growth drivers and strong momentum for 2021. \u2047 We expect to continue growing revenues faster than the market in 2021, driven by ongoing strength in petcare, continued expansion in markets outside the U.S., most notably China, and acceleration of our diagnostics portfolio penetration. \u2047 We are guiding operational growth of 9% to 11% in revenue for full year 2021. \u2047 Positive pet care trends during the pandemic, based on increased adoptions and people spending more time with their pets, should continue driving market growth in the near-term. \u2047 Data in the U.S., shows visits to veterinary clinics have rebounded and the average revenue per visit has continued to increase. \u2047 Over the long term, we see these trends moderating as adoption rates normalize and people eventually return to the workplace. \u2047 The Specialty Care regimens and chronic care treatments that began in the pandemic should continue, and our innovative portfolio across dermatology, parasiticide, pain, vaccines and diagnostics have us well positioned for continued growth and capturing share as these shifts occur. \u2047 In terms of livestock market, we expect low single digit market growth in 2021 as the impact from COVID-19 will still be felt, and a number of products experience loss of exclusivity. \u2047 We expect Zoetis to grow in line with the market even as we faced increased headwinds from generic competition for DRAXXIN, our leading anti-infective product. \u2047 We are confident we can leverage our lifecycle innovation strategies together with the overall diversity of our livestock portfolio, including swine product sales in China to help us address the loss of exclusivity for DRAXXIN and maintain livestock growth that will support our 2021 guidance. \u2047 Longer term, we will continue to invest in livestock innovations and data driven animal agricultural solutions. \u2047 As we continue through 2021, we will be building on the progress against our five priorities. \u2047 Driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. \u2047 Our investment plans and focus on growth for 2021 include, continuing the successful launch of Simparica Trio in the U.S. and other markets as well as the ongoing adoption of other new parasiticides, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12, driving growth in dermatology through increased use of direct-to-consumer advertising and disease awareness campaigns in the U.S. and globally. \u2047 Our focus remains on growing this market and increasing customer loyalty through our innovative treatments, which we expect to help us top $1 billion in annual sales for the first time. \u2047 As noted earlier, we will be investing in the launch of the first monoclonal antibodies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats in Europe in the first half of 2021, and advancing the regulatory process in the U.S. and other markets. \u2047 While we remain confident in the eventual U.S. approval of these products based on the safety and efficacy data we submitted, at this point, we believe it is unlikely we will receive approvals for Solensia or Librela in the U.S. in 2021. \u2047 We continue to work through regulatory reviews and manufacturing inspections with the FDA and we will continue to keep you updated on this progress on future calls. \u2047 And finally, we're continuing our development of digital and data solutions that will support more individualized animal care and more efficient and sustainable operations for producers. \u2047 In conclusion, I'm incredibly proud of what our people accomplished in the face of such uncertainties during 2020, and it gives me great confidence in our continued success and full-year guidance for 2021. \u2047 As we navigate through recovery from the global pandemic, and capitalize on the growth opportunities we see ahead, my optimism comes from what drove us over the last year. \u2047 The resilience and essential nature of animal health industry, the diversity, innovation and market leadership of our portfolio, and the agility and passion of our colleagues to face any challenge. \u2047 Now, let me hand it off to Glenn who will speak more about our fourth quarter results and guidance for the full year 2021. \u2047 We had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.7 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 billion, both exceeding the high end of our November full-year guidance range. \u2047 Full year revenue grew 9% operationally and 7% on a reported basis with adjusted net income increasing 10% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. \u2047 Going deeper into the numbers, price contributed 2% to full year operational revenue growth with volume contributing 7%. \u2047 Volume growth consisted of 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products and 1% from acquisitions, with other in-line products flat for the year. \u2047 We again saw broad-based revenue growth with the U.S. growing 11% and International growing 7% operationally. \u2047 The innovation we brought to the market and the diversity of our portfolio was key to our strong performance, as companion animal grew 17% while livestock was flat on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Performance in companion animal was led by our parasiticide portfolio, bolstered by the launch of Simparica Trio which generated revenue of $170 million. \u2047 This added approximately $150 million of incremental revenue and exceeded our expectations set prior to the pandemic. \u2047 Sales of Simparica also grew double-digits for the year with operational revenue growth of 16%. \u2047 Our key dermatology portfolio demonstrated continued strength in 2020 growing 23% operationally, generating revenue of $925 million and increasing more than $170 million versus prior year. \u2047 The COVID-19 pandemic created a difficult market environment for livestock. \u2047 However, we are encouraged by the resiliency displayed in 2020. \u2047 We remain optimistic that global livestock will return to modest growth in 2021 as the recovery from African swine fever in China continues and consumption patterns normalize. \u2047 Operational growth and adjusted net income of 10% were driven mainly by strong revenue growth and operating margin expansion. \u2047 Now, moving on to our Q4 financial results where we posted another strong quarter with revenue of $1.8 billion representing an increase of 9% operationally and 8% reported. \u2047 Adjusted net income of $438 million is an increase of 3% operationally and flat on a reported basis. \u2047 Operational revenue grew 9% with 2% from price and 7% from volume. \u2047 Volume growth of 7% consisted of 4% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 1% from other in-line products. \u2047 Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 25% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally in the quarter. \u2047 Companion animal parasiticides grew 52% in the quarter, gaining market share in the U.S. of more than 7% within the flea, tick and heartworm segment, versus the same period in the prior year. \u2047 This includes the continued adoption of Simparica Trio which generated sales of $60 million in Q4. \u2047 Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint again had significant global growth in the quarter with $257 million of revenue, representing 27% operational growth versus an extremely difficult comparative period in which key derm grew 29% for the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 Our diagnostics portfolio again made positive contributions to revenue with reference lab expansion and double-digit growth in consumables and instrument revenue. \u2047 The recovery in wellness visits continued to be a catalyst for growth following the slowdown from social distancing restrictions earlier in the year. \u2047 As we noted on our previous earnings call, the early fall cattle run pulled a portion of fourth quarter sales into the third quarter, leading to a weaker quarter in cattle than we would typically expect. \u2047 This was the primary driver of the 5% operational decline in livestock for the fourth quarter. \u2047 For the remainder of the livestock portfolio, swine posted a second consecutive quarter of growth with the herd rebuild continuing key accounts, as the market recovers from African swine fever in China. \u2047 Our aquaculture business grew high single digits in the quarter, and along with swine partially offset the decline in cattle and poultry. \u2047 Now moving on to revenue growth by segment for the quarter, U.S. revenue grew 11% with companion animal products growing 30% and livestock sales declining by 15%. \u2047 For companion animal, the positive trends at the vet clinic continued in Q4 with patient visits up 2% and revenue per visit increasing by 13%. \u2047 Companion animal growth in the quarter were driven by sales of our Simparica franchise as well as key dermatology products. \u2047 We maintained an increased investment in direct-to-consumer advertising in both therapeutic areas and continue to see a good return on that investment. \u2047 Simparica Trio performed well again in the quarter with sales of $56 million. \u2047 We remain extremely encouraged for the future growth of our product and the growth of the overall market segment as a material portion of Trio sales came from new patients to the category. \u2047 Key dermatology sales were $176 million for the quarter, growing 32% with significant growth for Apoquel and Cytopoint. \u2047 Our investments to support the franchise have been instrumental in driving more patients into the clinics. \u2047 Companion animal diagnostic sales increased 22% in the quarter as a result of reference lab expansion and growth in point-of-care instruments and consumables. \u2047 U.S. livestock declined 15% in the quarter driven primarily by cattle, which had a portion of Q4 sales pulled into the third quarter as a result of the earlier movement from pasture to feedlot. \u2047 The remaining species declined as well with COVID-19 and pricing pressure negatively impacting our swine business. \u2047 Poultry declines are largely attributed to product rotation and less producer profitability, leading to reduced usage of our premium products. \u2047 To summarize U.S performance, innovation and return on investment once again drove exceptionally strong growth in companion animal. \u2047 While livestock was down in the quarter, the results were in line with our expectations. \u2047 Revenue in our International segment grew 7% operationally in the quarter. \u2047 Companion animal revenue grew 17% operationally and livestock revenue grew 2% operationally. \u2047 Increased sales of companion animal products resulted from growth in our parasiticide portfolio, vaccines and key dermatology products. \u2047 Parasiticide growth in the quarter was again driven by the Simparica franchise with further adoption of Simparica Trio. \u2047 In Q4, we observed a series of favorable market trends, such as increased pet ownership and medicalization rates in Asia. \u2047 Overall, companion animal grew in every major market except Italy and the U.K., which had arguably the strictest lockdown protocols. \u2047 Companion animal diagnostics grew 16% in the quarter, led by an increase in point-of-care consumable usage. \u2047 Swine revenue grew 14% operationally, posting a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. \u2047 Swine sales in China grew in excess of 100% for the second straight quarter. \u2047 Key accounts expanded their use of vaccines and other products as they continue to rebuild herds from smaller farms to large-scale operations. \u2047 China total products grew 45% operationally in the quarter and 34% operationally for 2020. \u2047 Brazil was also a significant contributor to international growth in the quarter, growing 18% operationally. \u2047 For the fourth quarter and full year 2020, Brazil delivered double-digit growth in all species except poultry which modestly declined. \u2047 Overall, our International segment delivered strong results despite the challenges presented by COVID-19. \u2047 Our diversity across products and geographies enabled our international segment to again be a significant driver of growth. \u2047 Now moving on to the rest of the P&L for the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted gross margin of 67.7%, fell 80 basis points on a reported basis compared to the"], "gold_summary": ["q4 revenue $1.8 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $1.73 billion.  \u2047  sees fy
