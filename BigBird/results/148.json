{"article": ["Before we begin, I'd like to recognize all Church & Dwight employees around the world for their continued dedication to keeping our Company going during the pandemic, especially our supply chain and R&D teams as we overcame raw material shortages in Q1 as a result of the Texas freeze. \u2047 Now, let's talk about the results. \u2047 Q1 was another exceptional quarter. \u2047 Reported sales growth was 6.3%, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.83, and that's $0.03 better than our outlook. \u2047 Organic sales grew 4.9%, driven by higher consumption. \u2047 E-commerce shows no signs of slowing. \u2047 In Q1, our online sales increased by 54% year-over-year and as a percentage of total sales were 14.8% in Q1 compared to 10.2% in Q1 of 2020. \u2047 We continue to expect online sales for the full year to be 15% as a percentage of total sales. \u2047 Vaccinations will significantly influence consumer behavior. \u2047 The U.S. is slowly opening up, which means consumers are more mobile. \u2047 60% of vaccinated consumers are optimistic that they will return to a normal or new normal as we are seeing the first signs that consumers are willing to spend more time in stores based on a study by IRI. \u2047 In contrast, many countries outside the U.S. continue to experience lockdowns. \u2047 As described in the release, we have been facing shortages of raw materials due to the Texas freeze. \u2047 Raw material and transportation costs spiked higher in February and were exacerbated by the Texas freeze. \u2047 We expect the tight supply and higher input cost to continue for the balance of the year. \u2047 To mitigate the cost increases, we have announced price increases in laundry and across our international portfolio, and we have reduced couponing and promotional spending. \u2047 Rick will discuss this further in a couple of minutes. \u2047 At our Analyst Day in January, we outlined which categories and brands we expected to stay elevated throughout 2021, recover from COVID lows, decline from COVID highs and which ones would remain steady. \u2047 Overall, our full-year thinking has not changed. \u2047 To name a few categories, demand for vitamins, laundry additives and cat litter are expected to remain elevated in 2021. \u2047 Condoms, dry shampoo, power flossers and women's grooming are expected to deliver year-over-year growth as society opens up and consumers have greater mobility. \u2047 Baking soda, pregnancy test kits and oral analgesics are expected to decline from COVID highs. \u2047 Of the 16 categories in which we compete, 8 grew consumption in Q1, in some cases, on top of big consumption gains in Q1 of 2020. \u2047 Of those 8 categories, 5 saw a double-digit growth, gummy vitamins, toothache, battery-powered toothbrush, pregnancy test kits and women's electric grooming. \u2047 Household categories, such as laundry detergent and baking soda were down in the quarter and unable to comp the huge COVID-19 sales spikes seen in Q1 2020. \u2047 Looking at market shares in Q1, 8 out of our 13 power brands met or gained share within our U.S. Consumer Domestic business, which grew organic sales 5.1%. \u2047 I'll comment on a few of the brands right now. \u2047 Consumers have made health and wellness a priority. \u2047 VITAFUSION and L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins saw great consumption growth in Q1, up 24% with the help of the new launches described in the release. \u2047 It appears that new consumers are coming into the category and they're staying. \u2047 One survey showed that consumers who are new to the category had a 90% repeat rate. \u2047 WATERPIK grew consumption 15% in Q1 as it continues to recover from COVID lows and benefit from the heightened consumer focus on health and wellness. \u2047 WATERPIK is also benefiting from dental offices returning to pre-COVID patient levels. \u2047 We expect the frequency of our lunch 'n learn program to return to normal levels in the second half of this year. \u2047 While BATISTE remains impacted by social distancing, consumption was up 6%, and we achieved a record high quarterly balance share of 39%, behind our International Women's Day campaign. \u2047 Now, I want to talk about the International division. \u2047 Despite European lockdowns, our International business came through with 3.2% organic growth in the quarter, primarily driven by strong growth in our Global Markets Group. \u2047 Asia continues to be a strong growth engine for us. \u2047 WATERPIK, FEMFRESH and ARM & HAMMER led the growth for the International division in the quarter. \u2047 Our Specialty Products business delivered a positive quarter with 6% growth, primarily due to higher pricing. \u2047 Milk prices were stable in Q1 and are projected to increase later in the year due to higher demand. \u2047 Now, turning to New Products. \u2047 Innovative new products will continue to attract consumers. \u2047 In the household products portfolio, we are introducing OXICLEAN Laundry and Home Sanitizer. \u2047 It is the first and only sanitizing laundry additives that boost stain fighting and eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses. \u2047 The product is also designed for cleaning throughout the house and on a variety of surfaces. \u2047 In the personal care portfolio, VITAFUSION launched Elderberry gummies, Super Immune gummies and POWER ZINC gummies to capitalize on increased consumer interest in immunity. \u2047 WATERPIK launched WATERPIK ION, a water flosser which is 30% smaller and contains a long-lasting lithium ion battery and is specifically designed for smaller bathroom spaces. \u2047 To capitalize on its earlier success, WATERPIK SONIC-FUSION, the world's first flossing toothbrush, was upgraded to SONIC-FUSION 2.0 with two brush head sizes and two brush speeds. \u2047 And finally, FLAWLESS is taking advantage of the at-home beauty and self-care trends with a facial cleanser system, a shower wand for a full-body spa-like experience and at-home manicure and pedicure solutions. \u2047 Now, let's turn to the outlook. \u2047 We're off to a good start in Q1. \u2047 We continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8%, which is in line with our Evergreen target, despite the heightened input cost. \u2047 Given our expectations, for consumer consumption, we have raised our full year outlook for reported sales growth from 4.5% to now 5% to 6%. \u2047 Organic sales growth expectations were raised from 3% to 4% to 5%. \u2047 And if you look at consumption trends through the middle of April, 14 of our 16 categories were up in consumption year-over-year. \u2047 Now, in conclusion, I'd like to remind everyone of the many reasons to have confidence in Church & Dwight. \u2047 Our track record shows that we are positioned to do well in both good and bad times and in uncertain economic times such as now. \u2047 Categories in which we play are essential to consumers. \u2047 We have a balance sheet of value and -- pardon me, we have a balance of value and premium products. \u2047 Our power brands are number one or number two in their categories. \u2047 And we have low exposure to private label. \u2047 And with a strong balance sheet, we continue to be open to acquiring TSR-accretive businesses. \u2047 Next up is Rick to give us details on Q1. \u2047 We'll start with EPS. \u2047 First quarter adjusted EPS, which excludes the positive earn-out adjustment, was $0.83, flat to prior year. \u2047 And as we discussed in previous calls, the quarterly earn-out adjustment will continue until Q4, which is the conclusion of the earn-out period. \u2047 $0.83 was better than our $0.80 outlook, primarily due to continued increase in consumer demand for many of our products. \u2047 Reported revenue was up 6.3%. \u2047 Organic sales were up 4.9%, driven by a volume increase of 3.1% and a positive price mix of 1.8%. \u2047 Now, let's review the segments. \u2047 Organic sales increased by 5.1% due to the higher volume and positive price mix. \u2047 Overall, growth was led VITAFUSION, L'IL CRITTERS gummy vitamins, WATERPIK oral care products, FLAWLESS beauty products, ARM & HAMMER clumping cat litter and KABOOM bathroom cleaners as well as VIVISCAL hair thinning products. \u2047 Consumer International delivered 3.2% organic growth due to higher volume, partially offset by lower price and product mix. \u2047 This was a great result despite European writedowns. \u2047 For our SPD business, organic sales increased 6% due to higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume. \u2047 Milk prices have remained stable month-to-month and are projected to rise as 2021 moves forward. \u2047 Now turning to gross margin. \u2047 Our first quarter gross margin was 44.5%, a 120 basis-point decrease from a year ago. \u2047 Gross margin drag was impacted by 350 basis points of higher manufacturing costs, primarily related to commodities, distribution, tariffs and COVID impacts. \u2047 Commodities, which were exacerbated due to the Texas freeze were a 90 basis-point drag on margin. \u2047 Tariff costs negatively impacted gross margin by 40 basis points. \u2047 These costs were partially offset by a plus 190 basis points from price/volume mix and a positive 170 basis points from productivity programs as well as a 10 basis-point positive impact from favorable currency. \u2047 As a reminder, our outlook for the quarter on gross margin was down 50 basis points. \u2047 The entire variance was related to the spike in commodities and tight transportation market. \u2047 The good news is for the back half of the year, we expect margin expansion behind the pricing and promotional actions we laid out in the release as well as we start to lap some of the higher inflation and tariffs that we experienced in the back half of 2020. \u2047 Marketing was up $2.3 million year-over-year as we invested behind our brand. \u2047 Marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points to 8%. \u2047 For SG&A, Q1 adjusted SG&A increased 60 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to acquisition-related intangible amortization. \u2047 We also had higher investments within IT and R&D as well as some transition costs from the ZICAM acquisition. \u2047 Other expense all-in was $11.6 million, a $3.6 million decline due to lower interest expense from lower interest rates. \u2047 And for income tax, our effective rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 23.2% in 2020, an increase of 100 basis points, primarily driven by lower stock option exercises. \u2047 And now to cash. \u2047 For the first three months of 2021, cash from operating activities decreased 57% to $100 million due to higher cash earnings, which was offset by an increase in working capital. \u2047 Inventory is higher to support increase in sales as we continue to improve customer fill levels. \u2047 Accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased due to the timing of payments. \u2047 As of March 31st, cash on hand was $128 million. \u2047 Our full year capex plan continues to be approximately $180 million as we continue to expand manufacturing and distribution capacity, primarily focused on laundry, litter and vitamins. \u2047 For Q2, we expect reported sales growth of approximately 4.5%, organic sales growth of approximately 4% and gross margin contraction of 350 basis points as higher input costs continue and we lap artificially low promotional levels from a year ago. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.69 per share, a 10% decrease from last year's adjusted Q2 EPS. \u2047 As you read in the release, we did a voluntary recall of selected products within our vitamin business. \u2047 We expect the earnings per share impact in Q2 to be approximately $0.04 for the quarter and we are seeking reimbursement by insurance. \u2047 And now for the full year outlook. \u2047 We now expect full year 2021 reported sales growth to be 5% to 6%, which is above our previous 4.5% outlook. \u2047 We're also raising our full year organic sales growth to approximately 4% to 5%, up from the previous outlook of 3%. \u2047 Turning to gross margin. \u2047 We now expect full year gross margin to be flat for the year, primarily due to the impact of higher raw material and transportation costs and the Texas freeze in March. \u2047 We had previously expected gross margin expansion of 50 basis points for the year. \u2047 And recently, we have seen a large increase in raw materials and transportation costs. \u2047 We're absorbing $90 million of incremental costs for the full year. \u2047 Higher sales, reductions in promotions and price increases across all three of our divisions represented about one-third of our portfolio, offset a large part of the cost increases. \u2047 As a reminder, we price to protect gross profit dollars, not necessarily margin. \u2047 Our full year tax rate expectations are now 22%, higher versus our last expectations due to lower stock option exercises. \u2047 This is a $0.02 headwind versus our previous full year outlook. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share expectations continue to be in the range of $0.03 to $3.06, a 6% to 8% increase year-over-year. \u2047 Our cash from operations outlook continues to be $1 billion, while we continue to pursue accretive acquisitions. \u2047 As you heard from Matt, the Company is off to a great start, and we expect 2021 to be another strong year. \u2047 And with that, Matt and I would be happy to take any questions. \u2047 "],
