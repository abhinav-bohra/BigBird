{"article": ["Joining me in virtually today as we are all currently working from home are Mary Hall, our CFO; Robert Traub, our General Counsel; and Shane Hostetter, our Head of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer. \u2047 We have slides for our conference call. \u2047 You can find them in the Investor Relations section of our website at www. \u2047 A great deal has changed in the world in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 For us, our top priority is to protect the health and safety of our employees and our customers, while ensuring our business continuity to meet our customers' requirements. \u2047 All of our 34 plants around the world are operating and we are satisfying all of our customer needs. \u2047 I am very proud of what the Quaker Houghton team has done to continue servicing our customers as well as continuing with our integration effort, which has not missed a beat. \u2047 The second quarter was consistent with our expectations. \u2047 Overall, our sales were down 27% from the second quarter last year on a pro forma basis and down 24% from the first quarter. \u2047 I think it is helpful to understand where the 24% decline in sales from the first quarter came from and I'll first do this on a geographic basis. \u2047 The Americas declined 35%, EMEA declined 23% and Asia-Pacific declined 4%. \u2047 The declines in all three regions were primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 on our customers' businesses. \u2047 And as you could see geographically, there was a large difference between these regions. \u2047 The Americas was the most impacted as many of our customers had shutdowns or significant slowdown that lasted well into May. \u2047 EMEA was the next largest in impact as the customer shutdowns and production slowdowns were less expensive and a shorter duration than in the Americas. \u2047 Asia-Pacific declined 4%, with most of declines in India and Southeast Asia. \u2047 China sales were actually higher in the second quarter versus the first quarter as the China industrial sector returned to more normal conditions relatively quickly. \u2047 I'd also like to give you a sense of how our sales played out timing-wise during the quarter. \u2047 April was the lowest month of the quarter and May was only a little better as we saw a 1% sequential monthly increase in net sales. \u2047 Again, this is due to the many of our customers have an extended shutdowns or significantly reduced production during this period of time. \u2047 In June, we did see a much more significant improvement as net sales increased 20% from May's levels. \u2047 And we expect this sequential improvement to continue over the next several months, which I'll talk about later. \u2047 Another way to indicate the sequential quarterly sales trend is to look at what happened with our three major customer industry groups. \u2047 Metalworking declined the most and decreased 30% sequentially from the first quarter, due primarily to automotive OEM and related suppliers having prolonged shutdowns or significantly reduced production in the quarter. \u2047 Our other customer industry groups of metals and global specialty businesses were less impacted and showed declines of 21% and 16%, respectively. \u2047 I hope these different cuts of our 24% sequential sales decline help provide insight into what was happening in the quarter. \u2047 I also want to point out that we did continue to take market share despite the continued or the current difficulties in our end markets. \u2047 As our analysis continues to show, we had total organic sales growth due to net share gains of 2% in the second quarter of '20 versus the second quarter of '19. \u2047 Turning to gross margins. \u2047 Our second quarter gross margin was down from the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 The decline is primarily due to lower volumes and its impact on the fixed portion of our manufacturing costs. \u2047 What may not be apparent is that our product margins actually increased approximately 2% from last year with our raw material synergies being the vast majority of the increase. \u2047 This pandemic and its impacts has been similar in many ways to what we went through in late 2008. \u2047 Just like then, we took fast action to save costs in numerous ways. \u2047 Essentially, all discretionary expenses have been eliminated. \u2047 We stopped new hires, executive pay cuts were implemented, some positions were furloughed, and our planned capital expenditures have been cut by over 30%. \u2047 And very importantly, we reviewed our integration synergy plans in light of this situation and took additional actions as well as accelerated other synergies where possible. \u2047 And as we announced last quarter, we increased our guidance on synergy achievement. \u2047 For 2020, our current estimate is $53 million of cost synergies achieved versus our earlier estimate of $35 million. \u2047 In this quarter, we achieved $12 million of synergies and we expect sequential improvement during our future quarters. \u2047 One question we have been asked is whether this pandemic impacted our integration and the answer is that it really hasn't negatively impacted the synergy capture part of our integration plan. \u2047 I give our people tremendous amount of credit for being able to do plant shutdowns, product manufacturing site transfers, ERP implementations and various other strategic changes during this challenging work environment. \u2047 Our two years of integration planning and are paying off and we are fortunate to have this integration execution ongoing during this period to help us offset some of the volume impact, we are experiencing. \u2047 Even with these additional cost synergies, we have not done anything that will impede our business execution or strategic initiatives, including our ability to service our customers well, continue to grow above the market in the future, and further develop and execute our strategic platform. \u2047 Overall, it was a tough second quarter by any measure, but one we exited in a better place. \u2047 Also, while our EBITDA was nearly cut in half from the first quarter, we still generated good cash flow and have less net debt now by $13 million. \u2047 The positive cash flow nature of our business during severe times is something we have discussed with investors in the past and we are now seeing the positive impacts again in these tough times. \u2047 Looking ahead, we do anticipate that throughout the second half of the year, we will see gradual sequential improvement. \u2047 For example, we saw June coming stronger than the April, May lows; July was better than June and we expect continued gradual improvement that should make our third quarter performance, better than the second quarter and the fourth quarter better than the third. \u2047 However, we do not expect our business to return to the levels we experienced pre-COVID-19 by the end of the year. \u2047 Last quarter, we said that we expect our full-year adjusted EBITDA to be more than $200 million. \u2047 Based on the multiple scenarios we have simulated in our forecasting, we continue to expect this to be the case. \u2047 So nothing has really changed from what I mentioned last quarter about the full year. \u2047 Also, we do not expect to have any liquidity or bank covenant issues. \u2047 Overall, our higher expected synergies, additional cost saving actions, improvement in our product margins and our cash flow management are expected to continue to help us during this period of time when our volumes are down versus pre-COVID levels. \u2047 And if we look forward to 2021 and 2022, I continue to be optimistic about our future and I still expect us to achieve significant increases in our adjusted EBITDA as we complete our integration cost synergies, continue to take share in the marketplace, and benefit from a projected gradual rebound in demand in our end markets over this period. \u2047 I am so proud of how our team has performed in servicing our customers, meeting their needs, and successfully continuing with our integration execution, which is both critical and difficult for us this year. \u2047 People are everything in our business and by far our most valuable asset and ensuring their safety and well-being is and will continue to be a top priority for us. \u2047 We just celebrated our one-year anniversary of our combination and I'm proud of and very happy with our Quaker Houghton team and what we have and will be able to accomplish for our customers and investors both now and going forward. \u2047 These are available on our website. \u2047 Please also note that we updated our risk factors in our Form 10-Q following our Q1 update to address the evolving COVID-19-related issues and these risk factors should be reviewed along with those in our 2019 Form 10-K. \u2047 Reconciliations are provided in the appendix of this investor deck. \u2047 We followed a similar review format for this deck as the one we used during our last couple of calls post combination where our comparison periods show actual and non-GAAP results as well as pro forma sales and pro forma adjusted EBITDA as if we had been combined with Houghton throughout the periods presented. \u2047 So please see slides 6 through 8 now while I review some highlights. \u2047 As Mike noted, the precipitous decline in volumes we began to see in the latter half of March continued into April. \u2047 We expected April to be the trough in volumes, and it was with slightly better performance in May, and in June, we saw more meaningful improvement in volumes and performance as Mike mentioned. \u2047 So, while our actual sales are up significantly to $286 million in Q2 compared to $206 million in the prior year, this is due to the inclusion of Houghton and Norman Hay. \u2047 On a pro forma basis, including Houghton in Q2 of last year, net sales declined about 27%. \u2047 Most of this decline was due to the COVID-19 impact on volumes. \u2047 But we also saw a negative foreign exchange impact on the top line of about 4%, due primarily to the significant weakening of the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso and the RMB versus the dollar. \u2047 These negative impacts were partially offset by the inclusion of Norman Hay. \u2047 Our gross margin of 34% for Q2 was down from 36.5% in the prior year quarter, which we attribute primarily to the steep decline in volumes and the related impact on fixed manufacturing costs. \u2047 As Mike mentioned, we realized meaningful procurement synergies in the quarter and our product margins were up approximately 2%, which was masked by the impact of fixed manufacturing costs on our significantly lower volumes. \u2047 As volumes pick up, we expect the benefits to our gross margin to be more visible and fall to the bottom line. \u2047 The drag from COVID is also evident in our non-GAAP operating income of $11.2 million compared to $25.5 million in Q2 of '19 and $36 million in Q1 of 2020. \u2047 Similarly, our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.21 was down from $1.56 in Q2 of last year and $1.35 sequentially. \u2047 Our effective tax rate in the current quarter was 57.9% compared to 24.2% in Q2 of last year. \u2047 This quarter's elevated rate was primarily driven by an adjustment to tax reserves related to certain tax credits we acquired with Houghton and also to an adjustment relating to certain foreign tax audits. \u2047 Excluding all unusual items, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2020 will be in the range of 22% to 25%. \u2047 As Mike mentioned earlier, our Q2 adjusted EBITDA $32.1 million is in line with our guidance at roughly half of our Q1 adjusted EBITDA of $60.5 million. \u2047 And we continue to expect our full-year adjusted EBITDA will be more than $200 million. \u2047 With the decline in adjusted EBITDA, our net leverage has picked up about 0.2 times to 3.7 times on a reported basis and 3.1 times on a bank calculated basis, which is still comfortably below our bank covenant of 4.25 times. \u2047 We stress tested our projections for this year under multiple scenarios as Mike mentioned and expect no problem in remaining in compliance with our bank covenants. \u2047 And we have strong liquidity to support these uncertain times. \u2047 In addition, we're benefiting from the current low interest rate environment as the average interest rate on our debt is now about 1.9% as compared to 2.4% at March 31. \u2047 A bright spot in the quarter was our cash flow. \u2047 We're pleased to report that our operating cash flow doubled year-to-date to $44.7 million versus first half of last year of $22.4 million. \u2047 In addition, our Q2 operating cash flow of $24.5 million exceeded the prior quarter of $20.2 million. \u2047 This positive cash flow trend is primarily due to improved working capital. \u2047 As we've discussed in the past, the company has a very asset-light business model where the majority of capital deployed is in working capital and not in property, plant and equipment. \u2047 When general economic or industry crisis occur and stress sales, we generate cash through the release of working capital. \u2047 We saw this in the 2008-2009 crisis, and we are seeing it now. \u2047 In addition, our low capital intensity allows us flexibility in our capex spending and we're on pace to reduce capex by about 30% from our initial combined company estimates as we mentioned last quarter. \u2047 As Mike mentioned, it was a tough quarter. \u2047 But we're encouraged by some positive trends in business performance and the increase in cash flow I just mentioned, as well as the $12 million of cost synergies realized this quarter. \u2047 In addition, the increase in total synergies we expect to realize this year, which is up from $35 million to $53 million and the disciplined cost reduction actions we've taken will help mitigate the impact this difficult economic and business environment. \u2047 In summary, our track record of weathering tough economic environments through gaining share, cost reductions, and generating good cash flow during major downturn, all give us confidence in our ability to weather the storm. \u2047 More importantly, we've positioned our company need to leverage the future upswing in business activity when it occurs. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q2 sales $286 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $290.4 million.  \u2047  q2 non-gaap earnings per share $0.21
