{"article": ["Also during the course of today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. \u2047 We will begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter. \u2047 We're very pleased to report that in the third quarter, we continued our year-over-year double-digit growth in our key financial performance metrics, led by a very robust top line. \u2047 The top line results were broad-based across our agencies, geographies and disciplines. \u2047 Our growth was especially strong in CRM Precision at 24%. \u2047 Our CRM Precision Group is helping clients on their MarTech transformation, digital and e-commerce communications and direct-to-consumer marketing. \u2047 The group has played a key role in many of our recent new business wins where, overall, we continued our very strong momentum in Q3. \u2047 Broadly, across our group, growth was driven by improved economic conditions. \u2047 Omnicom's suite of services and capabilities are positioning us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace to: reimagine and strengthen our clients' brands, seamlessly connect them with their customers across their marketing journey, transform their marketing technology platforms and innovate in e-commerce and new media channels. \u2047 Our revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit in bottom line. \u2047 Our EBIT margins for the third quarter were 15.8%, which exceeded our 2020 margins and significantly outpaced the comparable period in 2019. \u2047 Net income and earnings per share for the quarter grew by more than 13% versus 2020 and were also significantly above our 2019 results. \u2047 As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned competitively and expect to benefit as economic growth continues to improve globally and from ongoing cost management. \u2047 We currently expect our full year organic growth to be approximately 9% and our full year EBIT margin to exceed our year-to-date margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 of 15.1%. \u2047 Going forward, we remain focused on our key strategic initiatives, which is centered around our talent, dedication to creativity and building on our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights. \u2047 In the third quarter, we made progress across these strategic initiatives as we announced three acquisitions. \u2047 Omnicom Media Group acquired Jump 450 Media, a performance marketing agency. \u2047 The company leverages algorithmic scaling strategies, rapid creative testing and data analytics to optimize digital media spend and drive customer acquisition. \u2047 Jump 450 will form the foundation for a dedicated performance media platform and business operation within OMG. \u2047 Its focus on e-commerce and pure performance marketing will strengthen and add a distinct set of capabilities to OMG's existing performance media offerings. \u2047 Also in late September, we announced the acquisition of two German-based companies: antoni and OSK. \u2047 antoni is one of the most innovative and creative agencies in Europe and was born with data and digital capabilities at its core. \u2047 antoni's creative leadership and depth of talent will significantly strengthen our capabilities in Europe and around the globe. \u2047 OSK has been in the top-10 of PR and comms agencies in Germany since 2008 and is the undisputed number-one for automotive. \u2047 It provides a broad portfolio of services at the intersection of PR and social media and excels in the convergence of technology, mobility and communications. \u2047 Our ability to bring together the brightest talent and data-driven consumer insights from across our organization to deliver holistic and integrated brand experiences is proving to be highly successful in our new business opportunities as well as in servicing our existing clients. \u2047 Following on the heels of Philips naming Omnicom their global integrated service partner for creative and media communications, in the third quarter, Mercedes-Benz appointed Omnicom its global marketing communications partner. \u2047 One of the world's most iconic brands, Mercedes-Benz is today the leading luxury automotive experience company. \u2047 TMX, a dedicated team from across our groups, will bring together the best-in-class talent and capabilities across Mercedes-Benz' customer journey with expertise in media and CRM, brand and performance creator, web personalization and content automation, public relations and events as well as paid and organic social. \u2047 And just last week, we won the Chanel media business globally, adding another iconic global brand. \u2047 As in all our significant wins as well as for our existing clients, our teams are able to showcase our creativity, better analysis and predictive insights and technology capabilities to deliver connected, personalized and seamless brand experiences for their respective customers at all touch points of the consumer journey. \u2047 One key differentiator for Omnicom in servicing our clients is our cohesive culture that binds us together. \u2047 It's a culture of creativity, flexibility and caring that are common values shared across our group. \u2047 I often hear from clients that a deciding factor in their decision to hire Omnicom is that our people who bring distinct specialized skills to them, know and respect one another and genuinely collaborate. \u2047 Our ability to integrate services from across our marketing disciplines is underpinned by Omni, our open operating system that orchestrates better outcomes. \u2047 Omni is built for collaboration, acting as a conductor between different specialists using a single processing workflow from insights to execution. \u2047 It empowers our people and our clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI. \u2047 Omni also provides better intelligence by orchestrating first-, second- and third-party data sets to present a single comprehensive view of consumers. \u2047 Our teams can then develop insights to create, plan and deliver the most impactful messages, content and communications to them at each stage of that consumer journey. \u2047 Omni is a unique and powerful tool for us, and we now have over 40,000 Omnicom colleagues provisioned on the platform in over 60 countries. \u2047 Hundreds of our clients, including all of our top-20, utilized Omni. \u2047 Moreover, the open-source system enables our practice areas like commerce, health and PR to customize Omni with different data sources for their clients. \u2047 For example, Omnicom Health Group created a custom offering called Omni Health. \u2047 Since rolling it out in April of this year, OHG has leveraged the platform to play a key role in expanding the group's omnichannel offering with new and existing clients, including AstraZeneca and Janssen, XARELTO, to name a few. \u2047 In summary, even during the pandemic, we accelerated the strength of our services, capabilities and organization to deliver better outcomes for our clients and win new business. \u2047 Our offering is powerful and differentiated. \u2047 We have best-in-class talent and creativity using best-in-class operating systems and technologies. \u2047 It's a formula that will continue to win for us. \u2047 Throughout one of the most difficult times in recent history, our people have shown ingenuity, resilience and strength. \u2047 We continue to spend and invest in training and development programs for all of our people from basic skills training all the way through the advanced programs of Omnicom University. \u2047 We recently expanded the curriculum for our DE&I and OPEN2.0 strategies. \u2047 As the pandemic continues to present a substantial health risk, the well-being of our colleagues remains our top priority. \u2047 We are ensuring we have a safe work environment and are offering a variety of programs for managers and individuals to support their wellness, resilience and health at work. \u2047 I recently traveled to several of our U.S. and European offices and have met with many colleagues and clients who are happy to be back in the office. \u2047 We are looking at many alternatives to provide our people a safe return back to the office. \u2047 For example, this week, we're testing a private transportation service for New York City-based colleagues. \u2047 In the months ahead, we look forward to welcoming more of our staff back with a continuing priority on their safety and flexibility. \u2047 It is truly our world-class talent and our dedication to creativity and innovative solutions that drive real business outcomes for our clients. \u2047 A key recent proof point reflecting the quality of our talent is Omnicom being named the Most Effective Holding Company in the U.S. by the 2020 [Technical Issues] report. \u2047 Overall, we're extremely pleased with the third quarter. \u2047 I'm proud to see that our strategic focus and the decisions we made throughout the pandemic are now leading to positive results. \u2047 Our results once again reflect Omnicom's ability to adapt and respond to the changes in the market and deliver through economic cycles. \u2047 While the impact of the pandemic continues to be felt across the globe, that impact has continued to moderate significantly as evidenced by our continued growth in the third quarter. \u2047 Slide 3 shows our third quarter improvement across our income statement, where our revenue growth and expense control drove an 8% increase in operating profit. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 24.1%, down from our estimated effective rate for 2021 of between 26.5% and 27%. \u2047 This was primarily due to the favorable settlement of uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions, the impact of which was approximately $10 million. \u2047 These items positively impacted net income and diluted earnings per share, which was $1.65, up $0.20 or 13.8% versus Q3 of last year and up $0.33 versus the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 So our growth continues on this important metric as well. \u2047 And finally, our $0.70 quarterly dividend, which was raised back in February, is 7.7% higher than last year. \u2047 Let's now flip to Slide 4 and look at the quarter in more detail, beginning with revenues. \u2047 Our total revenue growth was 7.1%. \u2047 Organic growth for the quarter was 11.5% or $367 million, which represents a significant improvement compared to Q3 of 2020 when the pandemic drove an organic revenue decline of 11.7%. \u2047 The impact of foreign exchange rates increased our revenue by 1.6% in the quarter as the dollar continued to weaken against most of our larger currencies compared to the prior year. \u2047 If FX rates stay where they were on October 15, we expect foreign exchange to decrease our reported revenue by approximately 1% for the fourth quarter and increase our reported revenue by 2% for the full year. \u2047 The impact on revenue from net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 5.9%. \u2047 Based on transactions that have been completed through September 30, 2021, our estimate is the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the balance of the year will decrease reported revenue by approximately 7% in the fourth quarter and by approximately 4% for the full year. \u2047 While we will continue our process of evaluating our portfolio of businesses as part of our strategic planning, as John has said regarding dispositions, we are substantially complete. \u2047 Advertising, our largest discipline at 53% of our total revenues, posted 8.6% organic growth with very strong performance from both our creative agencies and our media agencies. \u2047 Please note that reported Advertising growth is down 0.4%, due primarily to the disposition of ICON in Q2 of 2021. \u2047 Our agencies focused on direct, digital and marketing transformation consulting services in our precision marketing discipline also posted strong organic growth at 24.3%. \u2047 With the exception of the second quarter of 2020, this discipline has been a consistent grower for some time and has become a larger portion of our business each quarter. \u2047 CRM Commerce and Brand Consulting was up 18%, with our branding agencies leading the discipline's performance. \u2047 CRM Experiential was up 50%. \u2047 This business declined far more than our other disciplines in the third quarter of last year during the pandemic and has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to various global restrictions. \u2047 However, this remains an important area for our clients, and we look forward to further growth as global economies continue lifting social distancing restrictions. \u2047 CRM Execution & Support was up 8.3%, reflecting a recovery in client spend compared to the prior year in our field marketing businesses, while our research businesses continued to lag. \u2047 PR was up 10.5%. \u2047 We have a positive outlook for the discipline, especially within our global agencies, as clients adjust to the new post pandemic realities. \u2047 And finally, our Healthcare discipline was up 6.6% organically. \u2047 Healthcare was the only one of our service disciplines that had positive organic growth during the depths of the pandemic and continue to perform well. \u2047 Flipping to Slide 6, our revenue by region. \u2047 The key takeaway is that all of our geographies again posted solid organic growth. \u2047 This growth was driven by virtually every discipline within each region. \u2047 Outside the U.S., where total organic growth was 16%. \u2047 Double-digit growth in each region was led by Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia. \u2047 Our advertising, media and PR agencies performed well with double-digit growth, and our precision marketing agencies were sizable contributors and also posted strong double-digit growth. \u2047 In addition, experiential growth outside the U.S. was over 100% in total. \u2047 In the U.S., we generated 7.7% organic growth, which was boosted by strong double-digit growth in our precision marketing and PR disciplines as well as solid growth at our healthcare agencies. \u2047 The last revenue view I'd like to share with you is by industry sector on Slide 7. \u2047 The change in mix by sector in the portfolio was small on a year-to-date basis when compared to last year. \u2047 In summary, our revenue performance was very strong across the board on both a reported and organic basis and when analyzed by discipline, geography or industry sector. \u2047 To make the analysis more relevant, we have also included a supplemental slide in the appendix that shows the 2021 amounts presented in constant dollars. \u2047 Beginning with our largest category, salary and service costs. \u2047 These costs increased by 7.6% in total, and they tend to fluctuate with the change in revenue. \u2047 We would also note that Q3 2020 salary and service cost amounts were reduced by reimbursements received from government programs of $68.7 million. \u2047 As we continue to look forward, we expect a healthy advertising and marketing spending outlook, and strong demand from our clients will necessitate an increase in staffing. \u2047 The tight labor market will create challenges in the near term that we are confident our management teams will overcome. \u2047 Moving down the P&L. \u2047 Third-party service costs, which fluctuate with changes in revenue, decreased 6.9% during the quarter due to our net disposition activity, primarily related to the disposition of ICON and partially offset by the organic growth in revenue as well as the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes. \u2047 Occupancy and other costs, which are not directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.5% year-on-year or 2.9% when excluding foreign exchange rate translation impacts. \u2047 As expected, these good results continue"], "gold_summary": ["q3 earnings per share $1.65.  \u2047  operating margin for q3 of 2021 increased to 15.8% compared to 15.6% for q3 of 2020.  \u2047  qtrly increase in revenue from organic growth of 11.5%.  \u2047  global economic conditions may continue to be volatile as long as covid-19 remains which could negatively impact clients' spending plans.  \u2047  organic growth in third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 increased across all of co's fundamental disciplines.  \u2047  expect global economic performance of businesses to vary by geography and discipline until covid19 impact on global economy subsides."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share $1.65.  \u2047  q3 earnings
