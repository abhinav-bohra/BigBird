measures are adjusted net loss, adjusted net income, adjusted loss per share, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating loss, adjusted operating profit, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 We're using these non-GAAP measures today because they allow us to compare performance consistently over various periods without regard to non-recurring items. \u2047 In addition, RPC is required to use

revenues decreased to $236 million compared to $376.8 million in the prior year. \u2047 Revenues decreased due to lower activity levels resulting from a more pronounced fourth quarter seasonal decline

$19.7 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $23.2 million compared to EBITDA of $61.7 million in the same period of the prior year. \u2047

expenses and other expenses associated with lower activity levels. \u2047 In addition, cost of revenues declined due to lower employment costs as a result of our downsizing. \u2047 Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to significantly lower activity levels and more competitive pricing for our services. \u2047 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $36.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to $40 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year and this was due to lower employment costs. \u2047 Depreciation and amortization expense was $40.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of 5.2% compared to $42.6 million in the prior year. \u2047 Technical Services segment revenues for the quarter decreased 38.7% compared to the

expenses decreased to $36.8 million during the fourth quarter of the current year compared to $42.6 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 RPC generated an adjusted operating loss of $17.3 million

in the prior quarter. \u2047 Our Technical Services segment revenues decreased by 55.6%[Phonetic] or 20.3% to $218.9 million in the fourth quarter. \u2047 The Technical Services segment incurred a

pressure pumping fleet totaled approximately 735,000 hydraulic horsepower. \u2047 Fourth quarter 2019 capital expenditures were $41.4 million and the full-year total of $250.6 million and we currently estimate 2020 capex to be approximately $80 million. \u2047 As 2020 begins, we are focused on improving utilization and well site execution as well as effectively managing our costs. \u2047 We believe the actions taken as a result of our strategic assessment better align our operations with current market conditions. \u2047 Despite the challenging environment during 2019 and approximately $250 million of capital expenditures, we ended the year with $50 million in cash and no debt. \u2047 We will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and allocate capital to maximize long-term shareholder returns. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted loss per share $0.07.  \u2047  q4 revenue $236 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $237.6 million.  \u2047  qtrly revenue decreased
