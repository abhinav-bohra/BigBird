{"article": ["I'll start by acknowledging the sad and disturbing recent events in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area and across the nation that began with the horrific death of one of our community members George Floyd. \u2047 Our hearts go out to the family and friends of Mr. Floyd and the communities directly affected. \u2047 Regrettably, these events are representative of larger social and systemic issues. \u2047 As our communities work together through these tragic circumstances, we must stand for what is right. \u2047 The Toro Company has a long-standing focus on the importance of respect for all in our workplaces, in how we conduct business, and in the communities we serve. \u2047 In addition to the events of the past week, we all continue to deal with the effects of COVID-19. \u2047 We hope all of you and your families are safe during this difficult time. \u2047 It was humbling to see how so many people and organizations moved forward without hesitation to do what was needed to help others as the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world. \u2047 In response to the coronavirus, we prioritized the safety, well-being and support of our employees, customers and communities. \u2047 In addition to our value of respect for all as previously mentioned, some of our other core people values include carrying relationships, trust and integrity. \u2047 Even through significant personal and family challenges, our team has transformed the way we work to protect the safety of one another, support our customers, and help our communities. \u2047 I am deeply grateful for all of our employees around the world, many who are coming into our facilities each day, to develop, test, build and ship our products. \u2047 The team's flexibility, resourcefulness and resolve is being demonstrated as we've acted to make our facilities safe and implement work-from-home policies. \u2047 At the same time, we are maintaining the critical functions of our manufacturing operations. \u2047 All of this is vital, given The Toro Company's standing as an essential business. \u2047 In support of our communities, we launched a special COVID-19 giving initiative called Together We Can Do More. \u2047 Through this initiative, we directly donate and match all employee contributions made to COVID-19 relief efforts. \u2047 In addition, The Toro Foundation contributed $500,000 to organizations supporting families and communities most directly affected by the pandemic. \u2047 Recognizing the financial strain among our employees and their families, we expanded the availability of the Melrose/Hoffman Employee Critical Need Fund. \u2047 Additional voluntary contributions were made to that fund by our leadership team and the Board of Directors. \u2047 To quote our legendary former Chairman and CEO, Ken Melrose who sadly passed away last month, everyone has the potential to contribute to achieving the goals of the company. \u2047 If you unleash that potential, success will be a natural byproduct. \u2047 These words mean a lot coming from Ken who successfully led The Toro Company through some of the most challenging times in our history. \u2047 I will turn now to our business and financial review. \u2047 From a business perspective, our focus has been on maintaining ample liquidity, growing our position in the market, and balancing short and long-term objectives. \u2047 Our results this quarter were net sales sales of $929 million, down 3.4% from the prior year, primarily due to reduced Professional segment retail demand as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.92, down 21.4% from the prior year. \u2047 To provide specific information by business segments, in the Professional segment, total net sales were $661 million, down 8.6%. \u2047 Sales benefited from incremental contributions from the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions. \u2047 This quarter, we passed the one-year anniversary of the Charles Machine Works acquisition. \u2047 We are fortunate to have this business and its employees as part of our company. \u2047 Charles Machine Works added scale and diversification to our portfolio, open access to new markets and provided additional opportunities for synergy and value creation across the company. \u2047 We are on track to achieve or exceed our stated synergy targets. \u2047 Offsetting the gains from acquisitions were declines in most of our Professional businesses as a result of soft retail demand due to COVID-19. \u2047 The declines were most pronounced in commercial golf and grounds which saw fewer shipments of turf equipment and irrigation products. \u2047 This was driven by budget deferrals at golf course and municipalities, landscape contractor businesses which had fewer shipments as our channel partners aligned field inventory levels which reduced retail demand and rental specialty and underground construction businesses which have experienced reduced sales volumes as a result of global economic slowdown and impact on the construction and oil and gas markets. \u2047 It's important to note the Professional segment performance was tracking consistent with our expectations of modest growth until mid-March. \u2047 In April, we experienced additional and significant declines in most of our Professional markets. \u2047 We typically do not discuss the current quarter in our earnings calls. \u2047 However, we appreciate that this quarter is very different. \u2047 So, we'll share some color on what happened in May. \u2047 For the Professional segment, it was largely a story of new equipment purchase deferrals and focus on service and repair. \u2047 We're seeing continued challenges across golf and grounds, landscape contractor, and rental specialty and underground construction businesses. \u2047 These challenges stem more from lower budgets and deferred purchases than from temporary facility closures. \u2047 For golf, most play has resumed and demand for rounds has been robust. \u2047 However, lower food and beverage and event revenue has negatively affected club budgets, putting pressure on new equipment purchases. \u2047 For our municipal grounds customers, budgets have been lowered or diverted to non-ground support which has resulted in reduced equipment demand. \u2047 The repair and defer story is the same with landscape contractors. \u2047 However, with the lessening of stay-at-home restrictions, there were some improvements in these categories starting in late May. \u2047 In rental, specialty and underground construction, 5G infrastructure and broadband spending increased modestly in May with high demand for system capacity as a result of stay-at-home orders. \u2047 Underground infrastructure, rehab and repair projects remained steady. \u2047 However, this is being offset by continued construction and oil and gas project softness, reduced capital spending from national rental accounts resulting in new equipment purchase deferrals and lower dealer retail. \u2047 In the Residential segment, sales were up 12.9% in the second quarter. \u2047 This was mainly driven by incremental shipments to our expanded mass retail channel and strong retail demand. \u2047 Some of the demand drivers were favorable spring weather, new products and consumers focusing on home and garden improvements during stay-at-home orders. \u2047 Our product sales through captive and partnered e-commerce sites were up significantly in the second quarter. \u2047 For May, Residential segment momentum continued, driven by the same trends. \u2047 Regarding operations, all of our facilities are currently open with some operating at reduced capacity. \u2047 During the second quarter, some sites closed temporarily due to government orders or to manage inventory levels. \u2047 We will continue to align production to customer demand, comply with government orders and ensure the safety of our teams. \u2047 We had no supplier-related shutdowns in the quarter. \u2047 Regarding cash and financial flexibility, we continue to have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. \u2047 We took measures in the quarter to ensure that we have sufficient cash given the economic climate. \u2047 For the remainder of fiscal 2020, we are taking, across the board, pay cuts inclusive of leadership and eliminating merit increases and discretionary retirement plan contributions. \u2047 We also reduced expenses and paused new hires except for critical positions. \u2047 At the same time, we have preserved jobs and retained key talent. \u2047 We continue to benefit from productivity initiatives and enterprise synergy opportunities as a result of recent acquisitions. \u2047 As with past periods of economic challenge, we know what works and how to play to our strengths. \u2047 Our culture and business management approach are well adapted to respond to uncontrolled external variables. \u2047 While certain factors do lie out of our control, our diverse portfolio and flexibility, help us adjust to shifting situations, while continuing to provide long-term growth and sustained free cash flow. \u2047 We will continue to invest in the future for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. \u2047 The Toro Company is comprised of a balanced portfolio of products that enhance our customers' productivity across the seasons. \u2047 The company has a strong balance sheet that enables us to allocate capital effectively among a variety of alternatives, including new product development, acquisitions, dividends, debt pay down and share repurchases. \u2047 Q2 was no exception. \u2047 While the COVID-19 pandemic affected our results, we were able to adjust our operations and move the business forward. \u2047 We reported net sales of $929 million in the quarter, a 3.4% decrease from the second quarter of fiscal 2019. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share was $0.91 for the quarter compared to $1.07 last year. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.92, down 21.4% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. \u2047 For the first six months of fiscal 2020, net sales increased 8.4%. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share was $1.55 compared to $1.62 in the first six months of fiscal 2019. \u2047 Year-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.56 compared to $1.69 a year ago. \u2047 Before I review segment results, I'll cover liquidity. \u2047 Back in March, we entered into a three-year term loan agreement for $190 million. \u2047 This was to refinance our revolving credit facility borrowings, incurred in connection with Venture Products acquisition which closed on March 2. \u2047 With the funding of this new term loan, the company now has liquidity of approximately $800 million including cash and cash equivalents of $200 million and availability under our revolving credit facility of approximately $600 million. \u2047 We have no significant debt maturities until April 2022. \u2047 We continue to work closely with our banking partners and monitor credit markets. \u2047 Receivable collections continue to track similar to last year. \u2047 All of this gives us confidence in our ability to weather the current and potentially extended period of macroeconomic uncertainty. \u2047 I'd like to provide more color and some of the actions we've taken so far to maintain the strength of the company given the unprecedented speed and depth of the pandemic. \u2047 From a demand perspective, we've executed business continuity plans and work to ensure product availability in areas where demand remains strong such as in our Residential segment. \u2047 Additionally, we scaled back production in areas where demand was weaker. \u2047 As Rick discussed, we have taken actions to align costs with near-term demand and we'll continue to look for ways to make our cost structure more flexible and competitive. \u2047 Meanwhile, we focus on maintaining productivity and synergy intiatives which were driven by recent acquisitions and then extended across the enterprise. \u2047 Now, to the segment results. \u2047 For the second quarter, Professional segment net sales decreased 8.6% to $661 million. \u2047 The top line benefited from the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions which together added incremental net sales of $142 million. \u2047 Professional segment sales declined compared to the second quarter of 2019, due to lower shipments driven by COVID-related demand pull back. \u2047 Until mid-March and the impact of COVID-19, sales were tracking to modest growth in line with our expectations. \u2047 We saw a modest sales decline in the second half of March and a more significant reduction in April as compared to prior-year performance. \u2047 For the year-to-date period of fiscal 2020, net sales increased 6.6% compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. \u2047 Professional segment operating earnings for the second quarter decreased 29.2% to $106 million, reflecting a 460 basis point decline in segment operating earnings as a percent of sales, primarily due to manufacturing variance as a result of COVID-19 related facility closures and social distancing initiatives, incremental marketing, engineering and administrative costs as a result of the Charles Machine Works and Venture Products acquisitions, higher warranty expense and unfavorable product mix. \u2047 This was partially offset by favorable net price realizations, productivity and synergy gains, lower commodity and tariff costs and decreased incentive compensation expense. \u2047 Year-to-date Professional segment operating earnings declined 12.3% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. \u2047 Professional segment operating earnings decreased 360 basis points to 16.6%. \u2047 Residential segment net sales for the second quarter were up 12.9% $262 million, mainly driven by incremental shipments of zero turn riding and walk power mowers to the expanded mass retail channel as well as strong retail demand. \u2047 Year-to-date fiscal 2020 net sales increased 13.4% compared to the same period of fiscal 2019. \u2047 Residential segment operating earnings were up 68.5% to $37 million. \u2047 This reflects a 470 basis point year-over-year increase in segment operating earnings to 14.2%. \u2047 This improvement was largely driven by productivity and synergy gains, lower commodity and tariff costs, lower freight costs and SG&A leverage. \u2047 This was partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing variance and higher warranty expense. \u2047 Year-to-date Residential segment operating earnings increased 67.2% to $58.7 million. \u2047 On a percent of sales basis, segment earnings increased 440 basis points to 13.7%. \u2047 Moving to our operating results. \u2047 We reported gross margin for the second quarter of 33%, a decrease of 40 basis points over the prior year period. \u2047 Excluding acquisition-related charges and one-time costs associated with the inventory writedown of the Toro branded underground business, adjusted gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 33.4%. \u2047 The decrease in adjusted gross margin was primarily driven by manufacturing variance due to production downtime and inefficiencies as a result of COVID-19 related closures and product mix with higher Residential segment net sales compared to Q2 of 2019. \u2047 This was partially offset by productivity and synergy gains, favorable net price realizations within our Professional segment and lower commodity and tariff costs. \u2047 For the first six months of fiscal 2020, gross margin was 35.1% compared with 34.3% in the prior year period. \u2047 Adjusted gross margin was 35.3% compared with 34.9% in the first six months of fiscal 2019. \u2047 SG&A expense as a percent of sales increased 40 basis points to 19.5% for the quarter due to incremental marketing and engineering costs as a result of the Professional segment acquisitions as well as higher warranty expense. \u2047 These cost increases were partially offset by decreased incentive compensation costs and lower transaction and integration costs. \u2047 SG&A expense as a percent of sales for the first six months of fiscal 2020 was 22.3%, up 130 basis points from the prior year period. \u2047 Operating earnings as a percent of net sales decreased 80 basis points to 13.5% for the second quarter. \u2047 Adjusted operating earnings as a percent of net sales decreased 240 basis points to 14%. \u2047 For the first six months of fiscal 2020, operating earnings"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share of $0.91.  \u2047  q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.92.
