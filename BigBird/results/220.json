and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. \u2047 2020 was a challenging year, marked by a global pandemic, economic disruption and unrest due to racial injustice. \u2047 It was a true test to our resilience, our agility and our strength as a business. \u2047 We're proud of the way Synchrony managed through these challenges. \u2047 Though there have been significant developments that provide hope that the pandemic will begin to moderate, the virus resurgence and resulting regional shutdown and continued impact on unemployment is something we are still managing through. \u2047 And though the pandemic continues to impact results, we are encouraged by some of those trends that have developed. \u2047 Later in the call, Brian Wenzel will detail these impacts on the quarter's results and provide a view on how we think this year might develop. \u2047 I will provide a high-level overview here. \u2047 Let's first focus on our quarterly results, including some of our recent successes, which are outlined on slides three and four. \u2047 Earnings were $738 million or $1.24 per diluted share, an increase of $0.09 over last year. \u2047 Loan receivables were down 6% to $81.9 billion, and average active accounts decreased 10% from last year, with new accounts down 19%. \u2047 Purchase volume per account increased 10% over last year to $602. \u2047 And average active balance per account increased 4% to just under $1,200. \u2047 Net interest margin was down 37 basis points to 14.64% and the efficiency ratio was 37.1% for the quarter. \u2047 Net charge-offs hit a new low at 3.16%. \u2047 As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy, in response to COVID-19 impact on our balance sheet, deposits were down $2.3 billion or 4% versus last year. \u2047 This includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit growth, given the excess liquidity we have. \u2047 Total deposits comprise 80% of our funding and our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source. \u2047 Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers, makes our bank attractive to depositors, and we will continue to build out additional capabilities. \u2047 During the quarter -- we returned $128 million in the quarter through a common stock dividend. \u2047 We also announced that the Board authorized $1.6 billion in share repurchases for 2021, beginning in the first quarter. \u2047 We have a solid pipeline across our platforms, a mix of start-up and existing programs. \u2047 But we are being very disciplined around risk and returns, given the uncertainty in the current environment. \u2047 And while this retail landscape is shifting, we believe similar opportunities will continue, as evidenced by recent wins. \u2047 I will touch upon a few highlights. \u2047 We announced that we will become the issuer of Walgreens co-branded credit card program in the U.S., the first such credit program in the retail health sector. \u2047 The card will allow customers to earn rewards for purchases anywhere Mastercard is accepted. \u2047 We expect to launch the new program in the second half of 2021. \u2047 This new agreement is built upon the company's existing strategic partnership. \u2047 CareCredit is already accepted at more than 9,000 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores. \u2047 We are committed to providing Walgreens customers and patients with unparalleled experiences, a best-in-class loyalty program and the ability to manage their health and wellness spending. \u2047 In addition, we renewed our strategic partnership with Mattress Firm. \u2047 We provide flexible financing solutions and innovative business tools that empowered Mattress Firm to meet their customers at critical moments in the purchasing journey, which is increasingly online. \u2047 Our digital tools and industry-leading credit program team, including marketing, and analytic retail experts have optimized every step of the omnichannel customer journey to deliver a competitive user experience. \u2047 We look forward to many more years as a strategic partner of Mattress Firm. \u2047 We also reached a definitive agreement to acquire Allegro Credit, a leading provider of point-of-sale consumer financing for audiology products and dental services. \u2047 Allegro offers numerous customers loan options through its merchant partners with flexible payment terms at the point of sale. \u2047 These products are designed to offer customers choice to purchase the products and services they need or want. \u2047 The addition of Allegro Credit's merchant network and customers complements our strategy of growing CareCredit, our leading health and wellness financing platform. \u2047 The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 Altogether this quarter, we signed nine renewals and won seven new deals, along with the acquisition. \u2047 I cannot overstate the importance of digital innovation to the success of our programs. \u2047 Consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys. \u2047 We are leveraging our digital assets and continuously investing to ensure our partners are well positioned in this rapidly evolving dynamic. \u2047 These investments include the capabilities to empower SaaS and seamless integration with our partners' digital assets, enable customer choice at the point of sale, enhance contactless experiences, facilitate a seamless and easy application process, bring the in-store experience to a customer's digital devices for applications and payment, and integrate our financing office throughout the entire digital shopping experience. \u2047 We also continue to expand our digital penetration of all aspects of our customer journey: apply, buy and service. \u2047 Approximately, 60% of our applications were done digitally during the fourth quarter and grew 18% in mobile channel applications. \u2047 In Retail Card, 51% of our sales occurred online. \u2047 Finally, approximately 65% of our payments were made digitally. \u2047 In short, we are rising to the challenges presented by this difficult time. \u2047 We have strengthened the strategic position of our business and expanded the opportunity set that lies before us. \u2047 And we're investing in the right strategy that will enable near-term successes while also driving considerable shareholder value over the long term. \u2047 With our future in mind, as you know, a few weeks ago, we announced some important changes to the leadership of this company. \u2047 Effective April 1, I will transition to the role of Executive Chair of our Board of Directors, and Brian Doubles will become Synchrony's President and CEO. \u2047 Synchrony means so much to me, and one of my goals as CEO was to set up a thoughtful leadership transition with a successor who will advance what we have built. \u2047 Both the Board and I believe there is no one in the world better equipped to do that than Brian. \u2047 Brian has helped to build Synchrony every step of the way. \u2047 He has been my trusted partner for more than a decade, including through our IPO. \u2047 When we started Synchrony back in 2014, we set out to build a great business with a great culture that delivers for our partners and customers every day. \u2047 Together, with our 16,500 employees, we are doing just that. \u2047 With Synchrony in a position of strength, now is the time to implement this transition, allowing Brian to continue the incredible progress that has been made and to drive the next stage of Synchrony's exciting growth journey. \u2047 I look forward to working with Brian through this transition and continuing to support Synchrony's growth and future success as Executive Chair. \u2047 We truly would not be where we are or who we are today without her leadership, and it's an absolute honor to succeed her and lead Synchrony into the future. \u2047 I am also grateful that we will continue to benefit from Margaret's expertise and leadership in her role as Executive Chair. \u2047 And I am excited to partner with her and the Board, our leadership team, and especially our employees as we continue to capitalize on our momentum. \u2047 There is a lot to be excited about as we continue Synchrony's journey. \u2047 We have a strong business, a winning culture, and a tremendous opportunity to build on this strong foundation. \u2047 As incoming CEO, I will continue to implement the strategy that we've developed over the last few years, and which has enabled the momentum that our business has today. \u2047 We will continue to leverage our competitive strength, deepen our market leadership and invest in digital, data analytics and new product offerings to create a seamless customer experience. \u2047 We will continue to grow our business and drive value for all of our stakeholders, our investors, our employees, our partners and our customers. \u2047 Fundamental to our business is our objective to provide a full suite of products that can be tailored to serve the evolving needs of our customers and partners, while earning appropriate economic returns. \u2047 Our partners' most critical needs are centered on their ability to offer a product that can seamlessly integrate with our digital assets and systems, deliver higher average order volumes and sales, increase conversion rates and deepen customer loyalty. \u2047 By the same token, customers have their own unique set needs, including financing solutions that fit within their budget, are transparent and easy and convenient to use, and which offer them flexibility in their purchase and financing decisions. \u2047 We have extensive experience in installment lending, which has informed our approach to equal payment financing. \u2047 We think about these products in two categories. \u2047 We offer mid- and long-term equal payment plans with promotional periods anywhere from 12 to 162 months, depending on the product category. \u2047 We also offer short-term equal payment plans with promotional periods of three to 12 months. \u2047 We offer collateralized installment products with bigger ticket purchases with promotional periods from 12 to 180 months. \u2047 And we also offer short and long-term installment loans through our SetPay product. \u2047 These products run anywhere from three to 36 months. \u2047 All of these products are priced appropriately to meet our partner and customer objectives with APR starting at 0%, and each of these products, in turn, offer distinct benefits and address the unique objectives of our partners and customers. \u2047 Revolving equal pay products, for example, can be embedded inside of an existing revolving account, eliminating the need for a customer to open a new account. \u2047 And given the nature of their functionality, they also provide for repeat purchases as well as higher engagement and loyalty to the partners plan. \u2047 Meanwhile, closed-end products can be appealed to customers that prefer regular predictable payments. \u2047 To put our overall equal payment financing strategy in perspective, we currently have $15 billion in equal payment balances, 56% of which have 0% APR financing. \u2047 We have about 74,000 partners or locations offering our payment plan products. \u2047 And we have an overall repeat purchase rate of approximately 30% within 24 months of the first purchase. \u2047 Synchrony's success in this and our other core strategies has been driven by our commitment to data-driven innovation, a deep understanding of our partners' objectives and customer needs, and our ability to adapt as the competitive landscape and market conditions have evolved over time. \u2047 Our organization is built around being nimble, responsive and results oriented. \u2047 We leverage our decades of underwriting experience, our proprietary data analytics and our industry expertise in order to design and implement customized solutions that address our partners' needs while also delivering appropriate economic outcomes. \u2047 This is what has driven Symphony's long-standing track record and deepened our market leadership over the years. \u2047 We are excited to drive this momentum forward in 2021 simply by continuing to enhance the value we offer to all those we serve. \u2047 I speak for everyone in the company when I say we look forward to working closely with them in the next chapter for Synchrony. \u2047 As we begin 2021, we're encouraged by the developments being made to fight the pandemic, and continue to be inspired by those in the front lines. \u2047 For our part, we remain dedicated to keeping our employees safe in helping our partners, customers and communities during this difficult period, guided by our values and principles. \u2047 And with the partner-centric focus, we are working to help our constituents navigate this environment with an eye toward the future and the opportunities ahead of us as we begin to overcome the pandemic. \u2047 However, our business mix, which includes a significant digital component and certain industries benefiting from staying at home, such as home-related products and services, veterinary services, and electronics and appliances have outbalanced against some of the effects of the economic downturn. \u2047 Purchase volume was essentially flat, down 1% versus last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter, despite some pressure from new shutdowns and restrictions as the pandemic progressed during the quarter. \u2047 The continued pressure caused our average active accounts to be down 10% and a decrease in loan receivables of 6%. \u2047 Payment rates continue to be elevated relative to normalized levels. \u2047 Interest and fees on loans were down 11% from last year, consistent with the core decrease we experienced last quarter. \u2047 Dual and co-branded cards account for 38% of our purchase line in the fourth quarter and declined 4% from the prior year. \u2047 On a loan receivable basis, they account for 24% of the portfolio and declined 10% from the prior year. \u2047 While we're seeing positive trending in our growth metric as we enter the quarter, the acceleration of the pandemic result in regional shutdowns and diminished effects of the CARES Act stimulus slowed that early momentum. \u2047 While our sales are stable, we are encouraged by recent developments, including the recently enacted stimulus, the proposed stimulus, a new administration and national rollout of a vaccine. \u2047 We believe these factors will have a positive impact. \u2047 It should provide momentum as we progress through 2021. \u2047 I'll provide a more comprehensive view on 2021 shortly. \u2047 RSAs increased $18 million or 2% from last year. \u2047 RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 5.2% for the quarter. \u2047 This was elevated from the historical average, primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge-offs and the elimination of Walmart, which operated at a lower than company average RSA percentage. \u2047 The improvement in net charge-offs resulted in a decrease in the provision for credit losses of $354 million or 32% from last year. \u2047 This was partially offset by a reserve build in the fourth quarter of $119 million. \u2047 Other income decreased $22 million, mainly due to higher loyalty costs. \u2047 Other expense decreased $79 million or 7% from last year due to lower purchase volume and average active accounts, coupled with lower employee costs as we have begun to implement our strategic plan to reduce operating expenses. \u2047 Moving to our platform results on slide eight sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to COVID-19, and their trajectories through this period have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix, digital concentration, provider access and availability of hardline goods. \u2047 In Retail Card"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports
