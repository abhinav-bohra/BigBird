{"article": ["On the call today are Tim Crew, Chief Executive Officer; John Kozlowski, the company's Chief Financial Officer, Maureen Cavanaugh, our Chief Commercial Operations Officer; and Steve Lehrer, who leads our insulin biosimilar initiatives. \u2047 A playback will be available for at least three months on Lannett's website. \u2047 In a moment, Tim will provide brief remarks on the company's financial results, as well as recent developments and initiatives. \u2047 Then John will discuss the financial results in more detail. \u2047 We hope you remain safe and well as we all manage through the persistency of the pandemic. \u2047 I'll start today reviewing some of the highlights of the past year that are relevant to our future before turning to the key elements we see in that future. \u2047 First and foremost, in 2021, we continued to launch products and build our future portfolio. \u2047 We launched about a dozen new products, highlighted by a few significant contributors, including Levothyroxine tablets, Levothyroxine capsules and Clarithromycin. \u2047 The products we launched last year added new revenue streams and further diversified offerings, reducing our exposure and reliance on key products. \u2047 We also grew our base product pipeline with continued investment in a robust internal product development program. \u2047 For example, our recent Mycophenolate approval was achieved in just under 10 months, the third such product we developed to achieve so called first cycle approval in the past few years. \u2047 We have made great strides in our internal efforts including significant changes to our portfolio selection. \u2047 Such changes take time to be fully reflected in our financials, but we believe meaningful value is being built. \u2047 Further, we are working on our existing strategic alliance partners to expand our agreements to include new products. \u2047 For example, this past year Insulin Aspart was added to our HEC agreement, and more recently, generic Spiriva, Handihaler was added to our Respirent agreements. \u2047 Together these products represent multi-billion dollar markets with relatively few competitors expected. \u2047 We also formed a new strategic alliance partnership to launch Sevoflurane, a product with relatively few competitors and a market size of about $190 million based on IQVIA data. \u2047 We look to launch Sevoflurane in the back half of the fiscal year. \u2047 The second key accomplishment last year was even while we launched new products and grew our pipeline, we also maintained firm control over expenses and exhibited operating discipline. \u2047 We implemented and completed the cost reduction plan that included consolidating our R&D functions to a single location and lowered operating costs by approximately $15 million annually. \u2047 The third key accomplishment was that we significantly improved our capital structure. \u2047 This last year, we paid off our Term A loans with cash on hand and later successfully completed a full refinancing transaction of the Term B loans. \u2047 The refinancing transaction as we have often highlighted was significant for several reasons. \u2047 First, we extended the maturity of our debt to 2026 from 2022, which is now after several of our larger and more meaningful pipeline assets are expected to launch and contributed to a reduction in our debt. \u2047 Second, we upsize our credit facility and substantially freed up cash flow, primarily due to the elimination of mandatory principal payments until maturity. \u2047 Third, the new debt does not have any leverage covenants. \u2047 Fourth, as a result of this refinancing, in combination with working capital initiatives, we have improved our cash position. \u2047 Thus, we now have more ready resources to invest in growth opportunities. \u2047 Of course, another accomplishment to note was in our teams, particularly in our plants and labs, showed up to work every day throughout the pandemic and maintained a reliable supply of our affordable medicines. \u2047 This, of course, despite all the extra challenges we have been doing so this past year. \u2047 We are quite proud of all of these accomplishments. \u2047 Of course, there are also real challenges. \u2047 Well, competition is a fact of life in the generic industry. \u2047 The competitive environment we encountered last year was particularly impactful because it involved some of our most profitable products. \u2047 We offset some of these pressures with the aforementioned new product launches and cost reductions, but the decline significantly exceeded the offsets. \u2047 On top of a particularly competitive environment, COVID-19 continued to impact our financial performance with more downstream influences. \u2047 For example, as we have said, the pandemic resulted in fewer elective medical procedures being performed, this reduction in limited sales and use of our cocaine-based product. \u2047 As a branded product, our Numbrino NDA carries a higher than average gross margin for us, so changes up or down in sales have a disproportionate impact on our bottom line. \u2047 Fortunately, we believe many of the negative past year are beginning to attenuate while the positive factors continue to foretell meaningful opportunities. \u2047 With that as a background and leaving John to note the specific financial results, I will turn to our outlook for the upcoming years. \u2047 We expect our overall net sales and gross margin to continue to face pressure by recent and anticipated competitive pricing of certain key products, partially offset again by the benefit of new product launches. \u2047 We also expect sales of our Numbrino NDA to be impacted by a continuation of further elective surgeries being performed. \u2047 Once the pandemic subsides, we would expect to see an increase in these types of procedures and along with that, an increase in sales. \u2047 While we are forecasting a down year in sales and profits, we see fiscal '22 as a trough year. \u2047 Our key products have already been impacted by notable competitive pricing pressure, thus, those products have less further downside. \u2047 At the same time, the relative future potential of our pipeline continues to increase. \u2047 I also want to note that while we believe our generic ADVAIR DISKUS product has the potential to launch in calendar year 2022, we did not include any sales of the product in our FY '22 guidance. \u2047 Similarly, zolmitriptan is also not contemplated in our FY 2022 forecast, as a result of ongoing delays from our API supplier. \u2047 Nevertheless, we do expect both products to be meaningful contributors in fiscal 2023. \u2047 So now let's turn to our pipeline. \u2047 We continue to launch products[Indecipherable] approximately 13 ANDAs pending at the FDA including partner products, plus four additional products that are approved and pending launch. \u2047 We also have more than 20 products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts. \u2047 We continue to target more valuable products than has been our historical average. \u2047 With regard to our large durable product pipeline, we currently have five disclosed assets. \u2047 First, with our partner HEC, we have two insulin assets, Insulin Aspart, a fast acting insulin product and Insulin Glargine, a long-acting insulin product. \u2047 Combined, the two products participate in a double-digit billion dollar US market as reported by IQVIA. \u2047 Second, our drug device respiratory portfolio with their partner Respirent now has three assets, generic ADVAIR DISKUS, which is filed with the FDA, along with generic Flovent Diskus, and most recently, generic Spiriva Handihaler. \u2047 Combined sales of these products also represent a multi-billion dollar US market as reported by IQVIA. \u2047 As we have said, all of these products are differentiated from traditional generic products because of the significant technical expertise required for development and substantial plant investments made by our partners that needed to manufacture them. \u2047 So for all of these products, we expect only a handful of competitors. \u2047 I will discuss next the significant progress we are making advancing these large durable product opportunities. \u2047 With regard to generic ADVAIR DISKUS, we have been in regular contact with the FDA regarding this priority application since it was accepted in May of this year. \u2047 We are encouraged by their level of engagement. \u2047 We anticipate a mid-cycle review update from the FDA sometime in the next few months. \u2047 Thus, we expect to provide a better sense of how the application is progressing on our next investor call in November. \u2047 Currently, we continue to participate more than one FDA cycle and believe, as just noted, an approval in US launch of the product is possible in calendar year 2022. \u2047 For those new to Lannett story, generic ADVAIR DISKUS is one of the larger assets in our filed pipeline. \u2047 It is also currently the closest to expected commercialization in our partnered respiratory portfolio. \u2047 The second most advanced product in our respiratory portfolio is generic Flovent Diskus. \u2047 The last patient for the pivotal clinical trial for this product has been dosed and we anticipate the analysis of the trial to be completed within a few months. \u2047 We are currently planning for an ANDA submission before the end of the current fiscal year and a possible launch in calendar year 2023. \u2047 Next, as noted, we recently expanded our opportunities with Respirent to include generic Spiriva Handihaler. \u2047 The development arc for this product should be approximately 12 months to 18 months behind the generic Flovent Diskus product. \u2047 However, as there were various IP matters involved, we're not commenting today on the specific launch timing expectations. \u2047 Finally, as we have previously said, we're evaluating and in negotiations for additional product opportunities in inhalation respiratory space, particularly dry powder inhalers, and metered dose inhalers. \u2047 There continues to be additional multi-billion dollar market opportunities to pursue with both current and future partners. \u2047 Now turning to our two biologic insulin products, starting with biosimilar Insulin Glargine. \u2047 Clinical material for the drug product has now been manufactured in the new dedicated manufacturing site, which is a very significant milestone. \u2047 We still expect to submit an IND around the end of the calendar year and commence the pivotal clinical trial early next calendar year. \u2047 However, we have recently added a few months to the clinical timeline, due to current COVID-19 restrictions at the study site in South Africa. \u2047 We have also added a few more months to our timelines to address interchangeability with the FDA, which I'll discuss in a moment. \u2047 Thus, we currently think the biologics license application will be filed in the first half of calendar year 2023 and we would expect to launch in the first half of calendar year 2024. \u2047 Also note, China's version of the FDA, the NMPA has approved HEC's Insulin Glargine for China. \u2047 That product is made in the same new plant, where we have now just made our Insulin Glargine for clinical trials. \u2047 [Indecipherable] we have added to the development plan to address the interchangeability with the FDA is related to an important recent FDA approval of the first biosimilar and interchangeable Insulin Glargine, the[Indecipherable]. \u2047 We believe that interchangeability approval is good news for Lannett and HEC's insulin. \u2047 It demonstrates the FDA will approve interchangeable insulin products, which over-time should improve affordable access to these important medications. \u2047 Regarding biosimilar Insulin Aspart, the development of the product continues and we currently anticipate a potential launch of the product about 15 months following Insulin Glargine. \u2047 Again, Insulin Aspart was produced in the same facilities, working with the same teams and technologies as Insulin Glargine, so we are able to leverage may be earlier Glargine investments in development and manufacturing that have been made by both Lannett and HEC. \u2047 Like our respiratory portfolio, we see several opportunities to leverage our insulin assets. \u2047 There are other dosage forms of both Glargine and Aspart, such as vials and other distinct insulin products. \u2047 These opportunities again represent multi-billion dollar markets, as reported by IQVIA. \u2047 We also see opportunities to leverage our USA clinical data, 10 development and related IP, along with the manufacturing capacity at HEC to form a strategic alliance with third parties looking to accelerate their access to insulin products in international markets such as Europe. \u2047 Well, discussions on such opportunities are very preliminary, such relationships could yield meaningful value for both ourselves and our partners. \u2047 Finally, a few brief comments on Made in America[Phonetic] and ESG. \u2047 While we see a future that includes several high technology products from overseas sources, today, we are mainly a US domiciled generic medicines company. \u2047 Lannett adheres to strict US laws and US environmental guidelines with regard to development and manufacturing compliance for our US made products. \u2047 Most of our large generic competitors are already based overseas and don't face the same set of regulations and ship most of their products from the far side of the globe. \u2047 We are proud that today, we serve the US market from the US market and do so with an enviable track record and reputation for being a high quality and reliable manufacturer. \u2047 We point out these characteristics that make Lannett increasingly unique as a generic supplier so that our investors and customers think of Lannett when they consider Made in America in various ESG related initiatives. \u2047 To sum-up today's remarks, our accomplishments in fiscal 2021 were significant. \u2047 We faced head on a highly competitive market environment. \u2047 We launched new products and made important advances in the development of key products in our pipeline. \u2047 We expanded existing agreements that added three large durable assets to our respiratory and insulin franchises. \u2047 We refinanced our debt, improving free cash flow and extended our maturities beyond the expected launch dates of our large pipeline assets. \u2047 We continue to believe that the exciting products in our advancing and expanding pipeline still have the potential to transform our firm into $1 billion company by 2025. \u2047 I'll begin with our financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. \u2047 For the 2021 fourth quarter, net sales were $106.0 million, compared with $137.9 million for the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 Gross profit was $26.4 million or 25% of net sales, compared with $48.9 million or 35% of net sales for the prior year fourth quarter. \u2047 R&D expenses declined to $6.0 million from $6.6 million. \u2047 SG&A expenses declined to $15.5 million from $15.6 million. \u2047 Operating income was $4.9 million, compared with $26.7 million. \u2047 Interest expense increased to $12.1 million from $11.3 million in last year's fourth quarter. \u2047 Net loss was $7.4 million or $0.19 per share versus net income of $13.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $12.1 million. \u2047 Turning to our balance sheet. \u2047 At June 30, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $93 million, up from $81 million at March 31. \u2047 Cash increased during the fourth quarter due to a few factors. \u2047 First, as a result of the refinancing, we did not have a principal payment on our debt"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted loss per share $0.19.  \u2047  completed re-financing transaction, debt maturity extended to 2026.  \u2047  sees fiscal 2022 gaap net sales $400 million to $440 million."], "pred_summary": ["q4 non-gaap earnings per share $0.19.  \u2047  q4 non-gaap earnings per share $0.19."]}
