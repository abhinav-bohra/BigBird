{"article": ["I'm Ian Hudson, the Company's Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Also with me on the call today is Jennifer Sherman, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \u2047 These documents are available on our website. \u2047 In addition, we will file our Form 10-Q later today. \u2047 I'm going to begin today by providing some detail on our first quarter results, before turning the call over to Jennifer to provide her perspective on current market conditions, our progress against strategic initiatives, and our outlook for the remainder of the year. \u2047 In summary, we delivered another strong quarter with record orders and operating results, exceeding our expectations despite ongoing pandemic related disruptions. \u2047 We also had to navigate through the February ice storms in the south, which caused us to temporarily close our facilities in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi. \u2047 Fortunately, we did not experience any significant damage, but we did lose several days of production. \u2047 Despite these challenges, the teams recovered well with both groups delivering adjusted EBITDA margins at or above levels achieved in the first quarter of last year. \u2047 That feed is even more impressive, given the strength of the prior year quarter, which included record production at our largest facility and minimal impact from the pandemic. \u2047 Turning now to the numbers where consolidated net sales for the quarter were $279 million compared to $286 million last year. \u2047 Consolidated operating income for the quarter was $27.8 million compared to $32.3 million last year. \u2047 Consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $41.2 million compared to $43.9 million last year. \u2047 That translates to a margin of 14.8% in Q1 this year compared to 15.3% last year. \u2047 Net income for the quarter was $22.2 million compared to $23.4 million last year. \u2047 That equates to GAAP earnings per share for the quarter of $0.36 per share compared to $0.38 per share last year. \u2047 On an adjusted basis, earnings per share for the quarter was $0.38 per share, compared to $0.39 per share last year. \u2047 Order intake for the quarter was outstanding with orders of $384 million represent -- representing our highest quarterly orders on record and an increase of $80 million or 26% compared to Q1 last year. \u2047 Consolidated backlog at the end of the quarter also set a new company record at $410 million that represents an increase of $9 million compared to Q1 last year and an increase of $106 million or 35% from the end of 2020. \u2047 In terms of our group results, ESG net sales for the quarter were $228 million compared to $233 million last year. \u2047 ESG's operating income for the quarter was $27.1 million compared to $29.4 million last year. \u2047 ESG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $39.3 million compared to $40 million in the prior year. \u2047 That translates to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% in line with last year. \u2047 EFC reported orders of $324 million in Q1 this year, an improvement of $87 million or 37% compared to last year. \u2047 SSG's net sales for the quarter were $51 million this year compared to $53 million last year. \u2047 Operating income for the quarter was $7.2 million dollars compared to $7.4 million last year. \u2047 SSG's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was consistent with the prior year at around $8.2 million while its adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter improved to 16.2% of 80 basis points from Q1 last year. \u2047 SSG's orders for the quarter was $60 million compared to $66 million last year. \u2047 Corporate operating expenses for the quarter was $6.5 million, up from $4.5 million last year. \u2047 The increase was primarily due to an unfavorable year-over-year variance of $2.6 million associated with changes in mark-to-market adjustments of post-retirement reserves. \u2047 These market based adjustments benefited our earnings in Q1 last year by approximately $0.02 per share but were unfavorable in Q1 this year. \u2047 Turning now to the consolidated income statement where the decrease in sales contributed to a $6 million reduction in gross profit. \u2047 Consolidated gross margin for the quarter was 24.7% compared to 26.1% last year. \u2047 As a percentage of sales, our selling, engineering, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were down 20 basis points from Q1 last year, despite the unfavorable mark-to-market variance I just mentioned. \u2047 Other items affecting the quarterly results include a $700,000 increase in other income and a $400,000 decrease in interest expense. \u2047 Tax expense for the quarter was down $2.2 million dollars, largely due to lower pre-tax income levels and higher excess tax benefits from stock compensation activity. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for the quarter with 18.4% compared to 23.5% last year. \u2047 The lower tax rate in Q1 of this year was in line with our expectations after we had included an estimate of excess tax benefits. \u2047 At this time, we continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. \u2047 On an overall GAAP basis, we therefore earned $0.36 per share in Q1 this year compared with $0.38 per share in Q1 last year. \u2047 To facilitate earnings comparisons, we typically adjust our GAAP earnings per share for unusual items recorded in the current or prior year quarters. \u2047 In the current year quarter, we made adjustments to GAAP earnings per share to exclude acquisition related expenses, coronavirus-related expenses and purchase accounting expense effects. \u2047 On this basis, our adjusted earnings for the quarter were $0.38 per share compared with $0.39 per share last year. \u2047 Looking now at cash flow where we generated $26 million of cash from operations during the quarter, an improvement of $21 million over Q1 last year. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $168 million of net debt and availability under our credit facility of $270 million. \u2047 Our current net debt leverage ratio remains low even after funding the acquisition of OSW during the quarter for approximately $53 million. \u2047 Our strong financial position allows us to continue to invest in organic growth initiatives and pursue strategic acquisitions like OSW. \u2047 At the same time, we remain committed to pursuing strategic acquisitions and returning cash to stockholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. \u2047 On that note, we paid dividends of $5.5 million during the quarter, reflecting an increased dividend of $0.09 per share. \u2047 And we recently announced a similar dividend for the second quarter. \u2047 It's been over a year now, since the pandemic began. \u2047 And while there have been many challenges along the way, I remain in awe of how our teams have responded modifying our work practices to keep employees safe, exercising flexibility in handling uncertain market conditions, and finding new ways to serve our customers. \u2047 [Technical Issues] continues to experience some ongoing COVID related disruptions, but conditions are improving. \u2047 Our companywide efforts to raise awareness about vaccines, assist our employees in gaining access to vaccines and encourage participation levels, are paying off and we are pleased to report that our domestic employee vaccination rates are ahead of the national average. \u2047 In fact, in Illinois, where we have three of our largest facilities and the corporate office, over 60% of our employees are now fully vaccinated. \u2047 With that, we've seen an uptick in our sales, resources, traveling, reinforcing our customer-centric value proposition and contributing to greater order intake. \u2047 As in the last two quarters, we again saw improved demand for our products with our first-quarter order intake setting a new record for the company, surpassing the previous high by over $50 million. \u2047 Our first quarter orders reflect strength in most of our end markets and growing confidence in a post-pandemic recovery, which seems to be further solidified by recent economic stimulus. \u2047 That sentiment seems to be shared widely by our dealer partners and customers across most of our businesses. \u2047 Demand for sewer cleaners remains strong, with first quarter orders up 30% year-over-year, and almost double the amount recorded last quarter. \u2047 Safe digging is also continuing to gain acceptance. \u2047 Over the last couple of years, approximately 70% of our sewer cleaners orders have included an optional safe-digging package, which allows our sewer cleaners to also be used for hydro or vacuum excavation purposes. \u2047 We saw similar trends this quarter with customer appreciation for the safety and efficiency benefits of safe digging gaining momentum. \u2047 At MRL, our road marking and line removal business, first quarter orders were the highest quarterly levels since we acquired the business in 2019. \u2047 And with its planned expansion now complete, we are well positioned to benefit from potential infrastructure investment. \u2047 Our road marking services business, Highmark also won an $8 million striping contract during the quarter. \u2047 Since the 4th quarter of last year, we've also seen an uptick in our industrial end markets with improved orders for our Guzzler and JetStream products heading into the spring-cleaning season. \u2047 In addition, our dump bodies and trailer businesses reported strong organic order growth of 28% across our end markets, achieving record backlog. \u2047 While our backlog is at a record high, there are a few factors that may limit us from realizing the full benefits from the operating leverage that we typically experience with backlog at these levels. \u2047 The first factor that many of you will be aware of is the impact of the global semiconductor shortage on chassis availability. \u2047 We started to see some supply tightness late last year and our teams were proactive in securing additional chassis and recommending to our customers and dealer partners that they do the same for those orders were they supply the chassis. \u2047 As a reminder, that is about 50% of the time for our ESG businesses, excluding TBEI, where the customer almost always supplies the chassis. \u2047 We were recently notified by one of our chassis suppliers that they are temporarily suspending production of certain chassis for up to 90 days in light of the semiconductor shortage. \u2047 The issue primarily impacts our sewer cleaners, safe digging trucks, and certain street sweeper models. \u2047 The situation remains fluid and the teams have been working hard to mitigate the impact of the short-term disruption. \u2047 Based on the data we have received, we expect the situation will be resolved during the 3rd quarter with production expected to ramp back quickly thereafter. \u2047 Because we do not rely on any one single TSC manufacturer, and with the proactive actions we took, we have been able to pivot quickly to minimize the financial impact. \u2047 For example, at Elgin, our team was able to adjust production schedules, so that we build a higher concentration of the three-wheel Pelican sweepers during the period of the expected impact. \u2047 As a reminder, for that product line, we actually manufacture the chassis ourselves. \u2047 At our Streator facility, where we make sewer cleaners and Safe digging trucks, we have had an ongoing effort to secure additional chassis from other manufacturers. \u2047 However, because of lead times on certain chassis, there is a period of approximately two weeks where we have a shortage at Vactor. \u2047 With the goal of optimizing efficiency, the teams have worked diligently to manage the schedule, so that this brief pause will occur over the July 4 holiday. \u2047 With the additional chassis supply that we have secured, we are expecting a ramp up in production thereafter. \u2047 Like most companies, we are also experiencing rising commodity costs. \u2047 As our teams have done in the past, we took proactive measures such as locking in pricing and securing availability of steel based on forecasted needs. \u2047 Our teams are working diligently to mitigate the impacts of rising commodity costs by implementing price increases and surcharges where possible. \u2047 As it relates to labor availability, our ongoing commitment to environmental social and governance continues to benefit our company. \u2047 Investment in our employees differentiates us and our ability to attract labor at the majority of our facilities. \u2047 I now want to take a few minutes to provide an update on our strategic growth initiatives. \u2047 We remain bullish about Safe digging prospects, and with noted industrial end market recoveries and infrastructure spend optimism throughout the channel, we are confident Safe digging trends will continue to improve. \u2047 Our TRUVAC safe digging product line portfolio includes a complete range of truck mounted safe digging equipment with applications across a number of end markets. \u2047 We were pleased to see that TRUVAC product demonstrations for the quarter were up 70% from last year. \u2047 As I just mentioned, these education efforts are also having a positive impact in sewer cleaners demand with the inclusion of the optional safe digging package, turning our sewer cleaners into a multi-purpose vehicle. \u2047 We also continue to make progress with our aftermarket initiative with aftermarket revenues for the quarter improving by 6% and representing a higher share of ESG's revenues for the quarter at around 27%. \u2047 We continue to closely monitor rental fleet utilization and remain disciplined in making decisions about the size and composition of our fleet. \u2047 As part of that process, we have seen healthy used equipment sales in recent months and an uptick in rentals. \u2047 We are monitoring the current COVID situation in Canada with Ontario and many other provinces being subject to some of the most extreme stay-at-home measures since the start of the pandemic. \u2047 While we have not experienced any significant financial impact to date, we may see some impact in our Canadian markets over the next few months, which is typically a seasonally strong period for equipment rentals and part sales. \u2047 On the organic growth front, we have several new product launches in the pipeline, a few of which I'll touch on today. \u2047 Within ESG, street sweeper electrification remains a key area of investment. \u2047 We have previously talked about our first orders for hybrid electric broom bear street sweeper, which are currently expected to ship later this year. \u2047 This hybrid model, uses both battery energy and either CNG or diesel power for sweeping, with performance designed to meet or exceed current sweeper performance. \u2047 The hybrid broom bear is now being demonstrated by our dealer channel, primarily on the West Coast and then moving to the Southeast, and the feedback to date has been encouraging. \u2047 In addition, development of a hybrid version of our most popular line of street sweepers, the Pelican, is under way. \u2047 The plug-in hybrid electric Pelican sweeper is assembled and undergoing testing with product demonstrations plan for the second half of this year. \u2047 Within our dump body and trailer product portfolio, we are also realizing benefits from new product introductions. \u2047 During the quarter, products launched over the last year equated to organic growth of about 4%. \u2047 Within SSG, based on the nature of its product portfolio, our innovation pipeline typically includes a higher volume new product introductions and enhancements, that while individually may"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1
