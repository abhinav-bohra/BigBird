non-GAAP information that we believe is useful in evaluating the company's operating performance. \u2047 Reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures can be found in the conference call materials. \u2047 Most importantly, I hope you and your families are remaining safe and healthy. \u2047 Throughout these challenging times, we are proud of all Terex team members, who are keeping themselves and others safe, meeting the needs of customers and helping our communities. \u2047 Safety remains the top priority of the company, driven by Think Safe, Work Safe, Home Safe. \u2047 Our team members remain vigilant by carefully following the COVID-19 safety protocols and continuing to keep their guard up. \u2047 Despite a challenging year, we delivered results for all stakeholders. \u2047 We prioritize their health and safety while maintaining our Terex Way values. \u2047 Globally, team members gave back to their communities with their time and donations. \u2047 For our customers, they are the center of our recovery and we have continued to maintain the highest levels of safety and our sales and service operations. \u2047 And finally, for our shareholders, we minimize the operational and financial impacts related to the pandemic. \u2047 Despite the challenging markets during the fourth quarter, our team continued to meet customer demand, tightly managed all cost, aggressively reduced networking capital, especially AWP inventories, and delivered outstanding free cash flow. \u2047 Q4 revenue improved sequentially as end markets continued to recover despite the fourth quarter normally being seasonally slower. \u2047 The sequential improvement in revenues was driven by MP whose revenues improved approximately 18%. \u2047 Customer bookings in Q4 represented a continued strong improvement from Q3. \u2047 Sequentially AWP and MP bookings were up dramatically. \u2047 In addition to sequential strength in bookings, AWP bookings were flat with last year's pre-COVID levels and MP's bookings were up 53%. \u2047 Year-end customer backlogs increased 25% over prior year pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Our stringent cost control and producing the customer demand helped us deliver operating margins in line with prior year on 11% lower revenues, even with $18 million of restructuring and related charges. \u2047 AWP recorded near breakeven operating margins, including $11 million of restructuring charges and revenue down 18% from the prior year, representing a decremental margin of 7% or an incremental margin of 3% when excluding restructuring and related charges. \u2047 We are driving improvement in AWP's profitability to restore the segment to industry competitive margins and we will continue to take the actions necessary to deliver on that improvement. \u2047 Our MP segment achieved outstanding financial results, reporting a 15 % operating margin while revenues were down slightly year-over-year reporting an 82% incremental margin. \u2047 Throughout 2020, we right-sized our inventory levels to the customer demand environment, especially in our Genie business. \u2047 Their inventory levels remained consistent with 2016, which was the last time there was an industrial downturn. \u2047 In 2021, aerial products will manufacturer to customer demand. \u2047 Our intense focus on networking capital management drove a $129 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, delivering excellent full year cash flow generation. \u2047 Overall, our Q4 financial performance demonstrated strong execution by our global team. \u2047 We are committed to improving these results in 2021. \u2047 In 2020, we evolved from our Focus, Simplify, Execute to Win strategy to execute, innovate and grow. \u2047 This transition and strategic priorities has strengthened our business operations. \u2047 So we took swift and decisive measures in 2020 to improve, strengthen and position Terex for growth. \u2047 On the cost side, we looked at every aspect of the business to ensure we maximize our ability to be globally cost competitive. \u2047 We aggressively took out cost, not just manufacturing cost, we also executed on an SG&A cost reduction initiative with a target of SG&A percent of sales for 2021 of approximately 12.5%. \u2047 We listen to customers to ensure our products and services offer the features and benefits that provide value. \u2047 We also invested in our connected assets and digital capabilities across the enterprise to better serve customers. \u2047 We continue to drive global adoption of our products, Genie scissors and booms for working safely at height and mobile crushing and screening products for aggregate production. \u2047 Finally, we maintain our resolve to invest in the business for future growth. \u2047 Looking ahead to 2021, we recognize that execution is the foundation to deliver on our commitments to team members, customers and shareholders. \u2047 The hard work to rescale the company's cost structure will be aggressively managed to achieve our strategy of being globally cost competitive. \u2047 We'll continue to invest in innovative products and services to serve our specialized markets. \u2047 Terex is well positioned for growth in 2021 because we have strong businesses, strong brands and strong market positions upon which we can grow. \u2047 We will continue to invest, including investing in new products and manufacturing capacity where demand calls for it and we're a more focused organization. \u2047 I'm confident this will result in Terex being an even stronger company. \u2047 Turning to Slide 7. \u2047 Let me begin by reviewing our Q4 financial results. \u2047 I would like to call your attention to our financial reporting structure as you will notice consistently throughout 2020, we did not report adjusted financial results. \u2047 Instead, we are identifying specific financial callouts, which impacted our Q4 reported results. \u2047 Looking at the fourth quarter, we achieved net sales slightly higher than our outlook from the beginning of the quarter. \u2047 Throughout the quarter, we saw our end markets continue to stabilize and improve. \u2047 Overall revenue of $787 million was down 11% year-over-year. \u2047 For the quarter, we recorded an operating profit of $32 million compared to adjusted operating profit of $36 million in the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 The overall operating profit resulted from revenues being down, combined with $18 million of severance and restructuring charges primarily in our AWP segment. \u2047 We achieved this positive operating result through disciplined cost control and adapting to the market environment. \u2047 While lower revenues impacted our gross margins and resulted in elevated SG&A as a percentage of sales, our aggressive cost reduction actions allowed Terex to achieve an approximately 5% decremental margin in Q4. \u2047 This decremental margin was achieved despite $5 million of gross profit charges primarily due to restructuring. \u2047 In addition, SG&A was adversely impacted by $13 million primarily due to team members' severance and restructuring. \u2047 Excluding these charges, operating profit was $49 million and Terex achieved an incremental margin of 13% in the quarter. \u2047 The low operating income, interest and other expense was almost $10 million lower than Q4 of 2019 because of several factors, including: first, lower interest rates versus a year ago; second, $4 million of investment income; and third, non-recurrence of $2 million in FX losses recognized in the prior year. \u2047 Our 2020 global effective tax rate was approximately 18% compared to our previous estimate of 52%. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, there were a few discrete items benefiting our Q4 tax rate. \u2047 Finally, our reported earnings per share of $0.21 per share includes the adverse operating impact on gross profit and SG&A, offset by the favorable benefits in other income that I just discussed. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8 and our segments' financial results. \u2047 AWP sales of $412 million contracted by 18% compared to last year, driven by end markets in North America and Europe due to the impacts from the pandemic. \u2047 The aerial products market and our sales in China remain robust. \u2047 The utilities market remained stable and improved during the quarter across end markets. \u2047 We continue to aggressively manage production levels in aerial products to ensure that we are not building excess inventory. \u2047 During Q4, our aerial products production was 16% lower than Q4 2019. \u2047 This continued aggressive production control allowed us to achieve almost $180 million reduction in aerial products inventory levels year-over-year. \u2047 AWP delivered flat operating margin in the quarter, driven by aggressively rightsizing production and cost to align with end market demand. \u2047 AWP achieved strong decremental margin performance of 7% in the quarter, which includes $11 million of charges for severance and restructuring. \u2047 AWP fourth quarter bookings of $753 million were flat with pre-COVID Q4 2019 levels, while backlog at quarter end was $826 million, up 10% from the prior year. \u2047 Now turning to Materials Processing. \u2047 MP had another solid quarter achieving 15% operating margins as markets continue to improve. \u2047 It is a testament to the MP team's operational strength to deliver these positive operating margins and revenues down 3%. \u2047 Sales were lower at $366 million, driven by cautious yet improving customer sentiment. \u2047 The MP team has been aggressively managing all elements of cost in a challenging market environment, resulting in incremental margin performance of 82%. \u2047 Backlog of $523 million was 59% higher than last year and up 81% sequentially. \u2047 MP saw its businesses strengthen through the quarter with bookings up 53% year-over-year and up 76% sequentially. \u2047 Customers sentiment in both segments continues to improve as equipment is being utilized and ordered for 2021. \u2047 Turning to Slide 9. \u2047 Overall, 2020 demonstrated the resilience of our business and team members to deliver these results against a very challenging backdrop. \u2047 Significant cost actions reducing SG&A by $82 million from 2019 helped deliver 21% decremental margin and beat our 25% target. \u2047 In addition, strong positive cash flow generation was helped by tightly managing net working capital and aligning production to demand. \u2047 Turning to Slide 10. \u2047 When the pandemic arose during the first quarter, we quickly refocused our investment initiatives and took decisive action to reduce our overall cost structure through temporary and permanent actions. \u2047 And over the course of 2020, we instituted an SG&A cost reduction initiative, not just in corporate but across the entire company. \u2047 We always had an SG&A target going back to our 2016 Analyst Day of 12.5% of sales. \u2047 As detailed on this slide, we took a variety of actions to reduce our cost base. \u2047 Whether it was moving our corporate headquarters, improving productivity and selectively rescaling investments, we scrutinized every possible expense. \u2047 The results of these actions is that we were able to reduce our SG&A cost structure by more than $100 million for 2021 versus 2019 and delivered the improved results detailed in my earlier comments. \u2047 These actions have enabled Terex to come into 2021 well-positioned to meet the 12.5% target. \u2047 Turning to Slide 11. \u2047 Now I would like to update you on how we currently anticipate 2021 to develop financially. \u2047 It is important to realize we are operating in an unprecedented period and results could change negatively or positively. \u2047 Disruptions associated with COVID, whether it is team member absenteeism or supply chain disruptions, could impact our outlook. \u2047 With that said, this outlook represents our best estimate as of today. \u2047 Also, consistent with 2020, we do not plan to report adjusted financial results in 2021. \u2047 The outlook included on this chart includes all known income and cost but does exclude the impact of potential future acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring transformation or other unusual items. \u2047 As we identify currently unknown income or costs, we will identify them in our reported results. \u2047 As for commercial demand, we have seen our markets stabilize and improve over the course of 2020. \u2047 All other things being equal, we do expect to see markets improve due to the global deployment of COVID-19 vaccine and AWP customers' fleet replenishment. \u2047 However, our guidance does not include any benefit from potential infrastructure legislation. \u2047 We anticipate earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.35 per share based on sales of approximately $3.45 billion. \u2047 From a quarterly perspective, we expect revenues for the full year to be relatively evenly split between the first and second half of the year, with the second quarter being the strongest of the year. \u2047 We look forward to returning to year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter this year. \u2047 Operationally, the absolute amounts of operating profit and operating margins are expected to increase each quarter year-over-year with slightly more operating profit in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. \u2047 Importantly, we are planning for and look forward to reporting incremental, rather than decremental margins, which meet or exceed our 25% target for full year 2021. \u2047 Quarterly earnings per share are expected to be generally consistent with the development of operating profits during the year. \u2047 Based upon global tax laws, we expect a 2021 tax rate of 19%. \u2047 We are monitoring potential changes to tax laws in the United States and around the globe and we will adjust our operational and tax strategies as required. \u2047 For full year 2021, we are estimating free cash flow of approximately $100 million, reflecting another year of positive cash generation. \u2047 We do expect Q1 cash flow to be negative, which is consistent with historical patterns. \u2047 We also estimate capital expenditures, net of asset dispositions, will be approximately $9 million. \u2047 Corporate and other costs are planned to occur relatively evenly throughout the year, although Q1 is expected to be slightly lower and Q2 slightly higher than the average. \u2047 We continue to monitor developments associated with the UK's exit from the European Union and do not expect any material impact. \u2047 Now, let me turn your attention to the operating margin bridge on the slide. \u2047 We believe it is important that the investment community understand the key elements of our operating margin improvement in 2021. \u2047 First, cost reinstatements represent the restoration of team members' compensation after the reductions we enacted in 2020. \u2047 It is important to pay team members competitively to retain our talent. \u2047 Next, I would point out that positive volume and improved manufacturing efficiency would drive much of our margin improvement. \u2047 Additionally, our SG&A cost reduction effort also provides significant improvement in our 2021 operating margin. \u2047 Finally, we did have severance, restructuring and other charges in 2020 that are not expected to reoccur in 2021. \u2047 Taking together, these operational improvements drive our 2021 operating margin guidance of approximately 7%. \u2047 Turning to Slide 12. \u2047 Now I'll review our segment guidance. \u2047 We expect the improved customer sentiments demonstrated by our Genie and utility customers to continue into 2021. \u2047 AWP margins are expected to be positive each quarter of 2021 with incremental margins well above our targeted 25%. \u2047 Materials Processing is expected to continue its consistent operating performance delivering double-digit operating margins each quarter throughout 2021. \u2047 Following the run up in steel prices in 2018, we implemented a steel hedging program with respect to our Aerial's North American hot rolled coil, or HRC, steel consumption. \u2047 Approximately two-thirds of our Aerial's steel consumption is HRC. \u2047 You may"], "gold_summary": ["q4 earnings per share $0.21 from continuing operations.  \u2047  provides financial guidance for 2021.  \u2047
