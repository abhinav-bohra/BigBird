{"article": ["We refer to certain of these risks in our SEC filings. \u2047 Participating in today's call with me will be Paul McDermott, President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Riffee, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Drew Hammond, Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer; and Grant Montgomery, Vice President and Head of Research. \u2047 I'd like to start off with an update on the progress of our Southeastern market expansion, following our commercial asset sales. \u2047 I will also discuss the efforts that are underway to transform our operating model and current market conditions in the DC Metro and Atlanta, where we are actively growing our footprint. \u2047 Steve will then update you on our portfolio performance and trends and we'll discuss our third quarter results and outlook as we execute our transformation. \u2047 Starting with our geographic expansion. \u2047 We are pleased to report that in just over four months since our transformation announcement, we have already deployed or tied up over 55% of our $450 million target. \u2047 We have deployed or under binding contract to deploy approximately $154 million and we have been awarded another $97 million that is moving toward a binding contract. \u2047 We also have other opportunities that we are pursuing, all of which in line with our strategies and offer very strong NOI growth prospects. \u2047 We have a very active pipeline and remain confident that we will meet our target over the balance of this year and perhaps into early next year. \u2047 During the quarter, we closed the sales of our office and retail portfolios as planned. \u2047 We closed our first Southeastern multifamily acquisition, The Oxford, on August 10th for $48 million. \u2047 We have three additional acquisitions in process, including two communities that are under binding contracts of $106 million and the $97 million property that is moving toward the binding contract. \u2047 We expect all three to close during the fourth quarter. \u2047 We have and will remain disciplined and we are only underwriting assets that fit our strategy and provide stronger NOI growth. \u2047 Three of our initial properties aligned with our B Class portfolio strategy, with price points that target the deepest demand segments in their respective sub-markets and the other property aligns with our Class B value-add strategy and offers a near-term value-add renovation pipeline. \u2047 Our first acquisition, The Oxford, is a 240 unit garden-style community in the city of Conyers, Georgia. \u2047 The area is primarily comprised of family households who want the benefits of living in the suburbs, combined with connectivity with downtown, midtown and the South Atlanta business districts, along with the proximity to local employment nodes, including the Interstate 20 corridor, which is experiencing significant investment as employers expand into the area. \u2047 The Oxford was built in 1999 and over the past five years same-store rent growth for the submarkets 1999 product has outperformed the average for all 90s vintage apartments in the Atlanta market and significantly outperformed the overall Atlanta market rent growth for all apartments. \u2047 Over the past three years, the submarket has widened its outperformance versus the region's 90s vintage rent growth by over 3%. \u2047 The Oxford has performed very well during the first two-and-a- half months we've operated it, with very strong new lease rate growth of 25% during September and increasing to 26% in October. \u2047 Occupancy is tracking above our expectations, driven by very high retention rates and new leasing activity. \u2047 We acquired The Oxford at a cap rate of 4.7% and we expect an NOI growth rate that will be very high for the next three years. \u2047 Two of the properties that we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter are located in Henry County in the southern suburbs of Atlanta, where rent growth has outperformed the overall Atlanta market on a trailing five and three-year basis and is projected to continue to outperform over the next several years. \u2047 These properties are a strategic fit, aligning with our Class B portfolio strategy. \u2047 We will provide more details after we close. \u2047 In terms of our plans for our remaining capital and growth beyond, we are underwriting opportunities to acquire Southeastern communities, with low double-digit NOI growth prospects, which is stronger than our initial expectations when we decided to enter these markets. \u2047 While the Southeastern markets are competitive, we have several advantages that appeal to sellers and are helping us to succeed. \u2047 We have a 55-year track record of owning and operating multifamily properties and a strong track record of execution, which allows for a smooth and efficient due diligence process. \u2047 We have well-established relationships in the multifamily industry that transcend into our new Southeastern growth markets that we are profiting from. \u2047 Additionally, we are an all cash buyer with no financing contingencies, which sets us apart and adds a greater level of certainty of execution to the seller. \u2047 While cap rates have tightened further since June, we are keying in on opportunities that will yield outsized rent and NOI growth and align with our strategic goals. \u2047 Investment discipline is critical for us and we spend a lot of time and effort, researching and selecting our target markets and strategies for each market. \u2047 Our research tells us that the industrial mix of an economy can determine what rent growth will look like over the long-term. \u2047 Our current target markets of Atlanta, Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte have outsized exposure to industry that drive productivity growth, which creates a virtual feedback loop of job and income growth in migration and increasing education levels. \u2047 Year-over-year effect of rents for Atlanta, Raleigh/Durham and Charlotte grew by 19.8%, 19% and 17.6% respectively in September as reported by RealPage. \u2047 New lease trade outs were even stronger, averaging 22.7% across the three markets and a 580 basis point inflection between June and September. \u2047 Annual demand also serves across these markets as in migration and household formation drove record-setting absorption. \u2047 Reported first quarter annual demand had already exceeded the five-year average in each target market, yet it climbed over 23% higher from the first and the third quarters. \u2047 Raleigh/Durham posted a second quarter annual demand at 142% of its five-year average, while Charlotte and Atlanta second quarter annual demand topped 162% and 161% of their five-year averages respectively. \u2047 In order to maintain a disciplined approach and invest in these economies without competing with new supply, we're evaluating acquisition opportunities at the submarket level and targeting vintages with price points located at the deepest section of the demand curve. \u2047 We are targeting renters that are benefiting from economic and wage growth, but remain underserved by new supply, which provides us the opportunity to create a quality living experience, while also growing rents without competing with new supply. \u2047 We remain in active negotiations, pursuing additional opportunities and would like to tie up another $200 million in multifamily assets that we expect can now be completed by early 2022. \u2047 Again, we remain disciplined and are committed to allocating capital according to our strategy. \u2047 We have passed on opportunities that did not meet our criteria or would not generate accretive growth. \u2047 While we believe diversifying and expanding our footprint makes sense, we will also continue to explore acquisition opportunities in Northern Virginia, should they create greater value. \u2047 The Washington apartment market is exhibiting some of the same positive trends that we are seeing in our Southeastern target markets. \u2047 Year-over-year effective rents climbed 640 basis points from June to September. \u2047 Suburban Virginia's performance followed a similar pattern, but with even stronger growth with year-over-year effective rent growth accelerating to 9.7% in September. \u2047 Our DC portfolio is positioned well with 80% of our portfolio in Northern Virginia where the rapidly expanding consumer technology sector continues to drive job and income growth. \u2047 Furthermore, our value-oriented price points offer favorable supply and demand fundamentals over the long-term as the regional housing shortage worsens and cost of ownership and new apartment supply remains unaffordable for mid-market renters. \u2047 As many of you know we have been planning this transformation for several years and our transformation plan includes bringing property level management in-house while building a new operating platform for the future. \u2047 Over the past year, we have worked with a consultant to map out a plan to optimize our operational design as we scale our multifamily portfolio. \u2047 We are now in phase one of this project, which includes three phases in total. \u2047 We're making steady progress against the road map that we laid out and we anticipate that by the time of our year-end call, we will have selected all technology, establish the elements required to support our operations including a comprehensive human capital program and established a new brand that best defines our approach for investors, residents and employees. \u2047 At that time, we expect to be able to give guidance on G&A and transformation costs as we will be actively building out the platform. \u2047 We hope to execute phase two, which includes core platform implementation in 2022 and phase three, which incorporates the onboarding of our property management functions to our internal systems starting in late 2022 into mid-2023. \u2047 While we control our revenue strategy and do all capital planning internally, day-to-day marketing, maintenance and property management staffing have been outsourced. \u2047 Following the complete internalization of property management and enhancements to our operational platform, we expect to realize significant operational benefits from streamlining our business processes through the use of technology to establishing a closer connection with our residents to operational design efficiencies as we scale the business and optimize G&A expenses. \u2047 At the property level, we believe that there are operating efficiencies ahead of us from internalizing property management because we are designing an operating platform aligned with our strategies for resident experience and employee satisfaction and growth. \u2047 By utilizing corporate functions in a centralized model, we can be highly scalable, which will allow us to grow NOI at a much higher rate than G&A expenses. \u2047 By designing and implementing our operating platform from scratch, we are not limited by existing infrastructure and will offer value and opportunity to all our stakeholders. \u2047 The lease rate momentum that we experienced during the summer months has continued into the fall and we are positioned well heading into the winter months with low double-digit lease rate growth on our most recent new lease executions. \u2047 New lease rate growth was 9% for leases signed in September and 11% for leases signed thus far in October on an effective basis. \u2047 On the renewal side there has been very strong demand and the renewal lease rate growth was over 6% for September renewals and over 7% for October renewals on an effective basis. \u2047 Concessions declined dramatically from June through September and are nearing pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Total concessions for September move-ins declined over 95% compared to June move-ins driven by both a decline in the number of new leases with concessions and a decline in the average concession amount per lease. \u2047 The percentage of new leases with concessions declined from an average level of 60% during the first half of the year to only 9% of new leases for September move-ins. \u2047 The average concession value for new leases where concessions were granted, declined by 60% from $1300 for June move-ins to approximately $560 per home for September move-ins. \u2047 Occupancy remains strong, with a forward trend that will allow us to continue to increase rents. \u2047 Same-store average occupancy grew 40 basis points in October, compared to the third quarter. \u2047 Our suburban lease rates continue to outperform our urban lease rates, although the gap has narrowed due to the strong rebound we're experiencing in our urban portfolio. \u2047 Blended lease rate growth was 7% for leases signed in September and over 8% for leases signed in October on an effective basis which represents a significant increase in the third quarter average. \u2047 For move-ins that took place during the third quarter, blended lease rate growth was 3.5% on average on an effective basis, representing a 620 basis point increase from the second quarter. \u2047 Lease rate growth for September and October move-ins and lease executions with November and December move-in dates, indicates steady and consistent improvement through year-end. \u2047 We expect strong lease rate growth through the winter months and into the spring and summer leasing seasons in 2022. \u2047 Rents have shown a swift recovery. \u2047 The inflection as indicated by the rapid weekly improvement in lease rate growth, began toward the end of June and rental rates improved rapidly through the summer. \u2047 In August, we started signing new leases that were above pre-COVID levels for the majority of our portfolio. \u2047 Specifically, the average effective rent for new leases in the third quarter was above the same month in 2019 for 17 of our 21 same-store properties. \u2047 In fact, new leases for our suburban portfolio were 10% above the 2019 level on average in the third quarter, highlighting how well our suburban properties performed during the pandemic. \u2047 We expect to see steady growth in average portfoliowide rent levels, as the market recovery works its way in our rent roll, over the next year. \u2047 Our ability to capture this embedded growth will be slower during the winter months, as less than 25% of our leases expire between November and December. \u2047 During this time, we will be focused on balancing rent growth with retention as maintaining a balance and fundamentals heading into 2022 will set us up, for anticipated exceptionally strong spring and summer leasing season. \u2047 As we enter the spring and summer, we will be positioned to capture both the impact of the recovery and market rent growth beyond the COVID-related recovery. \u2047 Trove lease-up momentum continues and it is now over 85% occupied. \u2047 We expect Trove to be a key growth driver adding approximately $7 million of NOI in 2022 and $7.6 million of NOI in 2023. \u2047 We also continued to monitor demand levels at Riverside, where we have a shovel-ready opportunity to add 767 units which we put on hold when COVID hit. \u2047 While lease executions of Riverside are on a positive trend, we're currently monitoring projected lease rate growth, to support this development. \u2047 Our renovation programs are actively ramping up, after they were temporarily paused during the pandemic. \u2047 We have a pipeline of approximately 2,700 units in our same-store portfolio. \u2047 As expected, the pace of renovations picked up through the summer months, while unit turnover is seasonally high. \u2047 In many cases we preserve the renovation opportunity for the next turn, as we're achieving strong effective rent growth without currently having to make a capital investment. \u2047 Year-to-date we have fully renovated over 130 units and have invested capital in upgrading 110 additional units. \u2047 We are securing low to mid double-digit cash on cash returns year-to-date. \u2047 We expect to spend $3 million in our renovation program this year ramping up to approximately $7.50 million to $8 million next year for the current same-store portfolio. \u2047 In the spirit of our transformation into a multifamily REIT, we have made changes to our earnings materials and non-GAAP financial metrics to be more in"], "gold_summary": ["q3 core ffo per share $0.20.  \u2047  core ffo for 2021 is expected to be $1.05 to $1.08 per share."], "pred_summary": ["q3 ffo per share $0.40.  \u2047  q3 ffo per share $0.40."]}
