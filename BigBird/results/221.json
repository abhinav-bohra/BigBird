{"article": ["They are based on management's assumptions, which may or may not occur. \u2047 In addition, some of our comments today reference non-GAAP adjusted measures. \u2047 We expect to file our 10-K later today. \u2047 As mentioned, this teleconference is being recorded and will be available on our website following the call. \u2047 Please note these calls are designed for the financial community. \u2047 Well, years come and go but 2020, as we all know, was unforgettable. \u2047 The pandemic affected many aspects of our daily lives, and I'm proud of the way our employees pulled together to provide our customers with superior service. \u2047 We successfully navigated a number of challenges while still achieving our key financial and operational goals. \u2047 We reported net income from continuing operations of $2.30 per share for 2020. \u2047 That's driven by solid performance at the gas utility and a strong contribution from our new platform of water utilities. \u2047 On the gas operations front, our field crews successfully handled everything from wildfires to restoring service in several towns over Christmas to navigating COVID, social unrest, etc. \u2047 Just a few weeks ago, our employees in the natural gas system once again rose to the occasion and provided a reliable service through an extreme weather event. \u2047 Our storage facilities and overall hedge positions worked to mitigate the amount of gas purchased on the spot market and helped to minimize the impact to our customers' bills. \u2047 This was incredibly important as prices, as everybody knows, spiked across the country from the widespread cold snap. \u2047 Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity. \u2047 In 2020, we also executed on one of the largest capital programs in the Company's history aimed at supporting reliability. \u2047 We continue to operate one of the most modern and tightest systems in the nation, a system that has no cast iron and no bare steel. \u2047 In 2020, we invested over $270 million in our natural gas infrastructure. \u2047 From an economic perspective, 2020 was truly unprecedented. \u2047 Prior to the pandemic, we had a very fundamentally sound sustainable growing economy with record low unemployment both nationally and in our service territories. \u2047 We continue to see economic recovery and steady growth in several important areas. \u2047 Portland's unemployment right now is 6.1% in December, actually, essentially matching the national rate that's down from a 14.9% high in April. \u2047 Single-family housing activity remains strong. \u2047 In the Portland metro region, home sales were at 8.3% from 2019, with price growth of about 12%. \u2047 And new single-family permits issued last year were up 4% compared to 2019 levels. \u2047 At Northwest Natural, we continue to see good customer growth. \u2047 New construction plus conversions translated in connecting over 13,000 meters during the last 12 months ended December 31. \u2047 Our overall customer growth rate as a result was 1.5% for the same period, based on this strong single-family home construction, partially offset by the loss of some commercial customers due to the pandemic. \u2047 The rollout of vaccines is expected to ease pandemic related restrictions and allow businesses to reopen. \u2047 Still, we know these are difficult times for some customers and we've worked very closely with commissions, staff and stakeholders to determine the best way to return to normal business practices. \u2047 We've agreed to timelines for resuming collection processes and continue to evaluate the parties what makes sense for customers given the economic conditions, while also providing financial assistance and payment plans to vulnerable customers. \u2047 Enhancing the system includes a bill forgiveness program and working with the Oregon Legislature to provide additional funding for bill relief. \u2047 Through a variety of programs and agencies, we've provided over $4 million to over 10,000 households to pay their bills and stay warm during the last heating season. \u2047 We also donated about $1 million to nonprofits in our communities and initiated a special COVID-19 employee giving campaign. \u2047 For Oregon, previously approved new rates took effect on November 1 last year. \u2047 Gas bills continue to remain low. \u2047 Our customers are paying about 40% less today for their bills than they did 15 years ago. \u2047 In addition, in June, we passed back a record $17 million in storage bill credits to Oregon gas customers. \u2047 Safety, reliability and affordability make natural gas a preferred fuel source. \u2047 Eight out of 10 homeowners in our service territory prefer natural gas according to a study conducted in December 2020. \u2047 There's a strong recognition that natural gas is affordable, efficient and preferable to electricity for heating and cooking. \u2047 In fact, over 80% of respondents said they would pay $50,000 more for a home that has gas amenities over an all-electric home. \u2047 Customers also showed their appreciation by ranking Northwest Natural second in the West among large utilities in the 2020 JD Power's residential customer satisfaction survey. \u2047 And then finally, our Board approved the dividend increase in the fourth quarter back in 2020, the 65th consecutive year of annual dividend increases. \u2047 We are proud to provide the return to shareholders and be one of only three companies on the NYSE with that long record. \u2047 I will begin by discussing the financial impacts of COVID-19 and the highlights of the fourth quarter and full year 2020 results and then conclude with guidance for 2021. \u2047 In 2020, our utility commissions approved COVID deferrals and term sheets that outlined the types of revenues and costs that may be recovered. \u2047 These include PPE, bad debt expense, financing costs associated with additional liquidity and certain loss revenues. \u2047 Direct expense reductions such as lower travel and meals and entertainment are to be netted against the deferral. \u2047 Prudency review and recovery of the deferral accounts will be determined in future proceedings. \u2047 While our business model is resilient, we are experiencing some financial impacts related to the pandemic. \u2047 Through December 31, we incurred an estimated $10 million pre-tax of incremental costs and lower revenues due to the effects of COVID-19. \u2047 Of this, $4.8 million were deferred to regulatory accounts. \u2047 In addition, $1.3 million of late fee revenue that has not been charged to customers since the suspension of normal collection processes will be recognized in a future period when we begin to recover the foregone fees through rates. \u2047 The remaining $3.8 million that cannot be recovered through rates are primarily due to lower natural gas utility margin from customers that stopped service and slightly lower usage from customers that are not decoupled. \u2047 In order to further mitigate the financial effects of the pandemic, we initiated temporary cost savings measures which provided approximately $3.5 million of savings in 2020. \u2047 In summary, the total P&L impact of COVID in 2020 was $1.6 million. \u2047 Turning to our detailed financial results. \u2047 Note, I'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%. \u2047 Also note that year-to-date earnings per share comparisons reflect the successful issuance of 1.4 million shares in June 2019 as we raised equity to fund investment in our gas and water utilities. \u2047 As a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with a majority of revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating season. \u2047 For the quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $45.8 million or $1.50 per share compared to $38.3 million or $1.26 per share for the same period in 2019. \u2047 The gas utility posted an increase of $0.19 per share related to new rates in Oregon beginning November 1, 2020, offset in part by higher depreciation and general tax expense and the impacts of COVID-19. \u2047 Contribution from our other businesses increased $0.05 per share from the water assets we acquired in Washington and Texas and lower expenses at the holding company. \u2047 Utility margin in the gas distribution segment increased $11.5 million from the benefit of new rates in Oregon and customer growth, partly offset by the effects of COVID-19. \u2047 Utility O&M decreased $500,000 in the quarter, reflecting cost savings efforts. \u2047 I am proud of our employees whose hard work and commitment allowed us to accomplish this while still providing exceptional service. \u2047 Depreciation expense and general taxes increased $2.9 million related to the ongoing investment in our system. \u2047 For the full year 2020, we reported net income from continuing operations of $70.3 million or $2.30 per share compared to net income of $65.3 million or $2.19 per share for 2019. \u2047 2019 results included a regulatory disallowance of $0.22 per share related to an Oregon Commission order on tax reform and pension expense. \u2047 Excluding that disallowance on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.41 for 2019. \u2047 The $0.11 per share decline is largely due to year-over-year growth in expenses, the effects of COVID and the positive effects of weather and pipeline constraints on 2019 results. \u2047 In the gas distribution segment, utility margin increased $11.3 million. \u2047 Higher customer rates in Oregon and Washington, customer growth and revenues from the Northwest expansion project contributed an additional $21.5 million. \u2047 This was offset by lower entitlement and curtailment fees related to pipeline constraints in 2019 and warmer weather in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019, which collectively reduced margin by $4.5 million. \u2047 Utility margin also declined $1 million due to lower revenues from late fees as we suspended normal collection processes. \u2047 The remaining $5.2 million decline in utility margin is a result of the 2019 Oregon order. \u2047 With the exception of the first quarter pension disallowance, this order has no impact on net income as offsetting adjustments were recognized through expenses and income taxes, as I'll describe in a moment. \u2047 Utility O&M and other expenses declined $5.4 million. \u2047 This decrease is associated with the Oregon order which resulted in $14 million of additional expense in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed previously. \u2047 This was offset by a $6 million increase in underlying O&M related to higher compensation costs, contractor and professional service expenses as well as moving costs. \u2047 This was partially offset by the management driven cost savings measures I described earlier. \u2047 Pension expenses, included in other expense, increased $2.8 million. \u2047 However, this expense is now recovered in rates. \u2047 Over the last several years, we have invested in our gas system at historically high levels. \u2047 As a result, depreciation expense and general taxes increased $10.2 million. \u2047 Finally, utility segment tax expense in 2019 included a $5.9 million benefit related to the implementation of the Oregon order, with no significant resulting effect on net income. \u2047 Net income from our other businesses increased $2.2 million from higher earnings from the wastewater, water and wastewater utilities and lower expenses at our holding companies, partially offset by lower asset management revenues. \u2047 A note on capex. \u2047 We invested $294 million into the business, with $273 million of gas utility capital expenditures and $38 million for water acquisitions. \u2047 Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity. \u2047 With regards to the ongoing effects of COVID-19, approximately 97% of our commercial and industrial customers are current with their bills. \u2047 Nonetheless, we have seen some commercial customers go out of business and shut off their meters as they have been negatively impacted. \u2047 We will continue to monitor -- closely monitor usage levels and commercial customer losses. \u2047 We will also continue to be disciplined regarding cost management in an effort to mitigate these circumstances. \u2047 Moving on to 2021 financial guidance. \u2047 Gas utility capital expenditures for the year are expected to be in the $280 million to $320 million range, including significant projects related to system reinforcement, resource center renovations across our service territory and technology upgrades. \u2047 The Company initiated 2021 earnings guidance today in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. \u2047 Guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in laws, legislation or regulations. \u2047 While the past year held challenges, our focus remains the same: providing superior customer service, maximizing returns from our strong and growing regulated natural gas utility and diversifying our business by investing in the water sector. \u2047 We made progress on that last front with the sale of two investments that were no longer central to our strategy. \u2047 In August, we sold our interest in the Trail West pipeline project, and in December we completed the sale of the Gill Ranch storage facility in California. \u2047 Proceeds from the sales are expected to be reinvested in our gas and water businesses. \u2047 This past year reinforced our decision to build a water and wastewater utility platform and highlighted the value we bring and can create in this sector. \u2047 Our water and wastewater utilities experienced organic customer growth of almost 3%, 2.8% to be exact, over the 12 months ended December 31, 2020. \u2047 We also completed infrastructure improvements and filed our first water utility general rate case. \u2047 Although COVID temporary slowed acquisition -- temporarily closed acquisition activity -- slowed -- excuse me, temporarily slowed acquisition activity, we were still able to add a water and wastewater utility in Washington to our portfolio and made our first acquisition in Texas. \u2047 And we continued to make smaller acquisitions within our existing footprint while pursuing new expansion opportunities. \u2047 I remain -- I continue to remain very excited about the investment potential in this business. \u2047 Another key pillar of our strategy is aggressively pursuing a renewable future and working to decarbonize our gas utility system. \u2047 Before I take you through our approach, it's important to remember our starting point. \u2047 Northwest Natural serves about 74% of the residential square footage in our service territory and meets 90% of our space and water heat customers' energy needs on our coldest days, yet the emissions associated with that use accounts for only 6% of Oregon's total greenhouse gas emissions. \u2047 In the Northwest, the gas and electric system have concurrent peaks in the winter. \u2047 The gas system delivers about twice as much energy during the peak than the electric system, with even more capacity available. \u2047 This advantage positions us well to help drive decarbonization in the region in a way that ensures reliability and affordability. \u2047 And, as we have seen in recent weeks, one can never underestimate how important reliability is during the winter. \u2047 Let me walk you through three components of our vision of carbon neutrality by 2050. \u2047 First, we intend to continue to pursue aggressive energy efficiency to lower energy usage. \u2047 In the past 40 years, the number of residential natural gas customers in the US has grown by almost 90%, but demand has remained flat, which is a testament to the industry and how well they foster continued efficiency. \u2047 Our residential customers today use half of the amount of natural gas that they used in 1970 despite consistent growth in the average size of homes and more clients as per home. \u2047 Second, we're striving to integrate renewable natural gas from a variety of waste streams into our system. \u2047 The"], "gold_summary": ["q4 earnings per share $1.50 from continuing operations.  \u2047
