{"article": ["Slides for today's call are posted on our website, and we invite you to follow along. \u2047 Participants are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of today, April 29, 2020. \u2047 Information on potential factors and risks that could affect our actual results of operations is included in our SEC filings. \u2047 The company undertakes no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to the statements made in today's call other than through filings made concerning this reporting period. \u2047 In addition, today's discussion will include references to non-GAAP measures. \u2047 Clean Harbors believes that such information provides an additional measurement and consistent historical comparison of its performance. \u2047 Starting on Slide 3. \u2047 Before discussing our Q1 results, I'd like to address the coronavirus pandemic and how we're responding to it. \u2047 Obviously, the outbreak has created a healthcare crisis and caused economic disruption around the globe, and I hope that all of you and your families are staying safe. \u2047 Here at Clean Harbors, the safety of our employees is part of our culture and the top priority during this pandemic. \u2047 As an essential services provider with teams on the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis, we have instituted rigorous safety protocols and work closely with suppliers to make certain we have the necessary equipment to protect our employees. \u2047 During the crisis, our workforce has remained out in the field and at our plants, supporting our customers' needs across North America. \u2047 The workforce representing critical administrative functions has supported our field teams from home, and the strength of our systems has allowed that transition to be virtually seamless. \u2047 We expect the virus to impede our business in the second quarter, particularly within Safety-Kleen. \u2047 In addition to limited driving and business activity across North America, Safety-Kleen also had been affected by the sharp downturn and the value of base oil. \u2047 In short, we are faced with some difficult near-term market conditions, and we are making -- taking significant actions in response. \u2047 Let me touch on some of those actions. \u2047 Starting with alignment of our cost structure with the demand environment, we are rightsizing our workforce through furloughs and other reductions and implemented a nonbillable hiring and wage freeze, and we restricted all travel. \u2047 We've also gone back to many of our vendors and suppliers to negotiate for savings or improved payment terms. \u2047 In addition, we've temporarily shutted half of our rerefining capacity to reflect the current demand for base oil as well as the likelihood of less available used motor oil in Q2 and beyond. \u2047 From a liquidity perspective, we drew down $150 million on our revolver to strengthen our balance sheet in the event that crisis worsens. \u2047 We have reset our net CapEx spend plans for 2020, and we've lowered our expected spend by more than $50 million to preserve capital and support our free cash flow for the year. \u2047 That said, I believe our strong balance sheet leaves us well-positioned to succeed. \u2047 Turning to Q1 financials on Slide 4. \u2047 Revenues rose 10% from a year ago as both operating segments recorded solid growth. \u2047 At the same time, our adjusted EBITDA increased to a record $122.6 million, driven by our mix of high-value waste streams and high utilization, augmented by projects and emergency response work. \u2047 Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points to 14.3%. \u2047 Looking at our segment results, beginning on Slide 5. \u2047 Environmental Services revenue grew 11% based by contributions from our facilities network and Field Services group and aided by warmer weather nearly all quarter. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA growth of 22% was driven by business mix, disposal volumes, and emergency response revenue. \u2047 Emergency response work totaled $21 million, representing COVID-19 de-con work and a cleanup of a chemical plant fire. \u2047 Our disposal facilities saw impressive volumes this quarter as incinerator utilization increased to 86% and landfill tonnage grew 39%. \u2047 Our average price per pound for incineration in Q1 was up 11%, reflecting the record level of high-margin direct burn streams that we gathered. \u2047 Overall, another terrific quarter for our Environmental Service segment. \u2047 Moving to Slide 6. \u2047 Safety-Kleen revenue was up 8%, primarily by growth in the SK Oil business. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA and margin improved on lower SK Oil transportation costs and higher rerefining production compared with a year ago when volumes were disrupted by frozen rivers and flooding. \u2047 Within the SK branch business, core services performed well. \u2047 While parts washer services were flat with the prior year, waste ore collection was up slightly to 55 million gallons, blended products accounted for 25% of volume in the quarter, and our direct volume was 7%. \u2047 The first quarter began with positive signs that IMO 2020 was going to enable us to expand our refining spread as high sulfur fuel oil values had fallen, and base oil prices were up in early January. \u2047 But the oil shock sparked by the global outbreak of the coronavirus, IMO 2020 has largely been sidelined, and base oil has fallen by $1 a gallon. \u2047 We entered Q2 with significant pressure on our rerefining spread. \u2047 And in this environment, the value of used motor oil is in a charge-for-oil state. \u2047 In response to the current market conditions, we've significantly raised our charge-for-oil program. \u2047 Driving in the U.S. and Canada needs to normalize before our spread and lubricant demand can rebound. \u2047 And we see conditions -- when we see conditions improve, we'll consider reopening our closed rerefineries. \u2047 Turning to Slide 7. \u2047 Given the current environment, our capital allocation strategy is critical as ever. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, we are reducing our planned net CapEx by more than $50 million. \u2047 We divested two businesses in Western Canada in the first quarter as we continued to steadily shrink our direct exposure to energy. \u2047 Since we began executing our divestiture program several years ago, we've sold seven businesses for approximately $120 million in proceeds. \u2047 In terms of M&A, we're not likely to be active near term. \u2047 Long term, we believe we'll emerge from this market downturn stronger, both financially and operationally than some of our peers, which will allow us to be opportunistic. \u2047 For our buyback program, we will likely hold off until we are certain that the domestic economy is on a clear path to recovery. \u2047 In addition, we'll look to repay the $150 million on the revolver as soon as this crisis shows signs of nearing an end. \u2047 Looking ahead to our segments, although we have seen some cancellations and project delays due to COVID-19, we expect our Environmental Service segment to weather the current downturn well. \u2047 We expect our decontamination work and growing volumes of infection waste to help offset what would certainly be a larger decline. \u2047 Within Safety-Kleen, we expect both our branch business and our SK Oil to be hit fairly hard, particularly here in Q2 as stay at home orders greatly reduce vehicle travel and generate less used motor oil. \u2047 Our SK branch business should rebound as shelter-in-place mandates are lifted and low gasoline prices encourage a rebound in driving. \u2047 In SK Oil, our rerefining spread has contracted with a drop in crude, and we have aggressively increased our charge-for-oil pricing, but volumes are off and near-term demand for base oil has fallen. \u2047 In summary, our Q1 results demonstrated the strength of our business model, the value of our assets and our frontline role in emergency response. \u2047 Our market leadership, financial liquidity and positive free cash flow will enable us to navigate this global crisis. \u2047 Let me echo Alan's comments about the outstanding work of our team and everyone on the front lines of the crisis. \u2047 Through the unprecedented events we've experienced in just a few weeks, I think we all have a deeper appreciation for the professionals, especially healthcare workers, who put themselves at risk every day to help those in need. \u2047 Turning to Slide 9 and our income statement. \u2047 As Alan indicated, we delivered record first quarter results. \u2047 Revenue grew nearly $78 million, while adjusted EBITDA grew by nearly $21 million. \u2047 This reflects the mix of business we achieved in the quarter, project work and favorable weather. \u2047 From a gross profit perspective, we saw a sharp increase in both absolute dollars and on a percentage basis due to higher utilization, pricing, and a favorable comp with prior year. \u2047 Our gross margin increased by 160 basis points from a year ago. \u2047 SG&A expenses were up $14.5 million in the quarter due to the higher revenue, investments in our employees, and some onetime expenses from last year -- onetime items from last year. \u2047 As we move forward, we are focusing much of our cost reduction efforts in this area to bring expenses in line with our revenue. \u2047 Depreciation and amortization in Q1 was down slightly to $47.5 million. \u2047 We completed two small bolt-on acquisitions in 2019, while also divesting several businesses. \u2047 For 2020, we expect depreciation and amortization in the range of $285 million to $295 million, which is a little lower than last year. \u2047 Income from operations increased 92% to $45.5 million, a first-quarter record, reflecting the combination of our revenue growth and improved gross profit. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.21 in Q1 versus $0.02 a year ago. \u2047 Our adjusted earnings per share was $0.28. \u2047 Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 10. \u2047 As Alan mentioned, we drew $150 million on our revolver during the first quarter which increased our cash and short-term marketable securities to $494.3 million at quarter end. \u2047 We saw reasonable AR collection late in March, which led to a healthy cash balance. \u2047 Our strong liquidity position further protects our company and adds financial flexibility should we need it. \u2047 Our balance sheet remains in good shape. \u2047 Current and long-term debt obligations at quarter end rose to $1.7 billion, reflecting the drawdown on our revolver. \u2047 Our weighted average cost of debt is now 4.3% with a healthy mix of fixed and variable debt. \u2047 Leverage on a net debt basis was 2.2x for the trailing 12 months ended March 31. \u2047 Looking at our most recent cash balance from yesterday, our cash remains essentially flat from where we ended Q1. \u2047 The team has done a nice job maintaining its focus on collections and managing our spend. \u2047 Turning to cash flows on Slide 11. \u2047 Cash from operations in Q1 was up slightly at -- to $33.7 million. \u2047 CapEx, net of disposals and the purchase of our headquarters, was $59.9 million, up from a year ago, resulting in adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of a negative $26.2 million, which is consistent with prior year and our expectations. \u2047 For the year, we are now targeting CapEx, net of disposals and purchase of our headquarters in a range of $140 million to $160 million. \u2047 During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 300,000 shares of our stock at an average price of $57.41 a share for a total of $17.3 million. \u2047 As Alan mentioned, we'll be cautious in our approach to buybacks until we see evidence that markets are well into their recovery stage. \u2047 As Alan also noted, given the uncertain market environment, we would -- we are withdrawing our 2020 guidance. \u2047 We're hopeful we'll be able to reinstate guidance with our Q2 earnings announcement, provided markets have stabilized. \u2047 In summary, Q1 was a strong quarter, highlighted by several financial records, including adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 If it were not for COVID-19, our Q1 results would have positioned us for the fourth straight year of profitable growth. \u2047 We have taken significant actions in response to the pandemic and are prepared to take additional steps in the event of a prolonged recovery. \u2047 We are focused on things we can control, carefully -- including carefully managing our costs, and pursuing new waste streams to feed our landfills and incinerators. \u2047
