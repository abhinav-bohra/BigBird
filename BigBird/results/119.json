{"article": ["During this conference call, you will hear management make statements regarding intra-quarter business performance. \u2047 Management is providing this commentary to provide the investment community with additional insights concerning trends, and these disclosures may not occur in subsequent quarters. \u2047 It's a pleasure to speak with you today. \u2047 For the third quarter, Teleflex generated double-digit constant currency revenue and 27% adjusted earnings-per-share growth on a year-over-year basis despite a greater-than-expected headwind from increased COVID-19 infections due to the Delta variant. \u2047 All of our global product families grew on a constant currency basis year-over-year with the exception of our other category due to the divestiture of the respiratory assets to Medline. \u2047 Although we encountered a change in macro trends versus expectations at the time of the second quarter, the solid performance for Teleflex during the third quarter of 2021 reflects the diversified nature of our business and the benefits of the company's broad portfolio of medically necessary products and category leadership. \u2047 Our six primary product families and broad global footprint helped offset pressure on product revenues associated with elective surgery that were subject to pauses during the third quarter. \u2047 As many investors will be aware, there were restrictions on elective surgical procedures in as many as 28 states during the third quarter. \u2047 However, as we have seen since the pandemic began, our broad-based portfolio provides a hedge in periods of increased COVID activity with more than 60% of our business, either benefiting from increased COVID-related treatments or remaining relatively insulated from disruptions due to the pandemic. \u2047 Although we do not routinely provide intra-quarter commentary, given the larger-than-expected surge in COVID-19 infections from the delta variant, I will share some details for the third quarter. \u2047 Relative to guidance provided at the time of our Q2 earnings report, we saw a greater-than-anticipated pause in elective surgical procedures across select geographies in the U.S., Europe and Asia. \u2047 However, as COVID-19 infections trended down, we saw our average daily sales for products most exposed to elective surgical procedures begin to improve as we progressed through September. \u2047 During the third quarter, our Americas, EMEA, Asia and OEM segments demonstrated resilience with all regions showing constant currency revenue growth over 2020 despite the headwinds from the delta variant. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, this underscores the benefit of our diversified product portfolio. \u2047 For the third quarter, gross and operating margins exceeded levels achieved in 2020 and 2019 in comparable periods. \u2047 Our continued progress in margin expansion in 2021 has allowed us to increase directed investments toward growth drivers, which is an important component of our long-term strategy to enhance durable growth. \u2047 We remain cognizant of uncertainty around COVID-19 infections as the weather turns colder in the Northern Hemisphere, new variants and healthcare worker shortages. \u2047 Accordingly, we believe that it is prudent to assume that COVID-19 will remain a headwind and that a broad-based return to elective surgical procedures to normal volumes is unlikely during the fourth quarter. \u2047 We anticipate these elements to be transitory in nature, and we expect a more normalized environment to be established in 2022. \u2047 Given our year-to-date results and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are reducing our constant currency revenue growth to a range of 8% to 9% from 8.5% to 9.75% previously. \u2047 The revision in the constant currency growth outlook is primarily driven by lower growth expectations for products used in elective surgical procedures. \u2047 However, given strength in our operating margin performance and improvements in our balance sheet, we are increasing earnings per share guidance to a range of $13.15 to $13.35 versus our previous range of $12.90 to $13.10, implying growth of 23% to 25% year-over-year. \u2047 Turning to a more detailed review of our third quarter results. \u2047 Third quarter revenue was $700.3 million, an increase of 10.3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. \u2047 The year-over-year increase reflects the benefit of our diversified portfolio and was driven by contributions from all business segments, offset by the impact of COVID-19 and the divestiture of the respiratory assets to Medline. \u2047 In comparison to the comparable period in 2019, third quarter revenue increased 5.8% and demonstrated accelerating quarter-over-quarter growth in our Vascular, OEM and Anesthesia businesses, which offset sequential deceleration in areas of the business more exposed to the surge in COVID-19, including Interventional Urology, Interventional and Surgical. \u2047 Third quarter growth and operating margin performance exceeded our expectations reflecting the strength of our diversified portfolio, partially offset by greater-than-anticipated headwinds from COVID-19. \u2047 Our year-to-date margin performance is an encouraging sign for our longer-term profitability objectives. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $3.51 increased 26.7% year-over-year and exceeded our internal expectations. \u2047 Despite higher-than-anticipated headwinds from COVID-19 on our adjusted earnings per share results in the third quarter, the year-over-year performance reflects growth in our diversified product portfolio, modest price increases, gross margin expansion and better-than-expected operating expense management. \u2047 We continue to execute on our strategy to deliver durable growth with investment in organic growth opportunities, product innovation, margin expansion and deployment of capital for deleveraging our balance sheet and M&A. \u2047 I am proud of how the team continues to execute in a challenging environment. \u2047 Our third quarter financial performance demonstrates the resilience of our diversified global product portfolio, our targeted investment in growth drivers, including UroLift and MANTA while also reflecting progress toward our longer-term margin aspirations. \u2047 Turning now to a deeper look at revenue results. \u2047 I will begin with a review of our reportable segment revenues. \u2047 Americas revenues were $417.3 million in the third quarter, which represents 10.9% growth year-over-year. \u2047 Contributors to the year-over-year growth were Surgical, Vascular and Interventional, partially offset by the impact of pauses in elective surgical procedures. \u2047 EMEA revenues of $143.9 million increased 3.6% year-over-year with Interventional and Vascular products leading the growth. \u2047 EMEA benefited from a favorable COVID-19-related comparison due to improved procedure volumes year-over-year as countries across the region continued to open up despite disruptions related to COVID-19. \u2047 Revenues were $75 million, increasing 6.3% year-over-year. \u2047 Japan was strong in the third quarter, growing north of 30%, but was partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 in Southeast Asia. \u2047 Let's now move to a discussion of our third quarter revenues by global product category. \u2047 Consistent with my prior comments regarding our reportable segments, commentary on global product category growth will also be on a constant currency basis and ranked by size of our business units. \u2047 As a reminder, there were no meaningful differences in year-over-year selling days in the third quarter. \u2047 Starting with Vascular Access. \u2047 Third quarter revenue increased 8.5% to $175.5 million. \u2047 Our category leadership in central venous catheters and midlines, along with our novel coated PICC portfolio, continues to position us for dependable growth. \u2047 Our Vascular Access portfolio remains important in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, driving strength in the third quarter due to increased rates of coronavirus infections. \u2047 Our PICC portfolio continues to perform well with 10% growth year-over-year. \u2047 We continue to invest behind our differentiated PICC portfolio and are taking market share. \u2047 Intraosseous was also solid in the third quarter with growth up 12% year-over-year. \u2047 Third quarter revenue was $104.3 million, up 10.4% year-over-year. \u2047 We executed well during the third quarter, although increased COVID-19 infections slowed complex PCI and TAVR procedures. \u2047 We continue to invest behind our interventional portfolio, including complex catheters and MANTA, our large-bore closure device. \u2047 MANTA momentum remains strong, both in the U.S. and in international markets, with over 80% global growth year-over-year in the third quarter. \u2047 Given the year-to-date performance for MANTA, we are confident in our ability to achieve 8% share in 2021 of the $200 million to $300 million global market opportunity. \u2047 Turning now to Anesthesia. \u2047 Third quarter revenue was $97.1 million, up 26.6% year-over-year. \u2047 Products from Z-Medica contributed roughly 85% of the growth as the business continues to track to our $60 million to $70 million revenue expectations for 2021, partly offset by lower sales of tracheostomy products. \u2047 In our Surgical business, revenue was $92.8 million, representing 10.9% growth year-over-year. \u2047 Among our largest product categories, we witnessed robust growth in sales of our ligation clips and instruments as the elective surgical procedure environment was stronger than in the prior year period, partially offset by the impact of the Delta variant in select geographies. \u2047 Urology, third quarter revenue was $83.1 million, an increase of 1.5% year-over-year and below our expectations at the time of the quarter two conference call. \u2047 The quarter was impacted by elective surgery cancellations due to state restrictions and ICU capacity limitations as delta variant infections rose sharply in certain regions of the U.S. as well as continued business disruption associated with the pandemic. \u2047 We are closely monitoring trends in our UroLift business. \u2047 Importantly, our analysis of commercial and Medicare billing claims over the past six months indicates that UroLift has not lost market share to competing minimally invasive treatments for BPH and remains the leading procedure. \u2047 We continue to see COVID-19 as having the most significant impact on UroLift utilization with physician office staffing shortages also disrupting the business. \u2047 We see both of these impacts as transitory in nature and expect a more normalized environment in 2022. \u2047 The preference for UroLift continues to be driven by strong clinical results, with studies showing rapid symptom relief and recovery, no new sustained sexual dysfunction and durable results. \u2047 Indeed, our analysis shows that very few of our experienced users offer other technologies for the treatment of BPH given their confidence in UroLift. \u2047 The UroLift system remains distinct from other device-based BPH treatments, and we intend to maintain our leading market position in day surgery treatments for this condition. \u2047 We continue to target patients that are suffering from BPH and have either failed or are not satisfied with drug therapy, a population that is estimated to be 1.5 million men in the United States. \u2047 As we look toward the fourth quarter of 2021, we are assuming a relatively stable macro environment as compared to our September trends given lingering COVID-19 headwinds for elective surgical procedures. \u2047 When taking into account the softer-than-expected UroLift revenues during the third quarter and our recalibration of the fourth quarter, we are reducing our 2021 Interventional Urology revenue growth guidance to 15% to 17% year-over-year. \u2047 We would anticipate a more normal environment for elective surgical procedures to emerge during 2022. \u2047 We remain encouraged by the physician engagement as measured by our active users, new physician training, and the ability to perform UroLift procedures in all relevant care settings. \u2047 Our OEM business, which accounts for roughly 9% of total sales increased 29.4% year-over-year to $64.1 million in the third quarter. \u2047 We continue to see strength in our OEM business as customer ordering normalizes, and we remain well positioned in our markets with customers valuing our design and manufacturing capabilities. \u2047 And finally, our other category, which consists of respiratory products that were not included in the divestiture to Medline, manufacturing service agreement revenues and Urology Care products declined by 4.3% to $83.4 million year-over-year. \u2047 The decline largely reflects the loss of revenue due to the divestiture of the respiratory products, partially offset by manufacturing service agreement revenues and growth in Urology Care. \u2047 We continue to expect manufacturing service agreement revenues to phase out at the end of 2023. \u2047 That completes my comments on the third quarter revenue performance. \u2047 Turning to some commercial updates and starting with UroLift. \u2047 In the third quarter, we trained 124 urologists. \u2047 Interest in UroLift remains strong, and with over 355 doctors trained in the year-to-date, we remain positioned to meet our training target of 450 to 500 urologists in 2021. \u2047 Turning to our consumer marketing efforts. \u2047 We continue to view direct-to-consumer as a multiyear catalyst for UroLift in the United States. \u2047 We have continued to fund our DTC campaign to prime the pump for the recovery in elective procedures, and we'll keep investing in the fourth quarter. \u2047 We recently won a bronze award for best new branded television campaign from DTC perspective, which is a meaningful accomplishment given 13 finalists. \u2047 Search interest for UroLip remains high and well above other minimally invasive BPH treatments with the majority of urologist surveys continuing to report patients asking for the UroLift System. \u2047 Moving to UroLift 2. \u2047 We remain on a full rollout in the United States. \u2047 We've formally launched the product as well as the UroLift ATC to the broad urology community at the AUA meeting in September. \u2047 We are well positioned to convert the majority of physician customers to UroLift two by the end of 2022, fueled by advantages in tissue compression, reduced storage space and increased manufacturing capacity. \u2047 UroLift two remains an important margin driver as we remain positioned to generate 400 basis points of UroLift gross margin expansion as the revenue base is fully converted. \u2047 Regarding Japan, we continue to make progress toward an upcoming commercial launch for UroLift. \u2047 Recently, the three major Japanese urology societies agreed on guidelines for UroLift usage, which is a positive development. \u2047 As for reimbursement approval, we remain highly engaged with the MHLW and has been officially notified that UroLift will be reviewed at an expert panel in November. \u2047 Although we cannot control the timing of the regulatory pathway, the panel confirmation is an important milestone toward reimbursement in Japan, marking one of the final steps in the process. \u2047 There is no change to our baseline assumptions that our commercial ramp will begin in 2022. \u2047 Japan remains"],
