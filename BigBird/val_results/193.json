{"article": ["The third quarter marked a nice sequential improvement in our financial performance with results coming in above the high end of our expectations. \u2047 You will recall that based on early signs of recovery at the end of the second quarter, we raised our guidance for the year. \u2047 Based on stronger-than-expected performance in the third quarter, we are again raising our full-year guidance ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. \u2047 We are expecting a continuation of this recovery trends in the fourth quarter. \u2047 This, of course, sets us up well for next year. \u2047 As we promised back in April at the onset of the pandemic, we will talk to you today about our outlook for 2021. \u2047 Based on what we currently see, we think the most significant COVID impacts to our business are behind us and our outlook for 2021 indicates strong performance next year and a return to our growth trajectory. \u2047 Ron will discuss 2020 and 2021 guidance in more detail later. \u2047 Before we review the quarter, a quick operational update. \u2047 We continue to experience a gradual improvement in the accessibility of clinical research sites in the R&D Solutions business even with the localized flare-ups we've seen around the world. \u2047 We are seeing a return to onsite monitoring visits and similar to last quarter onsite visits exceeded the number of remote visits. \u2047 In instances where sites remain physically inaccessible for clinical monitoring, remote monitoring and virtual solutions are proving to be effective workarounds. \u2047 The pace of start-up activity picked up significantly during the third quarter and we are pretty much back to baseline levels for site initiation visits. \u2047 Of course, patient recruitment trends have started to follow as well. \u2047 Moving to Technology & Analytics. \u2047 As expected, TAS has remained resilient throughout this crisis in almost every area. \u2047 We've had very little interruption in data supplier demand. \u2047 Our information services continue to be mission critical to our clients and are therefore very insulated from the impacts of the pandemic. \u2047 The analytics and consulting businesses have performed remarkably well despite business development being hampered by the lack of in-person interactions. \u2047 One area we discussed before that has experienced significant disruption is the event management business, which relies almost entirely on face-to-face interaction. \u2047 And, of course, as you know, that business is essentially on pause for now. \u2047 Demand for our technology offerings remains strong. \u2047 We've added 45 OCE clients this year, bringing our total number of clients to 125. \u2047 During the quarter, we successfully rolled out OCE Optimizer, a real-time map-based territory and sales rep alignment solution. \u2047 This tool will save management team significant amounts of time previously spent planning and assessing sales data to ensure resources are effectively focused on the appropriate client base and product. \u2047 Finally, our CSMS business. \u2047 Demand for field reps continues to be soft, which of course impacts revenue. \u2047 But as we said before, while business development has also slowed due to the lack of in-person interactions, so far the business has performed modestly better than we would have expected as existing clients have largely retained field reps and have been continuing their engagements with us. \u2047 Now against that backdrop, let's now review our third quarter results. \u2047 Revenue for the third quarter came in at $2,786 million, which was $11 million above the high end of our guidance range. \u2047 This revenue beat came from strong organic operational performance. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $604 million with a $22 million beat versus the high end of our guidance range. \u2047 The EBITDA beat was due to better operational performance and productivity. \u2047 Third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.63 reflecting the EBITDA drop-through because the below the line items essentially netted out to zero. \u2047 Third quarter R&DS contracted backlog, including pass-throughs, grew 18.5% year-over-year to $21.7 billion as of September 30th, 2020. \u2047 We had broad based booking strength, but full-service clinical and lab were particularly strong. \u2047 The contracted net book-to-bill ratio, including pass-throughs, was 1.71 for the third quarter of 2020 and 1.42 excluding pass-throughs. \u2047 The LTM contracted book-to-bill ratio at September 30 was 1.55, including pass-throughs and 1.45, excluding pass-throughs. \u2047 Let's turn first to revenue. \u2047 Third quarter revenue of $2,786 million grew 0.6% reported and was flat at constant currency. \u2047 Revenue for the first nine months of the year was $8,061 million which was down 1.6% reported and 1.2% at constant currency. \u2047 Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue of $1,207 million grew 10.2% reported and 9.2% at constant currency. \u2047 Year-to-date Tech & Analytics Solutions revenue was $3,433 million, up 4.9% reported and 5.6% at constant currency. \u2047 In R&D Solutions third quarter revenue of $1,400 million was down 4.5% at actual FX rate and 5.1% at constant currency. \u2047 Excluding the impact of pass-throughs, R&D Solutions third quarter revenue grew 2.6%. \u2047 Year-to-date revenue of $4,076 million was down 5.6% at actual FX rate and 5.4% at constant currency. \u2047 Contract Sales & Medical Solutions revenue of $179 million was down 13.9% year-over-year reported and 14.4% on a constant currency basis in the third quarter. \u2047 Year-to-date revenue was $552 million, down 8.6% at actual FX rates and 8.3% at constant currency. \u2047 Now moving down to P&L, adjusted EBITDA was $604 million for the third quarter, which represented growth of 1.9%. \u2047 Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $1,649 million. \u2047 Third quarter GAAP net income was $101 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.52. \u2047 Year-to-date GAAP net income was $160 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.82. \u2047 Adjusted net income was $318 million for the quarter and $841 million year-to-date. \u2047 Our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 1.9% in the third quarter to $1.63. \u2047 Year-to-date adjusted diluted earnings per share was $4.32. \u2047 Now turning to the R&D Solutions backlog. \u2047 As Ari mentioned, R&DS new business activity remains quite strong. \u2047 Consequent on the robust booking activity that Ari talked about, our backlog grew 18.5% year-over-year to close at $21.7 billion and we expect $5.8 billion of this backlog to convert to revenue over the next 12 months, which is an increase of over $400 million versus where we were at June 30th. \u2047 And I would add that the outlook remains quite positive as RFPs are growing low double digits in both volume and dollars. \u2047 Moving to the balance sheet now. \u2047 At September 30th, cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.5 billion and debt was $12.3 billion, resulting in net debt of $10.9 billion. \u2047 Due to our strong EBITDA and cash flow in the quarter, our net leverage ratio at September 30th was 4.7 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, which was down a tad[Phonetic] from where we were at June 30th. \u2047 Cash flow was a bright spot as it was last quarter. \u2047 Cash flow from operations was $574 million in the third quarter, up 74% over last year. \u2047 Capital expenditures were $157 million and that resulted in free cash flow of $417 million. \u2047 M&A spending, as you saw, was negligible in the quarter. \u2047 For the first nine months of the year, free cash flow was $769 million, which is about double the same period last year. \u2047 As you know when the COVID-19 outbreak became the pandemic in March, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program. \u2047 We did not repurchase any shares in the second or third quarters, but the business is recovering well from COVID-19 disruptions. \u2047 Underlying demand is robust and cash flow is as well and we have a very solid liquidity position closing the quarter with an undrawn revolver of almost -- undrawn revolver and almost $1.5 billion of cash in the balance sheet. \u2047 And as a result of all this, we lifted our suspension on share repurchase program and we're expecting to opportunistically resume share repurchase activity. \u2047 And as a reminder, we currently have about $1 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining under the program. \u2047 Now let's turn to guidance. \u2047 Given the continuing momentum in the business, we're raising our full year guidance range for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted diluted EPS. \u2047 Our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020 assumes that business conditions will continue to improve during the fourth quarter. \u2047 And specifically, we assume that localized flare-ups of COVID-19 will not have a material impact on fourth quarter results. \u2047 We now expect 2020 revenue for the full year to be between $11,100 million and $11,250 million, which is an increase of $125 million over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. \u2047 For profit we now expect full-year adjusted EBITDA to be between $2,335 million and $2,360 million, which represents a $27 million increase over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. \u2047 And adjusted diluted EPS, we are expecting to be between $6.25 and $6.35, which is an increase of $0.10 over our prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. \u2047 This full-year guidance implies fourth quarter revenue of $3,040 million to $3,190 million, representing growth of 5% to 10.2%. \u2047 Now this is a wider range than we would normally guide to at this point in the year due to the uncertain timing of pass-through revenues associated with the COVID trials that we're working on. \u2047 From a segment perspective, we expect Technology & Analytics Solutions revenue would be in the high-single digits at the midpoint of our guidance range, R&D Solutions revenue growth to reach double digits, with the caveat that this growth rate could move up or down based on the timing of pass-through revenue and CSMS revenue growth to be similar to what we saw in the third quarter. \u2047 For fourth quarter profit, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $685 million and $710 million, representing growth of 6.7% to 10.6% and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.93 and $2.03, or growth of 10.9% to 16.7%. \u2047 This guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates at September 30th, 2020 remain in effect for the rest of the year. \u2047 As we indicated at the start of the pandemic, we've decided to advance our planning process versus prior years. \u2047 And as a result, we're now in a position to provide our 2021 outlook and this is much earlier than we would have done in the ordinary course. \u2047 For the full year 2021, we expect revenue in the range of $12,300 million to $12,600 million. \u2047 This represents growth of 10.1% to 12.8% versus the midpoint of our 2020 guide. \u2047 We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $2,725 million to $2,800 million, representing growth of 16.1% to 19.3% compared to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance. \u2047 And finally, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.65 to $7.95, which would represent growth of 21.4% to 26.2% compared to the midpoint of our 2020 guidance. \u2047 A little bit more detail for you. \u2047 The adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $420 million, operational depreciation and amortization of about $400 million and other below the line expense items such as minority interest of approximately $50 million and also the continuation of our share repurchase activity. \u2047 The effective tax rate we are assuming will remain largely in line with 2020. \u2047 Our 2021 guidance is predicated on the assumption that business conditions will continue to improve to the fourth -- in fourth quarter and that majority of our business will return to normal during 2021. \u2047 Our outlook for 2021 also incorporates our view that there will be some tail of COVID work, the growth in R&DS will come primarily from our base business. \u2047 So in summary, we're pleased with our team's ability to navigate the challenges that COVID has presented throughout the year and we're proud to be a critical contributor to the solution to this public health crisis. \u2047 Our R&DS business has adapted well returning to growth in services revenue and achieving another record quarter of bookings. \u2047 Our Technology & Analytics Solutions business improved sequentially and has returned to pre-COVID growth rates despite the headwinds of the event management business. \u2047 Our solid year-to-date overall Company performance has enabled us to raise our guidance for the full year for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS. \u2047 And now this performance combined with our strong free cash flow and liquidity position has enabled us to lift the suspension of our share repurchase program. \u2047 And finally, we are expecting a continued recovery in the fourth quarter and a very strong 2021. \u2047 So with that let me hand it back over to the operator for Q&A. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share
