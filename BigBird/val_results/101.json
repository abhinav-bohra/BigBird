{"article": ["I'm joined today by Patrick Kaltenbach, our Chief Executive Officer; and Shawn Vadala, our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Let me cover just a couple of administrative matters. \u2047 For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please see our recent Form 10-K and other reports filed with the SEC. \u2047 Just one other item. \u2047 More detailed information with respect to the use of and differences between non-GAAP financial measures and most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in our Form 8-K. \u2047 I am pleased to report another quarter of very strong results. \u2047 Customer demand was robust and our growth initiatives continue to be very effective. \u2047 Our teams throughout the world are executing very well. \u2047 I want to give a special acknowledgment to our global supply chain team, which is navigating a myriad of challenges with respect to raw materials, components and transportation. \u2047 Our ability to continue to meet heightened customer demand while overcoming the dynamic challenges in the supply chain is proving to be a competitive advantage in this environment. \u2047 Now let me turn to our financial results. \u2047 Local currency sales was 16%, and we had broad-based growth in all regions. \u2047 Our Laboratory business had excellent growth and our industrial product lines also performed very well. \u2047 Food retail was a headwind, drove overall sales growth as we had significant decline in the quarter. \u2047 With our strong sales growth and good execution, we achieved a 19% growth in adjusted operating income and a 24% increase in adjusted EPS. \u2047 Cash flow generation was very strong in the quarter. \u2047 Our end markets remain favorable, and our strategic initiatives are very effective at capturing growth. \u2047 Our Spinnaker sales and marketing approach provides the framework to identify and pursue the most attractive market segments while also increasing our sales force exposure to the most strategic customers. \u2047 We also continue to invest in the strength and breadth of our product portfolio, further extending our technology lead and reinforcing customer trust through our global service offering, which supports customers' productivity. \u2047 We have several -- we have successfully navigated the challenges of the global supply chain to date, but are cautious as demand dynamics remain challenging and conditions can change rapidly. \u2047 Although pockets of uncertainty exists in the global economy, we believe we are ideally positioned to gain market share. \u2047 With proven strategies, good demand in our end markets and continued focused execution on our growth and margin initiatives, we believe we are in an excellent position to deliver strong results in 2021 and 2022. \u2047 Let me now turn it to Shawn to cover the financial and guidance details, and then I will come back with some additional commentary on the business, and our outlook for next year. \u2047 Sales were $952 million in the quarter, an increase of 16% in local currency. \u2047 On a U.S. dollar basis, sales increased 18% as currency benefited sales growth by 2% in the quarter. \u2047 The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to local currency sales growth in the quarter, while we estimate that COVID testing was a headwind of approximately 1% to sales growth. \u2047 Last year, the benefit in our pipette business from COVID testing labs was particularly strong. \u2047 On Slide four, we show sales growth by region. \u2047 Local currency sales increased 20% in the Americas, 10% in Europe and 16% in Asia/Rest of the World. \u2047 Local currency sales increased 19% in China in the quarter. \u2047 The next slide shows sales growth by region year-to-date. \u2047 Local currency sales grew 20% for the nine months with a 21% increase in the Americas, 15% in Europe, and 23% growth in Asia/Rest of World. \u2047 On Slide six, we summarize local currency sales growth by product area. \u2047 For the third quarter, Laboratory sales increased 23%, Industrial increased 12%, with core Industrial up 11% and product inspection up 13%. \u2047 Food Retail came in worse than we expected with a decline of 19% in the quarter. \u2047 The next slide shows local currency sales growth by product area year-to-date. \u2047 Laboratory sales increased 26%, Industrial increased 16%, with core Industrial up 21% and product inspection up 9%. \u2047 Food Retail declined 1% for the nine-month period. \u2047 Let me now move to the rest of the P and L, which is summarized on Slide eight. \u2047 Gross margin in the quarter was 58.4%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior year level of 58.2%. \u2047 We benefited from volume and pricing which was offset in part by the challenges in the global supply chain, namely higher transportation, logistics and material costs as well as the impact of temporary cost actions we undertook in 2020. \u2047 R and D amounted to $42.3 million in the quarter, which is a 19% increase in local currency over the prior period. \u2047 The impact of temporary cost savings undertaken last year and greater project activity contributed to this increase. \u2047 SG and A amounted to $240.7 million, a 16% increase in local currency over the prior year. \u2047 The impact of the temporary cost savings that we undertook last year, higher variable compensation, and increased investments in sales and marketing were the principal factors driving the increase. \u2047 Adjusted operating profit amounted to $272.8 million in the quarter, a 19% increase over the prior year amount of $230 million. \u2047 We are pleased with this increase, which reflects very strong sales growth combined with good execution. \u2047 Adjusted operating margins reached 28.7%, a 20 basis point increase over the prior year level of 28.5%. \u2047 On a teo-year combined basis, our margins were up 270 basis points as the prior year margin benefited from the cost actions we implemented due to the pandemic. \u2047 A couple of final comments on the P and L. Amortization amounted to $16 million in the quarter, interest expense was $11.8 million in the quarter, other income in the quarter amounted to $3.3 million primarily reflecting nonservice-related pension income. \u2047 Our effective tax rate before discrete items and adjusted for the timing of stock option deductions was 19.5%. \u2047 Fully diluted shares amounted to $23.4 million in the quarter, which is a 3% decline from the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $8.72, a 24% increase over the prior year amount of $7.02. \u2047 On a reported basis in the quarter, earnings per share was $8.71 as compared to $6.68 in the prior year. \u2047 Reported earnings per share in the quarter includes $0.18 of purchased intangible amortization, $0.02 of restructuring offset by $0.19 due to the difference between our quarterly and annual tax rate due to the timing of stock option exercises. \u2047 The next slide shows our P and L year-to-date. \u2047 Local currency sales grew 20%, adjusted operating income increased 35%, with margins up 210 basis points. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share grew 43% on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 That covers the P and L, and let me now comment on cash flow. \u2047 In the quarter, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $243.1 million, which is an increase of 19% and on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. \u2047 We are very happy with our cash flow generation. \u2047 DSO was 35 days, which is two days less than the prior year. \u2047 ITO came in at 4.5 times, which is slightly better than last year. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow amounted to $615.3 million, an increase of 48% on a per share basis as compared to the prior year. \u2047 Let me now turn to guidance. \u2047 While our end markets remain favorable, forecasting continues to be challenging. \u2047 There are pockets of uncertainty in the global economy, most notably in China. \u2047 Furthermore, the widespread challenges within the supply chain and in transportation and logistics and the corresponding inflationary impact also creates uncertainty. \u2047 Finally, we have seen over the last several months how COVID variance and lockdowns can occur quickly. \u2047 We recognize the importance of remaining agile and adapting to unexpected changes in the environment. \u2047 We are very pleased with our ability to navigate the unprecedented challenges of the last two years, which we believe reflects the strength of our organization. \u2047 While we remain cautious about factors outside of our control, we feel very good about our growth initiatives and our ability to continue to gain market share and drive margin improvement via our pricing and Stern Drive initiatives. \u2047 Now let me cover the specifics. \u2047 For the full year 2021, we now expect local currency sales growth in 2021 and to be approximately 17%. \u2047 This compares to previous guidance of 15%. \u2047 We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $33.35 to $33.40, which is a growth rate of 30%. \u2047 This compares to previous guidance of adjusted earnings per share in the range of $32.60 to $32.90. \u2047 With respect to the fourth quarter, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 8% and expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $10 to $10.05, a growth rate of 8% to 9%. \u2047 For the full year 2022, based on our assessment of market conditions today, we would expect local currency sales growth to be approximately 6% and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $37.25 to $37.65. \u2047 Using the midpoint of 2021 guidance, this reflects a growth rate of 12% to 13%. \u2047 Some further comments on 2022 guidance. \u2047 We expect a slight headwind to sales growth from the impact of COVID testing on our pipette business. \u2047 We expect interest expense to be approximately $50 million in 2022 in total amortization, including purchase intangible amortization to be $65 million. \u2047 Purchase intangible amortization is excluded from adjusted earnings per share and is estimated at $24 million on a pre-tax basis or $0.79 per share in 2022. \u2047 In 2022, other income, which is below operating profit, will amount to approximately $13.5 million. \u2047 This is higher than the $10.7 million expected in 2021 due to an expected increase in pension income. \u2047 Finally, we assume our effective tax rate before discrete items will be 19.5% in both 2021 and 2022. \u2047 In terms of free cash flow for 2021, we now estimate it will reach $810 million, which reflects a 29% growth on a per share basis. \u2047 For 2022, we would estimate free cash flow in the range of $845 million. \u2047 Cash flow in 2022 is impacted by higher variable compensation payments related to the very strong performance in 2021. \u2047 Once we get beyond 2022, we expect free cash flow per share will grow in line with earnings per share and net income conversion will be in the 100% range. \u2047 We expect to repurchase approximately $1 billion in shares in both 2021 and 2022, which should allow us to maintain a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.5 times. \u2047 Some final details on guidance. \u2047 With respect to the impact of currency on sales growth, we expect currency to increase sales growth by approximately 3% in 2021 and be relatively neutral to sales growth in Q4. \u2047 In 2022, we would expect currency to decrease sales growth by approximately 1%. \u2047 In terms of adjusted EPS, currency will benefit growth by approximately 4% in 2021 and be a slight headwind to adjusted earnings per share growth in 2022. \u2047 We do not expect currency to impact adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Let me start with some comments on our operating results. \u2047 Our Lab business had outstanding growth in the third quarter despite having more challenging comparisons than it faced in the first half of the year. \u2047 Almost all product lines and regions had very strong growth. \u2047 We expect good growth in the fourth quarter, but it won't be the same level we have seen year-to-date. \u2047 As we look at 2022, we expect the strong biopharma trends to continue to be favorable and expect other end markets to do well, but we won't benefit from catch-up demand segments like chemical that we benefited from this year. \u2047 We also expect a bit of headwind in our pipette business from lower COVID testing activity. \u2047 Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain market share in our Laboratory business. \u2047 An additional nice development within our Lab business is that we obtained a $36 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to expand our pipette tip production in California. \u2047 We estimate that by the end of 2023, we will expand our global tip production by approximately 15% and the grant will also allow us to enhance manufacturing, automation and warehouse and logistics surrounding tips. \u2047 We are happy with this grant, which allows us to cost effectively increase tip capacity while at the same time, improving productivity. \u2047 Turning to our Industrial business. \u2047 Core Industrial did well in the third quarter as we are benefiting from some catch-up in demand and have been well positioned to benefit from increasing trends in automation and digitalization. \u2047 Core Industrial should have a solid fourth quarter. \u2047 We will face tougher comparisons in core Industrial in 2022, but expect to continue to drive market share gains overall. \u2047 Product Inspection grew 13% in the quarter. \u2047 Growth was especially strong in the Americas. \u2047 We expect good growth in the fourth quarter and we are cautiously optimistic about solid growth in 2022 as we should benefit from some pent-up investments from large packaged food customers and our strong product portfolio. \u2047 Finally, Food Retail declined 19% with pronounced declines in Americas and Asia and Rest of the World. \u2047 Our production was impacted by shortages of electronic components as these products use more standardized components that are also used in consumer electronic products. \u2047 We were also impacted by the timing of project activity. \u2047 We would expect Food Retail to also decline in the fourth quarter. \u2047 We are not forecasting much growth in 2022 as we continue to manage this business for profitability. \u2047 Now let me make some additional comments by geography. \u2047 Sales in Europe increased 10% in the quarter with very strong growth in Lab. \u2047 We would expect solid growth in Europe in 2022 against very good growth in 2021. \u2047 Americas increased 20% in the quarter with excellent growth in Lab, core Industrial and Product Inspection. \u2047 As mentioned earlier, Food Retail was down significantly in the Americas. \u2047 While we will face challenging comparisons in the Americas in 2022, we expect overall good growth. \u2047 Finally, Asia and the Rest of the World grew 16% in the quarter with outstanding growth in Laboratory and good growth in Product Inspection. \u2047 Core Industrial also did well. \u2047 China had good growth, particularly given the strong growth in the prior year. \u2047 We expect good growth in China in Q4 and in 2022, although it won't be at the same level we have seen year-to-date. \u2047 We"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q3 earnings per
