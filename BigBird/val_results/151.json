{"article": ["They are also referenced on page two of our financial supplement. \u2047 With that, let's start our teleconference with opening comments from Dave Nunes, President and CEO. \u2047 First, I'll make some high-level comments before turning it over to Mark McHugh, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to review our consolidated financial results. \u2047 Then we'll ask Doug Long, Senior Vice President, Forest Resources, to comment on our U.S. and New Zealand timber results. \u2047 And following the review of our timber segments, Mark will discuss our real estate results as well as our updated guidance. \u2047 We're very pleased to report our strongest quarterly adjusted EBITDA result since our separation into a pure-play timberland REIT in 2014. \u2047 We Specifically, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $115 million and pro forma earnings per share of $0.35 per share during the third quarter. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the prior year quarter by 71%, fueled by solid contributions across our timber segments as well as an outsized contribution from our Real Estate segment due to the closing of two significant development transactions. \u2047 We continue to capitalize on healthy domestic timber demand in the U.S., favorable log export pricing in New Zealand, and robust real estate market trends in the third quarter. \u2047 However, wet weather conditions and trucking shortages in the U.S. South constrained production during the quarter, while production in New Zealand was negatively impacted by a government-mandated shutdown in response to an outbreak of COVID-19. \u2047 Given these headwinds, we were very pleased with the results delivered by our team. \u2047 As Mark will discuss in greater detail. \u2047 Based on our performance over the first nine months of the year and our outlook for the balance of the year, we're modestly raising our full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $320 million to $330 million. \u2047 Drilling down to our different operating segments. \u2047 Our Southern Timber segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $24 million for the quarter, which was 7% below the prior year quarter. \u2047 We were encouraged to see net stumpage prices increase by 16%, but this lift in pricing was more than offset by 20% reduction in harvest volumes due to wet weather conditions and trucking shortages. \u2047 In our Pacific Northwest Timber segment, we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $13 million, an improvement of 38% from the prior year quarter. \u2047 This increase in adjusted EBITDA was driven by a 15% increase in sawmill (sic) sawtimber prices as domestic lumber markets remained favorable. \u2047 In our New Zealand Timber segment, third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 10% year-over-year to $20 million. \u2047 Favorable pricing more than offset, a significant increase in export shipping costs as well as 14% lower production volumes due to the government-mandated shutdown, which prohibited harvest activity throughout the country during a two-week period in August. \u2047 In our Real Estate segment, we generated record adjusted EBITDA of $64 million, up from $22 million in the prior year period, as we closed on a $38 million Unimproved Development sale in Kingston, Washington, and a $25 million improved development transaction in our Belfast Commerce Park project south of Savannah, Georgia. \u2047 Switching gears from the third quarter results, I'd like to provide an update on our Timber Fund business, which we acquired last year through our merger with Pope Resources. \u2047 As we previously communicated, the private equity timber funds business was not a good long-term strategic fit for Rayonier. \u2047 I am pleased to report that we have now completed our exit from the timber fund business. \u2047 During the third quarter, as previously announced, we sold the rights to manage Timber Funds, III and IV, as well as our co-investment stake in both funds for an aggregate purchase price of roughly $36 million. \u2047 We subsequently entered into three separate agreements to sell the remaining Fund II Timberland assets for an aggregate purchase price of $157 million. \u2047 Note that one of these transactions closed on September 30, and is reflected in our third quarter financial results, while the other two transactions, closed on October five and November 1, respectively, and will be reflected in our fourth quarter financial results. \u2047 All said, based on Rayonier's 20% ownership interest in Fund II, and factoring in the repayment of Fund II debt, proceeds to Rayonier from the sale of Fund II assets, will be roughly $24 million. \u2047 In addition, we expect to receive a carried interest incentive fee with respect to Fund II of approximately $14 million. \u2047 Overall, we view this as a favorable result for the sale process, particularly given the negative impact that last year's forest fires had on roughly 10,000 acres of Fund II and Fund IV properties, in Oregon. \u2047 We believe, the successful sale of our co-investments in Funds III and IV, and as well as the properties in Fund II, represent a positive outcome for our shareholders as the wind down of the fund business allows us to simplify our operations, and allocate capital to other strategic priorities. \u2047 Let's start on page five with our financial highlights. \u2047 Sales for the quarter totaled $365 million, while operating income was $123 million, and net income attributable to Rayonier was $76 million or $0.53 per share. \u2047 On a pro forma basis, net income was $50 million or $0.35 per share. \u2047 Pro forma adjustments for the quarter were primarily associated with a large disposition in the Pacific Northwest, as well as the actions taken to exit the fund business. \u2047 As Dave touched on, third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million was considerably above the prior year period, as an exceptionally strong contribution from our Real Estate segment, and year-over-year improvements in the contributions from our Pacific Northwest and New Zealand Timber segments more than offset a modestly lower contribution from our Southern Timber segment. \u2047 On the bottom of page five, we provide an overview of our capital resources and liquidity at quarter end, as well as a comparison to year-end. \u2047 Our cash available for distribution, or CAD, for the first nine months of the year was $204 million versus $124 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by higher cash taxes and capital expenditures. \u2047 A reconciliation of CAD to cash provided by operating activities, and other GAAP measures, is provided on page eight of the financial supplement. \u2047 Consistent with our nimble approach to capital allocation, we raised $52 million through our at-the-market equity offering program during the third quarter at an average price of $37.26 per share. \u2047 As previously discussed, we view the ATM program as a cost-effective tool to opportunistically raise capital, strengthen our balance sheet, and match fund bolt-on acquisitions. \u2047 Also building upon the actions taken in the second quarter to improve our debt maturity profile, and lower our weighted average borrowing cost. \u2047 In September, we opportunistically repaid the $45 million outstanding under our credit facility with Northwest Farm Credit Services, which previously -- which we had previously assumed in the Pope Resources transaction. \u2047 In sum, we closed the third quarter with $420 million of cash and $1.4 billion of debt, both of which exclude cash and debt attributable to the Timber Funds segment, which is nonrecourse to Rayonier. \u2047 Our net debt of $957 million represented 15% of our enterprise value based on our closing stock price at the end of the third quarter. \u2047 Let's start on page nine with our Southern Timber segment. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of $24 million was $2 million below the prior year quarter. \u2047 The year-over-year decline was primarily driven by lower harvest volumes, partially offset by higher net stumpage pricing. \u2047 More specifically, volume declined 20% during the third quarter as wet weather conditions, and constraints on trucking availability, hindered production throughout most of the region. \u2047 This decline in volume was partially offset by a 12% increase in average sawlog stumpage pricing compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 At slightly over $20 per ton, third quarter pricing reflected the highest average sawlog pricing, we have registered since early 2015. \u2047 The improved pricing reflects strong demand from sawmills weather-related constraints on supply, upward pressure on ship and sell pricing, due to increased competition from pulp mills, and improved export log demand in certain markets. \u2047 Likewise, Pulpwood pricing was also at its highest level since early 2015. \u2047 Specifically, our prices climbed 23% from the prior year quarter in response to strong domestic demand, constrained supply due to wet weather conditions, and an increase in pulpwood exports to China. \u2047 Overall, weighted-average pine stumpage prices increased 16% year-over-year, despite a shift toward a higher mix of pulpwood sales as compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 We are encouraged by the pricing gains registered during the quarter, albeit fueled in part by the wet weather conditions. \u2047 Moving forward, we believe certain southern markets are poised for stronger pricing, and believe our results continue to underscore, the relative strength of local timber market dynamics, across our footprint in the region, including proximity to the dominant work serving log export markets. \u2047 Moving to our Pacific Northwest Timber segment on page 10. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA of $13 million was $3 million above the prior year quarter. \u2047 The year-over-year increase was largely attributable to favorable domestic lumber markets, coupled with increased export demand relative to a year ago. \u2047 As the third quarter harvest volume was flat versus the prior year quarter. \u2047 At nearly $108 per ton, our average delivered selling price during the third quarter was up 15% from the prior year quarter. \u2047 Strong pricing was generally sustained throughout the quarter as underlying log demand remained healthy, even as lumber prices receded from the record level set earlier in the year. \u2047 Meanwhile, pulpwood pricing fell 2% in the third quarter relative to prior year quarter as sawmill residuals remain plentiful, amid strong lumber production. \u2047 While domestic demand remains healthy in the Pacific Northwest, we have seen export demand from China soften over the past few months. \u2047 This softness is largely attributable to elevated log inventories in China, concerns about the country's near-term economic outlook and supply chain disruptions. \u2047 We expect some choppiness in demand for log exports from the region to continue over the near term. \u2047 However, we believe the reduced harvest of European spruce salvage logs, the continued ban on Australian log exports to China, and the ban on Russian log exports beginning in 2022, will support continued demand for logs from Pacific Northwest, particularly as inventory levels in China normalize. \u2047 I'd also like to offer a few comments regarding the wildfires that have impacted parts of the Western U.S. this year. \u2047 Fortunately, none of our properties were seriously threatened by the fires. \u2047 That said, the availability of pulpwood has constrained pricing in some areas, and there has been upward pressure on hauling costs in areas that have been directly impacted by fires. \u2047 Consistent with our previous updates on this front, our operations have not been materially impacted from the salvage efforts conducted by others, which are generally winding down. \u2047 page 11 shows results and key operating metrics for our New Zealand Timber segment. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of $20 million was $2 million above the prior year quarter. \u2047 The increase in adjusted EBITDA, was driven by much stronger domestic and export pricing, largely offset by lower harvest volumes, higher cost and reduced carbon credit sales. \u2047 Volume declined 14% in the third quarter as compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 As the government shut down all nonessential activity across New Zealand from August 18 through August 31 due to COVID-19. \u2047 Our team in New Zealand was generally able to resume harvest operations in September, but there were some regions where restrictions continued as the government aimed to limit the spread of the delta variant. \u2047 Harvest operations have now resumed across the country, but full year 2021 volumes are expected to be modestly lower than we had previously anticipated due to the disruptions encountered in the third quarter. \u2047 Average delivered prices for export sawtimber jumped 59% in the third quarter from the prior year to $150 per ton, reflecting solid demand from China, the ban on Australian log exports to China, and the reduced level European spruce salvage logs into China. \u2047 While net stumpage realizations on export volumes were well above the prior year period levels, favorable export pricing was largely offset by a significant increase in shipping costs, as supply chain issues drove freight, and emerged costs higher. \u2047 Since reaching record levels a few months ago, there has been a pullback in pricing for radiata pine logs in response to elevated log inventories in China. \u2047 A slowdown in construction activity, adverse weather conditions, and power shortages in China, have collectively reduced the offtake from ports and resulted in pricing pressure on log exports. \u2047 While we anticipate pricing will remain favorable from a historical perspective, we expect relatively lower export pricing over the balance of the year. \u2047 We generally expect that net stumpage realizations on export volume will decline in the fourth quarter as we've seen only limited relief in shipping costs. \u2047 Shifting to the New Zealand domestic market. \u2047 Demand remains very strong, albeit constrained to some degree by COVID-related restrictions and the availability of labor. \u2047 During the third quarter, average delivered sawtimber prices increased 21% from the prior year period to $85 per ton. \u2047 Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, domestic sawtimber prices improved 14% versus the prior year period. \u2047 following the upward trend in the export market. \u2047 As a reminder, domestic sawtimber pricing normally follows export pricing with a lag. \u2047 Average domestic pulpwood pricing climbed 25% as compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 As it relates to carbon credits, we continue to defer sales during the quarter. \u2047 The value of carbon credits has roughly doubled over the past year. \u2047 Moving forward, we will continue to be opportunistic in our sale of carbon credits based on our market outlook. \u2047 In sum, we are pleased with third quarter results in the New Zealand Timber segment, especially given the COVID-related disruptions, and cost pressures we encountered. \u2047 Moving forward, we remain well positioned to continue to capture market share from Australia, and Europe, in the export market as well as benefit from strong domestic demand. \u2047 However, we do anticipate a relatively lower contribution from our New Zealand operations in the fourth quarter as compared to the first three quarters of the year. \u2047 I'll now briefly discuss the results from our Timber Funds segment. \u2047 Highlighted on page 12, the Timber Funds segment generated consolidated EBITDA of $4 million in the third quarter on harvest volume of 61,000 tons. \u2047 A"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share of
