{"article": ["Mike Speetzen, our interim chief executive officer; and Bob Mack, our interim chief financial officer, have remarks summarizing the quarter and our revised expectations for the full year. \u2047 Then we'll take some questions. \u2047 You can refer to our 2020 10-K for additional details regarding these risks and uncertainties. \u2047 Once again, the Polaris team delivered an impressive quarter despite substantial supply chain challenges. \u2047 Our team has remained focused on meeting the needs of our dealers and customers, which allowed us to again beat expectations this quarter. \u2047 Consumer interest in powersports continued at record levels throughout the quarter, with strong growth coming from both existing customers and new customers. \u2047 I'm pleased to report that our ORV market share gains continued, which we expect to be an ongoing trend for the year. \u2047 I'm also pleased to report that motorcycles, snowmobiles and boats also had strong retail demand and gained share in Q1. \u2047 The strong growth we are experiencing is not only in our North American whole good retail. \u2047 Our PG&A business grew nearly 50% during the quarter, with all segments and categories up significantly year over year. \u2047 And our international business was also strong, with sales increasing 59% as countries impacted by the pandemic slowly began to reopen. \u2047 Q1 results reflect an all-out effort by the Polaris team to overcome numerous challenges. \u2047 We continue to operate our plants at maximum supply chain-constraint capacity and utilize every available tactic at our disposal to produce the products our customers were demanding. \u2047 While our dealer inventory remains below optimal levels, we largely met demand and expertly navigated supply chain constraints. \u2047 To do so, logistics, commodities and rework costs have increased substantially. \u2047 We are managing the cost as best we can and, where it makes strategic sense, have raised prices to compensate for this inflation. \u2047 And yet, despite these headwinds, given the overall strong and better-than-expected performance seen in Q1 and continuing into April, we are raising our full-year guidance. \u2047 Bob will give you more details shortly. \u2047 First-quarter North American retail sales were up a robust 70%, continuing the unprecedented levels of growth. \u2047 The comparables were easier in the last two weeks of March when the pandemic drove an abrupt shutdown of commerce in 2020. \u2047 Even after adjusting for that impact, our retail was up an impressive 50-plus percent for the quarter. \u2047 We continue to see an expanding customer base, with new customers growing 70% in Q1. \u2047 We are especially proud to see success in our strategy to further diversify our customer base. \u2047 While many of these new customers have been in powersports for only a short time, our early data indicates a strong intent of these new customers to stay with the sport and a stronger intent to purchase another vehicle versus what we have historically seen, which is a promising indicator to support ongoing strong retail. \u2047 And the continued growth in sales to our existing owners, which increased an impressive 40% year over year, reinforces our confidence that these customers will return. \u2047 As I indicated earlier, our ORV business gained over 4 percentage points of market share in the first quarter. \u2047 Both Indian and Slingshot's first-quarter retail was strong as well, collectively finishing up over 70% and market share increased about 3 percentage points. \u2047 boats retail was also strong, tracking ahead of the industry based on preliminary data. \u2047 Snowmobile sales were strong as well, with retail up low 20% range for the first quarter. \u2047 Let me spend a minute talking about the strong performance of our Snowmobile business. \u2047 While our Snowmobile business is one of our smaller product lines today, it is where we started over 66 years ago in Northern Minnesota. \u2047 The North American snowmobile industry concluded its strongest season in over a decade, with industry retail up approximately 16%. \u2047 Polaris retail eclipsed the market, growing in the mid-20% range, resulting in market share gains of over two points for the season, the best share position in 16 years. \u2047 We are seeing tremendous new customer growth in Snowmobiles. \u2047 During the 2020, 2021 selling season, new customers represented over 60% of the sales growth, nearly double the rate from the prior season ending March 2020. \u2047 During the quarter, we held our annual spring dealer meeting and, while virtual, it was one of the best attended meetings in over a decade. \u2047 Attendance was up almost 80% compared to 2020. \u2047 During the meeting, we introduced 22 new snowmobiles on the revolutionary Rider-First Matryx Platform, which delivers industry-leading ride and handling, both on and off trail. \u2047 Additionally, we introduced the company's first turbo-charged two-stroke engine, the Patriot Boost. \u2047 This new engine uses proprietary SmartBoost technology for unrivaled combustion stability, enabling 10% more power at sea level and 50% more power at 10,000 feet than our current 850 Patriot engine. \u2047 The strong model year lineup, along with continued demand from new customers entering the sport, has generated demand we haven't seen in years. \u2047 In fact, our SnowCheck orders, which concluded a couple of weeks ago, will make up over half of our Snowmobile build this year, eliminating much of the uncertainty around in-season sales required later in the year. \u2047 As you well know, strong retail demand in all of our businesses has continued to pressure our ability to fill the dealer channel. \u2047 Inventory levels declined further on a sequential basis and were down 71% year over year, with ORV realizing the most significant decline. \u2047 Supplier constraints and logistics delays remain the ongoing bottlenecks, and we are working all available options to ease the supply chain strain as quickly as possible. \u2047 I'll talk more about our efforts to manage the situation shortly. \u2047 As we've discussed in the past, presold vehicles continue to be a lever that our dealers can utilize to ensure they capture the sale. \u2047 This is enabled by our advanced manufacturing capability which provides visibility into and flexibility of our production plan. \u2047 This is just one of many examples of how the team is navigating this challenging environment to ensure dealers and consumers get the vehicles they want. \u2047 Given the current environment and our expectations that the supply chain constraints may not improve significantly until late in 2021, we anticipate it will likely take until sometime in 2022 to return dealer inventory to targeted levels. \u2047 That said, our ability to continue to expertly manage the supply chain through 2021 positions us well to meet consumer demand. \u2047 The number of suppliers impacted by COVID-related constraints has been somewhat of a moving target. \u2047 The Polaris team has been doing a tremendous job of keeping product flowing to fulfill demand by expediting shipping, working directly with suppliers on their staffing and supply base, rebalancing in-sourced and outsourced manufacturing, using alternative logistics lanes to shorten lead times, staging Polaris employees at ports to expedite customs clearance and optimizing the flow and location of inventory to fill backlog as quick as possible. \u2047 Additionally, we're adding capacity at select locations, including Monterrey, Mexico for RZR and GENERAL; Elkhart and Syracuse, Indiana for Bennington and Hurricane; Rigby, Idaho for climb apparel and Wilmington, Ohio for PG&A distribution. \u2047 We will be evaluating additional expansion needs with our board as the year progresses based on the trajectory of current demand. \u2047 These capacity additions, along with the anticipated supply chain improvements later in the year, will allow us to further ramp production in the coming quarters. \u2047 However, as I said before, we do not see dealer inventory returning to targeted levels until sometime in 2021. \u2047 Despite these distractions, I'm happy to report that we are still on track with our supply chain transformation and that the savings are being realized slightly ahead of plan. \u2047 This is an incredibly important strategic initiative for us with the goal of identifying suppliers that can provide the best quality, delivery, service, technology and value. \u2047 We have now made all sourcing decisions for two of the four waves, and we kicked off the third wave in February through a virtual supplier conference and are optimistic about the continued success of the program. \u2047 By the end of the year, we expect to be almost halfway to our goal of approximately $200 million of gross savings. \u2047 Currently, these savings are partially offsetting increased costs from logistics, commodities, rework and tariffs. \u2047 The good news here is when these costs abate, our sourcing savings will continue. \u2047 Our sports electrification is a very real opportunity, appealing to current as well as new consumers. \u2047 As we look into the future, EV technology will continue to mature and grow, both in terms of performance capabilities and consumer awareness and interest. \u2047 Our efforts today will set the stage and enable us to be well positioned for the future. \u2047 Our revved up strategy aims to position Polaris as the industry leader in electrification, both through the introduction of new vehicles and expansion of current offerings. \u2047 Our goal is to offer consumers an electric vehicle option within each of our core product segments over the next five years. \u2047 Last fall, we partnered with Zero Motorcycles, a global leader in electric motorcycle powertrains and technology, to bring to market an all-new 2022 electric RANGER by December 2021. \u2047 This all new electric powertrain will elevate the RANGER platform to a whole new level of capability, durability and performance. \u2047 We're also making investments to grow our current EV offerings with the co-development of a fully autonomous low-speed shuttle using our GEM vehicles, coupled with Optimus Ride's full stack of sensors and software to enable fully autonomous shuttles. \u2047 The vehicles are expected to roll out in the second half of 2023. \u2047 As we move through the year, watch for additional details on our revved up strategy in the upcoming RANGER product launch. \u2047 As you just heard, our first quarter far exceeded our expectations given the ongoing strong retail demand across the portfolio. \u2047 The Polaris team has met the challenges of supply chain shortages, logistics delays by working tirelessly with our suppliers, executing significant rework and coordinating with our logistics providers to deliver on our dealer and customers' expectations. \u2047 First-quarter sales were up 39% on a GAAP and adjusted basis versus the prior year. \u2047 Sales were up significantly for all segments of our business, driven by the ongoing strength in powersports, the boating industry and in our adjacent markets and Aftermarket segments. \u2047 First-quarter earnings per share on a GAAP basis was $2.11. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $2.30, which was up significantly over last year's first quarter. \u2047 The results were driven by increased volume across the portfolio, lower promotional costs and operating expense leverage during the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted gross margins were up 352 basis points year over year primarily due to the lower promotional costs driven by the strong retail demand and lower floor-plan financing costs as a result of the low dealer inventory levels. \u2047 Supply chain constraints were an ongoing pressure point to gross margins as logistics and rework remained high. \u2047 And as we previously indicated, tariff costs were higher during the quarter as the onetime exemptions and refunds we saw in 2020 largely ended. \u2047 Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were down 584 basis points as we realized leverage from the strong sales growth and the timing of some R&D expenses and stock-based compensation costs being delayed into the coming quarters. \u2047 Income from financial services declined 18% during the quarter as income from the Polaris Acceptance joint venture, which dealers use to finance their inventory, continue to be down due to the lower level of inventory in the channel. \u2047 Foreign exchange also had a positive impact on our quarterly results, primarily driven by the Canadian dollar and the euro. \u2047 From a segment reporting perspective, all segments reported increased sales for the quarter. \u2047 ORV & Snowmobiles increased 50%. \u2047 global adjacent markets was up 27%. \u2047 And boats increased 29% for the quarter. \u2047 Our segments benefited from lower promotional costs, which has decreased considerably across the powersports industry, given the high demand and the lack of product in the channel. \u2047 And aside from boats, all powersports segments also experienced a negative product mix during the quarter as supply chain constraints caused a shift in the types of products we were able to produce. \u2047 Two additional highlights I want to point out are International and parts, garments and accessories businesses. \u2047 International sales were up 59% during the quarter. \u2047 All segments and regions experienced increased sales during the quarter, mostly driven by strong ORV, snow, motorcycle and PG&A sales. \u2047 About 10 points of the growth came from improved currency rates. \u2047 And our parts, garments and accessories sales increased 49% during the quarter. \u2047 All segments and product categories grew significantly during the quarter, driven by strong retail and installed base demand. \u2047 Moving on to our revised guidance for 2021. \u2047 Given the stronger-than-anticipated performance in the first quarter, we have increased our total company sales growth guidance and now expect sales to increase in the 18% to 21% range for the year, up from the 13% to 16% we guided in January. \u2047 We are also increasing our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2021 and now expect earnings to be in the range of $9 to $9.25 per diluted share. \u2047 The increase is driven by higher volume, increased pricing through growth, MSRP changes and continued lower promotional spending and floor-plan financing costs in addition to improved foreign exchange rates and operating expense leverage. \u2047 These positives are, however, being partially offset by continued manufacturing inefficiencies and higher logistics costs in addition to commodity and component pricing pressures driven by supply chain constraints. \u2047 While we are pleased with the strong demand we are experiencing, it continues to stress our supply chain as our supply partners attempt to match our demand trends. \u2047 This is putting additional pressure on gross profit margins for the remainder of the year. \u2047 We now anticipate that gross profit margins will be down 60 to 90 basis points, primarily driven by ongoing negative product mix we saw in the first quarter, along with increased logistics and manufacturing inefficiencies due to the high level of rework in our factories. \u2047 Additionally, we are seeing increases in commodity prices that we expect to hit our P&L beginning in the second quarter. \u2047 As a result, we are implementing price increases to help offset these pressures. \u2047 However, we expect it will take several quarters for the two to converge. \u2047 And as Mike indicated, our supply chain initiative now in its third year will help offset some of the additional supply chain costs. \u2047 While our gross profit margins are expected to be down for the year, as I stated on our last earnings call, if you exclude the impact of tariffs and supply chain disruptions, our gross profit margin rate would be up over 200 basis points compared to last year. \u2047 Adjusted operating expenses are now expected to improve 80 to 100 basis points as a percentage of sales as sales growth outpaces operating expense growth. \u2047 Our guidance for operating expenses in dollars for the full"], "gold_summary": ["compname says q1
