{"article": ["I'm Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development for HNI Corporation. \u2047 Actual results could differ materially. \u2047 In the second quarter, our members executed at a high level, delivering substantial year-over-year profit improvement. \u2047 The post pandemic recovery continues to provide reasons to be encouraged about both the general environment and our opportunities at HNI. \u2047 However, the macro backdrop along with our strong growth also presented new challenges in the quarter related to labor availabilities, supply chain capacity and inflation. \u2047 Our teams managed through those challenges to deliver strong results. \u2047 Our two differentiated business segments are well positioned to benefit from the recovery of the cycle, multiple secular trends and numerous HNI specific growth initiatives. \u2047 We have a track record of effectively deploying capital, driving annual productivity and cost savings and managing through macro and operational challenges. \u2047 First, non-GAAP earnings per share doubled year-over-year, despite increasing pressure from inflation and returning costs. \u2047 Second, our Residential Building Products segment delivered exceptional performance. \u2047 Third, demand in Workplace Furnishings is recovering. \u2047 I will start by providing some detail on those highlights. \u2047 Marshall will then cover our third quarter outlook. \u2047 I will conclude with some general comments. \u2047 Our first highlight for the quarter. \u2047 We doubled non-GAAP earnings per share versus the prior year, despite increasing pressures in returning costs. \u2047 Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.40 was up 100% from the $0.20 reported in second quarter 2020. \u2047 In the quarter, we overcame greater than expected pressures related to material inflation, labor availability and supply chain capacity. \u2047 We generated 22% sales growth and our network ramps up to meet that demand. \u2047 In addition, as we discussed last quarter, some of the costs related to temporary measures taken in the second quarter of 2020 returned. \u2047 Despite these pressures, we grow strong margin expansion and profit growth. \u2047 Overall, the second quarter shows the power of our diversified revenue streams, our ability to react quickly to changing market dynamics and our overall operational capability associated with our member owner culture. \u2047 Our second highlight for the quarter, we delivered exceptional revenue and profit growth in our Residential Building Products segment. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, total revenue growth exceeded 50% in the quarter and operating profit more than doubled, with operating margins expanding more than 500 basis points from second quarter 2020 levels. \u2047 From a channel perspective, new construction revenue was up more than 30% from year ago levels and remodel retrofit sales increased nearly 90% versus the prior year quarter. \u2047 Orders were equally strong in the quarter, growing 53% year-over-year. \u2047 As the quarter progressed the comps became more difficult, order growth moderated but remained at high levels. \u2047 Our value propositions, growth initiatives and supply chain strength continue to resonate with homeowners, homebuyers and builders. \u2047 As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the prospects for both remodel retrofit and new construction. \u2047 Long-term demographic trends and a persisting housing supply demand and balance will continue to support a prolong housing cycle and elevated remodeling activity. \u2047 Nesting and deurbanization trends also provide secular support. \u2047 And we have an outstanding opportunity to grow the category in both new construction and remodel retrofit. \u2047 As a reminder in new construction two-thirds of homebuyers see having a fireplace is a must-have feature of the home, but less than 40% buy one. \u2047 And on the remodel retrofit side, we estimate that only about 3% of all remodeling projects involve a fireplace. \u2047 To take advantage of these opportunities, we are driving a better connection with the homebuyer and homeowner and we'll continue to make investments and launch tools that will assist and influence homebuyers and homeowners in their purchase in remodeling journeys. \u2047 An example of our investment in our model home is our model home virtual tour capability, where we content -- where our content and messaging seamlessly plugs into the builders virtual experience. \u2047 This allows us to reach the homebuyer early in the decision process with consistent and effective content. \u2047 We have strong competitive positions in both new construction and R&R, our vertically integrated business model, unmatched product depth and pricing breadth, strong builder relationships and regional distribution infrastructure, all provide differentiation for this business. \u2047 As a result, we have significant opportunities ahead of us to grow revenue in the Building Products business. \u2047 The third highlight for the quarter. \u2047 Our Workplace Furnishings segment is recovering. \u2047 On an organic basis, net sales in this segment increased 9% and orders grew 32% versus the prior year period. \u2047 Second quarter non-GAAP operating income grew 21% year-over-year despite the pressures discussed earlier. \u2047 Our small-to-mid sized customers continue to outperform as does demand in the public sector with orders in our businesses focused on these markets increasing 55% year-over-year in the second quarter, putting us back to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 In addition, the North American contracting market continues to recover with orders in our contract businesses up more than 23% in the second quarter year-over-year. \u2047 And in the past five weeks, contract orders were up approximately 30% versus the prior year period. \u2047 Looking to the back half, we believe Workplace Furnishings has turned the corner and expect to drive revenue growth through the remainder of the year. \u2047 Recent order patterns are encouraging and are indicative of our agility, our competitive position and improving demand trends. \u2047 Market demand signals indicate activity will continue to ramp in the back half. \u2047 As a result, we continue to expect year-over-year revenue growth in our Workplace Furnishings segment to accelerate as the recovery in our contract business gains momentum. \u2047 Our Workplace Furnishings businesses have unmatched price point breadth, channel access and market reach and we are investing in multiple strategic initiatives aimed at driving continued outperformance. \u2047 A few examples of our growth initiatives include, the December 2020 acquisition of Design Public Group. \u2047 We are seeing strong momentum with DPG. \u2047 Year-to-date orders are up over 40% with record bookings in May and June. \u2047 DPG is also giving us more access in greater insight into the work-from-home segment and e-commerce possibilities. \u2047 Another example, is our recently launched ESR app. \u2047 This is a mobile app we built to drive engagement with dealer sales reps and currently provides quick access to marketing content, product information, digitalization and order status updates, all from a single mobile enabled platform. \u2047 Over 600 dealer sales reps are already using the app. \u2047 We expect that number to grow as we add more capability. \u2047 Additionally, we are investing to make our contract dealers more efficient and effective. \u2047 This includes technology to streamline the design and selling processes and platforms to make the back-office more efficient. \u2047 These investments along with our existing competitive differentiators position us well to benefit from office reentry, work-from-home and deurbanization trends. \u2047 Let's start with our outlook for consolidated revenue growth. \u2047 We expect third quarter revenue to grow in the mid 20% range compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 Because of our seasonality, this outlook implies third quarter volume will be substantially above second quarter levels, the sequential growth in the mid 20% range. \u2047 That level of growth when combined with the general labor and sourcing environment is presenting new challenges. \u2047 Our staffing levels and overall supply chain capacity are ramping up, but not as fast as demand. \u2047 As a result, we expect labor and supply chain constraints will limit third quarter revenue growth versus the prior year quarter by 4 to 6 percentage points. \u2047 That headwind is included in our outlook. \u2047 This is a timing impact. \u2047 We can solve these constraints over time, we are capturing demand and expect that 4 to 6 percentage points of growth to flow to subsequent quarters. \u2047 Let's move to our third quarter outlook for the Residential Building Products segment. \u2047 Recent order trends, new home construction activity, the outlook for remodel and retrofit demand and expected benefits tied to our multiple growth initiatives combine to suggest that revenue growth rate in the mid to high 20% range compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 We see continued momentum of both remodel retrofit and new construction. \u2047 Now let's shift to our outlook for Workplace Furnishings. \u2047 Strong second quarter order trends, our growing backlog and a low prior year comparable adjusted growth rate including acquisition impacts in the low to mid 20% range on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Let's shift to third quarter profitability. \u2047 Compared to the prior year quarter, we expect the impact of strong volume growth to be mostly offset by cost challenges related to inflationary pressures, increased growth investments and return of costs associated with temporary actions taken in the prior year or expect operating income to be modestly higher than the third quarter of 2020, operating margins will likely compress in a year-over-year basis. \u2047 We do expect margin expansions return post the third quarter, as our recent price actions take hold and we anniversary the temporary cost actions taken during the pandemic. \u2047 Finally some comments on our cash flow and balance sheet expectations. \u2047 Quarter ending debt levels were approximately $179 million, modestly higher than last quarter and down slightly from the second quarter of last year. \u2047 The gross leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter of 2021 was approximately 0.9, unchanged from last quarter. \u2047 On sequential basis, while our leverage ratio was unchanged, cash increased by more than $24 million. \u2047 We expect free cash flow to ramp up in the second half consistent with normal seasonality and our projected cash flow provide ample capacity for continued growth investment, dividend payments and opportunistic M&A and buyback activity. \u2047 Let me wrap up by stating that as we look to the rest of 2021 and into 2022, we remain optimistic about our businesses and our markets. \u2047 We continue to gain momentum in Workplace Furnishings, where our winning customer experiences, the multiple strategic investments discussed earlier and our operational excellence will combine to provide a competitive advantage as the market recovers. \u2047 Recall our focus in our Workplace Furnishings segment is a combination of driving revenue growth and expanding margins. \u2047 We are increasingly confident in the recovery of the Workplace Furnishings market as order strength is broadening across customer groups, project sizes and geographically. \u2047 Our improving order growth in the quarter and over the past five weeks is encouraging. \u2047 Our unique industry leading Residential Building Products platform is positioned for sustained long-term revenue growth. \u2047 Our growth strategies in this segment continue to gain traction and we see strong demand supported by demographics and low housing inventories. \u2047 As a reminder, our focus in our Building Products segment is on maintaining our strong margins, while continuing to drive strong revenue growth. \u2047 As we move to the next stage of the recovery, we do so position to grow revenue, expand margins and increase cash flow. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q2 non-gaap earnings per share $0.40.  \u2047  expects q3 consolidated revenue to grow in mid-20 percent range compared to prior-year quarter."],
