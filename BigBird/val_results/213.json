{"article": ["You will also find our 10-Q on Range's website under the Investors tab, or you can access it using the SEC's EDGAR system. \u2047 For additional information, we've posted supplemental tables on our website to assist in the calculation of EBITDAX, cash margins, and other non-GAAP measures. \u2047 The first quarter of 2021 saw Range made continued progress toward our key strategic objectives, improving margins through cost controls and thoughtful marketing, generating free cash flow, enhancing liquidity and extending our maturity profile, operating safely and efficiently, and ultimately positioning the company to return capital to shareholders as the most efficient natural gas and NGL producer in Appalachia. \u2047 I'll touch briefly on each of these before turning it over to Dennis and Mark to cover in more detail. \u2047 I'll start with unit costs and margin improvements. \u2047 Range's unit costs for the quarter were right on track and ahead of our expectations with G&A, LOE, exploration expense, and production taxes, coming in at the low end of our guidance and expectations. \u2047 Additionally, we reported a significant gain in our marketing activities for the quarter. \u2047 As expected, GP&T increased versus the prior quarter but was more than offset by the significant improvements we saw in NGL and natural gas realizations, resulting in the vast improvements to Range's margins. \u2047 In fact Range's unhedged realized price for the quarter was approximately $3.20 per mcfe, which was $0.51 above the NYMEX Henry Hub equivalent price of $2.69. \u2047 This premium to Henry Hub is a result of our diversified marketing portfolio and liquids production. \u2047 This liquids uplift improve margins and reduces Range's breakeven costs when compared to producing only dry gas. \u2047 In fact Range's pre-hedge margin improved by over $1 per mcfe in the first quarter when compared to the 2020 average. \u2047 Given the improved fundamental backdrop for natural gas liquids with approximately 65% of our activity in the liquids-rich window this year, Range is very well positioned to continue to benefit from this dynamic. \u2047 During the quarter, Range was also able to benefit from improved daily prices in the natural gas market, realizing a natural gas differentials that was $0.08 better than the midpoint of guidance only partially offset by higher transportation fuel costs, again benefiting margins and cash flow. \u2047 On the back with this improved pricing, Range generated $193 million in cash flow from operations before changes in working capital, and with capital spending, coming in at just $105 million for the quarter, Range generated solid free cash flow. \u2047 As shown on slide 14, we expect this to continue with significant growth in EBITDAX this year versus last. \u2047 When combined with absolute debt reduction, this organic free cash flow generation puts us well on our way toward our longer-term balance sheet targets. \u2047 Touching on the all-in capital investment of $105 million on the quarter, it's clear that the team's operational execution was superb. \u2047 And we continue to find ways to lower costs, once again leveraging our large contiguous acreage position to find ways to complete the operational plan with peer-leading capital efficiency. \u2047 After delivering on operational plans below budget for the last three years, Range remains on track to do the same for the fourth consecutive year in 2021. \u2047 The operational team safely delivered this capital-efficient plant with an eye toward our long-term environmental goals. \u2047 Range closed out 2020 with class-leading emissions intensity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions intensity and putting us right on track toward our 2025 goal of net-zero. \u2047 As we strive for this goal, it all starts with efficient operations that minimize our operating footprint and importantly, generates competitive returns. \u2047 We believe Range's peer-leading capital efficiency and maintenance capital are key differentiators among peers. \u2047 As we've discussed in the past, Range's large blocky acreage position affords us operational and financial efficiencies on multiple fronts including water recycling, infrastructure, rig mobilization, and equally optimization, just to name a few. \u2047 Dennis will cover a good example of how this combination of these benefits, benefit range from both an ongoing development and corporate return standpoint in addition to strengthening our environmental efforts. \u2047 When combining our low well costs, strong recoveries, and shallow base decline of under 20%, Range is operating at a high level of capital efficiency that provides a solid foundation for generating sustainable free cash flow, what further differentiate Range is our ability to deliver this level of efficiency for an extended period of time giving our multi-decade core inventory. \u2047 For some added context on our inventory, Range is turning to sales approximately 60 wells this year, but we have approximately 2,000 Marcellus locations with EURs that are greater than 2 Bcfe per 1,000 foot of lateral. \u2047 The average recovery of these wells is very similar to the wells Range has turned to sales for the last several years providing Range an unmatched runway of high-quality wells that's measured in decades. \u2047 This is not the case for many of our peers, which we believe positions Range as well as any upstream company to benefit from improving commodity price environment over the medium and long-term. \u2047 Before turning it over to Dennis and Mark, I'll just reiterate that Range remains committed to sustainable free cash flow. \u2047 Over time, we believe Range will stand out among peers as a result of our low sustaining capital, competitive cost structure, marketing strategies, and importantly our multi-decade core inventory life, which will be an increasing competitive advantage in the years to come as other operators exhaust their core inventories. \u2047 We will continue to focus on safe, efficient, and environmentally sound operations, prudent capital allocation, and generating sustainable returns to shareholders. \u2047 Importantly, these are all reflected in our updated compensation metrics that can be found in our most recent proxy statement. \u2047 Over to you, Dennis. \u2047 When we communicated the operational details for our 2021 program, our framework was built around improving both operational and capital efficiencies, enhancing margins, all while striving to further improve our environmental and safety performance. \u2047 As we look at our first quarter results, our operating teams are off to a strong start delivering on our objectives for the year, beginning with Q1 production above our communicated guidance and capital spending in line with our 2021 plan. \u2047 First quarter capital spending came in at $105 million or approximately 25% of our 2021 program budget. \u2047 As we discussed on the prior call, our capital spending program is front-end loaded for the year and is a consistent approach with previous years. \u2047 As we look forward, our second quarter capital spending is expected to be approximately one-third of the annual budget for the year, mainly driven by activity timing for completions and turn in lines shifting to Q2. \u2047 The reduced capital investments in the second half of 2021 are aligned with our activity cadence reducing to one drilling rig and one frac crew during the third and fourth quarters. \u2047 Our first quarter production level of 2.08 Bcf equivalent per day was a direct result of recent strong well results combined with exceptional field run time for the quarter due in large part to the near flawless winter operations planning and execution by our production operations team. \u2047 Underpinning our first quarter production including turning to sales, 16 wells spread across are dry, wet, and super-rich acreage. \u2047 Our Q1 turn-in lines consisted of an average horizontal length in excess of 11,500 feet and added just under 200,000 producing lateral feet to Range's Appalachia assets. \u2047 During the fourth quarter of last year, through the first quarter of 2021, our activity shifted toward wells located across our processable gas footprint. \u2047 The results of these turn-in lines increased Range's average oil production to a level exceeding 8,000 barrels per day in Q1 and, has increased overall liquids production in similar levels seen during the first half of 2020. \u2047 This level of wet production contribution is expected to continue through the end of this year with second quarter production projected at approximately 2.1 Bcfe per day. \u2047 This will position us to achieve our 2021 maintenance target of 2.15 Bcfe per day through additional margin enhancing liquids production while spending $425 million or less. \u2047 Shifting to our operational highlights. \u2047 During the first quarter, 15 wells were drilled across our dry, wet, and super-rich footprint. \u2047 Four of these wells are in the top 20 lateral links for Range's Marcellus program history with all four exceeding 17,800 feet. \u2047 Drilling efficiencies continued with nearly three-quarters of the new wells drilled on pads with existing production, coupled with a 5% increase in daily lateral footage drilled compared to 2020. \u2047 On the completion side, 16 wells were completed during the quarter. \u2047 Overall, the team completed just under 1,200 frac stages while setting a first quarter winter operations efficiency record by averaging over eight frac stages per day. \u2047 This efficiency level exceeds Range's previous best first quarter in winter operations record by 14%. \u2047 The water operations team built upon prior water recycling successes by utilizing nearly 2 million barrels of third-party produced water, a first quarter record and as a result, reduced overall completion costs for the quarter by more than $4.5 million. \u2047 Despite cold weather conditions and heavy snowfalls, the team produced some of our best operational results in our program to date. \u2047 All while keeping safety and environmental performance at the forefront. \u2047 Lease operating expense for the first quarter was consistent with our prior year's Appalachia level and remained low at $0.09 per Mcfe. \u2047 Achieving this LOE level is in large part due to a well-coordinated proactive winter operations plan with the objective of minimizing weather-related production impacts and associated costs. \u2047 These efforts generated a field runtime that exceeded 99% with a weather-related production impact of less than 0.5 million cubic feet per day for the quarter, a remarkable achievement. \u2047 Looking at the operational successes and milestones achieved during the first quarter, involves a focused, continuous improvement approach, and it's anchored by four key areas. \u2047 Range's water recycling program, long lateral development, utilization of existing infrastructure, and lastly optimize the use of drilling and completions equipment. \u2047 Each of these are key drivers in delivering on our operational and capital efficiency and our integrated part of achieving our ESG or more specifically our environmental objectives. \u2047 We often touch on the benefits each of these bring to our program ranging from a reduction in operating costs, efficiency gains, minimizing our environmental footprint, and reductions in emissions. \u2047 Today, I'd like to take a moment and walk through how these four strategies are being implemented by our operations and support teams along with the positive impacts. \u2047 I'll use three of the wells that were turned to sales in the first quarter as an example. \u2047 These three wells were drilled on an existing surface location with producing wells that were originally developed and turn to sales in 2013. \u2047 The average lateral length of the original wells was just over 3,000 feet per well. \u2047 In stark contrast, the average lateral length of the new wells is nearly 16,000 feet per well, more than 5 times longer. \u2047 No additional earth disturbance was needed for 5 times the acreage development and no additional production, gathering, and processing infrastructure was required to add these new wells. \u2047 To put this into perspective, Range has close to 250 developed pads in Southwest PA and as of today, we've returned 84 of these locations to drill additional wells. \u2047 Additional wells are planned for these same pad sites along with the approximate other two-thirds of Range's pads that we've yet to return to for added activity. \u2047 Simply put, we're only scratching the surface of this opportunity. \u2047 The three new wells were completed late last year, utilizing our contracted electric fracturing fleet which displaced 470,000 gallons of diesel fuel. \u2047 This reduced our cost by approximately $300,000 per well along with large reductions and associated emissions. \u2047 40% of the water used to complete these new wells was recycled water from Range's producing wells along with third-party water, sourced from our water sharing process. \u2047 The balance of the water was pumped from our water pipeline network, which was installed nearly a decade ago, further reducing emissions associated with truck traffic by more than 13, 400 truck trips. \u2047 The average initial production of these wells exceeded 44 million cubic feet equivalent per day including more than 9,700 barrels per day of combined condensate and natural gas liquids per well, placing them in the top tier of wells in our Marcellus program history. \u2047 This is just one of many examples we could share from our development during the past several years with results such as this. \u2047 These efforts have underpinned our operational efficiency gains and give us confidence in the durability around keeping our drilling complete cost below $600 per foot, all while achieving our environmental goals and producing best-in-class wells. \u2047 These benefits highlight the importance and value of having a high- quality contiguous acreage position and forward-thinking technical team. \u2047 Before moving on to marketing, I'd like to touch on Range's environmental and safety performance. \u2047 To further reduce production facility emissions, in 2020, Range transitioned to a quarterly leak detection program doubling the number of inspections conducted. \u2047 As a result of this increased inspection frequency, an additional 7,400 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions was removed from our program, resulting in a 67% reduction for those related components. \u2047 This effort along with the continued advancements in our production facility design and utilization of an electric frac fleet has resulted in further reductions in Range's reported emissions, reaching a new low CO2 equivalent level. \u2047 This level of performance is competitive with any natural gas play in North America and puts Range in an enviable position globally. \u2047 Consistent with our environmental results, Range's safety performance saw similar improvements delivering an over 30% improvement in recordable incidents for the quarter, which was the best Q1 performance versus the prior five years. \u2047 Switching to marketing, Range's NGL and condensate business benefited from a strong first quarter. \u2047 Market prices improved across the board and our advantaged portfolio of contracts enabled Range to capture premium pricing and a pre-hedge NGL realization in Q1, that was the highest level since late 2018. \u2047 The primary driver for improved pricing across both NGLs and condensate was strong demand in a market that saw decreased supply. \u2047 Preliminary results for US propane and butane or LPG reveal that Q1 2021 domestic demand was 13% higher year-on-year while supply decreased by 4%. \u2047 Similarly, condensate supply in the Northeast is estimated to have decreased by 15% to 20% year-on-year. \u2047 As a result of these improved fundamentals, the market average NGL barrel price improved significantly during the quarter. \u2047 At $24.83 per barrel, Range's Mont Belvieu equivalent barrel was at 38% over the prior quarter and 83% compared to the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Propane prices led the way, increasing"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 adjusted non-gaap earnings per share of $0.30.  \u2047  production for full-year 2021 is expected to average about 2.15 bcfe per day, with about 30% attributed to liquids production.  \u2047  q1 adjusted non-gaap earnings per share $0.30.  \u2047
