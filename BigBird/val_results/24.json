{"article": ["This is Craig Lampo, Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. \u2047 The Company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2,323 million and record GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.12 and $1.09 respectively. \u2047 Sales were up 11% in US dollars and up 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Sales in the third quarter increased by 9% organically. \u2047 And sequentially, sales were up 17% in US dollars and 15% in local currencies and organically. \u2047 Breaking down sales into our two segments, the interconnect business, which comprised 96% of our sales was up 11% in US dollars and 10% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Our cable business, which comprised 4% of our sales, was up 2% in US dollars and 5% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. \u2047 Operating income was $476 million in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Operating margins were 20.5%, which was up a very strong 250 basis points sequentially and up 80 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 The strong sequential improvement in margins reflected a healthy conversion on the higher sales levels, as well as an expected significant reduction in the impact of COVID-related costs. \u2047 The year-over-year improvement in operating margin reflected a strong conversion on the higher sales levels. \u2047 From a segment standpoint, in the interconnect segment, margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2020, which increased from 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and 20% in the third quarter -- sorry, in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 In the cable segment, margins were 10.7%, which increased from 10.2% in the third quarter of 2019 and 9.4% in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Given the unprecedented challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are extremely proud of this quarter's performance. \u2047 Our team's ability to manage through all of the impacts of this crisis is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action-oriented culture and which has enabled us to capitalize on opportunities and maximize profitability in an uncertain market environment. \u2047 Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million, which was down from $30 million in the third quarter of last year. \u2047 The Company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020, including excess tax benefit of $11 million associated with stock option exercises during the quarter, was 22.1% compared to 24.5% in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Excluding the excess tax benefit just mentioned, the Company's adjusted effective tax rate was 24.5% for both the third quarter of 2020 and 2019. \u2047 Adjusted net income of $336 million was 14% of sales in the third quarter of 2020, another confirmation of the strength of the Company's financial performance. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share increased by 22% to $1.12 in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $0.92 in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 15% to $1.09 in the third quarter of 2020 from $0.95 in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Orders for the quarter were $2,275 million, which was up 9% compared to the third quarter of 2019 and up 15% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.98 to 1. \u2047 The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. \u2047 Cash flow from operations was a strong $398 million in the third quarter or 119% of adjusted net income. \u2047 Our free cash flow was $330 million or 98% of adjusted net income. \u2047 From a working capital standpoint, inventory and accounts receivable and accounts payable were $1.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.1 billion respectively at the end of September. \u2047 And inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 79, 72 and 61 days respectively. \u2047 All improved from the second quarter levels and all within our normal range. \u2047 During the third quarter, our cash flow from operations of $398 million, along with the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $104 million, were used primarily to repurchase 1.9 million shares of the Company's stock for $202 million or an average price of $108, fund dividend payments of $75 million, fund net capital expenditures of $68 million, fund acquisitions of $50 million and fund net purchases of short-term investments of $9 million. \u2047 This increase is effective for payments beginning in January of 2021. \u2047 At September 30, cash and short-term investments were $1.5 billion, a majority of which is held outside of the US. \u2047 Total debt at September 30 was $3.8 billion with no maturities before the third quarter of 2021. \u2047 And net debt at September 30 was $2.4 billion. \u2047 Total cash on hand plus the remaining availability under our credit facilities was $4 billion at the end of the quarter. \u2047 And third quarter EBITDA was $568 million and our pro forma net leverage ratio was 1.2 times. \u2047 And first and foremost, I hope that all of you on the call here today, together with your family, your friends and your colleagues, are staying safe and healthy throughout the pandemic. \u2047 As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements in the third quarter, and most importantly, discuss the trends and progress across our served markets. \u2047 I'll then make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year of 2020. \u2047 With respect to the third quarter, amid what has been clearly an unprecedented and volatile year, I'm truly proud that we at Amphenol achieved record sales and adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, realizing levels significantly above our guidance that we issued just 90 days ago. \u2047 Sales reached $2,323 million, an increase from prior year of 11% in US dollars, 10% in local currencies and 9% organically. \u2047 This strong growth was driven by increases in mobile devices, IT-datacom, industrial, military, broadband and the automotive markets, and was offset partially by declines in the commercial air and mobile networks markets. \u2047 We are particularly proud to have achieved a very robust 17% sequential growth from the second quarter, which was significantly higher than our original expectations. \u2047 As Craig mentioned, the Company booked $2,275 million in orders, and that represented a book-to-bill of 0.98 to 1. \u2047 Now, despite experiencing some continued operational challenges related to the pandemic, we generated excellent operating margins of 20.5% in the third quarter, and this was a full 250 basis point increase from our second quarter levels. \u2047 Just want to say that the Company's financial position remains extremely strong with our operating cash flow of $398 million, and that was particularly notable given the stronger-than-expected sequential growth from the second quarter. \u2047 And we continue to leverage that financial strength to return capital to our shareholders, both through our repurchase last quarter of 1.9 million shares of the Company's stock as well as the Board of Directors' approval of a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend that we are announcing today. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of the Amphenol team. \u2047 No question in my mind that the record results this quarter clearly demonstrate the true value of the agility, the discipline and the drive of our entrepreneurial organization. \u2047 Now, turning to the trends across our served markets, I would just comment that as we've seen this year so far, Amphenol's balanced and broad end market diversification is a uniquely valuable asset, especially in times of heightened economic uncertainty. \u2047 As many of our markets began to recover in the third quarter, we were able to quickly capitalize on the growth opportunities in those markets, while still retaining our broad exposure to new opportunities and new technology developments across all areas of the electronics industry. \u2047 The military market represented 12% of our sales in the third quarter. \u2047 Sales in this market increased by 6% from prior year, driven in particular by growth in military vehicles, naval, space, communications and airframe applications. \u2047 Sequentially, our sales increased by a strong 30% as we recovered from the impact of production restrictions that hit certain of our facilities related to government measures implemented in the second quarter to control the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to increase slightly from these levels. \u2047 And for the full year 2020, we expect a low-single digit increase in sales from prior year. \u2047 This full year performance reflects our leading market position and strong execution, offset in part by the impact of the pandemic-related production restrictions we experienced in the first half of 2020. \u2047 I'm very proud of our team working in the military market around the world. \u2047 They have maintained a singular focus on ensuring that our defense industry customers have uninterrupted access to our leading high technology interconnect products, which are critical to our customers' equipment. \u2047 We are encouraged both by the accelerating adoption of electronics in these systems, together with the overall favorable defense spending environment. \u2047 The investments that we've made over the last several years in both new technologies and the capabilities to produce them at volume have positioned us very strongly to be able to capitalize on these trends for many years to come. \u2047 The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the third quarter. \u2047 Sales were down by 40%, a very significant level, as the commercial aircraft market once again experienced unprecedented declines in demand for new aircraft due to the pandemic-related disruptions to the global travel industry. \u2047 Sequentially, our sales were a bit better than expected, rising 4% from the second quarter. \u2047 As we look ahead, though, we expect the commercial air market to continue to be negatively impacted by the significant reduction in demand for air travel, which is occurring around the world. \u2047 Accordingly, we expect an approximately 20% sequential reduction in our sales to this market in the fourth quarter. \u2047 And for the full year 2020, we expect a roughly 35% decline from prior year due to the unprecedented demand disruptions that our customers are experiencing. \u2047 It's no question that these are difficult times for the entire travel industry and that that's having a serious impact on the market for commercial airplanes in the near term. \u2047 Nevertheless, our team remains committed to leveraging the Company's strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next-generation systems integrated into those airplanes. \u2047 And we remain well positioned when this market eventually does return to growth. \u2047 The industrial market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. \u2047 And our sales to the industrial market exceeded our expectations, increasing by 21% in US dollars and 18% organically, a very strong performance. \u2047 This robust growth was driven especially by the instrumentation, medical, industrial battery, heavy equipment, alternative energy and rail mass transit segments, really a broad base of growth that we saw in the industrial market. \u2047 Although we had expected sales to be modestly lower than the second quarter, we actually realized 11% sequential growth here in the third quarter, a very strong performance. \u2047 Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a modest decline from these third quarter sales levels. \u2047 Nevertheless, for the full year 2020, we expect a low-double digit increase in sales from 2019 levels, an outstanding performance given the overall market environment. \u2047 I'm truly proud of our team working in the industrial market. \u2047 Whether enabling the growth in volumes of a wide array of medical equipment, managing through significant increases in demand for semiconductor capital equipment or executing on unprecedented demand for next-generation batteries, our global organization has reacted quickly to ensure that our customers around the world are fully supported, regardless of the many operational challenges that have arisen throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 As we look toward the long term, I'm confident that our performance through this crisis has positioned us very strongly for the future. \u2047 And importantly, we continue to drive our leading development of next-generation interconnect, sensor and antenna products in support of our customers in the industrial market, who in turn are accelerating their adoption of next-generation technologies. \u2047 The automotive market represented 17% of our sales in the third quarter. \u2047 After a truly challenging second quarter during which the global automotive industry was deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were very pleased to have seen a very strong recovery here in the third quarter with results much better than we had originally anticipated coming into the quarter. \u2047 Our team's outstanding execution led to an increase in sales from prior year by 4% in US dollars and 1% organically, well ahead of our expectations. \u2047 Sequentially, our sales increased by truly significant 78% from the second quarter as our team was able to execute quickly on a recovery in demand from automotive customers in all regions. \u2047 Looking now into the fourth quarter, we expect automotive sales to further increase in the mid-single digits from these levels. \u2047 For the full year 2020, we expect a low-double digit reduction in sales, which does reflect the severe and sudden pandemic-related downturn in demand from automotive OEMs that we saw in the first half. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has clearly demonstrated both agility and resiliency in realizing these strong sequential growth levels. \u2047 In fact, our performance through this crisis makes me even more confident in our long-term prospects in the automotive market. \u2047 We've continued to expand our range of interconnect, sensor and antenna products, both organically and through acquisitions, all with the goal of enabling a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world. \u2047 This consistent strategy will no doubt continue to benefit us as the automotive market recovers. \u2047 The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. \u2047 And our sales to mobile device customers increased by a stronger-than-expected 25% from prior year, driven in particular by increased sales of products incorporated into laptops, tablets and wearables, and this was offset in part by slightly lower year-over-year sales to smartphones. \u2047 Sequentially, our sales increased by a much stronger-than-expected 37%. \u2047 And this was driven by higher sales across all the products that we serve. \u2047 Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect a slight increase from these already strong third quarter levels. \u2047 And for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow in the low-double digits from 2019. \u2047 And I would just note that this is well above our original expectations as we came into the year before we were hit with the pandemic. \u2047 While mobile"], "gold_summary": ["amphenol corp q3 adjusted earnings per share $1.09.
