{"article": ["This release is available on the company's website at dhigroupinc.com. \u2047 Lastly, during today's call, management will be referring to specific financial measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and net debt that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \u2047 As always, we appreciate your interest in DHI. \u2047 Let me first start with quick update on our operation status as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Our foremost concern at DHI is to ensure the health and safety of our DHI community. \u2047 As such, the majority of our employees continued to work from home during the quarter, using the best possible remote communication and collaboration tools. \u2047 And our team members, including sales and support, marketing and product development continued to be highly effective. \u2047 We currently have several offices open, though we have made the return to office optional for all our employees. \u2047 We are looking forward to having more of our employees back in the office when it's safe. \u2047 But rest assured, we are taking significant precautions to make sure we maintain the safety of our employees, whether they are in the office or working from home. \u2047 Now let's jump into a review of the quarter. \u2047 While the pandemic continues to challenge the way we all live and work, we actually saw job postings stabilize during the summer, although they were lower in total than the year before. \u2047 The sentiment is that many companies paused their hiring during this time as they reformulated their hiring plans based on their view of the economic recovery to come. \u2047 However, in September, we saw the sentiment change for the better, as evidenced by a notable uptick in job posting as well as an increase in our bookings. \u2047 Based on our Burning Glass feed, there are over 2,200 companies that have more than 20 open tech job postings right now. \u2047 Companies like Amazon, Microsoft and J.P. Morgan Chase have over 1,000 active tech jobs posted today. \u2047 Both the Staffing Industry Analysts and TechServe Alliance, industry research firms that focus on tech centric staffing and recruiting firms, are forecasting a bounce back in the IT staffing market in 2021 to almost pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 The SIA is forecasting year-over-year market growth of 7%, which would get the market back to 98% of 2019 IT staffing revenue levels, representing an almost complete rebound. \u2047 As I mentioned last quarter, a report released by Microsoft in July predicts that the worldwide digital jobs will grow from 41 million in 2020 to 190 million in 2025. \u2047 Of the 149 million new digital jobs to be created, 98 million are forecast to be in software development. \u2047 It's clear that our collective future will be more online and businesses will accelerate their efforts to digitize. \u2047 These efforts will, of course, require technologists. \u2047 As we continue to execute on our plan to create the best tech focused career marketplaces using our technology skills data model, we stand ready to capitalize on these trends. \u2047 Now let me provide some detail regarding our product development efforts during the quarter. \u2047 Our product development team continued to deliver its usual high pace of product innovation. \u2047 With the release of Dice IntelliSearch Based Job Alerts, job alerts are automatically generated based on the specific skillset and location found in the candidate's profile. \u2047 This creates a virtuous circle that encourages candidates to register and keep their profiles up-to-date. \u2047 Dice recruiter profile which we delivered last quarter, experienced the fastest adoption rate the company has ever seen from any of its product releases in the past two years. \u2047 During the third quarter, one-third of all Dice recruiters completed their new Dice Recruiter Profile. \u2047 Dice Recruiter Profile allows our clients to enrich their profiles with photos, personal information, details about corporate brand and culture, news and latest hires, upcoming events and future hiring needs, all of which create more transparency and personalize the recruiter behind the role. \u2047 Dice Recruiter Profile was the first major release in Dice's transformation from a job board to a full-scale career marketplace. \u2047 With Dice marketplace, we are creating a trusted environment where recruiters and candidates can learn much more about each other to facilitate more effective career discussions. \u2047 During the quarter, we also launched ClearanceJobs Client Team Dashboard, which allows clients to have a full view of their recruitment team activity on the site, linking activities to successful hiring patterns. \u2047 ClearanceJobs continues to be DHI's test bed for key market-leading features. \u2047 We also launched new features on eFinancialCareers called Follow, Voice and Video. \u2047 The Follow feature allows candidates to follow recruiters and get a news feed of their content on a weekly basis. \u2047 Voice and Video allow finance and tech professionals and recruiters to connect virtually with video and voice calling, as well as instant messaging through the eFC platform, all of which are highly relevant in the work from home environment. \u2047 These capabilities were delivered as we announced the completion of the first iteration of the fully functional eFC marketplace, a huge milestone for the company. \u2047 eFC follows CJ as the second brand to complete the transformation from job board to full-scale career marketplace. \u2047 We have many new product releases planned for the fourth quarter. \u2047 Dice is completing the design for its own messaging system with an expected launch at year-end. \u2047 Recruiters and candidates will be able the message each other within the platform in the same pattern as Facebook Messenger. \u2047 This is the second critical ingredient for full marketplace capability and creates in-platform engagement and stickiness. \u2047 Protecting our clients and candidate's information is incredibly important to us. \u2047 Therefore, in the fourth quarter, Dice has already released a new authentication and authorization system which move it to an industry-standard secure login protocol. \u2047 This feature is a stepping stone to multifactor authentication in early 2021. \u2047 We are also working on delivering calendar and schedule integration for ClearanceJobs, which will allow for recruiters and candidates to seamlessly schedule meetings and communicate in general from a system built into the platform and will connect to users' native email application. \u2047 Lastly, eFC has already release IntelliSearch based job alerts in the fourth quarter, similar to what I just described for Dice. \u2047 As I have said before, I believe we were experiencing a checkmark shaped recovery versus a V-shaped recovery. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, we saw a notable uptick in sentiment in bookings in September. \u2047 We had several sales teams reach or exceed their pre-pandemic bookings production for the quarter as a result of the rebound, including both CJ's new business and account management teams, as well as Dice's staffing and recruiting new business team. \u2047 Renewal rates for all account management teams improved during the month. \u2047 Dice commercial accounts continues to be affected by the current environment due to the uncertainty around hiring plans. \u2047 As an example, we have worked with one very large enterprise that has dramatically changed their hiring plan four times in the past four months. \u2047 The good news is that our sales team's pipeline of deal activity has continued to grow despite sales cycles lengthening. \u2047 We continue to see increased engagement from candidates in the current work from home environment. \u2047 In addition, on the client side, we saw an increase in marketing qualified leads through the contract me form fills on our Dice site which is a leading indicator of pipeline growth. \u2047 The rebound in Dice's staffing and recruiting new business highlights that Dice is a necessity for staffing and recruiting firms focused on tech. \u2047 And as I mentioned before, the need for technologists is expected to grow strongly in the new post-pandemic economy. \u2047 Due to the success that we are seeing in CJ and Dice's staffing and recruiting new business teams, we have shifted several sales reps from Dice's commercial accounts team to these two teams with the mantra sell of those who are buying now. \u2047 ClearanceJobs has been relatively unaffected by the pandemic, as its performance is generally correlated to the U.S. Department of Defense budget, which remains relatively predictable. \u2047 We continue to work hard on expanding CJ's addressable market through direct sales to U.S. government agencies and expect ClearanceJobs to add more government customers as we close out the remainder of this year. \u2047 Finally, eFinancialCareers remains our most challenged brand. \u2047 It is still being affected by the protests in Hong Kong, uncertainty around the hard Brexit and its largest market, the U.K. and the expected longer recession for the global banking industry as credit quality remains uncertain and under continuous reassessment. \u2047 There is no question that the uncertainty in the banking industry has weighed down eFC's performance to-date and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. \u2047 As I conclude my remarks, I want to reiterate that we are successfully executing on our plan to build career marketplaces for matching tech professionals with employers. \u2047 And we are doing so, while exceeding our adjusted EBITDA targets. \u2047 We believe we have created a better online platform than our competitors for matching companies with the highest quality tech professionals and believe we can capitalize on the millions of new technologist jobs expected over the next five years. \u2047 While this growth won't happen overnight and COVID-19 certainly presents uncertainty, we are confident in our business plan and the continued progress we are making toward achieving our goal of returning to growth. \u2047 I will start by going through the financial results, then add a few comments about the business. \u2047 For the third quarter, we reported total revenues of $33.3 million, which was down 2% from the second quarter and 11% year-over-year. \u2047 Dice revenue was $19.8 million in the third quarter, down 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. \u2047 We ended the third quarter with 5,300 Dice recruitment package customers, which is down 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. \u2047 Our average monthly revenue per Dice recruitment package customer was down 1% versus the year ago quarter to $1,122 or $13,464 on an annual basis. \u2047 Over 90% of our Dice revenue is recurring and comes from recruitment package customers. \u2047 Our Dice customer renewal rate was 63% for the third quarter, up from 57% last quarter, but down three percentage points year-over-year. \u2047 Our Dice revenue renewal rate was 66%, up five percentage points from last quarter, but down 10 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. \u2047 While we did see lower in-period renewal rates, that is customers renewing prior to or at contract termination, we are maintaining an ongoing dialog with these non-renewal customers with the expectation that they will resign when there is further recovery in the economy. \u2047 As we mentioned last quarter, we hired a new leader for our client success organization, who has implemented new processes around onboarding and ongoing touch points that we believe should have a positive impact on both customer and revenue renewal rates. \u2047 As we look at Dice, our strategy continues to be on larger customer relationships. \u2047 We believe this will put us in the best position for stability and growth. \u2047 Currently, approximately 13% of our customers generate 50% of our recruitment package revenue, though no one customer makes up 1% of revenue. \u2047 We think this is a good balance of a strong stable revenue base without having a significant customer concentration risk. \u2047 ClearanceJobs third quarter revenue was $7.3 million, an increase of 3% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. \u2047 This continued solid double-digit revenue growth year-over-year is reflective of ClearanceJobs' strong innovative products and competitive differentiation as well as the somewhat insulated market it serves. \u2047 Third quarter revenue for eFinancialCareers was $6.1 million, which was down 1% sequentially and down 25% year-over-year when excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. \u2047 As expected, COVID negatively impacted our performance for eFC during the quarter. \u2047 In the U.K., which is our largest geography by revenue for eFC, we were impacted by the COVID shutdown as well as the U.K. furloughs which were extended through October of this year. \u2047 In the APAC region, eFC's second largest geography, we continued to experience difficulties primarily due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. \u2047 Turning to operating expenses. \u2047 Third quarter operating expenses were $61.8 million, which includes non-cash impairment charges of both the Dice trade name of $8 million and goodwill of $23.6 million, both of which I will address in a moment. \u2047 Excluding the impairment charges, operating expenses were $30.2 million, representing a decrease of $1.7 million or 5% year-over-year. \u2047 This decrease in operating expenses was primarily the result of the comprehensive cost management exercise which began in late March and continues currently as well as more efficient third-party marketing spend. \u2047 Income tax benefit for the third quarter was $1.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 5%, which includes the impact of the non-cash impairment charges. \u2047 This rate is lower than our expected statutory rate of 25% due to nondeductible impairment charges and the allocation of loss between jurisdictions. \u2047 As I mentioned, during the third quarter, we recorded a non-cash impairment charges related to the Dice trade name of $8 million and goodwill of $23.6 million. \u2047 The impairment charge for the trade name was primarily driven by a decline to the royalty rate used in valuing the Dice trade name, an assumption driven by the impact of COVID-19. \u2047 The $23.6 million goodwill impairment is the result of the impact of the pandemic and the expectation that a broader recovery will extend into 2021, whereas previously we expected the recovery toward the end of 2020. \u2047 Including these non-cash impairment charges, we recorded a net loss for the third quarter of $27.3 million, a loss of $0.57 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share a year ago. \u2047 This quarter's net loss was negatively impacted by $29.3 million of charges substantially from the non-cash impairments of goodwill and intangible assets. \u2047 Last year's net income was positively impacted by $500,000 from discrete tax items. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.04 versus $0.07 last year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $7.6 million, a margin of 23%, which was consistent with the second quarter of this year and the third quarter of last year. \u2047 As we stated on our last call, our goal is to manage the business to approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margins. \u2047 We"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.04.  \u2047  q3 revenue fell 11 percent to $33.3 million.  \u2047  qtrly loss per share $0.57."],
