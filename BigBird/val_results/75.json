{"article": ["This release is available on the company's website at dhigroupinc.com. \u2047 Lastly, during today's call, management will refer to specific financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, and net debt that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \u2047 We appreciate your interest in DHI. \u2047 I want to begin by saying a few words about the impact of COVID-19 and our response to this global pandemic. \u2047 First, I want to express our heartfelt concern to all of those who have been impacted. \u2047 And to everyone listening today, I hope you and your family and friends are staying safe and healthy. \u2047 In the past several weeks, DHI has jumped into action to aid our community by launching COVID-19 Resource Centers on each of our brand sites, assisting both clients and candidates alike with information relevant to their needs in these challenging times. \u2047 And just last week, we launched a campaign to provide free recruitment services to U.S. hospitals to help them find technologists in fields like electronic medical records, healthcare administration, and computer system processing. \u2047 As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, our foremost concern at DHI is to ensure the health and safety of our employees, their families, and our worldwide community. \u2047 As such, we have taken extraordinary measures to maintain continuity of our operations and to continue to safely operate at full capacity while complying with the local, state, and country-mandated protection directives. \u2047 All of our employees are working from their residences using the best possible remote communication and collaboration tools. \u2047 And our team members, including sales and support, marketing and R&D, continue to be highly effective. \u2047 DHI has had a video meeting culture for many years, given the global nature of our team. \u2047 And as a technology company, we have significant experience operating in a remote work environment. \u2047 Well before this pandemic, 95% of our employees were utilizing company laptops with the ability to work from home. \u2047 The vast majority of our sales team routinely meets with clients remotely versus in-person. \u2047 And our R&D team uses online dev ops tools to promote code to production. \u2047 And as a result, we delivered two of our most significant product releases this year while our employees were working from home. \u2047 While the current environment is certainly challenging the way that we all live and work, DHI's business model gives us some level of protection and stability in these uncertain times, as 90% of our revenues are generated through annual subscription-based contracts. \u2047 Additionally, our business has a seasonality that has benefited us, with our largest two quarters for bookings being the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year. \u2047 As a result, as of March 31, we had already booked over 2/3 of our total revenue for fiscal 2020. \u2047 Despite this difficult environment, DHI was able to exceed its target of a 20% adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter. \u2047 We also took the precautionary step to ensure sufficient liquidity by drawing down an additional $25 million on our credit facility in early March while still maintaining a significant cushion to our covenants. \u2047 As we continue to work through these unprecedented times, with some of our competitors announcing layoffs, I want to emphasize that the strengths of our business model put us in a very different category and much stronger position than many of these other companies. \u2047 DHI is a specialist, not a generalist. \u2047 We match clients with technologists and their unique skill sets. \u2047 DHI is a subscription model, not pay-as-you-go. \u2047 DHI provides permanent hires, not hourly workers. \u2047 And DHI focuses on the enterprise market, less on the SMB space. \u2047 We believe our unique business model positions us well to weather this storm. \u2047 Additionally, over the past several weeks, we've seen a stable number of tech job postings as enterprises look to accelerate the use of technology in their business. \u2047 Now more than ever, businesses realize they need an online business model, a way of delivering services without being face-to-face, and a way to manage their remote employees effectively. \u2047 As a result, we continue to see a number of businesses looking for technologists to help accelerate these efforts. \u2047 Every week, we review a report that details the total number of new tech job postings as compiled by scraping the career pages for U.S. corporate websites each night. \u2047 Over the past several weeks, the total number of job postings has remained in line with the trailing 12-month trend. \u2047 The types of skills requested have shifted, with cybersecurity and systems engineering seeing an increased demand, but the overall volume of postings has remained relatively consistent. \u2047 Over the longer-term, if you look at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics trend line for tech jobs over the past 20 years, including through the dotcom bubble and Great Recession, there has been a constant increase in technologist positions in this country. \u2047 The market for technologists was at close to zero unemployment level before the pandemic, and we expect this high level of demand for these skill sets to continue. \u2047 And DHI is well-positioned for this opportunity even in this challenging environment as a result of the significant progress we made over the past year in building the leading marketplace for matching technologists with our clients. \u2047 In 2019, we delivered over 20 marquee product releases and dozens of minor releases. \u2047 During the first quarter, we continued to deliver a high pace of product innovation, including integrating IntelliSearch with our Dice Job Management Console. \u2047 This marquee release demonstrates the value of our patent-pending technology skills data model. \u2047 When a client posts a new tech job, IntelliSearch automatically generates a list of qualified candidates from our database. \u2047 The technologist recruitment process is all about gaining access to the right skill sets, and this powerful tool allows our clients to save time in their search process. \u2047 We also moved 100% of our audience to a new Dice home page that includes a modern layout and navigation scheme. \u2047 Additionally, we added a private email feature, which enables Dice candidates to protect their personal email address and only share it with recruiters when they choose. \u2047 On our path to transform Dice into an indispensable career marketplace, trust is a cornerstone of that experience. \u2047 Dice private email encourages candidates to make their profiles visible and up-to-date, increasing the breadth of talent visible to our clients. \u2047 The complete makeover of the Dice client experience over the past year, including IntelliSearch, Candidate Match, Job Management, Job Search, Job Alerts, Multi Location Search, and now our new Dice Home Page and Private E-mail, are delivering more value every day. \u2047 We also launched job alerts on eFC in the first quarter. \u2047 With this release, eFC and Dice are now on a common DHI job search and alerts platform, illustrating our code once, deploy many strategy across our brands. \u2047 Helping candidates find jobs that fit their skills and interests is the top priority of our job search engineering team. \u2047 The new job alerts release is a significant step forward toward our objective of having a best-in-class search experience for our candidates. \u2047 Finally, we also launched CJ Favorites in the quarter. \u2047 This feature allows clearance jobs clients to keep tabs on top candidate prospects, receive alerts when they are active on the site, and engage when they are receptive to contact. \u2047 CJ continues to be our testbed for key market-leading features. \u2047 Looking ahead, we have a clear product roadmap in front of us for each one of our platforms. \u2047 We are working now to add recruiter profile and remote jobs to Dice, and IntelliSearch and Candidate Match to eFinancial Careers. \u2047 There is no question that the importance of defining and searching for remote jobs has surged in popularity over the past few weeks, and I'm grateful that our team has accelerated the delivery of the remote jobs feature. \u2047 Simultaneously, we are working on delivering significant workflow automation features in ClearanceJobs. \u2047 We expect these additional features to be live in this second quarter. \u2047 Speaking of ClearanceJobs, I would like to update you on our progress in pursuing direct government contracts, one of our key growth initiatives we launched last year. \u2047 ClearanceJobs has done an excellent job growing year-over-year in the cleared professional market. \u2047 However, less than 1% of its revenue historically has come from direct contracts with government agencies. \u2047 Last year, we launched an initiative to identify U.S. government agencies we could be working with and understand more about their hiring needs for technology professionals. \u2047 As you'd suspect, these government organizations have just as much demand for technologists as the government contractors we serve today. \u2047 As such, we put together a plan targeting the agencies we wanted to approach first, and we've seen some early success. \u2047 We're making excellent headway, and I'm very proud of the effort of the ClearanceJobs team as they take on this entirely new customer segment. \u2047 We expect more government agencies to sign on as customers throughout 2020. \u2047 We are proud to announce that the Department of Defense has recently designated ClearanceJobs as an essential supplier, which they define as an essential service needed to ensure the continuing operation of government agencies. \u2047 Now, let me briefly touch on the progress we continue to make improving our go-to-market strategy and execution. \u2047 As I mentioned on our last call, during the fourth quarter, our new Chief Revenue Officer, Arie Kanofsky, added top-notch sales leadership to his team, and we created brand-new Dice Commercial sales teams in both Denver and New York. \u2047 These teams grew their pipelines very successfully, and we signed on many new clients based on their efforts for the first 10 weeks of the quarter. \u2047 Obviously, the state of the U.S. economy changed dramatically in mid-March, and these teams, which are 100% dedicated to building new business relationships, have seen what we believe is a temporary slowdown in their efforts as a result. \u2047 The insights we've gained in the first 10 weeks of the quarter, and the momentum we saw in signing new customers, gives us great confidence that our focus on commercial accounts will be the cornerstone for our growth as the business environment normalizes. \u2047 As I conclude my remarks, I want to reiterate that, as a specialist, we have built a better tool than our competitors for companies looking to hire technologists. \u2047 With our improved product offering and go-to-market strategy, we believe we can grow our revenue at or above the market growth rate over the longer-term. \u2047 While this growth won't happen overnight, and COVID-19 presents uncertainty, we are confident in our business plan and the continued progress we are making toward achieving our goal. \u2047 We remain incredibly excited about the market opportunity in front of us. \u2047 We believe the investments we made in 2019 and will continue to make in 2020, are positioning DHI as the industry leader in matching technologists with employers. \u2047 Let's jump right into the quarterly results. \u2047 For the first quarter, we reported total revenues, $6.6 million, which was down 3% from the fourth quarter and down 1% year-over-year when you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. \u2047 Dice revenue was $22.5 million in the first quarter, down 3% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year. \u2047 We ended the first quarter with 5,850 Dice recruitment package customers, which is down 3% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. \u2047 We continue to see an increase in our average monthly revenue per recruitment package customer, which was up 2% year-over-year to $1,153, or approximately $13,840 on an annual basis. \u2047 This is important, as over 90% of Dice revenue is recurring and comes from recruitment package customers. \u2047 Our Dice customer renewal rate was 67% for the first quarter, down 1 percentage point year-over-year, and our revenue renewal rate was 80%, which was also down 1 percentage point when compared to the same period last year. \u2047 As we look at our Dice customers, our strategy is to focus on these larger relationships, which creates a more stable customer base. \u2047 By moving upstream in terms of our marketing efforts, sales activities, and go-to-market approach, we believe we are putting ourselves in the best position for stability and growth. \u2047 As an example, currently 15% of our customers generate 50% of our recruitment package revenue, though no customer makes up even 1% of revenue. \u2047 We think this is a good balance of a strong, stable revenue base without having customer concentration risk. \u2047 First quarter revenue for eFinancial Careers was $7.2 million, down 6% from the fourth quarter and 10% year-over-year when excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. \u2047 As expected, COVID-19 negatively impacted our performance for eFinancial Careers during the quarter. \u2047 In the APAC region, eFC's second largest geography, we experienced difficulties at the beginning of the quarter as the Coronavirus hit both Singapore and Hong Kong in the second week of January. \u2047 In the U.K. and European financial industry, we saw the slowdown toward the latter half of the quarter. \u2047 ClearanceJobs' first quarter revenue was $6.9 million, increase of 4% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. \u2047 This continued solid double-digit revenue growth year-over-year is reflective of its strong innovative products and competitive differentiation. \u2047 Turning to operating expenses, first quarter operating expenses were $41.9 million, which includes an impairment of the Dice trade name of $7.2 million, which I will address in a moment. \u2047 Excluding the impairment, operating expenses were $34.7 million, representing an increase of $1.2 million, or 3% year-over-year. \u2047 This increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the current ramp-up of our sales and engineering capabilities. \u2047 As Art mentioned, we added several new sales reps to our commercial accounts team during the fourth quarter, which drove an increase in sales expense this quarter. \u2047 We also added additional engineering talent in the fourth quarter to accelerate the deployment of new product features, which drove increases in both product expense and capital expenditures. \u2047 In light of the current environment, we have reviewed our entire cost structure and have begun reducing non-headcount-related expenses, both operating expenses and capital expenditures. \u2047 This includes such areas as contractor and consulting spend, marketing spend, future headcount growth, and third-party vendor spend. \u2047 As an example, we have found several opportunities to extend critical vendor agreements prior to their expiration at lower per-month or per-user rates. \u2047 With regards to marketing, we believe we can still achieve our candidate and client engagement metrics with lower spend as"], "gold_summary": ["compname says q1 revenue fell 1 percent to $36.6 million.  \u2047  q1 revenue fell 1 percent to $36.6 million.  \u2047  q1 loss per share $0.13.  \u2047  as of march 31st, we had already booked over two-thirds of total revenue for fiscal 2020."],
