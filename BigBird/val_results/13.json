{"article": ["Lexington believes that these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. \u2047 Any references in these documents to adjusted company FFO refers to the adjusted company funds from operations available to all equity holders and unitholders on a fully diluted basis. \u2047 Operating performance measures of an individual investment are not intended to be viewed as presenting a numerical measure of Lexington's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows. \u2047 Executive Vice Presidents, Lara Johnson and James Dudley will be available during the Q&A portion of our call. \u2047 We had a great first quarter overall and continue to make substantial progress on executing our business plan. \u2047 Adjusted company FFO was $0.22 per diluted common share in the quarter, which included $10.9 million of lease termination income primarily associated with a legacy industrial asset in Durham, New Hampshire. \u2047 During the quarter, we purchased three industrial assets for approximately $51 million and completed the fully leased development project in the Columbus market. \u2047 Overall, these investments produced average estimated stabilized GAAP and cash cap rates of 6.1% and 5.9% respectively. \u2047 Market rents across our portfolio continued to grow. \u2047 Occupancy is healthy and our industrial exposure represented over 91% of gross real estate assets at quarter-end excluding held-for-sale assets. \u2047 We continued to see the value of our industrial properties steadily increase during the quarter, and we believe the value of our office portfolio has also improved amid signs of the pandemic easing. \u2047 There are several factors continuing to drive up the overall value of our holdings. \u2047 Capitalization rates continue to be under pressure replacement cost is increasing rapidly and tenant demand is driving rents higher. \u2047 Our industrial portfolio is benefiting from all these trends with first quarter industrial base and cash base rent renewal increases of 14.6% and 5.4% respectively representing the most visible sign. \u2047 The factors driving valuations higher are also supporting a highly competitive investment landscape, and we continue to focus our time on finding the best risk-adjusted opportunities in our target markets in the Sun Belt and lower Midwest. \u2047 Industrial purchases in the quarter included two facilities in Indianapolis and one in Central Florida. \u2047 Additionally, we have approximately $206 million of assets, either under contract or with an accepted offer, which we expect to close later this quarter. \u2047 After a slow start that is typical of the first quarter, current deal flow is robust, with more than $1 billion of investments under review. \u2047 We are mindful of pricing, as there continues to be a lot of capital chasing opportunities in a competitive market. \u2047 On the development front, we are finishing the construction of our Atlanta project in Fairburn and we are committed to two other projects in our target markets of Indianapolis and Central Florida. \u2047 Development and the purchase of vacancy continue to be attractive ways for us to produce stabilized yields in excess of what is available in the purchase market for fully leased buildings. \u2047 We leased 1.5 million square feet during the quarter and at quarter-end our stabilized portfolio was 97.8% leased. \u2047 Our asset management team has done a terrific job in securing both lease extensions and new leases with increasing rents. \u2047 In addition to the three lease renewals in our single-tenant industrial portfolio, we raised occupancy at our multi-tenant industrial facility in Antioch Tennessee to nearly 100% and simultaneously increased base rental rates by approximately 16% for the two new tenants within the facility. \u2047 Subsequent to quarter-end, we executed a five-year extension at our 423,000 square foot industrial facility in Lumberton North Carolina and increased base and cash base rent by 23% and 8.6% respectively. \u2047 Our balance sheet continues to be in great shape, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 4.6 times at quarter-end. \u2047 Our cash balance at quarter-end was $170 million, including restricted cash and we had $94.5 million sold forward in our ATM. \u2047 Liquidity was enhanced during the quarter by $58 million of sales at GAAP and cash cap rates of 6.3% and 6.5% respectively and will be augmented by retained cash flow throughout the balance of the year. \u2047 Subsequent to the quarter, we sold our industrial facility in Laurens South Carolina for $40 million. \u2047 Currently we have assets under contract or with an accepted offer for an aggregate gross price of approximately $135 million. \u2047 Our remaining non-core sale portfolio consists of 17 properties, which generated first quarter NOI of $8.2 million. \u2047 We believe the current value of this portfolio is approximately $290 million. \u2047 Finally, we continue to make progress with our ESG efforts and have disclosed long-term environmental targets. \u2047 In addition, we distributed a tenant survey to collect data, gain feedback and identify opportunities to partner with our tenants. \u2047 We became a supporter of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures and a participant member of GRESB and we are working on reporting to the GRESB real estate assessment for the first time this year. \u2047 The two Indianapolis assets we acquired during the quarter are virtually identical buildings, each approximately 150,000 square-foot Class A facilities built in 2019, well-located in Northwest Indianapolis within one mile of I-65. \u2047 The properties are 100% leased, each with two tenants, and have a weighted average lease term of just under five years, with rental escalations of 2.5%. \u2047 The Indianapolis, central location, excellent infrastructure and its large high-quality labor pool make it very attractive to both users, particularly e-commerce distributors. \u2047 Indianapolis is one of the top five cargo airports in the country, with the second largest FedEx hub in the world and it ranks as one of the top 10 U.S. bulk distribution markets. \u2047 Our Central Florida acquisition in Lakeland is an example where we can add value through leasing up some vacancy in the facility. \u2047 Property is a brand-new 222,000 square foot Class A warehouse distribution center and is primarily leased on a long-term basis with 2.5% annual escalations to credit tenant Motion Industries a subsidiary of Genuine Parts Company. \u2047 We are currently in negotiations with a potential tenant for a portion of the remaining square footage and have multiple prospects viewing the additional space, as we work toward a stabilized cash yield forecasted to be approximately 5.3%. \u2047 Lakeland is a core sub-market on the I-4 corridor between, Tampa and Orlando, two of Florida's largest and fastest-growing MSAs. \u2047 And the property is just a short distance away, from the new Amazon Air Hub facility in Lakeland. \u2047 Our approximately 320,000 square-foot Rickenbacker project in Columbus, leased to a subsidiary of PepsiCo was completed in the first quarter. \u2047 The estimated GAAP and cash stabilized yields are 7.9% and 7.7%, respectively. \u2047 As Will mentioned, we continued to have an attractive pipeline of development projects under way. \u2047 In Atlanta, our Class A, 910,000 square-foot development project is expected to be substantially completed this quarter. \u2047 Atlanta posted record positive absorption in the first quarter of over eight million square feet. \u2047 In the airport South Atlanta submarket where the property is located, led the Metro with over five million square feet of positive absorption. \u2047 We currently estimate our development costs to be approximately $54 million. \u2047 And our stabilized cash yield is estimated to be around 5.25%, which assumes 100% occupancy and payment of our tenant of our core Promote. \u2047 The property is in a prime-location along the I-85, South sub-market of Atlanta and we've been seeing sales trade, at substantial premiums to building costs. \u2047 Today I'll touch on the two development projects that we have begun funding in Central Florida and Indianapolis. \u2047 The Central Florida project is a Class A, 1.1 million square-foot warehouse distribution center, located on a 90-acre site with frontage along I-75 and near our recently purchased Amazon facility. \u2047 The estimated development cost is approximately $81 million. \u2047 Ocala is very well-situated for statewide Florida distribution requirements, located just north of I-75 Florida turnpike's split offering access to Tampa, Orlando and the East and West Coast of Florida as well as more toward Jacksonville and Georgia. \u2047 Our Indianapolis project in Mount Comfort which we began funding subsequent to the quarter, is just 14 miles east of downtown Indianapolis with easy access to I-70. \u2047 Mount Comfort is one of Indianapolis fastest-growing modern logistics sub-markets and offers a very favorable labor profile relative to other competing submarkets. \u2047 The 1.1 million square-foot facility has an estimated cost of roughly $60 million. \u2047 Like our Atlanta development project both projects feature market-leading specs, including 40-foot clear heights, efficient site plans truck court depths, building depth and column spacing and ample trailer and car parking, to meet the demands of e-commerce and other bulk distributors. \u2047 The shell completions are anticipated late in the first and second quarters in 2022, for the Ocala and Mount Comfort projects respectively, both with stabilized cash yields in the mid-5% range. \u2047 We'll continue to provide regular updates on the progress of these projects. \u2047 We generated adjusted company FFO of approximately $64 million or $0.22 per diluted common share in the quarter and adjusted company FFO would have been approximately $0.19 per diluted common share, excluding lease termination income of $10.9 million. \u2047 Revenues during the quarter were $93 million, representing an increase compared to the same time period in 2020, mostly due to new acquisitions and the termination income I just mentioned. \u2047 Property operating expenses were roughly $11 million with approximately 88% attributable to tenant reimbursement. \u2047 First quarter G&A was $8.4 million. \u2047 And we expect our 2021 G&A range, to be $31 million to $33 million. \u2047 Overall, same-store NOI increased 0.6% and would have been approximately 1.7% excluding single-tenant vacancy with our same-store lease portfolio at 97.5%. \u2047 More specifically, industrial same-store NOI increased 1.5% and would have been 2.8% excluding single-tenant vacancy. \u2047 At quarter-end, approximately 88% of our industrial portfolio leases had escalations with an average rate of 2.3%. \u2047 On the capital markets front, we took the opportunity in the first quarter to increase our availability under our ATM program to $350 million. \u2047 Additionally, we entered into forward sales contracts for an aggregate of 3.6 million common shares, which have not yet settled. \u2047 As of March 31, we had 8.6 million common shares unsettled under forward sales contracts which had an aggregate settlement price of $94.5 million. \u2047 As Will mentioned, our balance sheet is in terrific shape with low leverage and ample cash available. \u2047 At quarter-end, we had nothing outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility and unencumbered NOI remains high at 91%. \u2047 In addition, our consolidated debt outstanding was approximately $1.4 billion with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.3% and a weighted average term of 6.7 years. \u2047 "],
