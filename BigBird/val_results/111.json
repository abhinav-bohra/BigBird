{"article": ["Joining us today are Pedro Heilbron, CEO of Copa Holdings; and Jose Montero, our CFO. \u2047 First, Pedro will start by going over our third quarter highlights, followed by Jose, who will discuss our financial results. \u2047 Copa Holdings' financial reports have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. \u2047 In today's call, we will discuss non-IFRS financial measures. \u2047 Many of these are discussed in our annual report filed with the SEC. \u2047 To them, as always, my utmost respect and admiration. \u2047 The increasing vaccination rates and reduced travel restrictions in Latin America are positively affecting air travel demand in the region, enabling us to grow capacity quarter-over-quarter, while improving load factors. \u2047 Since restarting operations in Q3 2020, we have increased flight from almost zero to nearly 70% of our pre-pandemic capacity in Q3 2021. \u2047 Going forward, we expect further relaxation of travel restrictions and a continued demand recovery, which should allow us to deploy additional capacity in the fourth quarter and 2022. \u2047 But of course, COVID has not gone away and we've seen in other parts of the world, additional waves of the virus could affect demand in the future. \u2047 So, we will remain focused and flexible in terms of capacity, adjusting our plans as needed. \u2047 Now, I'll highlight some of our third quarter results. \u2047 In terms of capacity, we reached almost 70% of third quarter 2019 ASMs compared to 48% of 2019 capacity in the second quarter. \u2047 Load factor came in at 79%, an improvement of two percentage points compared to the second quarter on an almost 50% quarter-over-quarter ASM growth. \u2047 Revenues increased by 46% over the previous quarter to $445 million. \u2047 Our ex-fuel CASM decreased from $0.76 in Q2 to $0.62 in Q3, reaching 2019 unit cost levels at 70% of 2019 capacity. \u2047 We reported an operating profit of $59 million and an operating margin of 13.3% in the quarter. \u2047 Excluding a $10.4 million passenger revenue adjustments, that Company would have reported an operating profit of $48.6 million and an operating margin of 11.2%. \u2047 We had a cash buildup of $54 million and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion and a total liquidity of over $1.6 billion. \u2047 On the operational front, the Company delivered an untimed performance of 89.4% and that completion factor of 99.8%, ONCE again among the best in the industry. \u2047 This results a true testament to our employees' continuous commitment to delivering a world-class product to our passengers. \u2047 With regards to our network, we're excited to start our first new destination since the beginning of the pandemic. \u2047 Beginning in December, we will offer service to three new cities, Armenia and Cucuta in Colombia and Atlanta in the US. \u2047 By the end of the year, Copa will provide service to 72 destinations in North, Central, South America, and the Caribbean. \u2047 And we expect to recover service to the rest of our pre-pandemic network during 2022, strengthening our position at the most complete and convenient hub in Latin America. \u2047 During the quarter, we agreed with Boeing to accelerate the delivery of 12 737 MAX 9 that were originally intended to be delivered starting in 2025. \u2047 We will receive two of these aircraft in 2022 for a total of seven MAX 9 deliveries next year and the other 10 aircrafts will be added to Copa's deliveries from 2023 through 2025. \u2047 As to Boeing, during the fourth quarter, it expects to receive two aircrafts from the Copa fleet to end the year with a total of eight 737-800. \u2047 In closing, I'd like to reaffirm that we have a proven and strong business model, which is based on operating the best and most convenient network for inter-Latin America travel from our hub of the America leveraging Panamax advantageous geographic position, with the region's lowest unit cost for a full service carrier, best on-time performance and strongest balance sheet. \u2047 Going forward, the Company expects that at top of the Americas will be an even more valuable source of strategic advantage. \u2047 Hope you're doing well. \u2047 I'd like to join Pedro and acknowledging our great corporate team for all their efforts and great spirit during these many months of the pandemic. \u2047 I will start by going over our third quarter results. \u2047 Our capacity came in at 4.4 billion available seat miles, which amounts to 69% of the capacity operated per quarter of 2019. \u2047 Load factor came in at an average of 79% for the quarter, an increase compared to Q2 while operating 49% more ASMs. We reported a net profit of $8.2 million or $0.19 per share. \u2047 Excluding special items, we would have reported a net profit of $29.9 million or $0.70 per share. \u2047 Special items for the quarter are comprised mainly of an unrealized mark-to-market loss of $32.1 million related to the Company's convertible notes issued in 2020 and $10.4 million in revenues related to unredeemed tickets, which we are not included in our underlying results as they correspond to sales made during 2019 and early in 2020. \u2047 We reported a quarterly operating profit which came in at $59 million. \u2047 Excluding the $10.4 million in unredeemed ticket revenues, we had an adjusted operating profit of $48.6 million for the quarter. \u2047 Our operating margin was 13.3%. \u2047 Excluding the passenger revenue adjustments, we would have reported an operating margin of 11.2%. \u2047 Unit cost excluding fuel were better than in the second quarter at $0.062 per ASM, driven by a quarter-over-quarter capacity growth of 49%. \u2047 We continue with our cost savings initiatives and we are now targeting to achieve the unit cost below $0.06 once we reach above 90% of our pre-COVID-19 capacity. \u2047 During the third quarter, we had a cash buildup of approximately $54 million, driven mainly by increased sales during the period. \u2047 As a reminder, for our cash build of measure, we exclude all extraordinary proceeds from asset sales, but include capex and the payment of our leases and other financial obligations. \u2047 I want to spend some time out discussing the balance sheet and liquidity. \u2047 As of the end of the third quarter, we had assets of close to $4.2 billion and our cash short and long-term investments ended at $1.3 billion. \u2047 We also ended the quarter with an aggregate amount of $345 million in unutilized committed credit facilities, which added to our cash, brought our total liquidity to more than $1.6 billion. \u2047 In terms of debt, we ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in debt and lease liabilities at similar levels to the ones reported for the end of the second quarter. \u2047 Turning now for fleet. \u2047 In July, we finalized the sale and delivery of our last Embraer 190 and during the quarter, we delivered two Boeing 737-700s to their new owner, the end of the third quarter with 87 aircraft; 68 737-800 70%, 13 737 MAX 9s, and six 737-700. \u2047 These figures, we include aircraft currently in temporary storage that we plan to reactivate in the upcoming months. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we expect to receive two more 737 MAX 9s to end the year with a total of 89 aircraft. \u2047 As the remainder of the year, based on the current state of the demand environment and air travel restrictions, we can provide the following outlook for the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 We expect capacity to be approximately 83% of Q4 2019 levels at about 5.1 billion ASMs and we expect our operating margin to be approximately 4%. \u2047 Our Q4 2021 outlook is based on the following assumptions; revenues of approximately 80% of Q4 2019 levels at about $545 million, CASM ex-fuel of approximately $0.61, and oil price of $2.50 per gallon, an increment of approximately 17% quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Given the uncertainty, it is still premature to give a full year 2022 guidance. \u2047 However, for the first half of the year, we preliminarily expect our capacity measuring ASMs to be approximately 92% of the capacity operated during the first half of 2019. \u2047 And with that, we'll open the call to some questions. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname
