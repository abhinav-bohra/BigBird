{"article": ["Today, we will follow our customary format with Tony Petrello, our chairman, president, and chief executive officer; and William Restrepo, our chief financial officer, providing their perspectives on the quarter's results along with insights into our markets and how we expect Nabors to perform in these markets. \u2047 Also during the call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as net debt, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow. \u2047 We have posted to the Investor Relations section of our website a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most recently comparable GAAP measures. \u2047 Before I begin, I would like to express our thoughts and concern for the members of our community who were affected by the severe weather and the related power and water outages. \u2047 Our rig operations in Texas were essentially unaffected. \u2047 Turning to our results, I will begin with overview comments. \u2047 Then I will follow with a discussion of the markets and highlights from the quarter. \u2047 William will discuss our financial results. \u2047 First of all, as we close the books on 2020, I want to recognize the entire Nabors team for its outstanding performance in these extraordinary circumstances. \u2047 Our company's staff confronted the impacts of COVID and the depressed drilling market head on with perseverance and ingenuity. \u2047 Those efforts across all of our segments and functional areas reinforced our leadership in our markets. \u2047 At the same time, we managed to improve our financial strength. \u2047 We are emerging from the pandemic as a stronger company. \u2047 Nabors is well-positioned to capitalize on the upturn. \u2047 Our financial discipline paid off in 2020. \u2047 For the full year, we reduced overhead spending by 24%. \u2047 This effort began in the second quarter. \u2047 Our run rate in the fourth quarter represents nearly 27% drop over the 2019 quarterly average. \u2047 We also made further progress on our twin priorities, namely: generate free cash flow and reduce net debt. \u2047 We began the year at just under $2.9 billion in net debt. \u2047 We delevered by nearly $400 million, fueled, in part, by free cash flow generation of $184 million. \u2047 We ended 2020 with net debt less than $2.5 billion. \u2047 We achieved this in the face of very difficult market conditions. \u2047 Our results demonstrate the earnings power and resiliency of our unique portfolio of premium assets with geographical diversification. \u2047 Notwithstanding the most adverse industry and macro conditions in decades, we maintained our position as the preferred drilling contractor and reset our cost structure. \u2047 Our operational strength has supported our financial performance. \u2047 Outside of North America, we remain the largest and most profitable land drilling contractor. \u2047 And in the Lower 48, we continue to deliver the highest daily gross margins among our peers. \u2047 Based on the strength of our performance drilling offerings and our digital infrastructure, we increased the penetration of innovative drilling contracts. \u2047 These contracts generate incremental margin based on value sharing. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, the combined gross margin from our Lower 48 drilling rigs and our U.S. \u2047 Drilling solutions significantly exceeded those of our peers. \u2047 Our investments in performance, technology, safety, and, importantly, human capital and sustainability, are driving this success. \u2047 We are positioned well for continued growth. \u2047 I am looking forward to reporting further progress in 2021. \u2047 Next, I would like to spend a few moments on the macro environment. \u2047 After briefly testing the upper 30s in late October, the price of near-month WTI increased by 35% through the end of the year. \u2047 Since the beginning of 2021, the price has risen further. \u2047 Recently, WTI was trading above $61. \u2047 Brent, which is also important to our global client base, made a similar move. \u2047 It was recently priced above $64. \u2047 Global oil demand continued to recover in the fourth quarter. \u2047 The EIA reports consumption increased by more than 2% versus the third quarter. \u2047 In part, this contributed to a global inventory draw of over 200 million barrels. \u2047 In early January, the OPEC+ group agreed to keep its production essentially flat. \u2047 That announcement was followed almost immediately by Saudi Arabia's reported reduction in output. \u2047 The resulting higher prices, which I detailed earlier, are generally supportive of increased oilfield activity across all markets. \u2047 Comparing the fourth quarter and third-quarter averages, the Baker Hughes Lower 48 land rig count increased by 23%. \u2047 Our own working rig count increased by a similar percentage as we added rigs with several customers. \u2047 These additions more than offset the reduction of our rigs stacked on rate. \u2047 From the beginning of the fourth quarter through the end, the Anvers Lower 48 rig count increased by nearly 30%. \u2047 The growth rate among larger clients was approximately equal to the growth in the smaller operators. \u2047 It should be noted that more than half of the increase among the larger operators was driven by a single client, and most of that client's increase was the reactivation of just one drilling contractors rigs, which were stacked on rate. \u2047 Once again, we surveyed the largest Lower 48 clients. \u2047 This group accounts for approximately 35% of the working rig count. \u2047 Our review of these clients shows a modest pickup in activity planned for the balance of 2021. \u2047 It is the smaller and medium-sized operators which appear more responsive to the recent strength in commodity prices. \u2047 In our international markets, we have recently started to see demand increase in selective geographies as measured by the number of active rigs. \u2047 This trend extends across major markets in Latin America and in Saudi Arabia. \u2047 To summarize our view of the markets, global oil demand continues to rebound from the pandemic low. \u2047 Oil inventories, which expanded considerably in early 2020, are dropping. \u2047 The resulting increase in commodity prices has improved operator economics. \u2047 We see the response in the recent growth in rig count. \u2047 Overall, assuming the worst of the pandemic is behind us, the market environment is poised to support higher levels of activity. \u2047 Now, I will comment on our fourth-quarter results. \u2047 Total adjusted EBITDA was $108 million in the quarter. \u2047 These results reflect activity, which was somewhat better than anticipated. \u2047 Our Lower 48 operation and our International and Drilling Solutions segments exceeded our expectations. \u2047 With this adjusted EBITDA performance, we generated approximately $66 million in free cash flow after funding $41 million in capital spending. \u2047 Our global rig count for the fourth quarter was essentially stable at 131 rigs. \u2047 Growth in the Lower 48 in Canada largely offset the decline in international. \u2047 In our Lower 48 business, our reported daily rig margin of $9,541 exceeded our guidance and remained in line with the third quarter. \u2047 For the International segment, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was higher than our expectations. \u2047 Daily margin outperformed, driven mainly by strong operational performance in Saudi Arabia and by revenue from early terminations. \u2047 These items more than offset the decline in rig count. \u2047 Our industry-leading fleet capabilities, outstanding operational and safety performance, and expense and capex discipline all drove this accomplishment. \u2047 Next, I would like to mention some specific highlights for the quarter. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we completed a series of debt exchange transactions. \u2047 In the aggregate, these reduced our outstanding debt obligations by $284 million. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA in our Drilling Solutions segment increased sequentially by 44%. \u2047 The adjusted EBITDA margin in NDS widened to 32% in the fourth quarter. \u2047 This compares very favorably to 24% margins in the prior quarter. \u2047 In NDS, we increased the penetration of our RigCLOUD platform for digital operations. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, RigCLOUD was running on nearly all of our working rigs in the Lower 48. \u2047 We are now in the early stage of growing on third-party rigs. \u2047 We saw continued growth in our SmartSLIDE and SmartNAV apps. \u2047 SmartSLIDE is our directional steering control system, which automates slide drilling. \u2047 SmartNAV is our automated directional guidance system. \u2047 Our cumulative footage growth for these apps working together increased by 11% in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our cumulative well count was up by 12%. \u2047 Our portfolio of automation applications in NDS is second to none in terms of capabilities. \u2047 We developed these products around our SmartROS or rig operating system. \u2047 SmartROS was conceived from the ground up to collaborate with customer workflows while optimizing rig operations. \u2047 We believe we now have the broadest, most advanced, and most profitable automation solutions in the market today. \u2047 Our focus on ESG is increasingly reflected in our ISS ESG quality scores. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, our ISS environmental score improved significantly, and the ISS social score improved again. \u2047 We continue to reinforce our commitment to ESG, and I look forward to reporting on that progress. \u2047 More recently, Nabors has signed on to the science-based targets initiative. \u2047 We have committed to setting Science-based GHG emissions targets. \u2047 We are the only land drilling contractor to do so. \u2047 The use of alternative power on our rigs is an excellent illustration of our efforts in ESG. \u2047 I will cover this topic in more detail in a few moments. \u2047 In addition to these highlights, I would like to discuss one of our smart apps in particular. \u2047 Back in the second quarter of 2020, we released an improved version of SmartDRILL, our automated drilling software. \u2047 SmartDRILL digitizes an operators' well plan with optimal task sequences as defined with the operator. \u2047 Essentially, it executes virtually every task that the driller performs from the chair, and it compiles automated sequences of those tasks. \u2047 It is the only automated drilling solution in the market that enables ad hoc changes to the sequence. \u2047 By digitizing best practices, SmartDRILL improves consistency and reduces the potential for human error. \u2047 For example, we are able to minimize the risk of damage and reduce loss time. \u2047 Tangible benefits of SmartDRILL include an increase in single run laterals, a decrease in unplanned trips, and improved and consistent connection times. \u2047 We are excited about SmartDRILL. \u2047 Our pricing models for this app reflect the measurable value that it generates for customers. \u2047 I look forward to reporting on its progress and on other apps in our portfolio in the future. \u2047 I will also make some comments on Nabors's positioning in the energy transition. \u2047 Our plan as we embark on the transition consist of two parallel tracks. \u2047 Most immediately, we are examining alternatives to improve Nabors's own carbon footprint. \u2047 We actually started down this track several years ago when we introduced the fuel tool. \u2047 Fuel tool is a system that monitors and optimizes rig engine usage. \u2047 It was targeted to reduce fuel consumption. \u2047 Now, we are evaluating technologies aimed at carbon capture, emissions minimization, and power management. \u2047 We have an inventory of 40 dual fuel packages to satisfy market needs in the Lower 48. \u2047 Approximately 15% of our operating rigs in the Lower 48 are currently running on either high-line power or bi-fuel. \u2047 In addition, we have introduced our advanced energy management system on one of our rigs. \u2047 This system yields a significant improvement in the rig's carbon footprint. \u2047 We are also running 12 rigs in Canada with bi-fuel capability. \u2047 Globally, I expect the use of these technologies to increase in the future. \u2047 The parallel track includes opportunities which are relevant beyond our rig fleet. \u2047 These prospects could include other drillers' rigs or scale beyond the traditional markets in the oil field. \u2047 Our energy transition initiatives are still in the early stages. \u2047 We expect to make tangible progress going forward. \u2047 I look forward to reporting further on this area. \u2047 Before turning the call over to William, I will discuss our view of the market in some more detail. \u2047 The Lower 48 industry has added 151 rigs or 67% since its low in August. \u2047 Looking forward, we see the current commodity price environment supporting increased activity as the year progresses. \u2047 We expect our own rig count to increase each quarter throughout the year. \u2047 We are also starting to see some modest improvements in spot-day rates. \u2047 In our international markets, since the third quarter, we have seen our own activity increase further in Latin America. \u2047 Our working rig count in the region rose more than 50% during the quarter. \u2047 Accordingly, versus the fourth quarter of 2019, pre-pandemic, we have gained significant market share in both Argentina and Colombia. \u2047 In addition, several customers in Latin America with temporary COVID pricing adjustments have returned to full-day rates. \u2047 Notwithstanding the macro challenges, the operation in Saudi Arabia performed exceedingly well. \u2047 In addition, the expected rig restarts in the Kingdom have begun. \u2047 Since the beginning of the year, eight of the idle rigs have returned to work. \u2047 Our working rig count in Saudi Arabia now stands at 38. \u2047 This leaves five expected to return over the next 12 months. \u2047 These reactivations are consistent with the expectations we laid out last quarter. \u2047 I would like to take a moment here to express our appreciation to our SANAD CEO and the members of the SANAD board, especially the directors from Saudi Aramco. \u2047 The Aramco board members have been tireless in supporting the management team in delivering best-in-class operational performance. \u2047 That concludes my remarks on our fourth-quarter results highlights in the market. \u2047 I wish to reiterate that our primary concern remains the health and well-being of the extended Nabors community. \u2047 On behalf of the company, we extend our heartfelt thoughts to those affected by the pandemic. \u2047 The net loss from continuing operations of $112 million in the fourth quarter represented a loss of $16.46 per share. \u2047 The fourth quarter included $162 million of pre-tax gains from debt exchanges and repurchases, partially offset by charges of $71 million, mainly from asset impairments, for a net after-tax gain of $52 million. \u2047 Fourth-quarter results compared to a loss of $161 million or $23.42 per share in the third quarter. \u2047 The third quarter included net after-tax gains of $6 million related to gains from debt repurchases, asset impairments, and severance costs. \u2047 Revenue from operations for the fourth quarter was $443 million, a sequential gain of 1%. \u2047 Revenue improved in most segments, with only international and rig tech partially offsetting those increases. \u2047 In the Lower 48, despite some deterioration in the average pricing for our fleet, drilling revenue of $103 million increased by $6.9 million or 7% as our rig count improved by 11%. \u2047 Lower 48 rig count at 53.6 was up sequentially by 5.4 rigs, which is 2.4 rigs more than we had anticipated. \u2047 Daily rig revenue in the Lower 48 at $20,950 decreased by about $800 as we continue to"], "gold_summary": ["q4 loss per share $16.46 from continuing operations.  \u2047  q4 revenue $443 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $418.4 million."], "pred_summary":
