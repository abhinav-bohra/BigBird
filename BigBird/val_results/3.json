{"article": ["Also joining me on the call today are Rick Muncrief, our president, and CEO; Clay Gaspar, our chief operating officer; Jeff Ritenour, our chief financial officer; and a few other members of our senior management team. \u2047 We appreciate everyone taking the time to join us on the call today. \u2047 For Devon Energy, 2021, as a transformational year that can best be defined by our willingness to be a first mover and pursue bold strategic consolidation. \u2047 Our operational excellence and unyielding commitment to capital discipline, and the groundbreaking deployment of our industry-leading cash return business model, underpinned by our fixed plus variable dividend. \u2047 This transaction was perfectly timed at the very bottom of the cycle and set the groundwork for Devon's significant value creation during the year. \u2047 With this Advantage platform, we executed on her Delaware focused operating plan and captured cost synergies that resulted in $600 million of annual cash flow improvements. \u2047 These margin expansion efforts, combined with a disciplined capital allocation framework that prioritize value over volumes, resulted in Devon generating the highest level of free cash flow in our prestigious 50-year history. \u2047 With this powerful stream of free cash flow, we delivered on exactly what our shareholder-friendly business model was designed for, and that is to leave the industry in cash returns. \u2047 As you can see on the graphic, we rewarded shareholders with outsized dividends, opportunistic share buybacks, and we took meaningful steps to strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. \u2047 This disciplined execution was rewarded by the market, with our share price achieving the highest return of any stock in the entire S&P 500 index during 2021. \u2047 I am so very proud of what we accomplished, and I want to extend my sincerest gratitude to everyone involved. \u2047 Our team comprehensively executed on the tenets of our strategy while responsibly providing our nation with a low-cost and reliable energy source, that is the lifeblood of our a modern economy. \u2047 Now turning to slide six, while 2021 was a record-setting year for Devon, the setup for 2022 is even better. \u2047 With the operational momentum we've established, we have designed a capital program to efficiently sustain production at a ultra-low WTI breakeven funding level of around $30 a barrel. \u2047 Combined with the full benefit of merger-related costs synergies and a vastly improved hedge book, we're positioned to deliver free cash flow growth of more than 70% compared to 2021. \u2047 As you can see on the graph, the strong outlook translates into a free cash flow yield of 14%, assuming an $85 WTI price. \u2047 Play will run through the details of our operating plan later but simply put, we expect 2022 to be another great year for Devon. \u2047 Turning your attention to slide seven, with this significant stream of free cash flow, the top priority for our free cash flow is the funding of our fixed plus variable dividend. \u2047 This cash return strategy is a staple of our capital allocation process, allowing us to return meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash to shareholders across a variety of market conditions. \u2047 With this differentiated framework, we've increased Devon's dividend payout for five consecutive quarters, and in aggregate, we paid out $1.3 billion of dividends in 2021, which is a per share increase of roughly two times that of 2020. \u2047 Importantly, we expect our dividend growth story to only strengthen in 2022. \u2047 As you can see on the bar chart, we're on pace to essentially double our dividend again in the upcoming year, which equates to around 8%. \u2047 I would like to highlight that this attractive yield includes a substantial increase to our fixed dividend that we announced last night. \u2047 There's 45% increase in the fixed dividend reflects the confidence we have in our underlying business and financial performance as we head into 2022. \u2047 Now Slide nine, I want to briefly showcase how our unique dividend policy offers a quite compelling alternative for yield-seeking investors. \u2047 To demonstrate this point, we've included a simple comparison of our estimated dividend yield in 2022 compared to other commonly referenced yields in financial markets. \u2047 As you can see, Devon's yield of 8% is approximately six times higher than the S&P 500 index, and well in excess of the prevailing interest rate you can get from a 10-year treasury. \u2047 On Slide 10, in addition to our market-leading dividend payout, we're also excited to announce that we are increasing our share repurchase authorization by 60% to $1.6 billion. \u2047 At a multiple of less than five times cash flow, we believe our business trades at a substantial discount to the intrinsic value, especially given the structural improvements we've made to expand margins and returns. \u2047 Given this favorable setup, we put our money where our mouth is by aggressively repurchasing $589 million of shares just in the fourth quarter alone. \u2047 With the board expanding the capacity of our repurchase program, we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock throughout the upcoming year. \u2047 And lastly, the diagram on Slide 12, I believe, does a great job of summarizing what we've created here at Devon. \u2047 We've assembled a high-quality asset portfolio, and a team that has worked incredibly hard to deliver on our commitment to expand margins, and deliver growth, and free cash flow, accelerate our cash returns with our market leading dividend payout, enhance per share growth with opportunistic buybacks, and take consistent and meaningful steps to further enhance our financial strength. \u2047 While 2021 was a record year, we're only getting started. \u2047 At Devon, we have the right mix of assets, proven management, the right team, and a shareholder-friendly business model designed to continue to lead the energy industry and capital discipline, and cash returns. \u2047 And with that, I'll now turn it to Clay for the call to continue and provide an overview of our recent operational results and upcoming capital plan. \u2047 As Rick touched on, 2021 was a pivotal year for Devon, that demonstrated the power of our asset portfolio and the capabilities of our talented organization. \u2047 Across the portfolio, our team delivered results that exceeded production and capital efficiency targets, while continuing to drive down per-unit operating costs and improving margins. \u2047 Results matter, and while I don't take any of these accomplishments lightly, I'm equally proud of the way that we were able to accomplish these financial metrics. \u2047 Overcoming the challenges of the merger, pandemic, and supply chain issues we built a unified culture took many best practices from both legacy companies, and we're now poised for further leverage of those collective wins. \u2047 The first key point that is there is no change to the upstream capital budget of $1.9 to $2.2 billion as we disclosed last quarter. \u2047 While inflation is an absolute reality, our teams have done a good job of working with our service companies, mitigating escalations where we can, and quantifying the remaining impact or forecast. \u2047 The great thing about a cyclical business is that if you're paying attention, you should have a pretty good idea of what the most critical thing is to focus on in anticipation of the next phase. \u2047 At this point in the cycle, we're focused on listening to our service company partners and helping them help us be successful. \u2047 In this very tight supply chain market, the key phrase we hear is predictable and reliable. \u2047 You'll notice that our 22 program looks quite a bit like our 21 program. \u2047 This is what has allowed us to telegraph to our service companies, midstream partners, and other key stakeholders to expect more of the same. \u2047 That predictability allows them to plan their own supply chain work, and the reliability allows them to know that we're going to do what we say we're going to do. \u2047 Relationships are one of our core values at Devon, and this listening and working with our critical partners is an example of that value in action. \u2047 The relatively steady level of activity in 22 is projected to sustain our production throughout the year, ranging from 570,000 to 600,000 Boe per day. \u2047 During 2021, we had great success with our capital program that resulted in production growth rate of 34% compared to our first quarter 21. \u2047 It's high margin growth was driven by consistent execution and outstanding well productivity that was headlined by several memorable projects such as Danger Noodle, Boundary Raider, and Fiscal Cobra, to name a few. \u2047 Each of these prolific projects eclipse 30-day rates of more than 5,000 Boe per day on a plural basis, exhibiting the world class reservoir potential that resides in the Delaware Basin. \u2047 It's important to note, the strong volume performance in 2021 was paired with excellent capital efficiency and substantial additions to our approved reserves. \u2047 While I would never point to a single year of reserves booking as the measure of success with consistent and reasonable conservative booking processes, which we have, it can provide insight into the quality of the underlying assets. \u2047 At year-end, our proved reserves in the Delaware increased 18% on a Pro Forma basis, and these reserve additions replaced more than 200% of what we produce during the year. \u2047 I find it especially impressive that our team added these reserves and an ultra-low F&D cost of only $5 per Boe. \u2047 This result is just another example how advantaged and sustainable our resources in the Delaware Basin. \u2047 Turning your attention to the map on the right, you can expect more of the same for us in 2022. \u2047 You have a great slate of projects lined up to execute on, and once again, most of our program will consist of the high impact opportunities focused on developing Upper Wolfcamp and Bone Spring Zones, and to a lesser degree, the wolf is going to be Avalon targets as well. \u2047 To execute on this plan, we expect to run 14 rigs in 4[inaudible] during the year. \u2047 This capital activity will be diversified across our acreage footprint with sweet spots in Southern Lea and Eddy County, and state line receiving most of the funding. \u2047 Not only with this level of activity continuing to grow Delaware production in 22, but the benefits of our operating scale and best practices from the merger integration, we are well-positioned to continue to improve our execution capabilities. \u2047 As you can see on the slide, with the efficiencies captured in the Delaware, the team has essentially doubled the productivity of our rig and frac equipment compared to just a few years ago. \u2047 The operational improvements have also meaningfully reduced our cost over time to about $550 per lateral foot in 2021, which competes very well with anyone out there. \u2047 As I look ahead to 22, I expect our operational performance to continue to improve. \u2047 Our team consistently is identifying new ways to leverage technology, operational breakthroughs, and industry best practices. \u2047 Inflationary pressure and supply chain disruptions are reality. \u2047 Based on today's industry activity and commodity price projections, we've baked in around 15% higher costs than we saw in 2021. \u2047 We have been, and continue to be focused on consistency, planning, and staying out in front ahead of these in reacting to any unforeseen issues. \u2047 This work will be even more critical as the market continues to tighten. \u2047 On Slide 17, the next area I want to showcase is the momentum we're building in the Anadarko Basin, where we have a concentrated 300,000 net acre position in the liquids rig window of the play. \u2047 With the benefits of our $100 billion Dow JV Kerry, we drilled over 30 wells in 2021 and commenced the first production on 16 of those wells during the year. \u2047 As you can see on the charts, on the right, the initial capital efficiency is excellent. \u2047 With the benefit of state-of-the-art completion designs, and appropriately up spaced developments, per well capital cost of decrease by 25% versus legacy activity and well productivity to date has exceeded the type curve expectations by 35%. \u2047 With the strong execution, the carried returns we're seeing from this activity will compete for capital with any asset in our portfolio. \u2047 Given the success, we've elected to step up activity in the Anadarko Basin to 3 rigs and 22. \u2047 This program will result in around 40 new wells coming online in 2022, allowing us to maintain steady production profile throughout the year and harvest significant amounts of free cash flow. \u2047 Collectively, these assets generated more than a billion dollars of free cash flow in 2021, and we're on pace to produce a similar amount of free cash flow in 22. \u2047 We also remain some of the best returns in our portfolio. \u2047 The team has continued to unlock additional locations and has leveraged company best practices to significantly improve our ESG footprint. \u2047 Our Eagle Ford Asset continues to deliver solid returns. \u2047 The team is doing some very exciting work to unlock additional locations and a very significant refract potential. \u2047 The Powder, is a basin with the most upside yet to unlock. \u2047 Our team is making great progress in that regard by driving laterals longer to three miles and rebooting the stimulation design, we're seeing very encouraging results. \u2047 I'm proud of what these assets are delivering, and I appreciate the team's hard work and effort that goes into fulfilling this important role within our portfolio. \u2047 As many of you are aware, we set aggressive emissions reductions targets last year that covered a myriad of near, mid, and long-term priorities. \u2047 In addition, to ensure our organizational alignment, we directly tied progress on these targets to our annual compensation program. \u2047 We've also dedicated a board committee to engage in our ESG goal-setting process, performance, and reporting. \u2047 Since the announcement of these environmental targets, we've taken immediate action and delivered results. \u2047 We do not have finalized figures yet for this past year, but I can tell you our scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions will improve roughly by 20% in 2021 versus our 19 baseline, well ahead of that, stated the stated goals from this past summer. \u2047 Two of the key successes on reducing overall emissions is reducing methane emissions, and reducing flaring. \u2047 In 2020, we reduced methane emissions by 47% and we reduce flaring by 33%. \u2047 I expect this positive rate of change to continue. \u2047 Looking specifically at 22, we have many visible catalysts that will drive important results, such as advancing advancements and leak detection technologies, improved facility design, facility retrofits, wide-scale deployment of air-driven pneumatic controllers, and electrification of select field operations. \u2047 I believe that it's also important to point out that these efforts are focused on changes that will not only improve our ESG metrics, but will also improve our overall operations. \u2047 By focusing on these operational wins, we further align our organizational focus and excitement around ESG improvement. \u2047 My comments today will be focused on the key drivers of our financial results in 2021, and also provide some insights into our 2022 outlook. \u2047 Beginning with production, our total volumes in the fourth quarter averaged 611,000 Boe per day, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly adjusted core earnings per share $1.39.  \u2047  devon \u2047 s total production averaged
