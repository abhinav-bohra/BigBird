{"article": ["Factors, to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. \u2047 On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. \u2047 These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory findings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. \u2047 Today, we reported results of another very strong quarter. \u2047 Ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year and sales increased more than 22% on an organic basis. \u2047 Excluding COVID testing-related sales, which totaled $1.9 billion in the quarter, organic sales increased 12% versus last year. \u2047 As we've seen since the start of the pandemic, our diversified mix of healthcare businesses continues to prove highly resilient. \u2047 Even as COVID case rates surged in the US and other geographies during the third quarter, strong growth in our more consumer-facing businesses, nutritionals, established pharmaceuticals and diabetes care, mitigated the modest impacts we saw from the surges in certain areas of our hospital base businesses. \u2047 This has been a consistent theme throughout the pandemic, as evidenced by an increase in total company sales, excluding COVID tests, of 11% on an organic basis through the first nine months of this year compared to our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, which highlights that our growth is real and not simply a function of easy comps versus last year. \u2047 As a result of our strong performance and outlook, today, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range now at $5 to $5.10, which reflects nearly 40% growth compared to last year. \u2047 I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. \u2047 And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9% compared to last year. \u2047 Strong growth in the quarter was led by US pediatric and international adult nutrition. \u2047 In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew over 8.5% in the quarter, led by strong growth in the US from continued share gains in our infant formula and toddler portfolio. \u2047 Sales of Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand, once again grew strong double-digits, driven by market uptake of several recently launched new products as well as investments we're making in direct consumer promotion. \u2047 In Adult Nutrition, sales grew over 9% in the quarter, including mid-teens growth internationally, as we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands, including new users entering these categories and existing customers increasing their usage. \u2047 Sales increased more than 45% overall and 12.5%, excluding COVID testing-related sales. \u2047 During the quarter, as the Delta variant spread and COVID cases surged, particularly in the US, demand for testing increased significantly, most notably for rapid tests. \u2047 In total, during the quarter, we sold more than 225 million COVID tests globally and have now shipped over 1 billion tests since the start of the pandemic. \u2047 Over the of last several months, we've learned that COVID vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus. \u2047 Testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable, and easy to use, is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. \u2047 Abbott has established a global leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month. \u2047 Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew more than 15%, driven by strong execution and a steady cadence of new product introductions. \u2047 Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in China, Russia and India, which led to overall sales growth of 18% in our key emerging markets. \u2047 And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 13% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 16% compared to pre-pandemic sales in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Rhythm Management, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care. \u2047 In Structural Heart, we continued to enhance our portfolio in large, fast growing markets with the recent US FDA approvals of Amulet, which closes the left atrial appendage in the heart to help reduce the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation and Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. \u2047 In Heart Failure, we announced results from the GUIDE-HF trial of our CardioMEMS System. \u2047 As with many other recent and ongoing clinical trials across the healthcare industry, a portion of the CardioMEMS trial overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 After adjusting for this impact, CardioMEMS demonstrated a 28% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. \u2047 And we filed with the US FDA for label expansion based on the trial data in the middle of this year. \u2047 During the quarter, we also added an attractive growth platform to our vascular device portfolio with the acquisition of Walk Vascular, a commercial stage company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system called JETi that removes peripheral blood clots. \u2047 Peripheral thrombectomy is a large high growth area where we can leverage our existing commercial presence. \u2047 And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of nearly $1 billion. \u2047 During the quarter, we added over 200,000 new users, bringing the total global user base for Libre to well over 3.5 million users. \u2047 So in summary, we continued to achieve strong well-balanced growth across all of our major businesses, which is being fueled by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products. \u2047 COVID testing, particularly COVID testing, remains an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics and Abbott has established a strong leadership position in this area. \u2047 And based on the strength of our performance and outlook, we're raising our earnings per share guidance for the year, which now reflects growth of nearly 40% compared to last year. \u2047 I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. \u2047 Turning to our results. \u2047 Sales for the third quarter increased 22.4% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, you along with global COVID testing-related sales of $1.9 billion in the quarter. \u2047 Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1% on third quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 23.4% in the quarter. \u2047 Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25% of sales. \u2047 Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15.5%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15%. \u2047 The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. \u2047 Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. \u2047 We forecast $1 billion to $1.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales and forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, in the low double-digits versus last year. \u2047 And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around one-half of 1% on our fourth quarter reported sales. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["abbott sold more than 225 mln covid-19 tests globally in q3.  \u2047  compname says company sold more
