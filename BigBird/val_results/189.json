{"article": ["These reports, when filed, are available on the UPS investor relations website and from the SEC. \u2047 For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP results included after-tax transformation and other charges of $54 million or $0.06 per diluted share. \u2047 Unless stated otherwise, our comments will refer to adjusted results, which exclude transformation and other charges. \u2047 In the 17 months that I've been CEO, I've learned that no matter what comes our way, UPSers deliver. \u2047 But through it all, UPSers leverage the flexibility of our integrated network and the technology that powers it to deliver what matters. \u2047 A little over one year ago, we laid out our better, not bigger framework under a customer-first, people-led, innovation-driven strategy. \u2047 Inside that strategic framework is a focus on three main areas. \u2047 First is to improve revenue quality, including growing SMB volume. \u2047 Second is to reduce our cost to serve through productivity and cost takeout initiatives. \u2047 And third is to effectively allocate capital to create a better customer experience, happier UPSers, and higher returns on the capital we deploy. \u2047 While it is early in the execution of our strategy, the progress we are making is clearly visible in our results. \u2047 Looking at the third quarter, our performance was better than we anticipated. \u2047 Consolidated revenue rose 9.2% from last year to $23.2 billion, driven by another quarter of improved revenue quality across all three of our operating segments. \u2047 Consolidated operating profit grew 23.4% to $3 billion, driven by solid revenue growth and strong expense control. \u2047 Each of our segments delivered year-over-year operating profit improvement and double-digit operating margins. \u2047 And for the first nine months of 2021, UPS has generated more operating profit than any full year in our history. \u2047 Brian will share the details of our performance shortly. \u2047 As we've discussed, we are laser-focused on adding capabilities that enable UPS to grow with SMBs. \u2047 These improvements also benefit large customers that value our end-to-end network. \u2047 Expanded weekend delivery services is one of our new capabilities. \u2047 This initiative will be completed in the U.S. as planned by the end of this week. \u2047 We will now cover about 90% of the U.S. population on Saturday for both residential and commercial pickups and deliveries. \u2047 In addition, expanded Saturday services provides more capacity for Sunday SurePost delivery. \u2047 The best part of our weekend delivery program is that we've unlocked additional network capacity that benefits all customers without deploying additional capital. \u2047 And we've done this while expanding our U.S. operating margin on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 As we look at our third-quarter results, we see that SMBs value the new capabilities we are providing. \u2047 In the U.S., SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9% year over year. \u2047 In fact, we've seen strong growth here for the past six quarters. \u2047 volume, up 380 basis points from one year ago. \u2047 And outside the U.S., SMB average daily volume growth was 3.9%. \u2047 We see many opportunities to grow our international SMB volume as we continue to improve our digital experiences and roll out DAP, our Digital Access Program, to customers outside of the U.S. Let me also touch on SMBs and healthcare. \u2047 When COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out late last year, the world turned to UPS, and we were ready with connected capabilities, technology, and expertise. \u2047 Our brand relevance here is attracting new SMB healthcare customers and significantly driving profit growth in this sector. \u2047 And just on COVID-19 vaccines, we are on track to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses by the end of this year with 99.9% on-time delivery. \u2047 We are relentlessly focused on reducing our cost to serve, and we're making good progress. \u2047 While Brian will go through the details, I'll call out a few highlights. \u2047 In the U.S. we drove a measurable improvement in productivity as PPH, or pieces per hour, increased by 2.5%. \u2047 Additionally, as Nando described at our June Investor Day, through our ongoing efforts to optimize loads in our trailers, cube utilization in the third quarter was up 520 basis points versus last year. \u2047 This helped us eliminate more than 10% of daily trailer loads year over year. \u2047 And as we've discussed previously, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. \u2047 So to reduce turnover and improve productivity, we are converting around 1,000 part-time supervisor positions in our operations into nearly 400 full-time positions at no additional cost to our company. \u2047 Turning to what we refer to as Transformation 2.0 or plans to optimize our nonoperating expense. \u2047 We are on track to eliminate $500 million in nonoperating costs this year, with about $500 million of additional opportunity in 2022. \u2047 Finally, our third area of focus is disciplined capital allocation. \u2047 Since we began executing our strategy, we've seen marked improvement in our employee satisfaction and competitive Net Promoter Scores, due in part to how we've allocated capital to enhance the employee and customer experience. \u2047 In October, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform that also provides delivery services for packages that don't lend themselves to our small package network. \u2047 We continue to be disciplined in our capital spending practices. \u2047 This discipline, plus record earnings, yield a significant amount of cash. \u2047 So far this year, we've generated a record $9.3 billion in free cash flow. \u2047 And we expect full-year 2021 return on invested capital to be around 29%, which is a 730-basis-point improvement from what we reported at the end of last year. \u2047 Turning to the fourth quarter. \u2047 The global supply chain market is challenging. \u2047 There are capacity, congestion, and cost concerns. \u2047 But for UPS, our outlook is positive as, once we get a package, we get it delivered. \u2047 Outside of the U.S., where we peak, we are ready, and tight capacity benefits our freight forwarding business. \u2047 In the U.S., we project a robust peak season, and through our planning efforts, we believe we are well on our way to deliver a peak that will be a win for UPS shippers, recipients, and share owners. \u2047 Let me share a few details. \u2047 To begin with, the calendar is helpful as we have one more peak operating day than last year. \u2047 Further, we've expanded weekend delivery and added additional sorting capacity. \u2047 Nonetheless, we expect consumer demand will outpace capacity in the market. \u2047 We began collaborating with our largest customer several months ago, and we'll stay in close contact with them during the holiday shipping season. \u2047 Our technology allows us to match daily capacity with customer demand. \u2047 And where we need to, we will again control the amount of volume that enters our network. \u2047 These actions will minimize chaos costs and enable high service levels. \u2047 On the labor front, we've digitized and simplified our job application process. \u2047 enabling qualified applicants to receive a job offer within 30 minutes of applying. \u2047 In parts of the country, labor costs are higher than they were last year, but we are effectively managing through that cost pressure. \u2047 When you add it up, in the fourth quarter, we expect to generate record consolidated operating profit and expand operating margin year over year. \u2047 While we are laser-focused on peak, our business doesn't end on December 31st. \u2047 Later this week, we will release our U.S. general rate increase. \u2047 The 2022 increase will be 5.9%, reflecting the value of the services we offer and cost inflation pressures. \u2047 The details will be posted to ups.com. \u2047 As we move ahead, we will continue to execute by leveraging our global Smart Logistics Network, our amazing UPSers, and a strategy that's driving strong financial results today and positions us well for the future. \u2047 In my comments today, I will cover four areas, starting with a macro overview, then our third-quarter results. \u2047 Next, I'll review cash and shareowner returns. \u2047 And lastly, I'll wrap up with some comments on our outlook for the full year. \u2047 Let's start with the macro. \u2047 In the third quarter, the global economy continued its strong growth despite the dampening effects of COVID-19 and inflation, along with shortages in inventory and labor. \u2047 Within this backdrop, demand for our services remained high and the pricing environment in the industry was firm. \u2047 We expect similar dynamics in the fourth quarter, and as we demonstrated in the third, we will continue to execute our strategy and capture profitable growth opportunities in the market. \u2047 IHS is forecasting fourth-quarter global GDP will grow 3.8% and U.S. GDP is expected to grow 4.9%, which remain above historic GDP growth rates. \u2047 Moving to our third-quarter consolidated performance. \u2047 The progress we've made to improve revenue quality enhance productivity and allocate capital is driving strong top and bottom line results. \u2047 Consolidated revenue increased 9.2% to $23.2 billion. \u2047 Consolidated operating profit totaled $3 billion, 23.4% higher than last year. \u2047 All three segments generated record third-quarter operating profit and achieved double-digit operating margins in the quarter. \u2047 Consolidated operating margin expanded to 12.8%, which was 150 basis points above last year, and diluted earnings per share was $2.71, and up 18.9% from the same period last year. \u2047 Now let's take a look at the segments. \u2047 Our results in U.S. domestic were better than we anticipated principally due to higher than planned for improvements in revenue per piece and productivity gains. \u2047 As we expected, average daily volume in the U.S. was down 540,000 pieces or 2.7% due to a decline in SurePost of 576,000 packages per day. \u2047 This decline was partially offset by growth in ground commercial volume. \u2047 Our results reflect the continued execution of our strategy to win in the most attractive parts of the market. \u2047 In fact, customer mix continued to be positive as higher-yielding SMB average daily volume, including platforms, was up 10.9%. \u2047 And in the third quarter, SMBs made up 27.4% of U.S. domestic volume, compared to 23.6% last year. \u2047 Regarding our delivery mix, our commercial business continued to recover and grew 6.8%, representing 42% of our volume in the third quarter, compared to 39% in the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Nearly all industry sectors grew B2B average daily volume, including retail and high tech. \u2047 For the quarter, U.S. domestic generated revenue of $14.2 billion, up 7.4%, driven by a 12% increase in revenue per piece with fuel driving 270 basis points of the revenue per piece growth rate. \u2047 Total expense grew 5.8% and with fuel driving 180 basis points of the year-over-year expense growth rate. \u2047 Through our focus on productivity, overall improvements, led by our inside sort operations and on-road activities, helped offset the market rate adjustments we implemented in certain geographies, as well as the cost of expanding Saturday delivery. \u2047 And as Carol mentioned, a key measure of UPS productivity is pieces per hour. \u2047 And in the third quarter, we made improvements in nearly every area of our operations, led by preload, which improved by 6.5%. \u2047 Combined, these improvements contributed to a decrease in direct labor hours per day of 5.1%. \u2047 In summary, revenue growth was above expense growth, which generated positive operating leverage. \u2047 The U.S. Domestic segment delivered $1.4 billion in operating profit, an increase of $281 million or 24.8% compared to last year, and operating margin expanded 140 basis points. \u2047 The segment continues to generate strong profit growth, driven by the execution of our strategy. \u2047 Due to tough year-over-year comparisons and some supply chain disruptions, growth in average daily volume moderated in the third quarter and was up 1.9%. \u2047 B2B average daily volume grew 3.8% on a year-over-year basis and offset a decline in B2C volume, which was down 2.3%. \u2047 On a two-year stack, total average daily volume was up 14%. \u2047 Total export average daily volume was up 1.3% on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Export growth in Europe and the Americas offset a 4.8% decrease in export average daily volume out of Asia. \u2047 The decline in Asia was due to difficult comps from a year ago and the implementation of network contingency plans in response to COVID-19 protocols at select airports. \u2047 Relative to our plan, we had 137 fewer flights out of Asia than we anticipated. \u2047 For the quarter, international revenue was up 15.5% to $4.7 billion with strong growth across all regions. \u2047 Revenue per piece was up 14%, including a 500 basis point benefit from fuel. \u2047 Revenue quality improved on a year-over-year basis as we continue to utilize surcharges to match demand with available capacity. \u2047 In the third quarter, international delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of profits over $1 billion. \u2047 Operating profit was $1.1 billion, an increase of 14%, and operating margin was 23.5%. \u2047 Now looking at supply chain solutions. \u2047 The segment delivered record third quarter top and bottom line results as the team executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment. \u2047 Revenue increased 8.4% to $4.3 billion with all major business categories contributing to profit growth. \u2047 Market demand remained elevated with a couple of key profit drivers. \u2047 In forwarding, capacity constraints, and consumer demand in the market drove volume growth in air freight forwarding and strong yields in our ocean freight product, which drove top and bottom line results. \u2047 And in logistics, revenue and operating profit grew by double digits led by our healthcare portfolio. \u2047 In the third quarter, supply chain solutions generated record operating profit of $448 million, and the operating margin was an impressive 10.5%. \u2047 As a reminder, this is our first full quarter without UPS freight results, given that we closed the sale on that business on April 30th of this year. \u2047 Walking through the rest of the income statement, we had $177 million of interest expense. \u2047 Other pension income was $285 million. \u2047 And lastly, our effective tax rate came in at 22.3%, which was lower than last year due to favorable changes in jurisdictional tax rates and discrete items. \u2047 Now let's turn to cash on the balance sheet. \u2047 We are generating strong cash flow from our disciplined focus on capital allocation and growth in net income. \u2047 So far, in 2021, we"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted earnings per share of $2.71.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share $2.71 .  \u2047  ups releases 3q 2021
