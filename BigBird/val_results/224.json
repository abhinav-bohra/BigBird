{"article": ["In addition, we will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Consistent with our last call, we generated strong results during the period due to rapidly growing demand for our products and services. \u2047 We reported fourth quarter fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings of $1.30 per diluted share, a 17% increase over the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 Our Motive Power business saw another quarter of solid revenue and earnings improvement and our Specialty segment continued its positive momentum, bolstered by strong demand for our transportation products. \u2047 Energy Systems benefited from telecom driven 5G growth in the Americas, delivering solid revenue, but following short on earnings, which I will soon address. \u2047 Cash flow was again strong this quarter, producing a record year and leaving us on very solid financial footing. \u2047 Although the world has begun returning to some sense of normalcy, we continue to confront ongoing headwinds created by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We have seen continued availability constraints in recruiting new employees and select raw material shortages, particularly in resins and electronic components. \u2047 Prices have been sticky, but always lag rapid cost increases. \u2047 Our team is responding to the near-term shortages and hiring challenges and expect steady improvement as the supply chain settles down and the rest of the world accelerate. \u2047 I'd now like to provide a little bit more color on some of our key markets. \u2047 Let's start with our largest segment, Energy Systems, which faced several input cost pressures during the period, including higher tariffs, increased commodity prices, and expedited freight costs. \u2047 In addition, our customers continue to struggle with chip and labor shortages that have slowed their build rates, but we expect improvements from these broad upstream and downstream supply chain issues in the back half of the calendar year. \u2047 EnerSys is participating in the mid-spectrum wireless U.S. build-out with batteries and outdoor DC power systems. \u2047 While we remain -- while we maintain our strong market position, we believe our results will further accelerate when customers rotate to higher spectrum small cell 5G build-outs and can benefit from our next-generation line powering products. \u2047 We are also very excited about U.S. broadband MSOs building out portions of their own wireless networks with their own HFC networks. \u2047 Today, these MSOs primarily wholesale lease and voice data minute from other network wireless providers. \u2047 We have a full suite of DOCSIS 3.1 gateway products that help the MSOs deploy their wireless networks much faster at a lower total cost. \u2047 Recently enacted extended MSO backup power requirements in California for public safety grid shutdown resilience provide an excellent near-term opportunity for EnerSys as well. \u2047 If all sites currently identified are deployed, the opportunity is well in excess of $50 million. \u2047 In addition to telecom, we are seeing favorable industrial-utility trends as infrastructure improvements, reliability and resiliency are expected to provide another growth driver for Energy Systems. \u2047 Renewable markets continue to expand with the legislative and regulatory push for energy storage applications for residential solar plus storage, monetization of distributed energy resources and numerous global climate initiatives aimed at vehicle electrification and renewable generation. \u2047 We will capitalize more in this area as our next generation renewable inverters and batteries are released. \u2047 We have also made substantial progress on our own battery energy storage system plus DC fast-charging initiative for electric vehicles, which I will speak more about shortly. \u2047 Data center markets are also improving as areas lift more COVID-related site access restrictions. \u2047 All in all, global mega trends continue to be favorable to Energy Systems growth. \u2047 Our Motive Power business performed very well in the quarter. \u2047 We are now the only battery producer to offer both lithium and TPPL in maintenance free, along with our traditional flooded products. \u2047 This segment generated strong operating earnings from continued market demand recovery, growing maintenance fee revenues and continued opex discipline. \u2047 In addition, our Richmond, Kentucky facility has returned to full capacity and efficiency, while our Hagen, Germany, restructuring savings are starting to be realized. \u2047 We launched our lithium platform with our four variance this quarter and all of our Motive Power Products passed the internal UO tests. \u2047 This month we will be launching two additional variance. \u2047 And we continue to collaborate with multiple material handling manufacturers. \u2047 While we're only in the early stages of our launch, our customers continue to find this chemistry as best suited for the toughest duty and are actively trialing our offering with excellent results. \u2047 The third segment of our business, Specialty, reported another strong quarter despite the ongoing impact of COVID on our capacity ramp. \u2047 Our transportation business is performing well as the OEM Class 8 vehicle market recovers. \u2047 However, we along with many of our competitors have been dealing with hiring challenges and supply constraints, causing our backlog to remain stubbornly high as demand continues to grow faster than we can supply. \u2047 As a result, our focus remains on expanding TPPL production, particularly in our three Missouri factories. \u2047 Our Springfield ramp is behind schedule due to COVID, but we added a second shift to the high-speed line and increased oxide and pasting capacity. \u2047 High-speed line production doubled in the last three months and continues to improve. \u2047 Our Warrensburg facility made a significant improvement from the last two years performance as well. \u2047 Lastly, our aerospace and defense team had another great quarter executing on submarine, tactical vehicles and munitions projects. \u2047 We won several space contracts with a variety of customers and programs. \u2047 I am pleased that we officially kicked off our battery energy storage system plus DC fast charge initiatives during the quarter and we are moving fast. \u2047 Early momentum has been driven by two commercial real estate partners and our engineering team has exceeded my expectation by delivering a 285-kilowatt hour prototype, up and running on our tech center, here at corporate in just a few months. \u2047 Our launch real estate partner has identified over $1 billion of multi-year revenue opportunity starting early calendar year ''22 if we hit the reasonable cost and performance targets. \u2047 Our goal is to deliver EV charger that charges any electric passenger car as fast as the car can handle, often changing hours into minutes. \u2047 By using a large storage battery to quickly charge EVs, we can dramatically reduce system installation costs at many sites, including the size of the AC transformer and high voltage cable from the utility interconnect. \u2047 The energy system can also reduce operating costs by lowering peak demand from vehicle charging. \u2047 In addition to fast-charging EV's, the bidirectional energy system can also help the host site use electricity more cost effectively for its commercial operations and can provide emergency backup power, down power outages. \u2047 The system is solar compatible and largely made from existing EnerSys lithium battery modules in charge and technology. \u2047 Our goal from the beginning of our lithium program is to use standardized modular products and use these product -- use these building blocks across all of our lines of business. \u2047 This drives the economies of scale and accelerate our time to market. \u2047 We are lining up software partners for artificial intelligence and cloud services and reviewed preliminary business plan with our Board last week. \u2047 We will provide more color on this excited opportunity over the summer. \u2047 With fiscal year 2021 behind us, I wanted to lay out what we're seeing in the market and the opportunities ahead of us. \u2047 Despite the challenges of the past year, many caused by the global pandemic, we are well positioned for long-term success. \u2047 We are on the precipice of a massive 5G build-out that will provide a strong long-term tailwind for our business. \u2047 Recent commentary by the largest telecoms and equipment manufacturers has been unanimous. \u2047 5G is gearing up and we should begin seeing the accelerated ramp in the second half of calendar year 2021, with the build-out continuing for five years or many more thereafter. \u2047 The factors leading to this 5G growth include T-Mobile's acceleration postpaid[Phonetic], universal and competitive 5G deployments for all carriers, including AT&T, which is expected to spend $24 billion a year on its network. \u2047 This gives entry into the marketplace with an FCC requirement to deploy 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023. \u2047 And finally, government spending or government sponsored rural fiber broadband initiatives being rolled out at the federal and state levels throughout the U.S. There are some potential hurdles that could slow the ramp-up, including the success of the C-band auction completed in February for more than $81 billion, which could limit some carriers financial resources to deploy it. \u2047 The second hurdle relates to supply chain shortages discussed by the 5G manufacturers, particularly a lack of semiconductors. \u2047 We will keep a close eye on these developments with the U.S. leading Europe, but remain confident we're at the door of a major 5G expansion in the quarters and years ahead. \u2047 In addition, the Biden administration has proposed nearly $2 trillion dollar bill, which includes upgrades to traditional infrastructure like U.S. highways and bridges, and we'll also made significant investments in non-traditional areas that should benefit EnerSys directly, such as the electric grid, EV charging and high-speed broadband. \u2047 While it is far from a done deal, there is bipartisan support for several areas of the build that we are prepared to act on. \u2047 Our strategic initiatives outlined in our Investor Day nearly two years ago are worth repeating. \u2047 One, to accelerate higher margin maintenance free Motive Power sales with NexSys iON and NexSys PURE; two, to grow the portfolio of products in our Energy Systems business, particularly in telecom, with fully integrated DC power systems and small cell site powering solutions which will accelerate our growth from 5G; third, to increase TPPL capacity, particularly for transportation market share and our Specialty business and finally, to reduce waste through the continued rollout of the EnerSys Operating System. \u2047 In addition, we are now adding our Energy System plus fast-charging to the above initiatives. \u2047 We feel it is a core competency from decades of experience charging electric forklifts, and we believe it represents an immense opportunity. \u2047 We will work hard executing each of these areas and to deliver a long-term value our customers and shareholders deserve. \u2047 With that, I'll now ask Mike to provide further information on our fourth quarter results and go-forward guidance. \u2047 I am starting with Slide 10. \u2047 Our fourth quarter net sales increased 4% over the prior year to $814 million due to a 4% increase from volume and 2% from currency gains net of the 2% decrease in pricing. \u2047 On a line of business basis, our fourth quarter net sales in Energy Systems were up 11% to $349 million and Specialty was up 16% to $132 million, while Motive Power revenues were down 6% to $333 million. \u2047 Motive Power suffered an 8% decline in volume along with a 1% decrease in pricing, net of a 3% increase in FX. \u2047 The prior year, Motive Power fourth quarter revenues benefited from our recovery of the September 2019 fire in our Richmond, Kentucky facility. \u2047 Energy Systems had a 12% increase from volume and a 2% improvement from currency net of a 3% decrease in pricing. \u2047 Specialty had 16% in volume improvements along with 2% offsetting impacts from positive currency and lower pricing. \u2047 We had no impact from acquisitions in this quarter. \u2047 On a geographical basis, our net sales for the Americas were up 4% year-over-year to $557 million, with a 6% more volume and 2% less pricing. \u2047 EMEA was up 2% to $203 million despite 3% volume and pricing declines due to an 8% improvement in currency. \u2047 While Asia was up 19% at $55 million on 9% volume and 10% currency improvements. \u2047 Please now refer to Slide 11. \u2047 On a sequential basis, fourth quarter net sales were up 8% compared to the third quarter, driven by 9% volume improvements, net of a 1% price decline. \u2047 On a line of business basis, Specialty increased 21% with our TPPL continuing to provide more capacity for transportation sales, while Motive Power was up 9% as rebounds from the pandemic and Energy Systems was up 3%. \u2047 Now a few comments about our adjusted consolidated earnings performance. \u2047 As you know, we utilized certain non-GAAP measures in analyzing our company's operating performance, specifically excluding highlighted items. \u2047 Accordingly, my following comments concerning operating earnings, my later comments concerning diluted earnings per share exclude all highlighted items. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, adjusted consolidated operating earnings in the fourth quarter increased approximately $7 million to $78 million, with the operating margin up 50 basis points. \u2047 On a sequential basis, our fourth quarter operating earnings dollars were flat at $78 million, while our OE margin dropped 80 basis points to 9.6%, primarily due to Energy Systems results, which I will address shortly. \u2047 Operating expenses when excluding highlighted items were at 14.6% of sales for the quarter compared to 16.4% in the prior year as we reduced our spending by $9 million year-over-year and by 10 basis points sequentially. \u2047 Excluded from operating expenses recorded on a GAAP basis in Q4 are pre-tax charges of $27 million, primarily related to $6 million in Alpha and NorthStar amortization, and $21 million in restructuring charges for the previously announced closure of our flooded Motive Power factory in Hagen, Germany. \u2047 Excluding those highlighted charges, our Motive Power business generated operating earnings of 15.6% or 300 basis points higher than the 12.6% in the fourth quarter of last year, due primarily to improvements in manufacturing costs and lower operating expenses. \u2047 OE dollars for Motive Power increased over $7 million from the prior year. \u2047 On a sequential basis, Motive Power's fourth quarter OE decreased 230 basis points from the 13.3 -- excuse me, increased 230 basis points from the 13.3% margin posted in the third quarter, again due primarily to improved manufacturing and operating costs along with better price mix. \u2047 Energy Systems operating earnings percentage of 2.6% was down from last year's 4.1% and from last quarter's 7.4%. \u2047 OE dollars decreased $4 million from the prior year and decreased $16 million from the prior quarter despite slightly higher volume on lower margins and higher input costs. \u2047 These costs range from higher tariffs, freight, materials and manufacturing costs. \u2047 Specialty operating earnings percentage of 13.2% was up from last year's 11.7% and up from last quarter's 11.9%. \u2047 OE dollars increased over $4 million from both the prior year and prior quarter on higher volume and lower operating expenses. \u2047 Please move to Slide 13. \u2047 As previously reflected on Slide 12, our fourth quarter adjusted consolidated operating earnings of $78 million was a increase of $7 million or 10"], "gold_summary": ["adjusted net earnings per diluted share for q4 of fiscal 2021, on a non-gaap basis, were $1.30."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q4 adjusted earnings per share $1.30.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $1.30.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $1.30."]}
