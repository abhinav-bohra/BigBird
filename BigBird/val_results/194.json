{"article": ["My name is Matt Eichmann. \u2047 I'm joined by Pete Watson, Greif's president and chief executive officer; Larry Hilsheimer, Greif's chief financial officer; and Ole Rosgaard, Greif's chief operating officer. \u2047 We will take questions at the end of today's call. \u2047 In accordance with Regulation Fair Disclosure, please ask questions regarding issues you consider important because we're prohibited from discussing material nonpublic information with you on an individual basis. \u2047 Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question before returning to the queue. \u2047 Actual results could differ materially from those discussed. \u2047 As always, we appreciate your interest in Greif. \u2047 The team delivered excellent results despite a challenging operating environment that was complicated by the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures beyond our control. \u2047 Fiscal 2021 was an exceptional year with record financial results. \u2047 We significantly de-levered our balance sheet, improved our shareholder returns, achieved top decile colleague engagement, and were recognized as a leading workplace in the United States. \u2047 Looking ahead, these accomplishments have us positioned for an even stronger future as our fiscal 2022 guidance points to performance in line with the commitments we established in 2019. \u2047 Finally, in this past year, we made meaningful enhancements to our already strong sustainability performance and have embedded ESG deeper into our business strategies. \u2047 I'd like to ask Ole Rosgaard, our chief operating officer, to make a few comments regarding ESG that's on Slide 4. \u2047 I hope you and your families are well. \u2047 In my mind, sustainability is not an afterthought or corporate function, rather it's a leadership focus that creates business value by reducing risk and costs and bringing new market opportunities to growth. \u2047 We achieved several notable ESG accomplishments in 2021. \u2047 For example, we diverted a minimum of 90% of waste from landfills at more than 140 of our global facilities, increasing our global diversion rate to roughly 85% from about 70% last year. \u2047 Even more impressive, at year end, 50 of our global facilities had achieved zero waste to landfill status. \u2047 We launched our fourth Colleague Resource Group to provide professional development opportunities and further foster a more representative and inclusive culture across Greif. \u2047 And finally, we linked ESG KPIs to the Greif business system, improving our performance management capability to further drive this critical work. \u2047 The takeaway here is that Greif's strong ESG focus is core to our plans for sustainable value creation. \u2047 I look forward to sharing additional highlights with you in the future. \u2047 And now, back over to Pete to discuss our business results on Slide 5. \u2047 The global industrial packaging business delivered an outstanding fourth quarter result. \u2047 Our overall global primary product line was strong and benefited sales by almost 3% versus the prior year. \u2047 and EMEA and ongoing recovery in our industrial end markets. \u2047 Global steel drum volume fell by 1.5% per day versus the prior year. \u2047 The biggest shortfall was in APAC, reflective of our decision to implement strategic pricing actions and supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted our customers' operations. \u2047 Fourth quarter global steel drum volume was also impacted by performance in EMEA where volumes, where steady through most of the quarter but did slow in October as customers in this region faced their own set of supply chain disruptions. \u2047 The Americas region recorded strong mid-single-digit growth during the quarter. \u2047 Generally speaking, our industrial end markets remain healthy. \u2047 Customers report solid order backlogs and strong underlying demand, but they do face external supply chain disruptions. \u2047 Across GIP, we see little indication of customers building inventory, but some are carrying more stock than normal due to supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to ship to their customers. \u2047 GIP's generally stronger volumes and higher average selling prices resulted in significantly higher segment sales and gross profit year over year. \u2047 GIP's fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA rose by roughly $47 million due to higher sales, partially offset by higher raw material, manufacturing, and transportation costs. \u2047 The business also benefited from a $3 million dollar FX tailwind. \u2047 Looking ahead, we expect GIP's fiscal 2022 profits to be lower year over year, while we do anticipate volume growth, contribution from new capex projects, and beneficial efficiency gains. \u2047 Profits will be lower as the unprecedented run-up in steel costs provided a roughly $100 million tailwind to GIP's fiscal 2021 results that will not recur. \u2047 We anticipate GIP's normal profit cadence through the year to persist. \u2047 Paper packaging's fourth quarter sales rose by roughly $120 million versus the prior year due to stronger volumes and higher published containerboard and boxboard prices. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA rose by roughly $10 million versus the prior year due to higher sales that were substantially offset by higher raw material, manufacturing, and transportation costs, including a significant $50 million -- $51 million drag from higher OCC index cost and an $8 million natural gas cost spike not contemplated in our guidance. \u2047 The business benefited from a $4 million legal settlement tailwind reported in SG&A that will not recur. \u2047 Volume demand across our paper business remains strong that our combined mill backlogs exceed eight weeks. \u2047 Fourth quarter volumes in our CorrChoice sheet feeder system were up 2.4% today versus the prior year. \u2047 The demand for durables, e-commerce growth, and the OEMs auto supply chain all remained very solid, and we see no slowdown on the horizon. \u2047 Fourth quarter tube and core volumes were up 7% per day versus the prior year. \u2047 Demand was strong in most key end markets, including film, paper cores, textiles, and protective packaging. \u2047 Looking ahead into fiscal 2022, we expect significantly higher profits in paper packaging due to strong demand and continued flow through published price increases. \u2047 Big picture, our team delivered excellent fourth quarter results despite significant external challenges. \u2047 Fourth quarter net sales, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, rose 35% versus the prior year quarter due to stronger volumes and higher selling prices. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA rose by 57 million, including a 7 million combined tailwind from FX and a one-time legal settlement. \u2047 Keep in mind our adjusted EBITDA result overcame an OCC index headwind of 51 million and roughly 40 million of non volume related transportation and manufacturing inflation, including an $8 million unforecasted natural gas cost spike. \u2047 Interest expense fell by 9 million versus the prior-year quarter due to lower debt balances. \u2047 We also benefited by reaching a lower interest rate tier in our credit facility as a result of our substantial debt repayments. \u2047 Our fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate were both roughly 11%. \u2047 Fourth quarter adjusted Class A earnings per share more than doubled to $1.93 a share. \u2047 For fiscal '21, we delivered adjusted Class A earnings per share of $5.60 a share, a 74% improvement versus the prior year and a significant beat relative to our Q3 guidance. \u2047 Part of the earnings improvement came from a lower-than-anticipated non-GAAP tax rate of 18.1%, which benefited from reserve releases due to audit settlements, and statute of limitation expirations. \u2047 We estimate the lower tax rate relative to the guidance we shared at $0.15 at -- to fiscal '21 results. \u2047 The lion's share of our year-over-year earnings improvement came from disciplined operational execution. \u2047 Fourth quarter adjusted free cash fell roughly $79 million versus the prior year. \u2047 While profits improved significantly, capex rose and working capital dragged on cash flow primarily due to higher raw material costs than we anticipated in our forecast. \u2047 Working capital was also negatively impacted by lower-than-anticipated October volumes outside the U.S. while customers struggled with external challenges and ordered fewer drums. \u2047 That said, our team is controlling what it can with strong results and trailing 12-month average working capital as a percentage of sales, improved by a significant 140 basis points to a -- year over year to 10.8%. \u2047 Our core capital priorities are clear and remain consistent: reinvest in the business as needed to create value and support growth, return excess cash to shareholders via an attractive and growing dividend, and de-lever our balance sheet and maintain a compliance leverage ratio between two to two-and-a-half turns. \u2047 Our balance sheet is in great shape. \u2047 We anticipate spending between 150 million and 170 million in capital expenditures in fiscal '22 and target growing our dividend in '22 as mentioned in previous calls. \u2047 We are in the midst of our strategic planning process to determine the focus and extent of growth activities going forward to prudently leverage our strong balance sheet for the benefit of our shareholders. \u2047 We are pleased to introduce fiscal '22 guidance, excuse me, that delivers on the commitments we made more than two years ago. \u2047 Our guidance reflects the considerable improvement we've made in the base business over the last several years, including the successful Caraustar integration and synergy capture, and demonstrates Greif's resilience in overcoming the unforeseen and considerable external challenges presented by COVID and dramatic inflationary headwinds well beyond our control. \u2047 At the midpoint, we anticipate generating $6.15 of adjusted Class A earnings per share in '22. \u2047 Overall, we expect lower profits in GIP in fiscal '22 to be more than offset by higher profitability and EPS, highlighting once again the benefit of our diversified portfolio. \u2047 Interest expense will be significantly lower in fiscal '22 as a result of our aggressive de-leveraging, and we expect it to evolve further when we move to refinance our 6.5% 27 senior notes sometime in the first half of calendar '22. \u2047 We anticipate '22 adjusted free cash flow between 400 million and 460 million. \u2047 In addition to increased capital expenditures, we anticipate significantly higher cash tax in fiscal '21, mainly due to additional pre-tax income. \u2047 We anticipate working capital revert to a cash source. \u2047 It was a $222 million use in '21 as raw material cost inflation accelerated. \u2047 Now, a few reflective comments for your consideration. \u2047 From my perspective, the Greif of today is a far different company than the Greif of six years ago. \u2047 Our margin profile has stabilized and grown, profits have increased significantly, and our transparency and communication has improved and been applauded. \u2047 Our capital allocation strategy has been steady, disciplined, and predictable. \u2047 We have delivered on what we promised, and we continue to derive even greater value for our shareholders. \u2047 Despite these improvements, we continue to trade at a discount to our historical metrics in the broader market. \u2047 As an example, assuming a historic free cash flow of 11% in the midpoint of our '22 free cash flow guidance would imply a combined market cap of roughly $3.9 billion, or an increase of roughly 30%. \u2047 So, while we don't get to vote when it comes to our valuation, our opinion is that we deserve a closer look, given the discount present in our stock today. \u2047 Now, I'm going to take a minute and go off-script. \u2047 As most of, if not all of you are aware, today is Pete Watson's last earnings call. \u2047 Pete embodies the leadership and has a personal connection with many of Greif's colleagues that developed through personal contact. \u2047 He is a humble and respected leader who leans on his athletic coaching background for the skills in building a cohesive team. \u2047 As he took leadership at Greif, many things were broken. \u2047 Since taking the helm in November of 2015, the results have been extraordinary. \u2047 In safety, steady improvement, in colleague engagement, we improved dramatically to be a top decile in gallops industrial sector. \u2047 Those engaged colleagues have delivered outstanding customer service and driven incredible improvement in doubling our NPS scores over that period. \u2047 That focus on virtuous service profit chain has lead to financial improvement that has been exceptional. \u2047 From 2015 to 2021,[Inaudible] and EBITDA have essentially doubled. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA earnings per share has gone from $2.18 to $5.60 with no stock repurchases. \u2047 And adjusted free cash flow, which was $70 million in 2015 has averaged nearly $30 million in the last three years and will exceed $400 million in '22. \u2047 Pete has worked diligently to ensure this succession plan and left Greif in good leadership hands going forward to secure his legacy as an outstanding leader. \u2047 You certainly did go off-script and much appreciated. \u2047 And again Larry, I appreciate your comments and thoughts. \u2047 You are a good man. \u2047 As Larry talked about, today is my final earnings call as president and chief executive officer of Greif. \u2047 You know, it's a great company. \u2047 It's been my distinct honor to serve our global Greif team. \u2047 And I'm extremely proud, as Larry talked about, of what we've all accomplished together over the last six years. \u2047 I'm incredibly grateful to all our colleagues for their passion and dedication to excellence and also for their commitment to our team and our customers. \u2047 And while fiscal 2021 is a record year for our company, I'm even more excited for what lies ahead. \u2047 We are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing strength and improving trends at our key end markets and our extensive global portfolio, our differentiated service capability, and our sharp focus on operational execution allows us to best serve our customers' needs and generate significant shareholder value. \u2047 I, along with the rest of the board, are confident in Ole Rosgaard's ability to lead Greif going forward. \u2047 His operational background, strategic mindset, and passion for team building and serving customers will be advantageous to Greif's future. \u2047 I look forward to the company thriving under his leadership. \u2047 It has certainly been a pleasure working with all of you, and we certainly appreciate your interest in Greif. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q4 earnings per share $1.93 excluding items.  \u2047  sees fy 2022
