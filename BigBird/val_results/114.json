{"article": ["I think we're all very ready to turn the page and what was a very challenging 2020 and while the global pandemic remains very pervasive, we do all see light at the end of the tunnel and we look forward to 2021 with cautious optimism that conditions will improve. \u2047 Throughout 2020, we focused on executing our long-term strategy while recognizing the necessity to focus on employee health and safety, finding ways to work, and serving and delivering expected outcomes for our clients. \u2047 Over the past decade, we've been successful investing ahead of shift in client demand, placing us in a strong position to take advantage of key industry tailwinds in the future. \u2047 Our investments in these capabilities and our tremendous focus on our clients is now again producing good momentum in our business that became more visible as the year progressed by working better to anticipate, understand, and meet client needs during the challenging times. \u2047 We've achieved six straight months of net long-term inflows, totaling nearly $18 billion in the second half of 2020 with progress across channels, geographies, asset classes. \u2047 Retail flows improved in the second half significantly. \u2047 Our solutions enabled institutional pipeline remain near record levels. \u2047 We saw net inflows in Asia Pacific, totaling $17 billion in the second half of the year and improving flows in EMEA within the Americas over this timeframe and net long-term flows in the fixed income remained robust during that period. \u2047 All of these factors combined build a strong foundation as we head into 2021 and maybe a few highlights of the 4th quarter. \u2047 On slide 4, if you happen to be following along more specifically during the quarter, investment performance for a large portion of our high demand capabilities were in the upper quartile. \u2047 We had net long-term inflows and then nearly $10 billion during the quarter, long-term inflows in the fixed income capabilities continued while we saw client demand for equities within ETFs, quantitative and index strategies in particular. \u2047 We saw another quarter of strong inflows from Asia-Pacific region and flows in the Americas turn positive. \u2047 Alison will provide more information in a few minutes on the flow's strategic evaluation and more details of the quarter. \u2047 But I would like to note, we also improved our operating leverage during the period, paid our credit facility to zero, and made progress improving our cash position. \u2047 I would like to spend a few minutes on slides 5 and 6 to talk about our competitive strength and key capabilities in areas with high client demand and our focus for 2021. \u2047 Slide 5 illustrates the market opportunities we see for these key growth areas and demonstrates the majority of our investment capabilities are aligned with these opportunities. \u2047 In these areas, our investment performance is strong. \u2047 We're highly competitive and well positioned for growth and as we move into 2021, we plan to further expand our market leading position in ETFs in the US and EMEA in particular and build our passive presence in Asia-Pacific. \u2047 We are the fourth largest ETF provider globally, and our capabilities span passive active strategies in establishing and developing a spectrum of ETF-ESG ETFs and building on our 15-year legacy of innovation, we continue to develop the products in this space as demonstrated by the launch of the QQQ innovation suite and our first non-transparent ETFs that we delivered in the 4th quarter. \u2047 Strong alternative platform and our focus is growing our private markets business led by our market leading real estate and bank loan businesses, and active fixed income and global equity remain key areas of opportunity for us and our offerings are well positioned with strong investment performance and high client demand. \u2047 In addition, we are focused on our solutions efforts and as we have seen by the contribution to the institutional pipeline, clients value the service, the ability to offer solutions that builds the full power of our competitive set of capability and services-services to client continues to be a priority for us during 2021. \u2047 We continue to invest in our leadership position in Greater China. \u2047 We have been managing dedicated Chinese products for nearly 40 years. \u2047 We have already seen the benefits of our early mover[Phonetic] advantage in the China onshore market through our joint venture, which [Technical Issue] our position in the fast-growing China market and further develop our media solutions and asset allocation offerings. \u2047 Given our investment in the business over the past decade, our most recent efforts to better align the organization with our strategy, I'm confident that we have the talent, the capabilities, the resources, and momentum to [Technical Issue] future growth and success. \u2047 [Technical Issues] happy New year and remain focused on helping our clients achieve their desired outcomes regardless of where the markets take us. \u2047 Moving to slide 7, we had 61% and 70% of actively managed funds on the top half of peers on a 5-year and a 10-year basis, reflecting strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities, all areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. \u2047 Looking at our AUM on slide 8, we ended the quarter with $1.35 trillion in AUM. \u2047 Of the $132 billion in AUM growth, approximately $95 billion as a function of increased market values. \u2047 Turning to flows on slide 9, our diversified platform generated long-term net inflows in the 4th quarter of $9.8 billion representing 3.9% annualized organic growth, which we generated positive net inflows in active AUM of $400 million and passive AUM of $9.4 billion. \u2047 Our ETFs experienced net inflows of $6.1 billion including $4.7 billion in long-term ETF and $1.4 billion in our QQQ. \u2047 Our US-listed ETFs excluding the QQQs have their best quarter in their 15-year history. \u2047 We saw net long-term ETF flows in the US focused on equities in the 4th quarter including a high level of interest in our S&P 500 equal weight ETF which had $2.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter. \u2047 Two of our top 5 end-flowing ETFs were ESG related. \u2047 We continue to see momentum in our ETF business and demand for ESG funds and as Marty highlighted, the market opportunity is significant for this key growth area in 2021. \u2047 Retail net outflows were $800 million in the quarter, helped by the positive ETF flows. \u2047 On the institutional side, we had net inflows of $10.6 billion. \u2047 I'll provide a little more color on these flows on the next few slides, but importantly, the growth in our passive AUM and our institutional AUM is meaningful for the firm and contributed to the positive operating leverage we generated in the period. \u2047 Also, as Marty noted earlier, we are seeing the mix of ETF inflows being weighted toward higher fee-generating products. \u2047 Looking at flows by geography, you will note that the Americas had net inflows of $2.2 billion in the quarter, an improvement of $6.6 billion from the prior quarter. \u2047 This improvement was driven by net inflows into ETFs, institutional inflows, various fixed income strategies, and importantly, focused sales efforts and improvement in redemption rates. \u2047 Our global equity products improved by over $1 billion or 37% from Q3 driven by our developing market fund, which returned to positive net flows in the 4th quarter following negative net flows in the first three quarters of the year. \u2047 The UK experienced net outflows of $100 million in the quarter, as positive flows into our institutional quantitative equity capability were offset by net outflows in multi-asset in UK equities. \u2047 EMEA net outflows were $1.4 billion driven by institutional lumpiness and ETF outflows largely in our S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 use ETF. \u2047 And finally, I noted last quarter that Asia Pacific delivered one of its stronger-strongest quarters ever with net inflows of $8 billion. \u2047 In the 4th quarter, net inflows were even higher at $9.1 billion. \u2047 Net inflows were diversified across the Asia Pacific region. \u2047 $4 billion of these net flows were from Japan, $3.8 billion arose from our China JV, and the remaining $1.3 billion was generated from several other countries in the region. \u2047 It's worth noting that we continue to see strength in fixed income across all channels and markets in the 4th quarter with net long-term inflows of $8.2 billion. \u2047 This following net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion in the 3rd quarter and $6 billion in the second quarter. \u2047 It's also important to note that of the $26.1 billion in fixed income net inflows in 2020, $25 billion of these net inflows were from active fixed income capabilities. \u2047 Active fixed income has been a growth area for us in 2020 and remains a key investment area in 2021. \u2047 Now, moving to slide 10. \u2047 Our institutional pipeline remains robust at $30.5 billion on the heels of strong pull through in the institutional pipeline during the 4th quarter. \u2047 This pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies, and our solutions capability has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network warranting our continued investment in this key capability in 2021. \u2047 Turning to slide 11, you will note that our revenues increased $135 million or 12.4% from the 3rd quarter, driven by higher average AUM in Q4, as well as a meaningful increase in performance fees. \u2047 Net revenue yield at performance fees was 36 basis points flat and flat at the, at the Q3 yield level. \u2047 The impact of rising markets on our yield was offset by modest fee rate decline from the mix shift we experienced across products in the quarter as well as the impact of non-management fee earning AUM. \u2047 We recorded performance fees of $78 million in the 4th quarter, $48 million of these performance fees arose from our real estate business and $21 million from our institutional business and our China JV, two of our key growth areas. \u2047 Seasonally, we tend to see higher performance fees in the 4th quarter. \u2047 Total adjusted operating expenses increased 8.3% in Q4. \u2047 The $57 million increase in operating expenses was driven by higher variable compensation as a result of both market growth and compensation related to the performance fees in the quarter. \u2047 Operating expenses remained at lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic driven impacts to discretionary spending, travel, and other business operations that persisted in the quarter. \u2047 That being said, we did see a seasonal increase in marketing expenses as expected. \u2047 Moving to slide 12, we wanted to update you on the progress we have made with our strategic evaluation. \u2047 As we noted previously, we conducted a strategic evaluation across four key areas of our expense base, our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend, and technology and operations efficiency. \u2047 Through this evaluation, we will invest in key areas of growth, including ETF, fixed income, China solutions, alternatives, and global equities while creating permanent net improvement of $200 million in our normalized operating expense base. \u2047 As we noted, a large element of the savings will be generated from compensation which includes realigning our client facing workforce to support key areas of growth and repositioning to lower cost locations. \u2047 In the 4th quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings, $7 million of these savings were related to compensation expense as depicted on slide 12. \u2047 The remaining $500,000 in savings were related to facilities, which are shown in the property, office, and technology category. \u2047 The $7.5 million in cost savings were $30 million annualized is 15% of our $200 million net savings expectation. \u2047 Of the remaining $170 million in net savings, we anticipate we will realize roughly 50% of the savings through compensation expense. \u2047 The remaining 50% would spread across occupancy, tech spends, and G&A. \u2047 As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder recognized by the end of '22. \u2047 We estimate that we will realize roughly 75% of the anticipated compensation reductions in 2021, roughly 50% of the anticipated reduction in occupancy expense also in 2021, and all of the reduction in G&A this year. \u2047 The majority of efficiencies identified in our tech spend will not be realized until 2022. \u2047 In the 4th quarter, we incurred $104 million of our total estimated $250 million to $275 million in restructuring costs. \u2047 We expect the remaining transaction costs for the realization of this program to be in the range of $150 million-$175 million over the next two years, roughly two-thirds of this remaining amount occurring in 2021. \u2047 As a reminder, the costs associated with the strategic evaluation are not reflected in our non-GAAP results. \u2047 With respect to Q1, after improved market performance and asset inflows in the 4th quarter, we start the year with ever $1.3 trillion in AUM. \u2047 Given the market improvement with more back-end weighted toward the end of the quarter, we expect both operating revenues excluding performance fees and the associated variable expenses to be modestly higher in the first quarter. \u2047 This reflects the follow through from the market and slow growth that occurred over the course of the 4th quarter, even if we assume no change in markets from year-end. \u2047 On the expense side, this will include higher associated variable compensation from the seasonal increase in payroll taxes, partially offset by lower compensation related to the seasonal decline in performance fees and the execution of our targeted cost savings. \u2047 Turning to slide 13, adjusted operating income improved $78 million to $485 million for the quarter, driven by the factors we just reviewed. \u2047 Adjusted operating margin include 230 basis points as compared to the 3rd quarter to 39.5%, demonstrating the operating leverage in our model. \u2047 This helped drive a 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $0.72 a share. \u2047 In addition, we benefited from higher non-operating income and lower non-operating expenses in the quarter. \u2047 Non-operating income included $31.9 million in net gains for the quarter compared to $15.2 million in net gains last quarter. \u2047 The increase was driven by unrealized gains primarily in our seed money holdings. \u2047 Interest expense of $24.4 million was 28% lower than the prior quarter. \u2047 Q3 was the final quarter in which we paid dividends related to our forward purchase agreements, a portion of which we settled in January with the remaining portion to be settled in April 2021. \u2047 Our tax rate for the 4th quarter was 21.7%. \u2047 The reduction in the rate reflects the lower taxes on unrealized gains in our seed"], "gold_summary": ["quarterly adjusted earnings per share $0.72.  \u2047  long-term net inflows of
