{"article": ["I'm Chris Miorin, vice president of investor relations. \u2047 Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www. \u2047 In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. \u2047 In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Starting on Slide 3. \u2047 2021 was a pivotal year for Ingersoll Rand with many accomplishments and new records. \u2047 We solidified our compounding growth story as we reshaped our portfolio to focus on mission-critical, flow creation technologies and high-growth, sustainable end markets while establishing a new capital allocation strategy designed to enable us to consistently compound earnings over time. \u2047 We continued a strong operational execution where the commercial effectiveness of our team, driven by our IRX process, yielded a backlog at the end of the fourth quarter that was our largest ever and positions us very well for continued strong results in 2022 as demand for our products and services continue to grow. \u2047 Moving to Slide 4. \u2047 I want to take a moment to recognize some of the accomplishments across each of our five strategic imperatives in 2021. \u2047 In deploy talent, our employees think and act like owners because they are. \u2047 Shares granted to employees to date have appreciated from $250 million to over $500 million in value, motivating our engaged employee base to make decisions each day that can benefit our value creation and ultimately, their personal wealth. \u2047 Furthermore, we implemented a plan to also grant shares to employees who join us as new employees or via acquisitions, yet another factor enabling Ingersoll Rand to be considered an employer and acquirer of choice. \u2047 Our employee engagement score, up 17% over the last three years, also shows the power of ownership. \u2047 Our current engagement score now ranks in the top quartile of manufacturing organizations. \u2047 In expand margins, we have improved the company's adjusted EBITDA margin 370 basis points in 2019, including an improvement of 160 basis points in 2021 alone. \u2047 We have realized $215 million in synergies out of the $300 million commitment from the IR merger, with an additional $15 million expected in 2022. \u2047 In operate sustainably, we continue to make progress and have received recognition from ESG rating agencies, including S&P Global and MSCI, once again demonstrating how we leverage the power of IRX to drive performance across a multitude of initiatives. \u2047 In accelerate growth, our unique growth enablers outlined during our 2021 investor day, strongly contributed to growth in the past year. \u2047 Our demand generation engine now generates three times more marketing-qualified leads compared to 2019. \u2047 IIoT-enabled assets were up 250% year over year, and new product innovation increased 95% in 2021. \u2047 In allocate capital effectively, we secured approximately $2 billion in gross proceeds from the divestitures of Club Car and High Pressure Solutions and redeployed over $1 billion through acquisitions in 2021, which represents over 6% of sales when annualized. \u2047 We also repurchased $731 million in shares as part of the KKR's final equity sale, established a new $750 million share repurchase program, and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share during the fourth quarter. \u2047 We're incredibly proud of our 2021 accomplishments and could not have done it without the dedication of our team. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5. \u2047 We're committed to executing the strategy we outlined at our 2021 investor day and are confident it will produce the expected results. \u2047 This slide outlines how we are already delivering on that strategy and associated commitments. \u2047 Our portfolio is now positioned to capitalize on global megatrends, such as digitization, sustainability, and quality of life. \u2047 We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver mid-single-digit organic growth through 2025. \u2047 And as you can see, we outperformed on this commitment in 2021, delivering 12% year-over-year organic growth. \u2047 When coupled with mid-single-digit annual growth from M&A and technology investments, we expect to deliver total growth of low double digits through 2025. \u2047 And in 2021, we delivered 4% in-year growth from M&A and 6% annualized. \u2047 Our strong pricing, aftermarket, and I2V initiatives enable us to generate operating leverage and incremental productivity, with an expected 100 basis points of margin improvement per year over the period. \u2047 And in 2021, we over delivered on this target, capturing 160 basis points of margin expansion despite several challenges like supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. \u2047 With IRX as our competitive differentiator and over 275 IMPACT Daily Management or IDM meetings across our company each week, our high-performance culture encourages strong execution. \u2047 This continues to support our goal of being a premier, high-quality company that consistently compounds earnings by double digits each year, with free cash flow margins in the high teens. \u2047 And we feel that we're well on our way, as in 2021, we grew earnings per share by 63% and achieved adjusted free cash flow margin of 16%. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6. \u2047 We have achieved strong margin improvement across our portfolio since 2019. \u2047 Looking at the company, margins improved 370 basis points from 2019 despite COVID impacts and persistent supply chain and inflationary pressures. \u2047 In the ITS segment, we improved an impressive 470 basis points since 2019 as we continue to accelerate synergy capture and execute on value creation opportunities from the IR merger. \u2047 Incremental operating leverage and productivity should enable ITS to achieve margins in the high 20s over time. \u2047 In the PST segment, margins have expanded 170 basis points since 2019 and 290 basis points, excluding M&A. \u2047 Continued strong flow-through in the base PST business, coupled with diligent synergy execution as we onboard acquisitions, should yield adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-30s over time. \u2047 It is important to note that as we highlight on the last bullet point, due to the nature of our products, we're mission-critical with premium brands and high quality and reliability, and we have the ability to remain price/cost positive. \u2047 We have accomplished this in each quarter since the merger even during these inflationary times and expect to do the same in 2022. \u2047 Moving to Slide 7. \u2047 We're thrilled to announce the recent validation of Ingersoll Rand's progress as an industry leader in ESG. \u2047 Based on demonstrated progress, we received another upgrade from MSCI, which is our second upgrade in the past 18 months, and now have an A rating. \u2047 And I'm really excited to announce that S&P Global, in its annual sustainability assessment that was just released a few weeks ago, scored Ingersoll Rand in the top 15% and included us in its Sustainability Yearbook for 2022. \u2047 In addition, S&P Global recognized us with the Industry Mover Award, which is given to the most improved company in each sector of the year. \u2047 These recognitions exemplify our unwavering commitment to ESG. \u2047 In March of 2021, we committed to becoming a top-quartile ESG industrial company in three years. \u2047 And we believe we have achieved or are at the cusp of achieving that goal in one year. \u2047 And S&P Global agrees as it elected us to its Sustainability Yearbook, which recognizes the top 15% ESG performing companies in each industry sector. \u2047 Despite this progress, we're just getting started on our ESG journey, and we're very focused on accelerating progress toward our ESG growth. \u2047 I'm incredibly proud of our team for being recognized by the rating agencies already this early in our journey. \u2047 Moving to Slide 8. \u2047 We continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q4, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX to overcome persistent inflationary pressures in a challenging supply chain environment. \u2047 Through Q4 2021, we have realized $215 million in cost synergies and are on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment. \u2047 Total company orders and revenue increased 24% and 16% year over year, respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment despite comparisons to a strong Q4 2020. \u2047 Our orders and revenue in the quarter were a record for the company, eclipsing Q3 and setting us up well for 2022. \u2047 The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $342 million, a 15% year over year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.1%, a 40-basis-point sequential improvement. \u2047 Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $225 million after taking into account the unique items as pointed out on the slide. \u2047 Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 million from prior year. \u2047 This takes our net leverage to 1.1 times, an 0.9 times improvement from prior year. \u2047 Turning to Slide 9. \u2047 For the total company, Q4 orders grew 25% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. \u2047 Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.06 for the quarter. \u2047 We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 7% from the end of Q3 and over 50% from the end of 2020. \u2047 Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. \u2047 ITS segment margin declined 40 basis points, while PST segment margin declined 400 basis points, driven largely by the impact of M&A. \u2047 When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST margin declined by 120 basis points. \u2047 Finally, corporate costs came in at $26 million for the quarter, down year over year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general savings and prudency. \u2047 We expect corporate cost to normalize back to the low 30s millions per quarter in 2022. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was up 51% to $0.68 per share. \u2047 Of note, the adjusted tax rate came in at 5% for the quarter and 12% for full year 2021. \u2047 Q4 benefited from our ongoing tax restructuring efforts, specifically some nonrecurring impacts driven most notably by our efforts to manage and minimize the cash taxes associated with the divestitures of SVT and HPS completed earlier in the year. \u2047 As we look ahead to 2022, we expect the rate to be back in the low 20s due to the nonrepeat of some of these discrete items. \u2047 Turning to Slide 10. \u2047 On a full year basis, orders grew 28% and revenue increased 16%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. \u2047 The full year book-to-bill was 1.12, and total company adjusted EBITDA was up 28% from 2020. \u2047 Margin expanded by 160 basis points, with ITS margin up by 220 basis points and PST declining 50 basis points. \u2047 When adjusted to exclude the impact of these acquisitions completed in 2021, PST margins increased by 70 basis points. \u2047 ITS posted incremental margins of 38%, with PST at 27% or 36%, excluding the impact of M&A. \u2047 Moving on to the next slide. \u2047 Free cash flow for the quarter was $224 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by strong operational performance across the business while continuing to invest organically. \u2047 Capex during the quarter totaled $23 million, and free cash flow included $4 million of synergy and stand-up costs related to the IR merger. \u2047 In addition, free cash flow included a net inflow of $3 million in cash taxes related to the divestitures of the HPS and SVT segments. \u2047 Excluding these items, adjusted free cash flow was $225 million in the quarter. \u2047 Leverage for the quarter was 1.1 times, which was an 0.9 times improvement versus the prior year. \u2047 And total company liquidity now stands at $3.2 billion based on approximately $2.1 billion of cash and over $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. \u2047 Liquidity increased by $100 million in the quarter, which included outflows of $165 million toward strategic M&A and $8 million to fund our first quarterly dividend. \u2047 Our M&A funnel remains robust and active, up in excess of five times from the close of the IR merger, and we're remaining disciplined in our approach. \u2047 Moving to Slide 12. \u2047 We'd like to provide an update on synergy delivery and some detail on the impact of price versus cost. \u2047 On the left side of the page, we are updating the cost to achieve the $300 million synergy commitment related to the IR merger, as well as the associated stand-up of the new company from a combined $450 million to now $280 million, an aggregate reduction of roughly 40% or $170 million from our original estimates. \u2047 This speaks to how we are always heavily focused on high returns on cash investments regardless of the situation. \u2047 I am very proud of how our employee ownership culture continues to overdrive our performance. \u2047 With everyone thinking like an owner, they think about how every dollar spent generates profit and improvement. \u2047 In addition to the $215 million in realized synergies to date, we expect an incremental $50 million in 2022 and $35 million in 2023. \u2047 The synergy funnel remains in excess of $350 million. \u2047 And while we don't expect our synergy commitment to materially change as we look ahead, we will provide periodic updates on status and execution, particularly as we approach the end of the IR merger-related synergy delivery. \u2047 The right side of the slide highlights the ongoing price/cost dynamic. \u2047 In 2021, we remain price/cost positive each quarter, and we expect to deliver the same result in 2022. \u2047 Note that we are calculating costs, including direct material and logistics, but not direct labor or labor inflation, as labor is mostly offset with internal productivity actions. \u2047 In Q4, we delivered an incremental margin of 23% for the total company despite strong inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. \u2047 What I'm most proud of is that even in this environment, our team was able to achieve a sequential margin improvement of 40 basis points. \u2047 This highlights the resilience of IRX in very difficult environments. \u2047 Looking forward to 2022, we expect to remain price/cost positive each quarter as we continue to leverage IRX to drive commercial execution and productivity initiatives. \u2047 Given continued inflationary pressures and a very tough comparison from Q1 of 2021, we expect Q1 to be the most challenged period on a year-over-year basis, but nonetheless, expect incremental margins for the total year to be approximately 35% and the quarterly EBITDA profile to be well in line with prior-year quarterly phasing. \u2047 We know this is not easy, but it just speaks to the commitment of our team to be differentiated and be in the top quartile of performance. \u2047 And turning to Slide 13. \u2047 In our Industrial Technologies and Services segment, organic revenue was up"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.68 from continuing operations.  \u2047  sees full-year 2022 revenue growth to be 11% to 13%."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.68.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.68.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.68."]}
