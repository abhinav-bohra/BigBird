may different significantly from our expectations. \u2047 The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the today's call. \u2047 Additionally, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 These measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read together with our GAAP results. \u2047 We're extremely proud to deliver yet another quarter of outperformance with comps of 16.9%, building to an accelerated two-year stack of 41.3% and operating margin expansion of 60 basis points. \u2047 These results are a function of both the advantages of our distinctive positioning in the market and our successful execution against our long-term growth strategy. \u2047 Furthermore, our performance demonstrates that we continue to take share in a fractured market and deliver high-quality, sustainable earnings. \u2047 As a result, we are raising our full year outlook to reflect revenue growth of 22% to 23% and operating margins of 16.9% to 17.1%. \u2047 Customers are clearly responding to our products and channel strategies, and we expect to drive an outstanding finish to the year and beyond. \u2047 On the macro front, the industry remains large and fragmented, with more than half of its sales generated from smaller brick-and-mortar retailers. \u2047 We are one of the strongest market players and have incredible opportunity to capture more of an almost $1 trillion market opportunity. \u2047 We are at a pivotal point of change, both in the way we live and work, and we will intensely focus on our unique ability to capitalize on this change and, in turn, capture market share. \u2047 The housing market continues to hold strong with purchases of larger first and second homes. \u2047 Additionally, hybrid work arrangements continue to gain traction as a permanent work model. \u2047 Both of these trends result in a stronger need and desire to outfit the home for working, entertaining, and cooking. \u2047 In addition, another large point of disruption is the shift of the consumers to make purchases online. \u2047 Certain factors continue to bolster the shift in behavior, including the lasting impact of the stay-at-home dynamics of the pandemic and the entrance of the millennial generation into their home formation years, a customer segment who naturally gravitates toward digital purchasing. \u2047 In an industry occupied by market players who have not yet made significant investment in their e-commerce capabilities and pure e-commerce players without the service element of our retail business, we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend as a digital first, but not digital-only company. \u2047 Our incredible store shopping experience satisfies our cross-channel customers who shop both online and in-store. \u2047 Our customers continue to place importance on and in many instances, demands the prioritization of sustainability. \u2047 In fact, almost 70% of consumers today want to support brands that are purpose-driven and doing good in the world we share. \u2047 Our company is committed to being a value-led, sustainable company and is proud to be a leader in the home furnishing industry. \u2047 In short, the fragmented industry, the strong housing market, the shift of the consumer online, and the consumer demand for sustainability provide specific unique and sizable opportunities for our company to continue to grow. \u2047 And these macro trends are a perfect fit with our key differentiators. \u2047 Our in-house design capabilities, along with our depth ability to value engineer our products, allow us to offer exclusive, relevant, and high-quality products. \u2047 Our channel strategy provides a competitive edge in scaling the business into the future compared to both the retail and marketplace dominant players. \u2047 And of course, our values, which are deeply rooted in sustainability, diversity, equity, and inclusion, are embedded in our products and central in our actions. \u2047 These principles have been and will continue to be fundamental and nonnegotiable to the customers and communities we serve. \u2047 This, combined with our growth strategies, not only provide for sizable opportunities to grow our core businesses, but also to drive momentum in reaching new customers, geographies, and industries. \u2047 This expansion and diversification of our customer base present many exciting opportunities to deliver solutions for underserved spaces and places, from B2B which brings an exciting new customer profile, to our global business which drives expansion across new geographies, to our cross-brand and marketplace opportunities which expands the reach of our current bank and to the expansion of Williams-Sonoma Home, which attends to an underserved, high-end luxury market and has massive future potential for scaling. \u2047 We have, in fact, many opportunities to drive our business forward into the next chapter of growth. \u2047 Simply put, it's these macro shifts, combined with our key differentiators and our long-term growth prospects that result in us strongly believing in our ability to continue to take market share and deliver earnings well into the future. \u2047 Before we talk about Q3, let's take a minute to review the supply chain, which I know is top of mind for all. \u2047 It is no surprise that we have been intensely focused on the supply chain bottlenecks around the world. \u2047 Like all companies, we are not immune to the ripple effect from these short-term and long-term delays. \u2047 I want to share with you our status and the extraordinary accomplishments of the team. \u2047 Our upholstery lead times continue to improve and are industry leading as a result of our in-house domestic capabilities. \u2047 Our immediate and decisive responsiveness, our strong long-term vendor relationships and our scale have all minimized production and delivery delays relative to our competition. \u2047 And as a result, approximately 85% of our holiday receipts have already been received. \u2047 And finally, when we have delays, customer service is our priority, which has resulted in declines in escalations, cancellations, and calls into the care center. \u2047 All that said, I do want to highlight some important challenges we are facing as a result of this supply chain disruption. \u2047 First, as you know, we sourced a sizable amount of inventory out of Vietnam, which was recently shut down for three months. \u2047 This country has since reopened but is experiencing significant backlog across factories as they ramp up. \u2047 As a result, we are experiencing some inventory delays, particularly in our children's home furnishings businesses. \u2047 Second, given the ongoing strong demand we are seeing across our business and the impact of the Vietnam delays, we do not expect full recovery of our inventory levels until the middle of 2022. \u2047 Now let's turn to the results of the third quarter, which clearly demonstrates the strength of our business and our ability to execute with all brands outperforming again this quarter. \u2047 West Elm delivered a 22.5% comp, with all categories driving strong growth. \u2047 The upholstery business was very strong, and customers responded well to new products, including best sellers in bedroom, dining, and occasional categories. \u2047 Additionally, new categories such as Bass, Kids and Kitchens, also contributed to incremental growth. \u2047 Pottery Barn delivered another high-performance quarter, with a comp of 15.9%, driven by strong growth in all product categories, including our seasonal decorating business. \u2047 In addition, we saw strength across our core lifestyle furniture category, our design services, and our furniture advantage growth initiatives such as apartment and our curated marketplace assortments. \u2047 Pottery Barn Kids and Teens grew with a comp of 16.9%. \u2047 The demand for our GREENGUARD Gold-certified furniture remains strong, emphasizing the importance of both our proprietary design aesthetic and our commitment to sustainability in our customers' buying decisions. \u2047 Our baby business continues to accelerate as our customers expand their families and the response to our holiday and gifting offerings was strong with Halloween products driving record results. \u2047 Both our exclusive products and WS branded products continued to grow, and we saw strength in key entertaining items. \u2047 Operationally, an intensified focus in our key vendor partnerships has allowed us to increase inventory positions in high-demand categories, despite a supply chain-constrained environment. \u2047 And we believe the improvements made to our online and store experience yield momentum in the quarter. \u2047 Finally, last week, the brand launched a new recipe app and a reserve membership program, both of which provide a new way for our customers to engage with the brand while supporting our ongoing strategic initiative to develop and deploy content distribution. \u2047 Our Williams-Sonoma Home business is also accelerating as a result of our strategy to reposition the brand as a premium online furniture destination. \u2047 Pottery Barn, we're excited to share that our B2B growth initiative continues to produce record performance with our largest quarter ever, generating over $200 million of sales, nearly double that of last year. \u2047 Significant accomplishments of the business include an increase of 44% in new clients over last year, an acceleration of our contract grade lineup as businesses reopen and growth and diversification in our large project pipeline. \u2047 The business is also building across industries, capturing additional market share. \u2047 This growth initiative continues to outperform, and we see significant opportunity for this business to contribute long term. \u2047 In our cross-brand global business, we are focused on expansion, but through a disciplined capital-light brand-enhancing franchise model. \u2047 This quarter, we opened our first franchise store in India and rolled out e-commerce capabilities across that country to great success. \u2047 As we look forward, we see additional opportunities to lead in digital around the world. \u2047 Additionally, our initiatives to promote selling across our brands continue to yield results. \u2047 Cross-selling metrics, including total customers and percent of total of customers shopping across brands, are at record levels. \u2047 Not surprisingly, the spend of a cross-brand customer is a multiple of that, a single brand shopper, and increasing our share of spend with these customers will have a significant impact on incremental volume for the long term. \u2047 We are excited about the many initiatives we have in place to capture this opportunity. \u2047 Also in this quarter, we launched our new cross-brand credit card program, where customers can apply for credit, purchase, and earn rewards any of our brands. \u2047 This new initiative complements our existing loyalty program for all other tenders. \u2047 These two tiers of loyalty programs help us acquire and retain customers irrespective of their method of payment. \u2047 The advantage of our loyalty program is twofold. \u2047 First, as we previously shared, the multi-brand customers were two to three times more than the single brand customer. \u2047 We know we have an opportunity to increase our share of wallet with these customers. \u2047 And with our portfolio of complementary brands, this is a tremendous competitive advantage, few, if any, have in our industry. \u2047 Second, our loyalty program dramatically enhances the richness of our first-party data. \u2047 With almost 70% of our volume derived from e-commerce, we understand the importance of first-party data in the cookie less future that is rapidly approaching. \u2047 The loyalty program, along with hundreds of other attributes, in our in-house file is consolidated across our brands and channels, which allows us the ability to aggregate browsing behavior, transactions, demographics, channel preferences, and many other attributes. \u2047 This rich first-party data, along with our own in-house advertising expertise, allows us to be prepared and equipped as privacy rules evolve across the digital space. \u2047 And finally, I'd like to spend a minute on our impact initiatives. \u2047 We are proud to announce that in the third quarter, we raised minimum wages again to at least $15 an hour for all of our employees. \u2047 Additionally, we also announced new goals to both expand our purchase of next ethically handcrafted products to 50 million and to nearly double our investments in fair trade certified products to 10 million by 2025. \u2047 As the first home furnishings retailer to set significant ESG goals, we continue to lead the industry. \u2047 These actions not only positively impact people and communities that make source and distribute our products but also deliver value to our stakeholders, customers, vendors, shareholders, and our communities. \u2047 And our unwavering commitment to values is gaining further recognition. \u2047 For example, our Pottery Barn renewed program was included in Fast Company's 2021 Innovation By Design Awards. \u2047 We are rated top score about the Sustainability Furnishings Council for the fourth year running. \u2047 And our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded to AA, driven by our strong commitment to ethical production and our newly announced climate goals, which further distinguishes our company as a leader in sustainability. \u2047 As we enter the fourth quarter, we are seeing strong sales and margins continuing. \u2047 We are thrilled with our customers' response to our holiday and gifting assortment, and we are ready to drive an outstanding finish to the year. \u2047 Our teams are prepared to fulfill record orders leveraging our new technological capabilities and maximizing our digital-first omni advantage to meet the outsized demand we are seeing from our customers. \u2047 In summary, with our strong results to date, our winning positioning in the industry and our outperforming growth strategies, we are more confident than ever in the long-term strength of our business into fiscal 2022 and beyond. \u2047 We continue to be confident in our outlook of at least mid- to high single-digit comps, accelerating our revenues to 10 billion by 2024, with operating margins at least that of fiscal 2021. \u2047 Their talent, energy, and commitment underscore all of the success that we have had. \u2047 And with that, I'd like to wish you all a happy holiday season. \u2047 We are pleased to report another quarter of record revenues and profitability. \u2047 It is clear that our high-quality products and value proposition are resonating with our customers. \u2047 Our growth strategies are outperforming, and our operating model is positioned well to continue to deliver revenue growth and profitability into the future. \u2047 Our unique operating model has proven to be a competitive advantage and difficult to replicate. \u2047 95% of our products are proprietary or exclusive to our brands. \u2047 We have a vertically integrated digital first but not digital-only operating model that is nearly 70% e-commerce in an industry that primarily consists of brick-and-mortar or pure e-commerce players, and we are a sustainable and values-led company. \u2047 These advantages, along with the macro trends that favor our business, a strong housing market, the permanent adoption of hybrid work, a shift to online purchasing and the demand from customers for values and sustainability in their products are clearly driving our results and will fuel our growth and profitability for the long term. \u2047 Turning to our third quarter results in more detail. \u2047 Net revenues grew 16% to $2.048 billion, with comparable brand revenue growth of 16.9%, with comps accelerating to 41.3% on a two-year basis. \u2047 This strong performance was broad-based across all brands and both channels. \u2047 In fact, against tougher compares, our e-commerce business accelerated to over 67% of our total revenues from the"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 non-gaap earnings per share of $3.32.  \u2047  q3 non-gaap earnings per share $3.32.  \u2047
