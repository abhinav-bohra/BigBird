Ken will then provide a quarterly financial review and give more texture on the strength we're seeing in the demand trends across our portfolio. \u2047 After that, we'll start the Q&A session. \u2047 So let's start with quarterly results. \u2047 Our revenue was $340 million, up 12% overall and 3% on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 Our core organic product revenue increased 9% and driven by growth across our fire service and industrial PPE segments, partially offset by lower fixed gas and flame detection business, which was impacted by supply constraints. \u2047 Looking more closely at the quarterly comparison, I want to note that our 2020 third quarter benefited from higher pandemic-driven demand for air-purifying respirators. \u2047 In the current quarter, we saw our APR business return to more normal levels, which was a headwind to overall growth. \u2047 I noted on our second quarter call that our order book was strengthening, and that continued to be the case in the third quarter. \u2047 As an example, our backlog has increased $50 million, year-over-year. \u2047 Notably, the backlog across our gas detection as well as our firefighter apparel is trending at record levels. \u2047 Overall, our business remained healthy in the quarter, but supply chain disruptions in electronics and, to a lesser degree, labor shortages, did have impact on our delivery capabilities for some products. \u2047 In addition, our quarterly profitability was impacted by variable compensation resets and higher selling commissions along with discretionary costs as business conditions improve relative to last year. \u2047 Lastly, in this inflationary environment, pricing continues to be a key area of focus for us. \u2047 We implemented off-cycle increases to help mitigate higher input costs, and we continue to evaluate pricing as market conditions evolve. \u2047 With that as a backdrop, there are three key takeaways from the quarter that support my confidence in the outlook for MSA and our ability to navigate this environment. \u2047 First, our strong balance sheet provides plenty of capacity to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities. \u2047 Two, the MSA brand continues to be a pillar of strength. \u2047 I'm grateful that our customers see value in our products, and have been patient in waiting on delivery. \u2047 We're not experiencing any significant cancellations of orders. \u2047 And three, the engagement level of our associates and their passion for the mission of MSA has never been greater, adding fuel to our dedication of protecting the lives of workers throughout the world. \u2047 So first, let me talk about inorganic growth. \u2047 We completed the acquisition of Bacharach in a quarter and are making good progress in our efforts to integrate Bacharach into the MSA organization. \u2047 Recent milestones include the completion of a number of key initiatives that will help us meet financial targets that we've discussed with you on past calls. \u2047 Ken will provide more detail on the excellent progress we're making with Bacharach. \u2047 And with our net debt to trailing EBITDA below two times, we continue to evaluate additional inorganic growth opportunities, staying focused on how we can continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders. \u2047 Second, we remain very well positioned as the technology leader in safety. \u2047 We continue to invest in new product development to drive organic growth while providing our customers with innovative market-leading solutions to address their challenges of protecting their employees, and increasing productivity. \u2047 The most recent example of this is the new connected work platform, our team unveiled at the National Safety Congress earlier this month. \u2047 With the many complexities associated with implementing a world-class safety program, the value of technology that drives both compliance and efficiency by simplifying safety procedures, and remotely connecting safety managers to our employees has never been more important. \u2047 This connected services platform will help customers create safer and more efficient work environments through reliable and actionable data in real time. \u2047 The new offering is a powerful hardware, software combination. \u2047 It features a new wearable cloud-ready gas detection device, the ALTAIR io4 that enables a broad range of capabilities not previously available with unconnected devices. \u2047 With direct cellular connectivity, real-time location, live gas readings and automated compliance reporting. \u2047 This platform provides work site managers with new safety insights and added peace of mind. \u2047 Another element of MSA's connected work platform is a safety subscription that extends warranty coverage, and provides automatic and ongoing software upgrades. \u2047 With this subscription, safety managers have a convenient way to stay on the forefront of safety innovation and on budget. \u2047 This new connected technology platform is a great example of the market-leading work being done by our engineering, marketing and sales teams to drive productivity for our customers. \u2047 MSA was recently recognized as a 2021 top workplace by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \u2047 What makes this award particularly gratifying is the fact that it's based exclusively on employee feedback. \u2047 For 2021, we also earned the New Ideas Award. \u2047 The award is based on having the highest positive response rate to the prompt question, new ideas are encouraged at this company. \u2047 These recognitions are reflective of the truly special culture we have at MSA. \u2047 Associate engagement is always important to us. \u2047 And it's especially inspiring to know that this kind of sentiment exists at a time when we faced a myriad of challenges associated with the pandemic. \u2047 We're executing a number of strategic programs to position MSA for continued success, and none of that happens without attracting, developing and retaining the brightest talent, and these recognitions will certainly help us on that front. \u2047 I'll start the discussion with financial highlights centered around revenue, profitability and cash flow. \u2047 Revenue growth was healthy in the third quarter with core revenue growth of 19%. \u2047 This included 9% growth in organic core revenue on a constant currency basis. \u2047 We're seeing robust customer demand, especially in the Americas segment. \u2047 However, the persistent electronic component shortage, and labor challenges to a lesser extent, have impacted our ability to fulfill orders and is driving backlog to record levels. \u2047 Adjusted operating margin was 15% in the quarter, which was down year-over-year driven by -- driven primarily by variable compensation resets and higher selling commissions and discretionary costs. \u2047 These costs are resetting from an abnormally low base in 2020. \u2047 Cash flow performance was very healthy in the quarter and continues to support ongoing investment in growth opportunities and return of capital to our shareholders. \u2047 We're managing working capital well, and that resulted in strong improvements in quarterly cash flow. \u2047 Now let's take a closer look at the financial results in the third quarter. \u2047 I'll start with a focus on revenue. \u2047 Quarterly revenue of $340 million was up 12% overall and 3% on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 While our noncore business was off considerably on the lower level of APR revenues, it was encouraging to see core product revenues up 19% with 9% organic growth in the quarter. \u2047 We are seeing robust demand in the Americas segment, while revenue in the International segment is being impacted by the prevalence of COVID-19, resulting in a very uneven economic recovery across those regions, with particular weakness in the emerging markets in the International segment. \u2047 The quarterly book-to-bill was above one times in the quarter. \u2047 While order pace strengthened throughout the quarter, supply chain constraints around electronic components, and labor availability to a lesser extent, are impacting our ability to deliver in certain areas. \u2047 This has resulted in backlog increasing approximately $50 million year-over-year at the end of the quarter. \u2047 It's difficult to predict how long the supply chain challenges will last, but at this point, we expect that the constraints around electronic components will persist well into 2022. \u2047 Gross profit was 42.9% of sales in the quarter compared to 43.4% of sales in the prior year. \u2047 Gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 120 basis points for deal-related costs and amortization. \u2047 Excluding this, gross profit margin was up a healthy 70 basis points compared to a year ago. \u2047 We have implemented off-cycle price increases to offset inflation, we're seeing in electronic components, resins and other materials. \u2047 That said, the timing difference between pricing going effective and persistent cost inflation resulted in a tough price cost environment in the quarter. \u2047 We continue to evaluate pricing opportunities and have another price adjustment in Q4 in North America and early next year in international. \u2047 SG&A expense of $87 million was up $23 million from a year ago on a reported basis. \u2047 I want to spend a moment to dissect that amount as there are a lot of moving pieces in the quarter. \u2047 To level set, Q3 2020 SG&A of $65 million was abnormally low due to favorable compensation-related adjustments and the lack of discretionary spending. \u2047 The key drivers of the year-over-year increases are: First, we had an increase of approximately $10 million of expense from the acquisitions of Bacharach in Bristol, of which about $6 million will be recurring going forward; second, variable compensation resets and higher selling commissions added $6 million compared to last year; lastly, Discretionary costs are up $3 million associated with the increase in customer-facing activities. \u2047 Our quarterly adjusted operating margin was 15%, down 260 basis points from a year ago. \u2047 Looking at our segment performance, the Americas margin was 19.4%, down 160 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 The higher SG&A costs, I discussed previously had a significant impact on the segment. \u2047 International margin was 11.3%, down 290 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 International margins were impacted by lower organic revenue and higher SG&A on the drivers, discussed previously. \u2047 Our quarterly effective tax rate was 31.5% on a GAAP basis. \u2047 Adjusting for nonrecurring transaction costs and other restructuring matters, the effective tax rate was 24.7% in the quarter. \u2047 Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. \u2047 Quarterly free cash flow was $36 million, well above 100% conversion. \u2047 While overall working capital performance was strong, and improvements in receivables. \u2047 We built some inventory in the quarter, which aligns with our backlog. \u2047 We continue to execute on a balanced capital allocation strategy. \u2047 In the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Bacharach and the buyout of our joint venture interest in China. \u2047 In the quarter, we borrowed a net $282 million of debt to fund our corporate development activity, funded $17 million of dividends to shareholders and invested $11 million in capex. \u2047 We finished the quarter with cash of $117 million and net debt of $495 million or 1.8 times adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 While we continue to take a measured approach on M&A, our strong balance sheet provides ample capacity to continue to invest in organic and inorganic growth opportunities. \u2047 Before moving on, I want to provide an update on Bacharach now that we have had a full quarter of contribution. \u2047 The integration effort is progressing as planned, and the teams are working well together. \u2047 Bacharach contributed about $15 million of sales in the quarter, in line with what we communicated when we closed the acquisition earlier this quarter. \u2047 The Bacharach business is contending with many of the same electronic component challenges we are experiencing at MSA. \u2047 Looking forward, we're pleased with the order book and backlog, and are focused on driving conversion to sales. \u2047 We continue to expect earnings accretion from the acquisition in line with the range we previously discussed. \u2047 In the quarter, we had a noncash adjustment to the product liability reserve, which resulted in just about $9 million of additional expense compared to a year ago. \u2047 This increase is a result of an increase in the number of asserted cumulative trauma claims pending against our subsidiary, MSA LLC \u2047 We continue to monitor developments and filing rates. \u2047 We will be conducting our annual review process in the fourth quarter, which we expect to be finalized with our 10-K filing early next year. \u2047 As we look ahead, we continue to operate in a very dynamic environment. \u2047 Supply chain is the largest variable for us. \u2047 Raw material availability as well as the cost of those inputs can be difficult to predict. \u2047 To put it in perspective, we had $11 million lower revenue versus 2019 this quarter. \u2047 The backlog is up well over $70 million versus the same period in 2019. \u2047 We're laser-focused on executing initiatives to mitigate the impact of the supply chain challenges on our business, both on the top line and the margin profile. \u2047 It is clear that the economic recovery is progressing, and we see good strength in our Americas segment. \u2047 COVID-19 continues to have an impact on the world to varying degrees. \u2047 We are seeing the impact in our International segment, where the demand recovery has taken a little longer. \u2047 Over the course of the year, we have continued to invest in organic and inorganic growth programs that enhance our position as the safety technology leader. \u2047 I'm proud of our team's unwavering commitment to our mission, our business and our customers. \u2047 We've recently launched innovative new products and services with the ALTAIR io4 and MSA+ service and enhanced our gas detection product suite with the acquisition of Bacharach. \u2047 And to finish it out, we remain committed to investing in growth and profit improvement programs that will drive value and best position MSA for long-term value creation. \u2047 For all of us at MSA, safety is our mission, our passion and it's our purpose. \u2047 It goes to our associates who work at our Cranberry Township production facility and corporate center. \u2047 This team recently surpassed a remarkable 10 million hours without a lost time incident. \u2047 This means it's been more than five years since we've had an LTI at our Cranberry Township campus. \u2047 While the balance of 2021 will continue to present us with various challenges, I have tremendous confidence in our strategy and the team we have executing it. \u2047 Our business has demonstrated, its resiliency through a number of economic cycles today our products, people and passion position us to manage through this current cycle. \u2047 As I've communicated to our global workforce, I believe we are positioned extremely well as the leader in safety technology, ready to emerge as an even stronger organization in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 At this time, Ken and I will be glad to take any questions you may have. \u2047 Please remember that MSA does not give guidance. \u2047 "],
