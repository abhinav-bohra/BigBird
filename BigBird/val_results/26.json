{"article": ["I'm Monica Vinay, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer at Myers Industries. \u2047 If you've not yet received a copy of the release, you can access it on our website at www. \u2047 myersindustries.com, it's under the Investor Relations tab. \u2047 These comments are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \u2047 Such statements are based on management's current expectations and involve risks uncertainties and other factors, which may cause results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. \u2047 Further information concerning these risks, uncertainties and other factors is set forth in the company's periodic SEC filings and may be found in the company's 10-K and 10-Q filings. \u2047 We continued our growth trajectory during the quarter, and we made further progress on our long-term strategy despite a difficult macro environment that's impacting many businesses around the world. \u2047 During the quarter, we saw continued strong demand from our material handling and distribution customers. \u2047 This demand, combined with meaningful contributions from our recent acquisitions, drove the company to $200 million in net sales and more than 50% revenue growth for a second consecutive quarter. \u2047 The company's top line was the strongest it has been in many years. \u2047 On organic basis, sales grew 20% compared to the prior year period which marks three consecutive quarters of 20% or more organic growth. \u2047 We are beginning to see the benefit of our investments in our sales force and sales training and an improved commercial focus across the company. \u2047 While our top line performance was strong, we did see macroeconomic headwinds again this quarter, which impacted our margins. \u2047 Input costs climbed higher due to increasing raw material costs, and tightness in the labor market impacted labor costs, both of these drove margin compression during the period. \u2047 The negative impacts of labor were due to overtime pay, higher wages and in some cases, the lack of labor, which inhibited us from making or shipping certain orders. \u2047 While we believe inflationary labor and supply chain headwinds will likely persist for the next several quarters, we are taking numerous actions to mitigate possible impacts on our business. \u2047 These proactive steps include improvements in our sales and operations planning process, a reinvigorated sales force and the addition of a pricing excellence leader and team. \u2047 We're also working hard to debottleneck and automate our plants, while we continue to secure the raw materials necessary to ensure that we meet the volume needs of our customers. \u2047 We remain confident in our ability to manage price, volume and cost. \u2047 And as such, we are reaffirming our previous 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. \u2047 Myers demonstrated growth is meaningful. \u2047 Our company is becoming a growth story. \u2047 A new Myers is here. \u2047 We're pleased with the growth to date, and we expect this new growth mindset to be a sustained theme and focus at Myers Industries. \u2047 In the short term, however, we continue to see an inflationary environment that is compounded by labor shortages and supply chain issues. \u2047 To manage through it, we made a few near-term supply oriented decisions that consume cash in the third quarter. \u2047 These decisions were made to ensure we continue our high service level to our customers, and we expect cash flow trends to normalize in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Let's begin with a review of our third quarter financial results on Slide four. \u2047 Net sales were up $68 million, an increase of 51%. \u2047 Excluding the impact of the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisitions, organic net sales increased 20% driven by price, which contributed 13%. \u2047 Higher volume mix contributed 7%. \u2047 Sales increased in all key end markets in both Materials Handling and Distribution segments. \u2047 Adjusted gross profit increased $7.2 million, while gross margin decreased from 35.6% in the prior year to 27.2% in the third quarter. \u2047 Gross margin was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and higher labor costs which were not fully offset by pricing actions, has led to an unfavorable price-to-cost relationship. \u2047 Included in cost of sales was a $1.6 million increase related to the LIFO inventory reserve. \u2047 Adjusted operating income decreased $3.1 million to $12.5 million due to increased SG&A, driven by the addition of Elkhart and Trilogy along with higher compensation cost and higher professional fees. \u2047 Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased to 20.9% in the third quarter compared to 23.8% in the prior year as we are experiencing the benefits of our overall larger scale on our infrastructure. \u2047 We're pleased with the investments we are making in support of our One Myers work strategy are yielding positive results. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $17.3 million, a decrease of $2.3 million compared to the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.6%. \u2047 And lastly, adjusted earnings per share was $0.23, a decrease of $0.07 or 23% compared to the prior year. \u2047 Turning now to Slide five for an overview of segment performance for the quarter. \u2047 Beginning with Material Handling, net sales increased $63 million or 73%, including the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisition. \u2047 On an organic basis, Material Handling net sales increased 26%, driven by favorable price of 18%. \u2047 Strong volume mix contributed another 7% and FX, 1%. \u2047 Organic net sales increased in the vehicle, industrial and food and beverage end markets. \u2047 You may recall that our consumer end market was up significantly last year, driven by increased storm activity, which led to higher demand for our fuel containers. \u2047 Material Handling adjusted operating income decreased $1.3 million or 8% to $15.2 million. \u2047 The decrease was driven by an unfavorable price-to-cost relationship resulting from escalating raw materials and labor costs, which were not fully offset by pricing actions. \u2047 Additionally, SG&A expenses increased primarily due to the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisition, higher compensation costs, travel costs and professional fees. \u2047 In the Distribution segment, sales increased $5 million or 11%. \u2047 Volume mix contributed 6%, resulting from increases across both equipment and supplies and price contributed 5%. \u2047 Distribution's adjusted operating income decreased $700,000 to $4.4 million due to an increase in SG&A expenses, which were more than offset higher volume mix and favorable price-to-cost relationship. \u2047 Turning to Slide six. \u2047 Working capital timing negatively impacted our cash flow for the quarter. \u2047 Free cash flow was negative $13.8 million compared with positive free cash flow of $16.2 million for the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Cash from operations decreased in the quarter due to increases in working capital, driven by a $14 million and an $8 million increase in accounts receivable and inventory, respectively, combined with a $3 million decrease in trade accounts payable. \u2047 Additionally, capital expenditures were $6 million in the quarter. \u2047 Sales were more weighted in the back half of the quarter, contributing to the elevated accounts receivable balance. \u2047 In addition to higher raw material costs, our focus on meeting our customers' needs also contributed to higher inventory levels. \u2047 Year-to-date free cash flow was essentially flat, down $700,000. \u2047 Cash on hand at quarter end was $15 million. \u2047 We expect working capital to turn favorable in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Overall, our balance sheet remains strong and gives us the flexibility needed to execute on our long-term growth strategy. \u2047 As a reminder, on July 30, we utilized our revolving credit facility to finance the Trilogy Plastics acquisition. \u2047 We ended the third quarter with leverage at 1.8 times. \u2047 On Slide seven, turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2021. \u2047 We anticipate net sales to increase in the mid- to high 40% range attributed to both organic growth and acquisitions. \u2047 Our previous sales guidance was in the mid-40% range. \u2047 A little more than half of the growth for the year is expected to come from the Elkhart and Trilogy acquisition. \u2047 Elkhart's annual net sales at the time of acquisition were approximately $100 million and Trilogy's annual net sales were roughly $35 million. \u2047 While rising input costs and labor pressures continue to impact our profit growth and margins during the third quarter, we are seeing signs of resin cost easing and are cautiously optimistic it will begin to decline as we move through the fourth quarter. \u2047 This, combined with additional pricing actions affected in the fourth quarter should result in a favorable price-to-cost relationship for the quarter. \u2047 Taking these considerations into account, we are reaffirming our 2021 outlook for adjusted earnings per share of $0.90 to $1.05 per share. \u2047 Our guidance reflects a weighted average share count of 36.5 million shares and the addition of the newly acquired Trilogy business. \u2047 As a reminder, Trilogy is expected to be only slightly accretive to earnings per share in the current fiscal year. \u2047 Our key modeling assumptions include depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $22 million and capex of approximately $16 million to $19 million, up slightly from our previous capex guidance of $15 million to $18 million. \u2047 capex is expected to trend higher than past years with our renewed focus of investing in our facilities and improving our capacity along with the addition of Elkhart and Trilogy. \u2047 The effective tax rate is forecast to approximate 26%. \u2047 In closing, while the short term continues to be impacted by macroeconomic factors, our fundamentals remain intact. \u2047 We are extremely pleased with the demand for our portfolio of products along with our ability to pass along the value proposition they bring through pricing actions. \u2047 We are making solid progress on our One Myers initiative, which Mike will share with you momentarily. \u2047 Starting on Slide eight. \u2047 It's been a little more than a year since I first introduced our long-term road map and broader One Myers strategy. \u2047 I'm very proud of the considerable progress we've made to date. \u2047 I have a lot of passion for this company, our company, I see the upside and the opportunity every day. \u2047 We're currently well into the middle innings on Horizon one of our transformation. \u2047 As a company, we are aligned and centered on our true north, our mission, which is to transform our Material Handling segment into a high-growth business as the true innovator of engineered plastic solutions while we also continue to grow and optimize our Distribution segment. \u2047 As I outlined in the past, Horizon one is built on driving self-help initiatives to improve profitability and then using these proceeds to fund organic growth through sales and commercial excellence and bolt-on programmatic M&A. \u2047 We've made meaningful progress across each of these areas. \u2047 As we continue to execute the remainder of Horizon 1, we'll have the necessary foundation, knowledge and track record to move into Horizon two. \u2047 We will continue with the self-help and organic growth efforts, but will use the enterprise level M&A to create shareholder value. \u2047 After the completion of Horizon two, we will transition into Horizon three, where we approach M&A on more of a global scale. \u2047 Our One Myers vision and the associated transformation of our business is rooted in our ultimate goal of maximizing long-term value creation for our shareholders, we believe, will be achieved as we execute on this plan. \u2047 Slide nine covers the four strategic pillars that support our One Myers vision. \u2047 My approach is to be consistent, almost broadly consistent on the pillars and on the levers and the areas of focus we're using to drive our transformation. \u2047 Because they are the bedrock, the foundation of our transformation, we must maintain consistency in our approach in order to provide direction to our people and ensure execution success. \u2047 These pillars and work tracks are straightforward and not terribly complicated. \u2047 Our success comes from our relentless and dogged pursuit of their execution. \u2047 Since I've covered these pillars extensively in the past, I'll move on to Slide 10 to update you on the progress we've made across each of these as it relates to our first horizon. \u2047 We've displayed an outstanding growth -- organic growth trajectory over the last several quarters and believe we are taking the right action to help sustain this momentum. \u2047 We are building a world-class commercial organization at Myers through the continued addition of strong talent at the middle level and the new and rejuvenated marketing, product management and sales structure we put in place. \u2047 We've also invested in sales training and improving our sales processes to drive organic growth, customer intimacy and pricing to value not to cost. \u2047 Additionally, our investments in e-commerce continue to take flight. \u2047 E-commerce is showing encouraging results with year-to-date sales up approximately 30%. \u2047 We've learned to use e-commerce as a flywheel for volume and have found that it is an excellent channel. \u2047 We're able to accept or decline business that helps us best optimize our assets capabilities. \u2047 This flywheel approach will become more impactful as we get better at S&OP and improve how we balance our growing demand across our facilities. \u2047 Moving on to M&A. \u2047 Growth via acquisition is and will continue to be an integral part of our One Myers strategy. \u2047 We closed on our acquisition of Trilogy Plastics earlier this quarter and are very excited about its prospects. \u2047 Trilogy enhances our ability to manufacture highly engineered and tight tolerance specialty products. \u2047 We're already taking some of the learnings and best practices from Trilogy into our plants that were legacy Ameri-Kart or Elkhart Plastics. \u2047 So far, three months in, the integration of Trilogy is going well and is right in line with our expectations. \u2047 As a reminder, the integration of Elkhart has also gone well, helping us better serve our customers and capture growth synergies and $4 million to $6 million of cost synergies, both of which exceed expectations. \u2047 From a big picture perspective, through our two acquisitions over the last year, we are making progress on developing an effective framework for selecting high-quality companies that complement our businesses. \u2047 And as equally important, we're on our way to developing a strong, repeatable playbook and processes to ensure a successful integration of these acquired companies. \u2047 We have lost connection with our speakers. \u2047 We will be with you in just a second. \u2047 We now have the team back on the line. \u2047 I will hand back over to Mike McGaugh. \u2047 Sorry about that, folks. \u2047 And I'm not exactly sure where it dropped, but I'll pick up around e-commerce. \u2047 So that's a great place, a great thing. \u2047 So additionally, our investments in e-commerce continue to take flight. \u2047 E-commerce is showing encouraging results with year-to-date sales up approximately 30%. \u2047 We've learned to use e-commerce as a flywheel for volume and found that it's an excellent channel. \u2047 We're able to
