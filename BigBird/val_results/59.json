{"article": ["In particular, the extent of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business remains uncertain at this time. \u2047 During today's call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 As for the content of today's call, Kevin will start with a discussion of the business, and Lewis will follow with a recap of Dolby's financial results and provide our third quarter and second half fiscal 2021 outlook. \u2047 With another strong performance in licensing revenues this quarter, we are off to a solid start to our fiscal year. \u2047 Our first half fiscal 2021 revenues have grown about 10% compared to the first half of fiscal 2020, and earnings have grown at an even higher rate. \u2047 Our financial results reflect the strength of Dolby's business model and the broad adoption of Dolby Technologies across the devices and services that consumers are seeking to enjoy their content. \u2047 Before Lewis takes you through the numbers, I wanted to highlight some of the areas of our progress and the recent examples of how Dolby is enabling a broader range of content. \u2047 With a growing number of content experiences becoming Dolby experiences, we add to our value proposition for deeper adoption in existing device categories, and we address the use cases for adoption in new device categories, which together drive our opportunities for growth. \u2047 With Dolby Atmos for music, we are enabling a significant step forward in how people can enjoy their favorite songs, which is creating new opportunities to expand the adoption of Dolby Atmos to a broader range of devices and services. \u2047 Lucid Motors announced that they will be bringing the first automobile to market that will include Dolby Atmos. \u2047 The Lucid Air will enable the Dolby Atmos for music experience for the car and is the first example of a significant opportunity to address the primary entertainment use case within automotive. \u2047 Lucid is just one example of how we are creating more ways for consumers to enjoy a growing library of music in Dolby Atmos. \u2047 We have strong engagement with top artists around the world as more songs and albums are being made available in Dolby Atmos, including many recent Grammy-nominated artists like Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and Megan Thee Stallion. \u2047 This quarter, Hungama, a top music streaming service in India began supporting Dolby Atmos. \u2047 They joined TIDAL, Amazon Music and Anghami who are currently streaming music in Dolby Atmos. \u2047 As we continue to build on the momentum for Dolby Atmos for music, we see opportunities for more services to adopt Dolby Atmos, and to deepen our adoption across mobile, PCs, automotive and headphones. \u2047 Gaming is another area where we see much of the opportunity ahead of us, to bring Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to a growing number of experiences. \u2047 Microsoft Xbox will be the first gaming console to support the combined Dolby experience for games. \u2047 Xbox gamers will have more ways to enjoy the Dolby experience with new gaming headsets released this quarter from Microsoft and Bang and Olufsen that highlight support for Dolby Atmos. \u2047 Lenovo recently launched a new mobile phone designed to support gaming content, the Legion Phone Duel two that highlights support for Dolby Atmos. \u2047 We also saw the first eSports event in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos this quarter. \u2047 As part of Blizzard Entertainment's BlizzConline, we enabled an event that showcased Overwatch matches to be viewed in the combined Dolby experience through PCs and gaming consoles. \u2047 eSports gives us unique opportunities to engage gamers by bringing Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos to the experiences that they are passionate about. \u2047 As we grow the number of Dolby experiences within games, we add to our existing value proposition and drive more reasons for adoption on gaming consoles, PCs and mobile phones. \u2047 By expanding our presence in music and gaming, we addressed two of the primary use cases on a mobile device. \u2047 At the same time, we see more ways for Dolby to enable the highest quality experiences across more of the content enjoyed on mobile devices. \u2047 Over the past few quarters, we've highlighted how we are enabling new experiences in mobile, like being able to record in Dolby Vision with the iPhone 12 or being able to enjoy live sports content in Dolby Atmos through a mobile app. \u2047 This quarter, Earshot, a leading podcast service in India became the first podcast app to support Dolby Atmos. \u2047 They will be making Dolby Atmos content available across different genres of podcasts and in multiple languages. \u2047 As we continue to expand the relevance of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across a broader range of content, we address more of the use cases for mobile devices, driving the reasons for deeper adoption with our partners. \u2047 This quarter, Xiaomi launched their first mobile phones that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. \u2047 This adds to the growing number of partners that support the Dolby experience within mobile, which is highlighted by the Apple iPhone 12 lineup that features the combined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience. \u2047 In addition, Samsung, OPPO and Sony continue to highlight Dolby Atmos with the recent launch of their latest flagship models. \u2047 All of this progress adds to our strong position within movie and TV content, which continues to drive more device adoption within the living room. \u2047 This quarter, Samsung released their Q7 sound bar, highlighting support for Dolby Atmos. \u2047 Within TVs, our partners around the world, including Xiaomi, Changhong and Skyworth, released new models that support the combined experience. \u2047 In addition to supporting Dolby Atmos, TCL and Hisense also highlighted support for Dolby Vision IQ within their recent TV launches. \u2047 With this momentum, we still see a significant opportunity ahead to reach higher levels of adoption with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in the living room, similar to the broad presence of our core audio technologies. \u2047 The adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos on devices is driven by a consistent flow of new titles that are being enabled in the combined Dolby experience. \u2047 Our streaming partners, like Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+ and HBO Max, continue to make a broad range of titles available in Dolby, and the combined experience is consistently highlighted with the release of their latest tentpole titles. \u2047 Let me shift to cinema. \u2047 As consumers begin to return to the movies, they are seeking out premium experiences and Dolby Cinema is the best way to enjoy a movie. \u2047 We now have about 90% of our Dolby Cinemas opened globally to certain capacity restrictions. \u2047 Our engagement with exhibitor partners remain strong as we recently added a new Dolby Cinema partner in China, and we also had four new Dolby Cinema locations open during the quarter. \u2047 We also see initial signs of strong box office performance from titles like Godzilla vs. \u2047 Kong and successful local content in China, including Detective Chinatown three and Hi, Mom that were all available in Dolby Cinema. \u2047 We look ahead to anticipated titles later this year, including Top Gun: Maverick, A Quiet Place II and Black Widow that will all be available in Dolby Cinema. \u2047 During the last year, we have started to bring the Dolby magic that powers the best movie, TV and music experiences to a much broader range of content and interactions with Dolby.io, our developer platform. \u2047 Our focus is on deepening our engagement with the developer community, growing the number of developers on the platform and building their engagement with our APIs. \u2047 Just last week, we completed an integration with Box.com and Dolby.io. \u2047 Companies that use Box can now enable their users to easily improve the quality of their audio directly from where their files are stored within Box, powered by Dolby Media APIs. \u2047 We are excited to bring unique solutions to Box's broad range of customers and the opportunity to drive more people to engage with Dolby.io. \u2047 Our interactivity APIs are supporting a wide range of use cases, and we see new customers across multiple industries from online learning to enabling influencers to connect with fans, or even in one case, supporting an application that enables live streaming for medical teams. \u2047 As we look ahead, we also see opportunities where real-time interactions come together with recorded media and we can uniquely provide comprehensive solutions by embedding both our interactivity and media APIs. \u2047 With a growing number of new experiences being enabled by Dolby.io, we are learning from our engagement with developers and evolving our offerings to best support the use cases where we see significant opportunities to bring higher quality media and best-in-class real-time interactions. \u2047 So to wrap up, we have growing momentum in enabling Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences in more forms of content like music and gaming. \u2047 As we enable our technologies to address a broader range of content, we build upon our strong position within movies and TV and create more reasons for adoption across devices and services. \u2047 With Dolby.io, our technologies are beginning to address a much larger world of content experiences and interactions. \u2047 All of this gives us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth into the future. \u2047 And with that, I'm going to hand it over to Lewis to take us through the financials. \u2047 And of course, May the fourth be with you. \u2047 As Kevin said, our financial results were very solid this quarter. \u2047 Revenue and earnings both coming in higher than we previously guided. \u2047 So let me go through a few details for everyone. \u2047 Second quarter revenue of $320 million was above our guidance range of $280 million to $310 million, as the volumes that we had were higher-than-expected in several of our end markets. \u2047 And then we also benefited from a true-up of about $15 million in the quarter for Q1 shipments reported that were above our estimate. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, second quarter revenue was down from last year's $352 million due to lower recoveries and lower revenue from cinema-related business partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Technologies and higher market volume in areas like PC and TV. \u2047 On a sequential basis, total revenue was down from Q1 due to lower recoveries and lower seasonality, and both of these were anticipated when we gave our guidance at the beginning of the quarter. \u2047 So the Q2 revenue was comprised of $304 million in licensing and $16 million in products and services. \u2047 So let's go through the trends in licensing revenue by end market, starting with broadcast. \u2047 Broadcast represented about 35% of total licensing in the second quarter. \u2047 Broadcast revenues decreased by about 19% year-over-year, and that was driven by lower recoveries offset partially by higher market volume along with higher adoption of Dolby. \u2047 On a sequential basis, broadcast decreased by about 25%, due primarily to lower seasonality along with lower recoveries. \u2047 Mobile represented approximately 22% of total licensing in Q2. \u2047 Mobile decreased by about 12% from last year, that was due to a shift in timing of certain contracts, and that was offset partially by higher adoption of our technologies. \u2047 On a sequential basis, mobile was down about 38%, due primarily to lower recoveries and timing of revenue under contracts. \u2047 PC represented about 17% of total licensing in the second quarter. \u2047 PC was higher than last year by about 12% due to higher market volume, along with increased adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. \u2047 And that was offset partially by declining ASP because of mix of our disc versus non-disc units. \u2047 Sequentially, PC was up by about 56%, driven by timing of revenue under contracts, along with seasonally higher activity from patent programs. \u2047 Consumer electronics represented about 16% of total licensing in Q2. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, consumer electronics was lower by about 2% due to a shift in timing of certain contracts offset partially by higher volume in devices like sound bars and DMAs, as well as higher adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. \u2047 On a sequential basis, CE decreased by about 7% due mainly to lower seasonality and timing of revenue under contracts. \u2047 Other markets represented about 10% of total licensing in the second quarter. \u2047 They were up about 14% year-over-year, driven by higher revenue from gaming and automotive, and that was offset partially by lower Dolby cinema revenues. \u2047 On a sequential basis, other markets decreased by about 22%, driven by lower seasonality in gaming and lower admin fees from Via. \u2047 Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue was $16 million in Q2 compared to $16.9 million in Q1 and $23 million in last year's Q2. \u2047 And the year-over-year decrease was attributable to lower demand in the cinema industry because of the pandemic. \u2047 So now I'd like to discuss Q2 margins and operating expenses. \u2047 Total gross margin in the second quarter was 89.9% on a GAAP basis and 90.5% on a non-GAAP basis. \u2047 Products and services gross margin -- products and services gross margin on a GAAP basis was minus $345,000 in Q2 compared to minus $5.5 million in the first quarter. \u2047 Products and services gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was a positive $1.1 million in Q2 compared to a negative $3.9 million in the first quarter. \u2047 As I mentioned when I gave guidance, we took steps to reduce the cost structure in manufacturing, and that's helping our product gross margins return to positive territory. \u2047 Operating expenses in the second quarter on a GAAP basis were $204 million compared to $189.8 million in Q1. \u2047 The annual salary increases for our employee base went into effect at the beginning of Q2. \u2047 And also, Q1 operating expenses benefited from a gain on sale of our facility in Brisbane. \u2047 Operating expenses in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $178.4 million compared to $167.1 million in the first quarter. \u2047 Non-GAAP operating expenses were pretty much in line with the guidance that we gave. \u2047 Operating income in the second quarter was $83.2 million on a GAAP basis or 26% of revenue compared to $105.9 million or 30.1% of revenue in Q2 of last year. \u2047 Operating income in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $110.9 million or 34.7% of revenue compared to $129 million or 36.7% of revenue in Q2 of last year. \u2047 Income tax in Q2 was 10.6% on a GAAP basis and 16% on a non-GAAP basis. \u2047 Net income on a GAAP basis in the second quarter was $76.2 million or $0.73 per diluted share, and that compares to $88.5 million or $0.86 per"], "gold_summary": ["q2 non-gaap earnings per share $0.91.  \u2047  q2 gaap earnings per share $0.73.  \u2047  sees q3 gaap earnings per share $0.15 to $0.30.
