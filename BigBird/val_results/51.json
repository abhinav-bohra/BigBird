{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Don Kimble, our chief financial officer, and Mark Midkiff, our chief risk officer. \u2047 I'm now moving to Slide 3. \u2047 We delivered another strong quarter with earnings per share of $0.72. \u2047 This is an increase of 18% from the first quarter and up significantly from the year-ago period. \u2047 Our results reflect our success in acquiring and deepening relationships across our franchise, further improvement in credit quality, and contributions from targeted investments. \u2047 We generated positive operating leverage on a year-to-date basis and remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year. \u2047 We generated record second-quarter revenue, driven by an 8% year-over-year increase in noninterest income. \u2047 In our consumer business, we experienced record growth in new households in the first six months, in every one of our markets, and in every age group. \u2047 Importantly, some of our strongest growth has come from younger clients in the western part of our franchise. \u2047 Our new client growth over the past six months exceeds our growth in any full-year period over the last decade. \u2047 Additionally, our consumer business generated over 4 billion in loan originations for the quarter. \u2047 Mortgage originations reached another all-time high and we expect to exceed last year's record level of 8.3 billion for the full year. \u2047 Laurel Road also had another strong quarter despite the federal student loan holiday. \u2047 Since the launch of our National Digital Bank, Laurel Road for doctors, we have added over 2,500 new doctors and dentists. \u2047 The launch was an important milestone in our digital journey, which brings together several critical elements of our strategy, targeted scale, digital, healthcare, and primacy. \u2047 Moving to our commercial businesses. \u2047 We had another strong quarter. \u2047 Our investment banking business generated fees of 217 million, a record second-quarter level and the second-highest quarterly level in our history. \u2047 We experienced growth across the entire platform. \u2047 We have grown this business consistently over the past decade, and we expect to grow it again in 2021. \u2047 Importantly, this is a business driven primarily by repeat clients. \u2047 Our pipelines are currently at record levels, supporting our strong growth outlook for the business. \u2047 This quarter, we raised $21 billion for our clients, of which we retained approximately 20% on our balance sheet. \u2047 Expenses this quarter reflect higher production-related incentives and the investments we continue to make across our franchise, in digital, in analytics, and in our teammates. \u2047 Let me highlight just a few of these investments. \u2047 I've already mentioned Laurel Road and the launch of our National Digital Bank. \u2047 Not only have we accelerated client acquisition, but our new clients are doing more with us with approximately half of our new doctor and dentist using multiple products. \u2047 We also continued to build out our analytic capabilities, including our recent acquisition of AQN Strategies, we have doubled the size of our analytics team. \u2047 Year to date, we have increased our senior bankers by 5% and in our targeted growth areas. \u2047 This has resulted in a 21% increase in client pitches on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 We also consolidated 54 branches this quarter with an additional 14 planned for next quarter. \u2047 These consolidations will drive future cost savings and support our ongoing investments. \u2047 Shifting to credit quality. \u2047 Our trends remained positive this quarter. \u2047 Nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, and criticized loans were all down from the prior quarter and net charge-offs to average loans were nine basis points. \u2047 We continue to support our clients while maintaining our moderate risk profile, which has and will continue to position the company to perform well through all business cycles. \u2047 Finally, we have maintained our strong capital position while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. \u2047 Our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 9.9%, which is above our targeted range of 9 to 9.5%. \u2047 Our strong capital position enables us to continue to execute against each of our capital priorities, namely organic growth, dividends, and share repurchases. \u2047 Combining our share repurchases and dividends paid this quarter, we have returned capital representing $0.50 a share for an annualized return of capital of approximately 11% at our current valuation. \u2047 Earlier this month, our board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to 1.5 billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continuing through the third quarter of 2022. \u2047 The board will also evaluate an increase to our common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 Overall, I was very pleased with the quarter, which reflects the hard work and dedication of our team. \u2047 We grew our top line, and we made targeted investments to position the company for continued growth. \u2047 As always, we remain committed to our disciplined approach to risk management and our commitment to return capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \u2047 I'm now on Slide 5. \u2047 As Chris said, it was a strong quarter with net income from continuing operations of $0.72 per common share, up 18% from the prior quarter, and four times from the year-ago period. \u2047 The quarter reflected a net benefit from our provision for credit losses. \u2047 The reserve release was largely driven by our strong credit metrics and expected improvement in the economic environment. \u2047 Importantly, we generated record second-quarter revenue, driven by strength in our fee-based businesses. \u2047 Our reported return on tangible common equity for the quarter was 22.3%. \u2047 Adjusting for the reserve release, ROTCE was 16% within our targeted range of 16 to 19%. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6. \u2047 Total average loans were $101 billion, down 7% from the second quarter of last year. \u2047 C&I loans were down $9 billion, reflecting decreased utilization levels. \u2047 Consumer loans were up 9%, benefiting from continued growth from Laurel Road and, as Chris mentioned, record performance from our consumer mortgage business. \u2047 Combined, we had over $4 billion of originations this quarter between our residential mortgage and Laurel Road production. \u2047 The investments we've made in these areas continue to drive results and, importantly, add high-quality loans and relationships. \u2047 Linked-quarter average loan balances were relatively flat as commercial loans declined due to the commercial utilization rates, partly offset by growth in PPP loans. \u2047 Consumer loans grew 2%, again related to the continued strength from our consumer mortgage and Laurel Road. \u2047 PPP average balances were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up from $7 billion in the first quarter. \u2047 The PPP balances ended the quarter at $5.7 billion, reflecting $2.8 billion of forgiveness, and $900 million of new production. \u2047 Continuing on to Slide 7. \u2047 Average deposits totaled $144 billion for the second quarter of 2021, up $16 billion or 13% compared to the year-ago period, and up 5% from the prior quarter. \u2047 The linked quarter and year-ago comparisons reflect growth in both commercial and consumer balances, which benefited from government stimulus. \u2047 The growth was partially offset by a continued and expected decline in time deposits. \u2047 Total interest-bearing costs came down another two basis points from the first quarter, following a three-basis-point decline last quarter. \u2047 We continue to have a strong, stable core deposit base with consumer deposits accounting for over 60% of our total deposit mix. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8. \u2047 Taxable equivalent net interest income was 1.023 billion for the second quarter of 2021, compared to 1.025 billion a year ago, and 1.012 billion from the prior quarter. \u2047 Our net interest margin was 2.52% for the second quarter, compared to 2.76% from the same period last year and 2.61% for the prior quarter. \u2047 Both net interest income and net interest margin were meaningfully impacted by the significant growth in our balance sheet compared to the year-ago period. \u2047 The larger balance sheet benefited net interest income but reduced the net interest margin due to the significant increase in liquidity driven by strong deposit inflows. \u2047 Compared to the prior quarter, net interest income increased $11 million and the margin declined nine basis points. \u2047 Lower interest-bearing deposit costs and higher loan fees from PPP forgiveness were offset by lower-earning asset yields and continued elevated liquidity levels. \u2047 For the quarter, PPP loan fees, including the impact of forgiveness, totaled $50 million, up $2 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 The significant build in liquidity continues to be the largest driver of our net interest margin. \u2047 We are maintaining around $20 billion in excess cash. \u2047 Cumulatively, excess liquidity has negatively impacted our net interest margin by about 35 basis points with seven basis points of incremental impact for the second quarter. \u2047 Moving to Slide 9. \u2047 We've continued to see strong growth in our fee-based businesses, which have benefited from the investments we've made. \u2047 Noninterest income was $750 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared to 692 million for the year-ago period and 738 million in the first quarter. \u2047 Compared to the year-ago period, noninterest income increased 8%. \u2047 We had a record second quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which reached $217 million driven by a broad base across the platform, including strong M&A fees. \u2047 Commercial mortgage servicing fees increased $32 million. \u2047 Cards and payments income also increased $22 million related to broad-based growth across product categories, including debit, credit, and merchant products. \u2047 This growth was offset by lower consumer mortgage fees resulting from lower gains on sale margin and also the impact of MSR valuation changes. \u2047 Lower operating lease income resulted from leverage lease gains in the year-ago period. \u2047 Compared to the first quarter, noninterest income increased by $12 million. \u2047 The largest driver of the quarterly increase was a record second quarter and the second-highest ever quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees. \u2047 Service charges on deposit accounts and commercial mortgage servicing income also showed strength versus the prior quarter. \u2047 These were partially offset by lower other income due to positive market-related valuation adjustments in the prior period, offset by negative adjustments in the current quarter. \u2047 I'm now on Slide 10. \u2047 Total noninterest expense for the quarter was $1.076 billion, compared to 1.013 billion last year and 1.071 billion in the prior quarter. \u2047 Our expense levels reflect production-related incentives and the investments we've made to drive future growth. \u2047 We have highlighted some of the significant investments on the lower left of this slide. \u2047 We continue to invest in Laurel Road, including the launch of the National Digital Bank, including spend in marketing and technology. \u2047 We also grew senior relationship bankers by 5% year to date in our targeted focus areas, including renewables team that we added in May. \u2047 We've also continued to invest in our digital capabilities, as well as analytics. \u2047 Our analytics team has grown by two and a half times, including our recent acquisition of AQN. \u2047 The increase from the prior year is primarily in personnel expense related to higher production-related incentive compensation and an increase in our stock price. \u2047 Employee benefit costs also increased $16 million as healthcare-related costs were low in the second quarter of last year. \u2047 Computer processing expense this quarter was elevated related to software investments across the platform. \u2047 Compared to the prior quarter, noninterest expense was relatively stable. \u2047 Higher incentive and stock-based compensation was offset by seasonally lower employee benefit cost. \u2047 Marketing costs were up $5 million, primarily related to the launch of the Laurel Road for doctors. \u2047 I'm now on Slide 11. \u2047 Overall, credit quality continues to outperform expectations. \u2047 For the second quarter, net charge-offs were $22 million or nine basis points of average loans. \u2047 Our provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $222 million. \u2047 This was determined based on our continued strong credit metrics, as well as our outlook for the overall economy. \u2047 Nonperforming loans were $694 million this quarter or 69 basis points of period-end loans, a decline of $34 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 Additionally, criticized loans declined and the over 90-day delinquencies improved quarter over quarter. \u2047 Now on to Slide 12. \u2047 Key's capital position remains an area of strength. \u2047 We ended the second quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.9%, which places us above our targeted range of 9 to 9.5%. \u2047 This provides us with sufficient capacity to continue to support our customers and their borrowing needs and return capital to our shareholders. \u2047 Importantly, we continue to return capital to our shareholders in accordance with our capital priorities. \u2047 We repurchased $300 million of common shares during the quarter, and our board of directors authorized a second-quarter dividend of $0.185 per common share. \u2047 As Chris mentioned, combined, this return of capital represents $0.50 a share this quarter an annualized return of 11% of our current valuation. \u2047 Earlier this month, the board of directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion beginning in the third quarter of this year and continue through the third quarter of 2022. \u2047 The board will also evaluate and increase the common stock dividend in the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 On Slide 13, we provide our updated full-year 2021 outlook, which we have adjusted to reflect our outlook for the remainder of the year. \u2047 Consistent with our prior guidance, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage this year. \u2047 Average loans are still expected to be relatively stable, reflecting continued momentum in our consumer areas, the impact of the PPP program, and a pickup in commercial loan growth later this year. \u2047 We expect deposits to be up high single digits, reflecting the continued outperformance we have seen to date. \u2047 We will continue to benefit from our low-cost deposit base. \u2047 Net interest income is now expected to be relatively stable, reflecting a low-rate environment, as well as the slightly lower-than-expected loan balances. \u2047 Our net interest margin will continue to reflect the impact of excess liquidity on our balance sheet. \u2047 Noninterest income should be now up in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, reflecting the broad-based growth in most of our core fee-based businesses, including what is expected to be another record year for our investment banking business. \u2047 Given the stronger revenue outlook, we now expect noninterest expense to be up low single digits, with the primary driver being higher production-related incentives. \u2047 As we identified on our expense side, we are also continuing to invest in areas that will drive future growth, namely teammates, technology, and also rolling out new capabilities such as Laurel Road, does not change our focus on core expenses and driving further efficiencies, including our commitment to generate positive operating leverage for"], "gold_summary": ["announced new common share repurchase authorization of up to $1.5 billion.  \u2047  qtrly earnings per share from continuing
