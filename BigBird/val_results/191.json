{"article": ["We hope you are all well. \u2047 We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. \u2047 We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. \u2047 At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Philippe Krakowsky. \u2047 I'll start with a high-level view of our performance in the quarter. \u2047 Ellen will then provide additional details. \u2047 Then I'll conclude with updates on the highlights at our agencies, to be followed by Q&A. \u2047 First and foremost, as Jerry said, I hope that you and your families are keeping well. \u2047 As we all know, around the world, the pandemic is still with us to a significant degree. \u2047 With all that entails, it bears mention that our people continue to navigate the many challenges, both personal and professional, presented by the health crisis. \u2047 Their extraordinary resilience and capacity for innovation, as well as their care for one another and their commitment to our clients, are inspiring. \u2047 Against business conditions that continue to be demanding, our people have driven the solid growth and the high level of first quarter profitability that we are reporting today. \u2047 Turning to those results, beginning with revenue, we are pleased with our start to the year. \u2047 First quarter organic net revenue growth was 1.9%. \u2047 That reflects solid performance in the U.S., an organic decrease of 20 basis points, and strong international growth of 6.3%, with increases in every world region. \u2047 In the U.S., you'll recall that we are comparing to very strong underlying performance in the first quarter of 2020 when we faced headwinds of nearly 4% due to certain 2019 client losses that we previously identified. \u2047 Domestically, during this year's first quarter, we saw increases in areas such as media, data services and technology and our healthcare specialist agencies. \u2047 Our international performance was paced by 12.4% growth in Continental Europe, where we had a strong start to the year by our media, data and tech offerings as well as McCann Worldgroup. \u2047 Worldwide, our healthcare and retail client sectors, which were consistent outperformers last year, were again our growth leaders in the first quarter. \u2047 From the standpoint of our operating segments, Our IAN segment grew 3.2% organically, led by media, data and technology and by the healthcare specialty agencies. \u2047 As expected, in comparison to last year's largely pre-pandemic first quarter, global conditions in Q1 continued to weigh most heavily on the events and sports marketing disciplines and on certain project-driven businesses in both IAN and DXTRA. \u2047 Nonetheless, while the environment understandably retained a strong note of caution across our offerings and client sectors, the lows were generally not as low. \u2047 Clients are finding their footing amid a global economy that's increasingly showing signs of recovery. \u2047 As better days ahead begin to come into focus, conversations with clients have generally become more positive and constructive. \u2047 Turning to operating expense and profitability. \u2047 Our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline. \u2047 Given the uncertainty that prevailed in 2020, we made decisions and took a series of actions during the year, necessary, but in many cases, no less difficult, to ensure the long-term health of the overall business. \u2047 Our expenses in the quarter reflect much of the benefits of the strategic restructuring executed over the course of last year, most notably, in our expenses for base payroll and occupancy. \u2047 We continue to be highly confident that, over time, we are well positioned to realize the full level of permanent operating expense savings that we've talked about previously, which, as a reminder, annualized at $160 million. \u2047 Along with a return to growth and the benefits of our restructuring actions, our Q1 results were further helped by variable expense categories that continue to run at very low level, given that many of our activities are still restricted by the pandemic. \u2047 These include significantly lower expenses for business travel and meetings as well as their associated costs. \u2047 Our first quarter net income as reported was $92 million, which includes the expense of certain nonoperating items. \u2047 Our adjusted EBITA was $266 million, a level which is approximately 2.5 times the first quarters of recent years. \u2047 Our adjusted EBITA margin was 13.1%. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and was $0.45 as adjusted mainly for our loss on the early extinguishment of debt, the disposition of certain small nonstrategic agencies, both of which are nonoperating expenses, and our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles. \u2047 During the quarter, we refinanced a portion of our outstanding debt on very favorable terms, while extending our debt maturity profile. \u2047 This level of financial flexibility positions us well in the event there is volatility as the global economy moves through a recovery. \u2047 We're pleased to be able to share with you these strong set of results, which build on our company's long-term record of industry outperformance and consistent margin expansion. \u2047 It bears mention that we continue to invest in our people and our capabilities and, as a result, to further differentiate our offerings in the areas of strongest opportunity and growth. \u2047 This has been particularly relevant since we are seeing growing client demand for technology and data services and amid accelerating transformational change in marketing and media. \u2047 Our ability to create marketing and media solutions that bring together creativity, technology and data in order to solve for higher order client opportunities are what drove growth in the first quarter. \u2047 Given the complexity of the media and consumer landscape, marketers are looking for partners who can help them build their businesses through more precise, personalized and accountable engagements with individuals. \u2047 With the deprecation of third-party cookies, all businesses are increasingly focused on realizing value from their first-party data, who are finding partners with whom they can pool data assets. \u2047 As important, this needs to be done in a way that's respectful of people's privacy and anticipates likely regulatory development. \u2047 We remain well positioned to benefit from those opportunities. \u2047 Of course, our first quarter is seasonally our smallest, and most of the year still remains ahead of us. \u2047 We also appreciate the heightened degree of business uncertainty as part of the current reality facing all companies until a business like ours translates into more challenging visibility to the full year. \u2047 As a result, we're staying very close to our people and our clients, asking our teams for frequent financial updates and continuing to carefully manage expenses. \u2047 To date, we're seeing cautious optimism from clients, and the tone of business has firmed in the last few months. \u2047 Reopenings, fiscal stimulus and vaccination programs in a number of our largest markets are providing a tangible lift to economic activity and marketing demand. \u2047 As we mentioned to you on our last call, we remain confident in those areas we can control, namely the strength and competitiveness of our offerings and the people and talent within our group. \u2047 We are seeing that the most contemporary services we provide are growing in terms of the receptivity from clients and prospects. \u2047 Given our strong start to the year, and based on the assumption that there'll continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year in the range of 5% to 6%. \u2047 With that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITA margin of approximately 15.5%. \u2047 As such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all our stakeholders. \u2047 We will, of course, keep you apprised of our progress as the year develops. \u2047 On that note, I'll hand the call over to Ellen for a more in-depth view on our results. \u2047 I hope that everyone is safe and healthy. \u2047 I would like to join Philippe in recognition and, candidly, admiration of our people for their terrific accomplishments under very difficult circumstances. \u2047 First quarter adjusted EBITDA, before a small restructuring adjustment, was $265.9 million and margin was 13.1%. \u2047 These are levels that compare very favorably against any previous first quarter. \u2047 We returned to growth with variable expenses that are lagging the recovery in revenue, and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share was $0.23 as reported and $0.45 as adjusted. \u2047 The adjustments exclude the after-tax impacts of the amortization of acquired intangibles, a small restructuring refinement, nonoperating losses on sales of certain small nonstrategic businesses and the nonoperating loss on the early extinguishment of debt. \u2047 During the quarter, we refinanced $1 billion of senior notes that had been scheduled to mature over the next few years. \u2047 We placed the $1 billion in new notes maturing in 10- and 20-year tranches. \u2047 The timing of those transactions initiated in mid-February was favorable in light of the subsequent rise in market rates. \u2047 We appreciate and value the support and the reception that we received. \u2047 As you may have seen in late March, we also received upgrades to our outlook from both S&P and Fitch. \u2047 Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. \u2047 I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. \u2047 Turning to Q1 revenue on slide four. \u2047 Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.03 billion, an increase of $55.6 million. \u2047 Compared to Q1 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 1.5%, with the dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets. \u2047 Net divestitures were negative 60 basis points. \u2047 Our organic net revenue increase was 1.9%. \u2047 At the bottom of this slide, we break out segment revenue in the quarter. \u2047 Our IAN segment was -- grew 3.2% organically, a terrific result against last year, largely non-COVID first quarter. \u2047 We saw solid growth by our offerings in media, data and tech at FCB and at McCann Worldgroup. \u2047 At IPG DXTRA, the organic change in the quarter was negative 4.8%, which reflects the weight of live events and sports marketing within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic. \u2047 With that, DXTRA's performance was a sharp sequential improvement from the fourth quarter, especially in the public relations disciplines. \u2047 Moving on to slide five, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. \u2047 In the U.S., which was 65% of net revenue in the quarter, our organic decrease was 20 basis points against the challenging comparisons underlying our headline number from a year ago. \u2047 Compared to Q1 2020, we did see continued pressure on events and sports as well as certain project work, as has been the case throughout the pandemic. \u2047 International markets were 35% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 6.3% organically. \u2047 We grew in every international region, which is a notable improvement from Q4. \u2047 Continental Europe grew 12.4%, with increases in every major national markets, including Spain, Germany, Italy and France, driven by increased spend from existing clients. \u2047 With double-digit growth, there are a number of operating highlights in the region, including strong increases at media and tech and at McCann. \u2047 The U.K. increased 3.5% organically and, again, this is net of continuing headwinds in the events discipline We had solid growth at McCann at our media, data and tech offerings and at MullenLowe. \u2047 Asia Pac grew 3.4% organically. \u2047 Among our largest regional markets, we had strong gains in Australia and Singapore, while China and India's revenues declined. \u2047 Our organic growth in LatAm was 5%, with particularly strong results across Mexico, Colombia, Argentina and Chile. \u2047 Our Other Markets group grew 7.3%, with notably strong performance in the Middle East. \u2047 Moving on to slide six and operating expenses in the quarter. \u2047 Our net operating expenses, excluding billable expenses and the amortization of acquired intangibles, decreased 6% from a year ago and to 2.8% growth of our net revenue. \u2047 The result was first quarter margin expansion to 13.1% from 4.9% a year ago. \u2047 We have significant year-on-year expense savings in a number of different categories, most notably our restructuring savings in payroll and occupancy and a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses. \u2047 In the latter category, I would call out specifically the sharply lower travel and related expenses, for the obvious reasons, and significantly reduced bad debt expense, which was at an increased level in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 As you can see on this slide, our ratio of total salaries and related expense as a percentage of net revenue improved by 340 basis points to 68.7% compared with 72.1% a year ago. \u2047 Underneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which improved by 360 basis points. \u2047 We had a lower severance expense ratio, which was only 30 basis points of net revenue compared to 120 basis points in Q1 2020. \u2047 At quarter end, total worldwide headcount was approximate 51,200, a decrease of 6.1% from a year ago as a result of our restructuring and regular severance actions taken over the course of last year as well as our business dispositions. \u2047 Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 480 basis points to 14.4%. \u2047 We continue to have significant decreases in our expenses for occupancy, driving year-on-year leverage of 110 basis points. \u2047 We leveraged all other office and other direct expense by 370 basis points, which includes the decreased expense for travel and bad debt. \u2047 Our SG&A expense was 1.4% of net revenue, an increase of 30 basis points. \u2047 On slide seven, we present detail on adjustments to our reported first quarter results in order to provide better transparency and a picture of comparable performance. \u2047 This begins on the left-hand side with our reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS. \u2047 Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million. \u2047 The restructuring charges were $1.3 million. \u2047 To be clear, these are small adjustments to estimates related to our 2020 restructuring program that we concluded at the end of last year. \u2047 Below operating expenses, in column 3, we had a pre-tax loss in the quarter of $12.5 million in other expenses due to the disposition of a few small nonstrategic businesses. \u2047 To the right of that, our pre-tax loss due to the early"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share of $0.23.  \u2047  q1
