{"article": ["We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's chief executive officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's chief financial officer. \u2047 Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. \u2047 As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. \u2047 These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call. \u2047 Both can be found on our website. \u2047 As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter. \u2047 And along the way, I'll give you my perspective. \u2047 On our results, they are encouraging. \u2047 In our markets, they're standing firm and on our progress, it's made us stronger than ever before. \u2047 And we'll also speak about what it all means. \u2047 We believe it means we're getting better and better positioned for more, even while we're still in the midst of a once in a 100-year pandemic. \u2047 And after all that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. \u2047 We believe our first quarter is clear confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, further accommodating to the virus environment, overcoming period-to-period variations from business to business, dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. \u2047 Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.0246 billion were up 20.2%, including $19.2 million of favorable foreign exchange and $11.3 million of acquisition-related sales. \u2047 Organic sales growth was 16.3%, gains in every group. \u2047 It's our third straight quarter of being above our pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 And ongoing contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation processes, the principles we use every day, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, they all combine to drive that progress. \u2047 Progress there was -- opco operating income of $200.9 million was up $62 million from last year, which included $7.5 million of restructuring charges. \u2047 Opco operating margin was 19.6%, up from the 2020 level of 16.3% or 17.2% as adjusted for restructuring. \u2047 For financial services, operating income of $65.3 million increased 14.8% and the delinquencies were down, even in the midst of a pandemic stress test, during commercial trial of what we could call extraordinary proportion. \u2047 And that result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 23.9%, a 300-basis-point improvement as reported and up 220 basis points as adjusted. \u2047 First-quarter earnings per share was $3.50, up 40.6% from last year's $2.40. \u2047 And excluding the 2020 restructuring charges, earnings per share grew 34.6%. \u2047 I said it before, and I'll say it again. \u2047 We believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered the Great Withering. \u2047 And we also believe that our first-quarter results testify to just that, especially when we compare them to 2019 before the virus. \u2047 So let's do that. \u2047 Versus 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew $102.9 million or 11.2%. \u2047 That reflects $15.3 million of acquisition-related sales; $11.6 million of favorable foreign; currency and a $76 million or 8.1% economic gain. \u2047 The 2021 opco operating margin of 19.6% was up 50 basis points from the 2019 level as adjusted for a legal settlement in that earlier period, and that 50-point gain was achieved against 80 points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while still absorbing the COVID. \u2047 Now to our markets. \u2047 Auto repair remains quite resilient. \u2047 The technicians are rolling. \u2047 They know they weather the depth of the COVID shock and have learned to accommodate the virus environment and are moving to psychological recovery. \u2047 There's still some air of vigilance, but their activities are robust. \u2047 And they know they won't be shocked again by a spike. \u2047 They're quite positive regarding the future of driving as people pivot from shared mobility to individual transportation, and it's vehicle repair with the technicians as a strong and resilient market. \u2047 You can hear it. \u2047 You can hear it in our franchisees' voices and you can see it written clearly across our double-digit numbers. \u2047 Also in auto repair, there are shop owners and managers. \u2047 There are signs that the auto business is rising. \u2047 Demand for new and new cars is high, but dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is still attenuated. \u2047 So there is a gradual gain and we're positioned to take advantage with the broader and stronger product line, with innovations like our TRITON-D10 diagnostics and new acquisitions like Dealer-FX putting us deeper into dealerships than ever before and providing us a clearer view of the future repair trends, new technologies, and evolving vehicle platforms. \u2047 Dealer-FX puts us at the right place at the right time as things change. \u2047 Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of consequence. \u2047 This is where C&I operates, the most international of our operations. \u2047 And these are the customers that have been most impacted by the virus. \u2047 They're slower to accommodate and to recover, but they have been recovering. \u2047 And in the quarter, the results showed that trend, despite some significant headwinds, including the continuing impact of the virus, the February freeze in Texas, some challenged business sectors like oil and gas, and troubled geographies like Southeast Asia. \u2047 Despite that variation, we did see growth in critical industries, improvement in a number of areas, in aviation, and education, and a heavy-duty fleet, they all combined to overcome the continuing turbulence in natural resources. \u2047 Also in C&I, SNA Europe, SNA Europe, another quarter of double-digit growth with broad strength across its geographies in places like France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Germany and the Nordic region. \u2047 And from our Asia Pacific division, up double digits as well with solid increases in key countries like China and India and Japan. \u2047 So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as improving and representing clear opportunity. \u2047 And coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there's clear overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding to repair shop owners and managers, extended critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product line, we're holding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work. \u2047 Understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-on people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock. \u2047 About a year ago, as we entered the virus, we recognize the resilience of our markets and the strength of our model, projecting a V recovery, and that's how it played out. \u2047 You can see it in the results. \u2047 So now let's turn to the segments and discuss those results. \u2047 In the C&I group, on a reported basis, including $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales, first-quarter volume rose 15.3% compared to last year. \u2047 Organic sales were up 9.5%, double-digit growth in our European hand tool business had a mid-single-digit rise and critical industries led the way. \u2047 From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable currency, represents a rise of $19.2 million, compared to the $31.5 million registered in 2020, which included $4.4 million of restructuring. \u2047 That all means, on an adjusted basis, an adjusted increase of over 40%, an as adjusted increase of over 40%, and the operating margin was 14.7% and as reported increase of 420 basis points and 290 as adjusted. \u2047 Now when compared with 2019, the pandemic-free measuring stick sales were up 7.2%, and that included $10 million or a 3.1% organic gain; $8 million of acquisitions, and $5.2 million for favorable foreign currency. \u2047 Once again, C&I demonstrated sequential improvement. \u2047 If you go back and look at the numbers, they keep getting closer and closer, now they're above pre-pandemic levels despite the ongoing uncertainty. \u2047 It's one of the things I think we want to remember, the virus isn't gone. \u2047 We're still bearing it and we didn't have it in 2019 and C&I is above that level. \u2047 As part of the trend, we remain committed to extending in critical industries. \u2047 That's the C&I sweet spot. \u2047 So we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise. \u2047 And enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products, developed especially to make critical work easier. \u2047 One example is our CT9010, 3/8-inch drive, 18-volt brushless impact wrench, the newest member of our MonsterLithium family, aimed at tight space sustained power, rugged durability, and precise control. \u2047 The 9010 features 320-pound feet of bulk breakaway torque and 240-pound feet of working torque, all the power of technician needs when they're working in confirmed quarters. \u2047 It offers a variable speed trigger in three-speed selections in Ford and reverse. \u2047 That means greater control, adaptable to any applications, and no overtorque-ing important. \u2047 The 9010 advanced design also reduces motor temperature rise, delivering higher durability and great power to rate ratio. \u2047 It's been fitted with 100-lumen headlight that helps technicians work in dark environment, just what's needed for those close jobs. \u2047 And the 18-volt battery with the five-amp hours ensures consistent output and extended the run time, which translates to less charging and more efficient workday. \u2047 And all of this comes -- and this is the best part, I think -- all of this comes in an extremely compact size. \u2047 Only six and three-quarter inches in overall length that will fit into the tightest of workspace. \u2047 The CT9010 is a great tool. \u2047 It's had strong demand, and it's already one of our $1 million hit products. \u2047 I don't want to leave C&I without mentioning SNA Europe. \u2047 Double-digit sales growth again, progress by the Black ergo tool management system, expanding product customization to the needs of the task, driving progress across -- against the twin headwinds of a difficult proven environment. \u2047 Europe is not so easy these days and the uncertainty of Brexit, no small feat. \u2047 Well, that's C&I, continuing sequential improvement and positioned for more. \u2047 Now on to the tools group. \u2047 Sales of $478.3 million, up $102.4 million, including $6.7 million of favorable currency and a $95.7 million or 25% organic gain, double-digit growth, both in the U.S. and the international operations. \u2047 The operating margin was 20.7%, yes, 20.7%, up 780 basis points. \u2047 Compared with pre-virus 2019, tools group sales grew $68.1 million, 16.6%, including $5.2 million favorable currency translation and $62.9 million or a 15.1% organic gain. \u2047 And this year's 20.7% operating margin was up 430 basis points compared with pre-pandemic 2019. \u2047 The tools group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it. \u2047 We do believe our runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise network represents a continuing opportunity. \u2047 And there's evidence that we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel in our franchisee metrics, the financial and physical indicators that we monitor closely. \u2047 Again, this quarter, they remain clearly favorable. \u2047 And based on those metrics, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger. \u2047 And they say so. \u2047 And our direct interactions at events like this past January's kickoff meeting held this year at a distance. \u2047 It was a great affair. \u2047 Well attended, strong orders, visible commitment to our brand, watch parties all over the country. \u2047 I zoomed into several of myself, and they were brimming with enthusiasm and optimism. \u2047 Our franchisees entrepreneurs and professionals all are pumped, confident, and reaching higher. \u2047 The tools group quarter that's a strong advantage for us. \u2047 The tools group quarter was also marked with Snap-on value creation, customer connection, and innovation, offering new products. \u2047 Sometimes, just an improvement on an established line, but clearly making work easier, solving problems, delivering productivity gains. \u2047 All of these are born out of observing the changing work in shops on an everyday basis. \u2047 We're in those shops every day. \u2047 We watch the work. \u2047 We author the products. \u2047 One such add is our KERN681, seven-drawer, single bank EPIQ series roll cab, configured entirely with extrawide 62-inch drawers, greater flexibility and capacity and a standard footprint, making the most of limited shop space. \u2047 Our franchisees are already calling an uninterrupted storage. \u2047 It's the first large-capacity roll cab with a full complement of extrawide drawers in the industry. \u2047 It's made on our Iowa plant. \u2047 I saw some of them being made there just last month. \u2047 The local team is proud of them. \u2047 It comes with two swivels and two rigid casters located right on the corners of the box. \u2047 It doesn't seem like much of a change, but that's a clever innovation that provides mobility and tight spaces, while also greatly enhancing box stability. \u2047 That's a very important feature for a high-capacity unit, the KER681 EPIQ strength, styling, and styling, 8,000 pounds of low capacity, and more than 45,000 cubic inches of storage space. \u2047 The franchisees are saying it's been a clear hit and they're right. \u2047 We spent some time over several quarters, working to expand franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and Van operations, so it's paid off. \u2047 Selling capacity is up. \u2047 And you can see it clearly in the three straight gangbusters quarters for our tools group. \u2047 I don't need to say any more about them. \u2047 Now let's speak about RS&I. \u2047 First-quarter organic sales rose 7.6% with varying gains across the board. \u2047 Undercar equipment coming back, delivering double-digit rise, diagnostics and information products,
