{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Mike Hayford, CEO; Owen Sullivan, president and COO; and Tim Oliver, CFO. \u2047 And as always, a great job with the intro to our third-quarter call. \u2047 I will begin with some of my views on the business, including an update on our move to NCR becoming a software platform and payments company, with a shift to recurring revenue streams and a focus on improving profit margin. \u2047 Tim will then review our financial performance and an outlook into the remainder of 2021. \u2047 Let's begin on Slide 4 with some highlights from the third quarter. \u2047 NCR delivered strong performance that included accelerated recurring revenue growth, significant margin expansion and solid cash flow production. \u2047 The team executed very well both strategically and tactically. \u2047 Strategically improving our mix of software and services, investing in our platform products and at the same time continuing to build momentum in our NCR-as-a-Service strategy, while continuing to focus on meeting customer needs in the challenging supply chain environment that we experienced in the third quarter. \u2047 First, we delivered 20% total revenue growth and 39% recurring revenue growth in the third quarter. \u2047 Recurring revenue represented 62% of total revenues in the quarter which is a significant increase from 53% one year ago. \u2047 We continue to make steady progress increasing our recurring revenue, which is consistent with our 80/60/20 goals. \u2047 As you know, the third quarter was the first full quarter of incorporating Cardtronics in our financial results as we closed on the transaction in late June and received the final regulatory approval on August 10 from the CMA in the U.K. Second, adjusted EBITDA increased 41%. \u2047 Third, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 18.5%, which represents an increase of 280 basis points from the third quarter of 2020 and marks the highest level in four years. \u2047 Fourth, we delivered solid free cash flow. \u2047 We generated 125 million of free cash flow in the quarter. \u2047 This is the sixth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. \u2047 The successful execution of our NCR-as-a-Service strategy is helping to drive higher recurring revenues, expansion of EBITDA margin and more linear free cash flow production. \u2047 And finally, the integration of Cardtronics remains on track. \u2047 We made progress integrating the teams and going to market as a unified company. \u2047 We are more enthusiastic than ever. \u2047 We are well positioned to accelerate the NCR-as-a-Service strategy and further shift NCR's revenue mix to software, services payment, including recurring revenues. \u2047 Now moving to Slide 5. \u2047 We executed extremely well in the third quarter, driving progress toward NCR-as-a-Service. \u2047 We have strong momentum across our strategic growth platforms, which support our transition to shift NCR to a software platform and payments company. \u2047 In Banking, we continue to have a positive momentum in our digital banking platform. \u2047 In the third quarter, digital banking had 22 renewals, three new logo deals, and eight new product sales to existing clients, all positive drivers of growth. \u2047 Demand has been strong for our business banking platform, as well as for the online digital account opening. \u2047 The digital account opening, which we obtained through the acquisition of Terafina earlier this year, NCR can now onboard a broad array of accounts across multiple channels. \u2047 I am pleased with the progress we have made returning digital banking to a growth engine for NCR. \u2047 During the third quarter, digital banking grew 9% over the same period last year. \u2047 We are receiving increased interest in our ATM-as-a-Service solution. \u2047 An integrated go-to-market model between the legacy NCR and Cardtronics teams provide a key point of competitive differentiation. \u2047 Liberty Bank, which is one of the largest mutual banks in the United States, selected NCR to provide end-to-end ATM-as-a-service for its ATM network, including upgrading its entire ATM fleet. \u2047 In Retail, we continue to gain traction with our NCR Emerald software platform. \u2047 We have positive momentum in winning the upgrade imperative for retail POS software. \u2047 In the third quarter, we had significant success advancing our software-defined store, which is a component of our next-gen Emerald solution. \u2047 It provides us the capability to start our retail clients down the path of upgrading to our next-gen cloud-based solution in a seamless, low-risk approach by accepting select micro services from our NCR eCommerce platform in an incremental approach to transitioning to NCR's next-gen solution. \u2047 We had two major software-defined store commerce platform signings during the third quarter from large clients that have installed the NCR eCommerce platform validated the technology in a full rollout during 2021, both confirming their success with signing a five-year subscription agreements during the third quarter, these two, Pilot Flying J, the largest operator of travel centers in North America with 750 retail locations in 44 states; and Circle K, which operates more than 15,000 convenience stores in over 20 countries. \u2047 In addition to the NCR eCommerce platform, Circle K also expanded its relationship with NCR to enable the Allpoint Network across stores in eight states. \u2047 During the quarter, we also signed 17 new contracts through our digital front-end app, Freshop. \u2047 This SaaS solution helps grocers implement their own eCommerce and delivery services without expensive third-party providers. \u2047 Freshop connects to our clients through the NCR platform and provides NCR additional upsell opportunities and value-add for our retail customers. \u2047 In Hospitality, our focus on customer success and wallet share gain is proving itself in our ability to attract new customers and better service existing customers. \u2047 NCR realized a significant upgrade in our relationship with Buffalo Wild Wings, which is part of the Inspire Brands family, entering into a four-year contract to support Buffalo Wild Wings across 1,200 locations with subscription-based point-of-sale software, various cloud-based applications, and end-to-end managed services. \u2047 In the SMB market, the momentum of Aloha Essentials, which bundles payments, software, services, and hardware into a single offering, continued in the third quarter with a 102% increase in a Aloha Essentials sites over last year's same quarter. \u2047 Our Payments business continued its success during the third quarter. \u2047 We increased the number of restaurant payment processing sites by 27% from the second quarter, as well as upselling existing customers to our payments platform. \u2047 During the third quarter, we signed enterprise hospitality client Sbarro to our payments platform. \u2047 This is in addition to two other enterprise hospitality clients Shipley and Pei Wei that we signed a payment processing deals earlier this year. \u2047 In summary, we have increased momentum accelerating our NCR-as-a-Service strategy across each of our business segments. \u2047 We continue to focus on taking care of our customers, advancing our product capability with investments in our strategic growth platforms, and improving our productivity. \u2047 With that, let me pass it over to Tim. \u2047 To echo Mike's comments, we are very pleased with our third-quarter results. \u2047 We demonstrated terrific tactical execution in an uncertain business environment and significant acceleration in our more strategic growth areas. \u2047 CMA in mid-August since we last talked to you on our Q2 earnings call. \u2047 Today's report includes the results for the consolidated companies for the full quarter, with legacy Cardtronics now included in our banking segment. \u2047 Let's begin with Slide 6, which presents a top-level overview of our third-quarter financial performance. \u2047 Starting on the top left, revenue was $1.9 billion, up $312 million or 20% versus the 2020 third quarter, driven by strong growth in both our banking and hospitality segments. \u2047 Normalizing for the inclusion of Cardtronics, pro forma revenue was up 3% year over year. \u2047 In aggregate, we had high double-digit revenue growth in our software business, which is more than sufficient to offset lower hardware revenue. \u2047 While demand for hardware across all three segments is increasing, component availability and freight challenges constrained both revenue and profitability in self-checkout and point-of-sale. \u2047 Also shown here in darker green is our mix of recurring revenue. \u2047 With the inclusion of the full quarter of Cardtronics revenue, which has a preponderance of recurring revenue, our aggregate result was up 39% and comprised 62% of revenue in the quarter. \u2047 On a pro forma basis, recurring revenue was up 7% year over year. \u2047 In the top right, adjusted EBITDA increased $103 million or 41% year over year to $352 million. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin rate expanded 280 basis points to 18.5%, representing a high watermark for the previous four years. \u2047 While I will provide a little more detail on the discussion of the segments, in general, a higher value revenue mix, cost productivity and price initiatives were together more than sufficient to overcome premium costs associated with a brutally difficult supply chain and a huge shift to recurring quarter for our retail business. \u2047 In the bottom left, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, up $0.15 or 28% from the prior-year third quarter. \u2047 The Cardtronics transaction remains on track to be 20 to 25% accretive to earnings per share within the first full year. \u2047 The tax rate was 28.5%, and we now expect the full-year tax rate to be 28%. \u2047 And finally, and maybe most importantly, we delivered another strong quarter of free cash flow with generation of $125 million. \u2047 This compares to $160 million in the third quarter of 2020, which benefited from pandemic-related temporal cash preservation actions and the timing of an insurance settlement. \u2047 Moving to Slide 7 for our banking segment results, which now includes the Cardtronics operations. \u2047 Banking revenue increased $273 million or 35% year over year, driven by increases in software and services revenues that more than offset the decline in ATM hardware revenue. \u2047 We continue to successfully replace our onetime revenue that was traditionally recognized with the sale of ATM hardware with more durable, predictable and valuable software and services revenue streams. \u2047 Subscription software TCV signed in this segment doubled from prior year, with significant increases in both annual value and duration. \u2047 Banking adjusted EBITDA increased $98 million or 68% year over year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin rate expanded by 450 basis points to 23%. \u2047 The margin increase was a result of the significant accretion from the inclusion of the Cardtronics businesses, a more profitable and valuable mix of revenue in our legacy NCR businesses, as well as the cost productivity and price increases. \u2047 The bottom of the slide shows our key metrics for the banking segment. \u2047 On the left, while current quarter wins have a typical lag to conversion and eventual revenue generation, prior period wins at digital banking drove a 9% year-over-year growth rate in the third quarter. \u2047 The grade of growth in digital banking has accelerated in the last several quarters. \u2047 We continue to expect digital banking to exit the year at a double-digit revenue growth rate as we lap most of the attrition caused by the 2019 customer losses. \u2047 Digital banking registered users also increased 9% compared to Q3 of 2020. \u2047 The shift to recurring revenue continues to gain traction, with recurring revenue up 71% year over year and 7% on a pro forma basis. \u2047 We are extremely pleased with the first full-quarter performance at Cardtronics. \u2047 As we continue to add and expand with financial and retail partners, we are driving more transactions over our leading ATM network in the United States. \u2047 Cash transactions on our ATMs in the U.S. were up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 demonstrates the value of the network to our consumers, to our retailers and to our financial institutions and drove strong performance. \u2047 We expect to drive both traditional transaction growth and new types of transactions as we invest in expanding the capabilities of this network. \u2047 Moving to Slide 8, which shows our retail segment results. \u2047 While I typically start in the top left on these charts, for this quarter in retail, the story is really described by the bottom half of the page. \u2047 Looking at SCO revenue, which is approximately 50% hardware, as we called out in Q2, we posted a very strong Q2 growth rate due to a customer request to accelerate a $30 million self-checkout order into Q2 from the second half of the year. \u2047 That exacerbated the already sawtooth pattern. \u2047 We expect a strong Q4 for self-checkout that will result in full-year 2021 growth of more than 10%. \u2047 And in the center bottom, our platform lanes, a KPI that illustrates the success of our strategy of converting our retail customers to our platform-based subscription model. \u2047 As you heard from Mike, we had two key deals at Pilot Flying J and Circle K converting to our software-defined store platform during the quarter. \u2047 These contracts, much like those that we have standardized on in the banking segment, convert would-be onetime perpetual sales into a multiyear subscription-based revenue stream. \u2047 The nature of these contracts shifts roughly $30 million of very high profit revenue that would have previously occurred is upfront software license to revenue that now recurs over the next several years. \u2047 Considering those two retiming impacts, retail revenue declined $3 million or 1% year over year due to the lower hardware revenue and the shift to recurring revenue, partially offset by growth in software and services. \u2047 And similarly, retail adjusted EBITDA declined $11 million or 14% year over year, while adjusted EBITDA margin rate contracted 190 basis points to 12.7%. \u2047 The declines are primarily driven by that shift to recurring revenue. \u2047 Recurring revenue in this business increased 4% versus the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Slide 9 shows our Hospitality segment results, which is participating fully in the recovery of the restaurant industry. \u2047 We're seeing strong momentum across the business as we see a rebound in the enterprise market with an uptick in new restaurant openings and technology refreshes. \u2047 Hospitality revenue increased $50 million or 29% as restaurants reopen, rework existing locations, and expand. \u2047 Our signed subscription total contract value in this business increased 46% from the year-ago third quarter. \u2047 Our sales pipeline is getting stronger and we continue to hire to increase our feet on the street and catalyze growth. \u2047 Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased to $35 million, up 46% from the third quarter of 2020, while adjusted EBITDA margin rate expanded 180 basis points to 15.7%. \u2047 This improved profitability was driven by higher revenue and lower operating expenses. \u2047 Hospitality's key metrics on the bottom of this slide include Aloha Essentials sites and recurring"], "gold_summary": ["q3 non-gaap earnings per share $0.69.  \u2047  q3 revenue rose 20 percent to $1.9 billion."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.69.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.69.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.69."]}
