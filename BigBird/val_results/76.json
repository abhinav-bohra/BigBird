{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Arsen Kitch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Murphy, Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Financial results for the fourth quarter of 2020 were released shortly after today's market close. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, the company reported net sales for the fourth quarter of $453 million and adjusted EBITDA of $72 million. \u2047 Which represents growth of approximately 4% and 38%, respectively, over the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 A few business highlights to mention. \u2047 Our tissue business drove results with both higher sales and production volumes year-over-year to meet volatile demand, which exceeded our expectations. \u2047 Our production in the quarter was similar to our sales. \u2047 Our paperboard business delivered strong performance as well. \u2047 Our backlogs are robust, which contributed to our decision to announce a price increase of $50 per ton across our SBS portfolio, starting on February 2. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we used the free cash flows generated to reduce net debt by an additional $58 million. \u2047 On slide four, as I noted over the previous quarters, we remain focused on our top priorities during COVID, the health and safety of our people and safely operating our assets to service our customers. \u2047 Our efforts and risk mitigation strategies are making a difference in helping to reduce the risk of COVID at our sites. \u2047 Our human resources and manufacturing leadership teams are doing an exceptional job of proactively monitoring the health of our workforce and ensuring that we have the proper staffing levels in place. \u2047 Our people's diligence to date has been key to our success and will continue to be so. \u2047 As a recognition of the work by our entire team during this challenging time, we paid out a onetime discretionary bonus of $1,000 in November to over 2,800 of our people. \u2047 We're also strongly encouraging all our people to get the COVID vaccine with a $200 incentive. \u2047 I would like to express my deepest gratitude to our entire team for their extraordinary efforts and perseverance through this challenging time. \u2047 As we start to see the benefits from a broader vaccine rollout, I want to encourage maintaining high levels of vigilance until COVID is under control and behind us. \u2047 I will now share what we saw for both the tissue and paperboard businesses in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Let's start with our Consumer Products division on slide five. \u2047 As we had previously noted, at home tissue demand was volatile during the quarter. \u2047 New waves of the pandemic caused significant spikes in demand mid-November through mid-December. \u2047 While we originally anticipated demand at or below levels that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2019, we were reminded of how unpredictable demand can be for essential products during this time. \u2047 Mike will expand further on demand patterns in the fourth quarter during his comments. \u2047 Our team and customers are doing a great job working through this volatility, and we benefited from higher-than-anticipated sales and production volumes in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our industry view remains largely the same, which I'll summarize in a few key points to provide some context. \u2047 First, recall that the market for tissue in the U.S. is traditionally 2/3 at-home and 1/3 away-from-home, with limited manufacturing production capability to swing between the 2. \u2047 As consumers have been more homebound, there has been a shift toward at-home consumption. \u2047 Demand swings have and will continue to be driven by consumer behavior. \u2047 Our expectation is that as COVID vaccines are administered and infection rates decrease, that we will see a shift back to away-from-home consumption, which we expect will negatively impact us as we're primarily focused on the at-home market. \u2047 With that said, it is unclear if there will be a lasting impact on consumer behavior in a post COVID environment. \u2047 Second, while it is too early to discern private branded share trends, we continue to note that paper towel demand is tracking ahead of the overall tissue category, while facial demand is lagging. \u2047 Private brands have had a good track record of gaining share relative to branded products over the past decade, a trend that we would expect to continue. \u2047 We will continue to monitor these trends in the coming months and quarters due to the continued uncertainty in consumer demand associated with COVID. \u2047 Third, as we noted in previous quarters, SKU rationalization has occurred, aiding additional production. \u2047 We believe that lower SKU counts benefit both retailers and manufacturers like us. \u2047 While we have seen some customers desiring a recovery of SKUs, we do not anticipate SKU counts to go back to pre-COVID levels in the near to medium term. \u2047 Our tissue results in the fourth quarter were robust. \u2047 We shipped 13.9 million cases, which was up around 5.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 Sales were down 4.2% relative to the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we exited several customers to reduce complexity and improve our network, which impacted the fourth quarter results and is expected to impact first quarter 2021 results as well. \u2047 We are encouraged by our pipeline of sales for the remainder of 2021. \u2047 As you recall, we estimate that approximately 2/3 of paperboard demand is derived from products that are more recession-resilient and 1/3 is driven by economically -- by more economically sensitive or discretionary products. \u2047 Our folding carton customers, especially those with concentrations in food or healthcare packaging, continue to see strong demand and our food service customers, especially those with concentrations in quick service restaurants and away-from-home dining, continue to see weaker demand. \u2047 We are pleased with the market reception of our sustainability focused brands of Nuvo Cup and ReMagine folding carton. \u2047 Both are playing a meaningful role in our favorable market position. \u2047 We're encouraged by our solid performance in the quarter and continued strong demand for our products. \u2047 We made an announcement last week about the natural gas curtailment in Arkansas that caused us to temporarily suspend production in Cypress Bend. \u2047 Natural gas deliveries were curtailed to the point where we could no longer operate. \u2047 We estimate that the costs associated with the weather event across our paperboard system, including loss production, repairs and spikes in natural gas prices, could impact us in the first quarter by approximately $6 million to $8 million. \u2047 We continue to experience the same fundamental supply and demand dynamics that led us to announce a $50 per ton price increase in January. \u2047 Demand remains robust and our backlogs have grown since beginning of the year. \u2047 Price increase implementation has begun, and we expect that it will take several more months to fully implement the increase. \u2047 The consolidated company summary income statement shows fourth quarter as well as the full year 2020 and 2019. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, diluted net income per share was $1.34 per share and adjusted EBITDA was $71.6 million and full year diluted net income per share was $4.61 per share, and adjusted EBITDA was $283.2 million. \u2047 These represent significant increases over the prior periods, which were driven by tissue demand due in large part by consumer COVID-related behavior as well as the benefits from our Shelby investment, favorable raw material pricing and the lack of a major planned outage in our paperboard division. \u2047 The corresponding segment results are on slide eight. \u2047 Our paperboard business continued its strong adjusted EBITDA performance, while consumer products benefited from significant sales growth and fixed cost leverage associated with production growth and favorable input costs. \u2047 Before we speak in more detail about our divisional performance, I want to note changes in how we portray our financial bridges. \u2047 Previously, we have shown the impact of production volume changes and associated fixed cost leverage impact in our cost category. \u2047 We have modified that approach and are including production volume changes in our volume category. \u2047 We believe that this change will enable investors to better understand sales changes as we expect to produce similar quantities of product that we sell, which will all be in the volume category. \u2047 The cost category will better reflect the changes in raw material input pricing and inflation. \u2047 This sheeting is a service that distorts our sales price of our base paperboard products. \u2047 Additionally, we have decided to make some accounting changes that will impact our financials starting in 2021, but we want to note them for you today. \u2047 You can also review these changes and the pro forma impact in our 8-K filing. \u2047 Our bail pulp sales from our Lewiston mill to third parties have been recorded in our tissue business. \u2047 These sales will now be recorded in our paperboard business. \u2047 Bail pulp sales from Lewiston to our tissue operations will be transferred at market price going forward as opposed to cost. \u2047 We believe this change will better reflect the economics associated with the business. \u2047 We will still transfer pulp from the Lewiston pulp mill to the Lewiston tissue operations at cost given the located nature of these assets. \u2047 As a reminder, in the second quarter of 2019, we started our new Shelby, North Carolina paper machine and incurred, as anticipated, start-up costs related to lower production throughput, higher waste and other costs which persisted during the remainder of 2019. \u2047 We achieved the targeted production rate of our new paper machine in the second quarter of 2020 and we're continuing to capture the benefits associated with the project, including ramping our converting lines, realizing supply chain savings and achieving sales wins and mix improvements. \u2047 While we are not providing a specific dollar amount for these costs and benefits, the continued realization of the Shelby investment is an important factor in our performance improvement. \u2047 Our mix continues to improve as Shelby has come online, more than offsetting some year-over-year price impacts. \u2047 We're benefiting from the volume increases related to the production ramp, which helped to meet elevated demand. \u2047 Overall, lower input costs, improved mix and fixed cost leverage from increased production possibly impacted our tissue business in the fourth quarter of 2020 relative to the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 You can also review a comparison of our fourth quarter 2020 performance relative to third quarter 2020 on slide 17 of the appendix. \u2047 slide 10 contains some additional context on tissue related to the volatility of demand and its impact on our financial performance. \u2047 The IRI panel data, which is a snapshot of retail sales of tissue measured in dollars depicts what our customers and we have observed from consumer demand patterns, with the line showing changes on a year-over-year basis, while the data in the box shows a quarterly review versus last year. \u2047 As we exited the third quarter, we anticipated an elevated but stable demand pattern. \u2047 Based on that demand profile, ample inventory levels at our customers, and slowing demand from our customers in October, we expect to see softness in our fourth quarter sales. \u2047 But the consumer-driven demand spike in mid-November into December, that changed rapidly. \u2047 This period of volatility, both the October pullback, which we noted on our third quarter earnings call, and strong orders in November and December, are a good reminder that we may not return to a stable order pattern until after COVID-related volatility is behind us, impacting our ability to forecast the business. \u2047 We added an additional slide in the appendix of the supplemental materials that details the weekly volatility in IRI panel data that our customers and supply chain have experienced. \u2047 Our sales in the fourth quarter were 13.9 million cases, representing a unit decline of 4.2% versus the third quarter and unit growth of 5.3% versus prior year. \u2047 Our production in the quarter was $13.9 million cases or down 9% versus the third quarter and up 2.4% versus prior year. \u2047 Production levels have benefited from the Shelby ramp and SKU rationalization. \u2047 The cost leverage from the significant increase in production, along with improved costs in freight and logistics, led to continued strong results year-over-year. \u2047 Slide 11 is a year-over-year adjusted EBITDA comparison for our paperboard business. \u2047 Lower pricing, which RISI reported in February 2020, was partly offset by favorable mix. \u2047 The absence of a planned major outage at our Cypress Bend mill was also a driver of year-over-year improvement. \u2047 Overall, our team ran our operations well in the quarter and continued to deliver strong results. \u2047 You can review a comparison of our fourth quarter 2020 performance relative to third quarter 2020 performance on slide 18 in the appendix. \u2047 Slide 12 provides a perspective on our first quarter outlook and some other key drivers for full year 2021. \u2047 As previously discussed, tissue outlook is largely a function of sales demand. \u2047 Tissue shipments in January were 4.6 million cases, and our shipments in February are trending to below four million cases. \u2047 At this pace, we are expecting first quarter shipments to be below levels experienced in the first quarter of 2020, when COVID initially impacted consumer buying patterns, and down versus the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 As we mentioned previously, our paperboard business announced a price increase of $50 a ton across our SBS grades effective February 2. \u2047 Given the nature of our agreements and discussions with customers, we expect that the benefit of this will be reflected in the next couple of quarters with limited benefit expected in Q1. \u2047 The unexpected weather-related outage at our Arkansas mill, which caused loss production and repairs as well as natural gas price increases across our paperboard system, is expected to negatively impact the quarter by approximately $6 million to $8 million. \u2047 If our assumptions are correct, we would anticipate the first quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $51 million to $59 million. \u2047 This range also assumes that we continue to operate our assets without significant COVID-related disruptions. \u2047 While we are not prepared to provide specific annual guidance for 2021 and there are several drivers, assumptions and variables that we would like to address. \u2047 We are expecting a positive impact from the previously announced SBS price increases. \u2047 We are anticipating tissue volumes to drop high single to low double-digit percentages. \u2047 This assumes continued normalization of consumer buying patterns, but is highly dependent upon the course of the pandemic. \u2047 We are encouraged by our sales pipeline, which we anticipate will have a positive impact on the second part of the year. \u2047 Paperboard volumes are expected to be largely stable. \u2047 We are expecting higher input costs, including pulp, packaging, energy and freight. \u2047 While these variables are difficult to predict today, raw material inputs in total could be a $40 million to $50 million headwind this year, with more than half the total coming from pulp. \u2047 In our paperboard business, planned major maintenance outages are expected to reduce our earnings for 2021 compared to 2020 by $25 million to $30 million. \u2047 We have updated this guidance on slide 23, where we broke out the timing by quarter, which reflects our current plan. \u2047 In light of the Cypress Bend weather event"], "gold_summary": ["q4 earnings per share $1.34.  \u2047  q4 sales $453 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $449.3 million."], "pred_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $4.61.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $4.61."]}
