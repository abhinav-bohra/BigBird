{"article": ["Melinda will open and close the call and Bob will speak to segment performance and the financials midway through. \u2047 We'll then open the call to questions. \u2047 Although we believe these statements to be reasonable, our actual results could differ materially. \u2047 The most significant risk factors that could affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-K. \u2047 We encourage you to review those risk factors as well as other key information detailed in our SEC filings. \u2047 With that I'd like to now turn over the call to Melinda Whittington, La-Z-Boy's President and Chief Executive Officer. \u2047 We are delivering on plan and controlling the controllables even in these times of significant widespread global supply chain disruption. \u2047 Across the La-Z-Boy enterprise, we delivered all-time record high sales of $576 million with sales 29% ahead of the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter. \u2047 Our business is much larger today than pre-pandemic, and we believe our momentum is sustainable. \u2047 We are poised to grow on this base of nearly $2.1 billion in trailing 12 month sales. \u2047 Also as expected, operating margins improved sequentially as our delivered sales for the quarter reflected pricing and surcharge actions taken to offset unprecedented rising raw material costs. \u2047 All in all, we are pleased with the momentum and growth we are experiencing during these challenging times. \u2047 Looking forward, demand continues to be strong across the enterprise and our backlog remains at all time highs, even as we continue to increase capacity to service our customers and consumers. \u2047 During Q2 of last year, businesses were just reopening and consumers were resuming furniture purchases. \u2047 At the time, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network were unusually strong, up 34%. \u2047 Off that base, written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network decreased 6% in the fiscal '22 second quarter. \u2047 However, comparing this quarter to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network increased an impressive 26% for a compounded annual growth rate of 12% across the two years. \u2047 Similarly, while written same-store sales for our company-owned retail segment decreased 7% versus the unusual prior-year period written sales increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 12% across the last two years. \u2047 For Joybird, primarily an e-commerce business, it continued its strong growth trajectory accelerating to rate 56% more business this Q2 than in last year's second quarter and delivering an extremely impressive compounded annual growth rate of 40% across the last two years. \u2047 As we focus on addressing this strong ongoing demand and accumulated backlog, we continue to make strategic investments to increase capacity and improve capabilities and are producing more units than ever to service customers. \u2047 We're continuing to add manufacturing cells and now employ almost 40% more manufacturing personnel in pre-pandemic. \u2047 In Mexico, additional cells are coming online at our SLR facility and the first cells at our new[Indecipherable] plants are expected to begin operations in January, with that location of fully operational by fiscal year end. \u2047 And we continue to work to minimize supply chain disruptions from those associated with lack of component parts such as electronic chips to those inherent in hiring and training new workers until they reach normal productivity levels. \u2047 As we mentioned last quarter, where possible, our procurement team is significantly increasing inventory for key components to minimize disruption while also working to diversify our supply chain with multiple sources in various geographies to protect against continued supply chain volatility. \u2047 In addition, early in Q3, we acquired the Furnico upholstery manufacturing business in the UK. \u2047 Furnico has been manufacturing La-Z-Boy product for sale in the UK and Ireland since 2008. \u2047 This expansion of in-house manufacturing capability will provide greater certainty of supply to our customers in the UK and is a key step in building an integrated supply chain network for La-Z-Boy International. \u2047 Also during the quarter, we continued to return value to shareholders with a dividend payment and $15 million in share repurchases, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders in the first half of the year to $64 million across dividends and share repurchase. \u2047 And finally, we were pleased to announce last month, the expansion of our Board of Directors to 12 members with the addition of Erika Alexander, who serves as the Chief Global Officer, Global Operations for Marriott International. \u2047 Erika has held various leadership roles for several of Marriott's largest brands and will bring a wealth of operational experience perspective and expertise to La-Z-Boy. \u2047 Importantly, as we manage the current operational challenges across the business, we're also addressing the long term with our work on Century Vision, our winning strategy for growth through our Centennial anniversary in 2027 and beyond. \u2047 As I noted last quarter, Century Vision includes three key pillars. \u2047 The first is to leverage and reinvigorate the La-Z-Boy brand. \u2047 This includes leveraging the La-Z-Boy comfort message, a renewed focus on aging down the core consumer and accelerating our omnichannel offering. \u2047 To date, our marketing platform featuring Kristen Bell, has been successful in driving brand recognition including young -- including among younger consumers who say the La-Z-Boy brand is relevant to them. \u2047 Our objective is to build on this sentiment and last month we produced a new series of commercials that showcase how La-Z-Boy's range of products meet our consumers' needs. \u2047 At the same time throughout the course of Century Vision will expand the vibrant La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store base to approximately 400 locations across North America and will strengthen the entire network to remodels and relocations with some 30 projects on tap for this fiscal year. \u2047 While the purchase journey may start digitally, our consumers like to visit our stores to shop providing us with a great opportunity to deliver the flagship La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries store experience. \u2047 Most importantly, our goal is to connect with consumers along their purchase journey through multiple means whether that's online or in person. \u2047 With respect to the Company-owned stores, we've become very successful running our retail business where we benefit from the integrated wholesale-retail margin. \u2047 We continue to acquire independent La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery stores to round out our portfolio where it makes sense for us and the dealer. \u2047 We recently signed an agreement to purchase five stores in the Alabama and Tennessee markets from the retiring dealer that will be accretive as we quickly and seamlessly integrate them into our portfolio when we close the transaction later in the third quarter. \u2047 The second pillar of Century Vision relates to Joybird where we have a sustainably profitable direct-to-consumer model, an exciting and relevant brand with significant potential. \u2047 We are fueling Joybird to drive disproportionate profitable growth through an increase in digital marketing spend to drive awareness and customer acquisition, ongoing investments in technology and expansion of product assortment and additional small format urban stores in high traffic areas. \u2047 We are excited to open a new store in LA, this month and have an additional stores slated to open by the end of this fiscal year. \u2047 In markets where we have Joybird small format stores, we consistently see a geo lift in the online sales, demonstrating the appeal of an omnichannel model across all brands and retail formats. \u2047 We also recently opened a virtual store at Joybird's LA headquarters for online shoppers to chat, call and video conference into a dedicated retail environment which has proven to be very successful both in terms of consumer satisfaction and closing sales. \u2047 And the third pillar of Century Vision is to leverage and enhance our enterprise capabilities to support the growth of our consumer brands as well as enable the potential for tack-on acquisitions that can benefit from our supply chain expertise and accelerate the La-Z-Boy Incorporated growth story. \u2047 Strengthening digital capabilities across the entire La-Z-Boy enterprise and improving the agility of our supply chain, so that it can more broadly support all our customer brands will be key focus areas moving forward. \u2047 All in, as we execute Century Vision, we expect to grow the topline higher-than-industry averages and deliver double-digit operating margins. \u2047 We are proud of our near term results and excited for our future. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, fiscal '22 second quarter sales increased 25% to a record $576 million versus the prior year quarter, an increase sequentially from the fiscal '22 first quarter reflecting continued strong demand and ongoing capacity increases as well as the effects of pricing and surcharges. \u2047 Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter, sales were 29% higher for a compounded annual growth rate of about 14% over the last two years. \u2047 Consolidated GAAP operating income increased $54 million versus the prior year period and non-GAAP operating income increased to $52 million. \u2047 Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 9.4% and non-GAAP operating margin was 9% up sequentially from the first quarter. \u2047 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.89 for the fiscal '22 second quarter versus $0.75 in the prior year quarter. \u2047 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.85 in the current year quarter versus $0.82 in last year's quarter. \u2047 My comments from here will focus on our non-GAAP reporting unless specifically stated otherwise. \u2047 I will now review our results by segment. \u2047 Demand for product across all businesses remains strong. \u2047 Starting with our wholesale segment, delivered sales for the quarter grew 28% to $439 million compared with the prior year period and increased 12% sequentially from Q1. \u2047 Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter, sales were 25% higher for a compounded annual growth rate of 12%. \u2047 Non-GAAP operating margin for the wholesale segment was 9.1% versus 12.2% in last year's second quarter, primarily reflecting higher raw material and freight costs, start-up costs for new facilities and labor challenges, partially offset by pricing and surcharges, fixed cost leverage on higher volume and lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales. \u2047 All in, we were pleased with the results and the progress we made sequentially from the first quarter operating margin of 4.7%. \u2047 Turning to the retail segment. \u2047 For the quarter, delivered sales increased 19% to $192 million. \u2047 Delivered same-store sales increased 17% versus the year-ago quarter. \u2047 Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter, delivered sales increased 30% for a compounded annual growth rate of 14%, again demonstrating the strength of the La-Z-Boy brand and our furniture gallery store system in this environment as well as ongoing strong execution at the store level with sales metrics positive across the board. \u2047 Non-GAAP operating margin increased to a second quarter record of 12.5% versus 9.4% in the prior year quarter, driven primarily by fixed cost leverage on the higher delivered sales volume as well as expense management. \u2047 Sales for Joybird which are reported in corporate and other increased 37% to $40 million versus the prior year quarter. \u2047 On a two-year basis, compared with a -- the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 second quarter delivered sales increased in impressive 93% for a compounded annual growth rate of 39%, reflecting the momentum Joybird is building and the direct to consumer marketplace as we continue to acquire customers and strengthen brand awareness through new digital marketing channels. \u2047 For the quarter, Joybird increased both its web and in-store traffic, conversion and average ticket. \u2047 Joybird's sustaining profitability and with a focus on accelerating disproportionate growth, we will continue to invest in Joybird marketing to drive broader brand awareness and customer acquisition. \u2047 Pulling all of this together, consolidated non-GAAP gross margin for the entire Company for the fiscal '22 second quarter decreased 500 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily driven by significant increases in raw material and freight costs, start-up costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and labor challenges in our wholesale businesses. \u2047 These items were partially offset by pricing and surcharges in our wholesale business. \u2047 Consolidated non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of sales for the quarter decreased 280 basis points, primarily reflecting fixed cost leverage on the higher sales volume, mainly in our retail segment as well as lower marketing spend as a percentage of sales. \u2047 Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the fiscal '22 second quarter was 26.6% versus 26% in the second quarter of fiscal '21. \u2047 Our effective tax rate varies from the 21% federal statutory rate, primarily due to state taxes. \u2047 We expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal '22 year to be between 25.5% and 26.5%. \u2047 Year-to-date, we generated $15 million in cash from operating activities. \u2047 We ended the period with $297 million in cash and no debt and held $31 million in investments to enhance returns on cash. \u2047 Year-to-date, we invested $59 million and higher inventory levels to protect against supply chain disruptions and support increased production and delivered sales. \u2047 We also spent $33 million in capital year-to-date, primarily related to improvements to our retail stores, plant upgrades at our manufacturing distribution facilities, new upholstery manufacturing capacity in Mexico and technology upgrades. \u2047 As a note, last month we entered into a new five-year $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility which replaced our $150 million ABL facility. \u2047 The new facility has a $100 million accordion feature, allowing us to expand our borrowing capacity to support future growth. \u2047 It also provides the option to request to extend the term beyond five years for two additional periods of one year, each. \u2047 Borrowings under the facility may be used for general corporate purposes and working capital. \u2047 As of today, we have no borrowings against the facility. \u2047 Regarding cash returned to shareholders, during the quarter, we continued to buy back shares, spending $15 million repurchasing more than 400,000 shares of stock in the open market leaving 8.6 million shares in our existing authorized share repurchase program. \u2047 Year-to-date we have returned $51 million to shareholders via share repurchase. \u2047 We also paid $6.6 million in dividends to shareholders in the second quarter. \u2047 And subsequent to quarter end, demonstrating its confidence in the Company's long-term growth prospects, the Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.165 per share. \u2047 As we looked at the future, from a capital allocation perspective, over the long term, we will target to invest roughly half of operating cash flow back into the business via capex and M&A and return the remainder to shareholders"], "gold_summary": ["q2 non-gaap earnings per share $0.85.  \u2047  q2 sales rose 25 percent to $576 million.  \u2047  q2 gaap earnings per share $0.89.  \u2047  continue
