{"article": ["The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Kociancic, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 We are also joined by other members of the Everest management team. \u2047 Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in these filings. \u2047 Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 For nearly 50 years, Everest has been a source of strength for our customers. \u2047 This has never been more important than in today's public health, economic, social and natural catastrophe-impacted environment. \u2047 Our business is running smoothly. \u2047 And our people continue to demonstrate the passion, professionalism and resilience that differentiates Everest. \u2047 I am particularly proud of Everest recently being named by Business Insurance as one of the best places to work in 2020, a meaningful achievement in the current environment. \u2047 The economic recovery is uneven, and there was significant natural catastrophe activity in the quarter. \u2047 Despite this, Everest has continued to grow and generate operating profit. \u2047 Our broadly diversified Reinsurance and Insurance franchise, our financial strength, deep distribution relationships and our focus on providing solutions to our customers represent the foundation that position us well for the strength we see in the reinsurance and Insurance Markets today. \u2047 In addition, we have added two exceptionally talented and seasoned global executives to our management team. \u2047 Mark Kociancic, our new Group Chief Financial Officer, joins us from SCOR, where he was the group CFO since 2013. \u2047 Jim Williamson, our new Group Chief Operating Officer, joins us from Chubb. \u2047 Both of these executives have made an immediate impact to Everest. \u2047 Craig has played an important role in the growth and evolution of Everest. \u2047 Craig will remain with the company until the end of 2020 to assist Mark with a smooth and seamless transition. \u2047 We have also further fortified our already strong capital base with a $1 billion senior notes offering completed on October 7. \u2047 This is very efficient long-term 30-year capital at a low 3.5% coupon. \u2047 As I said in the second quarter earnings call, we have the capital to play offense in this improving market, and we also have capital flexibility. \u2047 We chose to exercise some of this flexibility opportunistically, given the state of credit markets and the low borrowing rates available. \u2047 We will seek to deploy these proceeds as favorable market opportunities continue to develop and in support of our overall strategy to grow book value over time. \u2047 Our already strong company is now even stronger. \u2047 Everest's strength is evidenced by our third quarter results for the group, where despite the high frequency of natural catastrophe activity, we achieved 16% gross written premium growth and improved attritional combined ratio of 85.8%, excluding cat and pandemic impacts, net investment income of $234 million, operating income profit of $97 million, net income of $243 million, book value per share growth of 7% from year-end 2019 or 9% adjusted for dividends, and a record shareholders' equity of $9.6 billion. \u2047 Our growth in the quarter stems from a combination of new business opportunities, improved rate levels and high retention rates on our existing book. \u2047 The underwriting loss for the quarter was driven by the previously announced $300 million in catastrophe losses. \u2047 This is in the context of an estimated $35 billion industry loss in the third quarter. \u2047 We also added $125 million to our COVID-19 loss provision, reflecting the ongoing nature of this event and our prudent reserving philosophy. \u2047 This provision is predominantly IBNR. \u2047 Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic impact, our attritional combined ratios for the group in each of our segments, Reinsurance at 83% and Insurance at 94%, improved year-over-year and are reflective of the earnings generating power of the Everest franchise. \u2047 Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. \u2047 On a nine-month year-to-date basis, Everest has grown 15% and delivered an 88% attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic impact. \u2047 Everest Reinsurance had 20% quarterly growth year-over-year. \u2047 We executed our strategies to underwrite a high-performing book of business with higher economic returns and lower volatility. \u2047 We executed on reinsurance opportunities in several classes, including facultative risk, Property & Casualty and in certain territories, including the U.S., Canada and Latin America. \u2047 Traditional capital from highly rated carriers, like Everest, has become more relevant and supply is tight. \u2047 We see the favorable pricing environment continuing for the foreseeable future. \u2047 We also continue to be disciplined and rigorously evaluate each transaction. \u2047 John Doucette is available to provide additional details on market conditions during the Q&A. \u2047 Everest Insurance had solid execution in the quarter with continued underlying margin improvement over 2019 and 6% growth year-over-year, despite exposure reductions in certain lines given the current economic environment. \u2047 The attritional combined ratio, excluding the pandemic impact, improved to 94% for the quarter compared to 96% in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 We are strategically managing the Insurance portfolio to build a more diversified business and steer our mix toward product lines that earn higher margins over the long term. \u2047 Our significant position in both E&S and Retail channels give us access to a wide set of opportunities. \u2047 For the quarter, the main insurance growth drivers were continued rate momentum of plus 19% excluding workers' compensation, and plus 13% including workers' compensation. \u2047 We had strong growth across property, excess casualty and D&O, where market capacity is constrained and we are seeing the strongest rate increases and better terms. \u2047 We had continued strength in the excess and surplus line space. \u2047 And we also had strong renewal retention in both our Retail and E&S businesses. \u2047 Mike Karmilowicz is available to provide additional details on market conditions during the Q&A. \u2047 Regarding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the $125 million loss provision in the third quarter was comprised of $110 million for Reinsurance and $15 million for Insurance. \u2047 Our overall COVID-19 loss provision year-to-date is $435 million, of which 85% is IBNR. \u2047 Consistent with our analytical rigor, we continue to take a measured approach to our COVID-19 loss estimation that is based on credible, fact-based and supportable information. \u2047 We instituted a thorough loss estimation process at the start of the pandemic. \u2047 It is conducted team by team and contract by contract. \u2047 As events unfold and more data becomes available, we are continuously testing our estimates. \u2047 The claims data we're seeing is consistent with our expectations. \u2047 It is also important to reiterate that as a reinsurer, our analysis is specific to each situation. \u2047 And similar to reserving, we have established an equally prudent and rigorous claims process. \u2047 We evaluate claims presented based on existing policy and contract terms and conditions. \u2047 Lastly, we remain comfortable with the exposure and loss reserves in our Mortgage business in the context of the ongoing economic uncertainty from the pandemic. \u2047 In summary, Everest continued to perform well in the third quarter despite the uncertainty in the world today. \u2047 We continue to purposely seek the best opportunities to write business at attractive returns. \u2047 We have a talented team, a diversified global platform and a strong capital position, all of which allows us to provide attractive solutions to our clients and capture the improving opportunities in front of us. \u2047 I am very excited to be joining the great team here at Everest with its excellent talent base and culture. \u2047 I look forward to contributing to the company's continuing growth and success. \u2047 I think my industry experience and skill sets will be assets to further augment the great foundation that has been built here at Everest. \u2047 Everest delivered a strong set of financial results for the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 We achieved significant net income and positive operating income, continued our growth into favorable market conditions and strengthened our already robust capital position. \u2047 For the third quarter of 2020, Everest reported strong net income of $243 million. \u2047 This is more than double the $104 million of net income for the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, net income was $451 million compared to $792 million for the first nine months of 2019. \u2047 Year-to-date, net income included $67 million of net after-tax realized capital gains compared to $90 million in the first nine months of 2019. \u2047 Third quarter results were driven by strong premium growth across the group, strong investment income performance and improved attritional loss and combined ratios. \u2047 We also had Q3 catastrophe activity of $300 million, pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums. \u2047 And we added $125 million COVID-19 pandemic loss provision. \u2047 Year-to-date, our COVID-19 provision stands at $435 million. \u2047 And as Juan stated, it's predominantly IBNR. \u2047 The group experienced an underwriting loss in Q3 of $115 million due to the elevated level of natural catastrophes in the quarter as compared to an underwriting loss of $28 million in 2019. \u2047 Turning to Everest's market position and growth. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, gross written premium was $7.7 billion, up $1 billion or 15% compared to the first three quarters of 2019. \u2047 This reflects balanced and diversified growth in both segments, with Reinsurance up 15% and Insurance up 15% compared to last year. \u2047 During the third quarter of 2020, the company reported $300 million of catastrophe losses. \u2047 These losses are pre-tax and net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums and related to Hurricanes Laura, Isaias, Sally; wildfires in California and Oregon; and other events including the Midwest United States derecho windstorm. \u2047 The after-tax basis amount was approximately $240 million. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected net pre-tax and net of reinstatement catastrophe losses of $345 million compared to $335 million during the first nine months of 2019. \u2047 Excluding catastrophe losses and the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the comparable combined ratios were 85.8% for Q3 2020 and 87.1% for Q3 2019, an 88% through the first nine months of 2020 and 87.7% for the first nine months of 2019, mostly attributable to the Reinsurance business mix changes. \u2047 Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for the third quarter of 2020 was 59.3%, down from 59.7% compared to Q3 2019. \u2047 Excluding the pandemic loss estimate, the group attritional loss ratio for the first nine months of 2020 was 60.2%, up from 59.5% for the first nine months of 2019, primarily due to the continued change in Reinsurance business mix year-over-year. \u2047 For the Reinsurance segment, the Q3 2020 attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, was 57.5%, essentially flat from 57.6% in Q3 2019. \u2047 Year-to-date, it stood at 58.5%, excluding the pandemic loss, up from 57.5% for the first nine months of 2019. \u2047 This increase was related to the continued shift toward more pro rata business, which carries a higher loss pick versus excess of loss, but allows us to benefit directly from the firming primary market. \u2047 The Reinsurance division has $323 million of year-to-date operating profitability, given its $294 million of year-to-date net investment income. \u2047 For the Insurance segment, the Q3 2020 attritional loss ratio, excluding the impacts from the pandemic, was 64.8%, down from 65.9% in Q3 2019. \u2047 Year-to-date, it stood at 65.2%, down compared to 65.6% for the first nine months of 2019. \u2047 Our U.S. franchise, which makes up the majority of our Insurance business, continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. \u2047 The Insurance division has $62 million of year-to-date operating profitability, given its $126 million of year-to-date net investment income. \u2047 The Q3 group commission ratio of 20.2% was down compared to the prior year Q3 level of 23.3%. \u2047 This was driven by business mix and Reinsurance, notably more facultative business written and earned, and also higher ceding commission received in the Insurance segment. \u2047 The group commission ratio of 21.7% year-to-date was down compared to the prior year figure of 23%, largely due to the same reasoning. \u2047 The group expense ratio remains low at 6.1% for the first nine months of 2020, in line with our expectations. \u2047 Q3 investment income increased strongly to $234 million versus $181 million for Q3 2019. \u2047 For investments, pre-tax investment income was $420 million year-to-date as compared to $501 million for the first nine months of 2019. \u2047 The fixed income portfolio generated $408 million of investment income year-to-date compared to $383 million for the same period last year. \u2047 As expected, net investment income increased substantially as we recorded $89 million quarter-to-date of largely fair market value adjustments of our limited partnership investments in this line. \u2047 The limited partnership result was due to the impact of improvement in the economy and financial markets. \u2047 As a reminder, we report our limited partnership income one quarter in arrears. \u2047 The pre-tax yield to maturity on the investment portfolio was 3.1%, diminishing from 3.4% one year ago. \u2047 We continue to hold a well-diversified, high credit quality bond portfolio with conservative duration at approximately 3.5 years. \u2047 The current overall fixed income reinvestment yields are averaging approximately 2%. \u2047 Other income and expense included $38 million of foreign exchange gains during the first nine months of 2020 compared to a loss of $44 million for 2019. \u2047 Regarding income taxes, our effective tax rate on operating income was minus 0.1% through Q3. \u2047 There is a year-to-date tax benefit of $31 million related to the CARES Act that we reported in the first quarter. \u2047 Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on year-to-date operating income would be 8.9%. \u2047 Along with growth and profitability, positive cash flow was a highlight this quarter as we generated record operating cash flows of approximately $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $633 million in Q3 2019, reflecting the strength of the growth in premiums in 2020 compared to 2019. \u2047 Everest has a strong balance sheet, which was endorsed by the market with our very attractively received debt raise"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly gross written premium of $2.8 billion, reflecting growth of 16% over same quarter in 2019."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3 earnings per share $0.89.  \u2047  q3 earnings
