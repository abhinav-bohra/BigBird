{"article": ["These beliefs are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which may be beyond our control, including those detailed in our periodic SEC filings. \u2047 Please note that the Company's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. \u2047 There will be an opportunity for Q&A at the end of the call. \u2047 For those participating, please limit your remarks to one question and one follow-up if necessary. \u2047 I'm pleased with our company's performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. \u2047 We have delivered solid results while continuing to make progress on our strategy. \u2047 We've improved the way in which we serve our customers, expanded margins, and allocated capital effectively. \u2047 As you know, the pandemic has created real challenges over the past several quarters and we have yet to return to a steady state. \u2047 The slowdown last year had a global impact on supply chains and logistics and we continue to feel the impact of this in the economy and in our operations. \u2047 Yet, we have continued to have consistent and strong performance during this time. \u2047 As we look forward, we are facing some new and existing challenges. \u2047 As demand begins to rebound, global logistics, for example, continues to encounter issues. \u2047 New challenges include the global chip shortages and the rising cost of some components. \u2047 To be clear, these are good problems to have. \u2047 We are managing these challenges aggressively and our entire team will work tirelessly to deliver the best possible outcomes for our customers and continued high quality results. \u2047 So moving on to the second quarter highlights, our team delivered great results this quarter. \u2047 Sales were down 5.8%. \u2047 However, we saw gross profit margin of 43.4% expand 170 basis points and reported operating profit margin expand 180 basis points against the prior year. \u2047 The expansion was largely a result of product and productivity improvements throughout the business and we are very happy with the results. \u2047 Karen will speak in more detail about this later in the call. \u2047 Finally, in a message to our associates earlier this month, we announced that we were carbon neutral in our operations. \u2047 I will talk more around this later in the call, but I'm delighted that we were able to announce this milestone as quickly as we did. \u2047 I'd now like to update you on our ongoing transformation. \u2047 I have been at Acuity Brands for a little over 12 months and what I continue to see every day is a team that is striving for success, that is not shy about changing and that believes in Acuity and where we are going. \u2047 It is no secret that I came to Acuity because I saw the opportunity for our company to be more than a lighting business. \u2047 Our core lighting and lighting controls business was and is way more durable than the market gives it credit for, as evidenced by our performance over the past several quarters. \u2047 And we will continue to transform our business and the broader industry. \u2047 We have the best go-to-market network in the industry and the broadest product lines that serve a wide variety of end markets. \u2047 We continue to improve the effectiveness of our products and the efficiency of our supply chain through the implementation of new technologies. \u2047 We have a valuable and growing business in Distech and in Atrius we have the potential to build a very valuable technology business. \u2047 Finally, we have the ability to grow through acquisitions both in our current businesses as well as in new ones. \u2047 In our Lighting and Lighting Controls business we announced an exciting evolution in the leadership of that business. \u2047 Trevor Palmer has taken over as President. \u2047 Most recently, Trevor was leading our Controls business. \u2047 He joined the Company through the Distech acquisition nearly five years ago and he exemplified the talent that already exist within our organization. \u2047 Trevor brings 27 years of industry experience to the role. \u2047 I'm excited for what Trevor and his team will do with this business going forward. \u2047 During the quarter, we continued to invest in product development. \u2047 We have introduced new lighting and controls products and improved and evolved parts of our product and solutions portfolio. \u2047 In our Contractor Select portfolio, we saw significant demand for the Compact Pro High Bay, a versatile high bay that has been in demand as a result of the increase in warehouse renovations, driven by the shift to online retail and the expansion of logistics networks across North America. \u2047 The CPHB is a breakthrough product that was designed to deliver improved performance in a smaller size to ensure ease in installation. \u2047 The product uses fewer inputs, is more efficient to transport, and is both globally sourced and manufactured in our facilities to ensure supply chain flexibility. \u2047 Within our GUV category, we introduced EvolAIR with UV technology -- with UV Angel technology, excuse me. \u2047 This product uses onboard 254-nanometer technology and circulation above the fixture to locally disinfect air in occupied and unoccupied spaces. \u2047 We have installed this product in multiple Acuity locations and have specifications being developed with this product in education, office, and healthcare applications. \u2047 It is worth pointing out that our controls capabilities are a key differentiator for successful GUV lighting solutions. \u2047 Our Holophane product continued to win bids in infrastructure projects. \u2047 We were awarded the order for the relighting of the Big Dig project in Massachusetts that will begin in the second half of our fiscal year. \u2047 Part of the scope of this mandate was to replace existing low cost fixtures that had been installed several years ago and were not performing as expected. \u2047 Holophane is known for its quality, and durability and I am pleased we are the partner of choice to make the necessary improvements. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, we have continued to invest in product vitality. \u2047 We have maintained the pace and quality of product rollouts this year, which positions us well for the market recovery. \u2047 I continue to be impressed by the agility of our team. \u2047 Transitioning to go-to-market, we are committed to our independent sales network. \u2047 This quarter we announced the realignment in the Northeast that will benefit our customers in the region and nationwide. \u2047 We are creating a new agency through the consolidation of what were formerly the Acuity-owned agency in New York, the New Jersey territory and the independent agency in Philadelphia. \u2047 This transaction demonstrates our commitment to the independent sales network, which we believe to be the strongest in the industry. \u2047 By creating this new agency, we are better positioned to participate in designs and specifications that start in New York and travel around the country. \u2047 We are also better positioned to serve contractors who work in New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia. \u2047 We continue to make progress with Distech and Atrius. \u2047 Distech is uniquely positioned in the building management space, built on open protocols and distributed through a network of independent systems integrators. \u2047 It has continued to grow throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We're also making progress around the product roadmap for Atrius. \u2047 We are recruiting best-in-class talent to drive the capabilities in that business. \u2047 In early January, Sandeep Modhvadia joined the business as Vice President of Product Development. \u2047 Sandeep comes to us from Google Cloud where he was responsible for the product development team building vertical solutions for the manufacturing, industrial, automotive, power and transportation industries. \u2047 We will continue to add talent to Atrius and make progress building unique and valuable technology solutions. \u2047 Now, I would like to take a few minutes to highlight our progress on the ESG front. \u2047 ESG is directly aligned with our values and our business strategy. \u2047 We care about the environment, our people and our communities. \u2047 Our company has been built on products, technologies and services that deliver sustainability and energy efficiency. \u2047 Over the last year, we have focused on our own operations. \u2047 Our recent accomplishment of achieving carbon neutrality across Scope 1 and 2 emissions in our operations is the result of this work and demonstrates our commitment to continually improving our communities. \u2047 We achieved carbon neutrality as a result of reducing environmental impacts in our facilities and through investing in carbon offsite projects. \u2047 Some of the energy efficient improvements made in our facilities can be highlighted by our Crawfordsville, Indiana facility where we optimized air compressors, installed more efficient belts and added switches to reduce energy consumption and by our Conyers, Georgia and Des Plaines, Illinois facilities where we installed our new I-BEAM IBG and Holophane Phuzion high bay lights and used our Atrius building OS technology to conserve energy and improve the quality of light and space. \u2047 And in our facility in New York, Ohio, in which we rebuilt the glass furnace to improve overall efficiency and which has now completely converted to renewable electricity, a win for the environment and the cost savings. \u2047 Our priority is the reduction of energy usage in our facilities and for our customers. \u2047 Until we're able to realize the full impact of our energy efficiency improvements, we are supplementing with an offset program that is focused on helping the communities where we operate. \u2047 We are investing in a series of carbon offset projects in Mexico, Indiana and California, all communities where we have a presence. \u2047 These projects support energy efficiency and renewable energy options at colleges and universities, landfills and agricultural sites. \u2047 These programs allow us to remove carbon from the atmosphere and balance our carbon footprint from operations. \u2047 While the focus of our recent accomplishments has been environmental, we are giving equal prominence to the S and the G parts of EFG. \u2047 Simply stated, we want to be the place where the best people come to do their best work. \u2047 To do this, we are continuing to focus on improving the lives of our associates by strengthening our culture and removing the barriers to success. \u2047 Acuity is proud to be an inclusive company where we all succeed together. \u2047 Finally, we have addressed several issues of governance over the last year by, among other things, diversifying and restructuring our Board of Directors and overhauling our total rewards program including improving our long-term incentive plans. \u2047 Moving on to capital allocation. \u2047 As I previously mentioned, we have now repurchased nearly 10% of our outstanding shares since May 2020. \u2047 Effectively allocating capital is an important part of how we will create value for our company. \u2047 To reiterate, our capital allocation priorities are clear: first, to grow our current businesses; second, to grow our company through acquisitions; third, to maintain our dividend; and fourth to create value through share repurchases. \u2047 We were able to capitalize on the dislocation in our share price and have been very effective repurchasing shares over the last year. \u2047 As we look forward and barring another significant market dislocation, we do not anticipate maintaining this rate of share repurchases. \u2047 We will return to our priority of using capital to grow the business. \u2047 As we look ahead, we see improvements in the end markets we serve and we are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the remainder of fiscal year '21. \u2047 We intend to use the breadth of our product portfolio and the strength of our go-to-market teams to deliver a solid top line performance. \u2047 While there will be global challenges ramping back up, we are aggressively addressing them. \u2047 We will continue to invest in our business with the intention of becoming a larger, more dynamic company. \u2047 I want to start by echoing Neil's initial comments regarding this quarter's performance. \u2047 Our associates pulled together to deliver a solid performance and the fourth consecutive quarter of gross profit margin over 42%. \u2047 I am proud of the changes and progress we continue to make. \u2047 Moving to our second quarter results, net sales were $777 million, a decrease of 5.8% compared to the prior year, which we believe was a very good performance in this market. \u2047 Notably, within our sales performance, our independent sales network and direct sales network were approximately flat with the prior year as we continued to see strength in medium to large projects, offsetting some of the pressure in the commercial office space, which continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Retail channel sales declined approximately 24% as compared to the prior year as a result of strong year-over-year pre-pandemic comparison. \u2047 This was exacerbated by one of our large customers carrying out an inventory rebalancing, which we believe to be a one-off impact. \u2047 We expect to see sequential growth in this channel in our fiscal third quarter of 2021. \u2047 Finally, sales in corporate accounts declined just over 50% as compared to the prior year. \u2047 We continue to see large retailers differ renovation spend as a result of safety concerns resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 In the last few weeks, there have been indications that these concerns are slowly lifting and we expect to see continued sequential recovery through the balance of the year. \u2047 Moving on to the rest of the income statement. \u2047 Gross profit margin was 43.4% for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 170 basis points over the prior year. \u2047 This was an outstanding achievement. \u2047 This outperformance was the result of product and productivity improvements that yielded returns and we believe that this will position us well for any unforeseen challenges. \u2047 Given this gross profit margin improvement, we believe attaining a gross profit margin above 42% is reasonable on an annualized basis. \u2047 Reported operating profit margin was 11.7% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted operating profit margin was 14% of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, an increase of 170 basis points over the prior year. \u2047 The majority of this improvement was driven by the higher gross profit margin and continued cost containment efforts, particularly around travel expenses and sales and marketing costs resulting from less in-person activity due to the pandemic. \u2047 As we continue to demonstrate our ability to drive margins, we will begin to reassess our reinvestment strategy, prioritizing systems and software development as we focus on executing our digital transformation. \u2047 As the economy continues to open up, we expect to see travel and other marketing expenses increase throughout the balance of the year. \u2047 We are working with our associates to ensure that only essential travel and marketing expenses are being incurred and do not expect to return to pre-pandemic expense levels in fiscal 2021. \u2047 As previously discussed, this quarter, we were able to share with our associates that we achieved 100% carbon neutrality within our operations by prioritizing efficiency improvements in operations and some offsetting measures. \u2047 This is not just an initiative for the management team. \u2047 Both Neil and I believe this is the core to the ongoing success of the Company. \u2047 As part of the offsetting measures, we expect to see a modest SDA investment, but this will not be material. \u2047 The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was 23.5% compared with 23.4% in the prior year quarter. \u2047 We currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate will be around 24% for the full year fiscal"],
