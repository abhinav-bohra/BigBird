{"article": ["Despite the extraordinary challenges 2020 presented on a global scale, we are extremely pleased with the strong execution of our team -- that our team has shown, not only in the field, but by all of the employees within the family of companies, who demonstrated the true resiliency of the Reliance business model. \u2047 I applaud each and every one of you for your tremendous efforts to quickly and nimbly adapt to the changing environments, ensure our customers were always taken care of, and most importantly, maintain your unwavering commitment to health and safety, our most important core value. \u2047 Since 2017, our SMART Safety program has been focused on embedding our culture of safety across our entire family of companies. \u2047 Working together as one company, we focused on this initiative in 2020 like never before in response to the new and unique challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 In addition to developing new policies and procedures to prevent the spread of the virus, we improved our safety performance in 2020 with an approximately 23% reduction in our incident rate compared to 2019. \u2047 While this is a significant milestone, as I've stated in the past, we will not be satisfied until this rate reaches 0. \u2047 I'd like to take a moment to congratulate both Karla Lewis and Arthur Ajemyan for the recently announced well-deserved promotions. \u2047 Consistent with our Board's strategic executive leadership succession plan, Karla was promoted from CFO to President and was simultaneously appointed to our Board of Directors effective January 15. \u2047 Karla has demonstrated excellent judgment and leadership in each role she has held since joining Reliance in 1992, and her unique abilities and talents have earned the respect of our employees and shareholders. \u2047 Karla's promotion recognizes her significant contributions to Reliance. \u2047 It will allow her to broaden her knowledge of Reliance's field operations and increase the diversity of her experience. \u2047 In addition, Arthur Ajemyan was promoted to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective January 15. \u2047 Arthur has held various positions in Reliance's finance and accounting department for over 15 years and has done a phenomenal job. \u2047 I congratulate both Karla and Arthur on their promotions and look forward to continuing to work closely with them in their new roles. \u2047 Now let's turn to our 2020 results. \u2047 We delivered a solid financial performance in 2020, driven by consistently strong operational execution despite considerable turbulence in the market. \u2047 Our results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our people and unique business model as well as our ability to execute through both good times and bad given the diversity of our products, end markets and geographies. \u2047 Our decentralized structure allowed us to respond rapidly to fluid market conditions and demand trends. \u2047 These factors, combined with pricing discipline and continuous improvements to our value-added processing capabilities, enabled us to achieve our second consecutive year of record annual gross profit margins at 31.5%, up 120 basis points from 2019 and exceeding our estimated sustainable range of 28% to 30%. \u2047 We also maintained healthy profitability levels despite the extraordinarily volatile and challenging market conditions. \u2047 For the full year, we generated non-GAAP earnings per share of $7.71 as a result of the combination of strong margin discipline and effective expense control, which helped mitigate our decline in profitability. \u2047 On the heels of a record year in 2019, we maintained strong cash flow from operations of $1.17 billion in 2020 driven by our profitability and focus on working capital management. \u2047 Fueled by our ongoing focus on rightsizing our inventory to reflect current demand levels and our differentiating advantage of cross-selling inventory among our family of companies, we achieved our companywide inventory turn goal of 4.7 times based on tons for 2020. \u2047 In line with historical trends and the cornerstone of our business model, a significant portion of our metal we purchase is from domestic suppliers. \u2047 And it is paramount that we continue to support our mill partners who, in turn, have consistently been there for Reliance during challenging times. \u2047 Our countercyclical cash flow generation allows us to remain flexible and opportunistic in executing our growth initiatives while concurrently returning value to our stockholders. \u2047 We invested $172 million in our business through capital expenditures in 2020, including many growth opportunities such as our recent toll processing expansion in Texas and Kentucky. \u2047 Today, we are introducing our 2021 capital expenditure budget of $245 million that includes new buildings and other projects to expand, upgrade and maintain many of our operating facilities. \u2047 We are installing energy-efficient lighting and solar panels in certain of our facilities. \u2047 Our 2021 budget also includes innovative new processing equipment to provide our customers with the highest-quality products and services. \u2047 Although COVID-19 has slowed the pace of acquisitions activity in general, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of potential candidates as we've begun to broaden our view on the universe of prospective growth opportunities. \u2047 As always, we evaluate opportunities based on a strict set of criteria to ensure a strong fit within the family of companies. \u2047 Now turning to stockholder returns. \u2047 In 2020, we repurchased $337.3 million worth of our common stock at an average cost of $91.80 per share and paid $164.1 million in dividends to our shareholders. \u2047 We've maintained our payment of regularly quarterly dividends for 61 consecutive years without ever suspending payment or reducing our dividend rate. \u2047 In addition, we've increased our dividend 28 times since our 1994 IPO, including the most recent increase of 10% for the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 Looking forward into the remainder of 2021. \u2047 Reliance will continue to execute and improve upon our tried-and-true model that has led us to industry-leading results for many decades. \u2047 Over the past year, we've adapted to operate more efficiently than ever before without sacrificing our competitive edge and the critical elements of our business that make Reliance a trusted and reliable business partner. \u2047 We will maintain our focus on opportunities to enhance our products, end markets and geographical diversification, along with our ongoing commitment to strong pricing discipline, diligent expense control, when-needed inventory management, organic growth and innovation. \u2047 As was evident throughout the past year, our customers rely on Reliance to continue to support them through trying times, often in greater capacity and on a more frequent basis. \u2047 As I continue to say, and I will say again, America is going to need Reliance to rebuild. \u2047 As an essential business, we were able to continue operating throughout the pandemic, with our 2020 tons sold decreasing only 10.8% compared to 2019. \u2047 Our average selling price was down 9.6% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declining mill prices for most of the products we sell during the first nine months of the year. \u2047 Despite these negative trends, we achieved record gross profit margin in 2020. \u2047 In the fourth quarter of 2020, healthy demand conditions in the majority of our end markets resulted in our tons sold declining only 1.3% compared to the prior quarter. \u2047 This was the lowest Q4 seasonal decline we've experienced in the last 10 years and exceeded our guidance by a significant margin. \u2047 Despite customer holiday-related closures and less shipping days typical of the fourth quarter, we experienced solid demand trends throughout the fourth quarter as the economy continued to regain momentum. \u2047 Supported by solid demand and rising input costs, metal pricing improved as mill price increases for many of the products we sell accelerated throughout the fourth quarter with prices for certain carbon steel products almost doubling, which led to our average selling price increasing 4.6% compared to the third quarter of 2020, again, exceeding our expectations. \u2047 The favorable demand and pricing conditions in the fourth quarter contributed to our record gross profit margin of 33%, a 60 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 And on a non-GAAP FIFO basis, which we believe is the best measure of our day-to-day operating performance, our gross profit margin of 33.6% increased 180 basis points from 31.8% in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Our record gross profit margin reflects the outstanding performance by our managers in the field who effectively implemented price increases at the time of mill announcement prior to receiving the higher-cost metal into inventory, pushing our gross profit margin above already strong levels, resulting from our focus on higher-margin orders. \u2047 While we are very pleased with our record Q4 and full year gross profit margin, we continue to believe our estimated sustainable gross profit margin range of 28% to 30% is appropriate as we navigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and operate through this uncertain environment. \u2047 That said, maintaining our strong gross profit margin remains a cornerstone of our business model. \u2047 We believe our managers will continue to successfully leverage the significant investments we have made to expand and improve our value-added processing capabilities. \u2047 In fact, one of the key factors contributing to our record gross profit margin for the full year was our value-added processing capabilities, which have increased in recent years as a result of our significant investments in state-of-the-art equipment. \u2047 While the percentage of orders with value-added processing declined to approximately 49% from 51% in 2019 due to changes in product mix caused by the pandemic, process orders continue to serve as a stabilizer to our margins in challenging markets with declining demand and pricing trends. \u2047 I'll now turn to a high-level overview of the conditions in our key end markets. \u2047 Demand in nonresidential construction, the largest market we serve, remained relatively steady during the fourth quarter due to ongoing healthy bidding activity for new projects and the restart of projects that had been put on hold earlier in the year. \u2047 We've been seeing quoting activity in the areas you might expect such as infrastructure projects, schools, utilities, water and power, strip malls and data and distribution centers. \u2047 Demand for the toll processing services we provide to the automotive market was strong, with activity back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter as automotive OEMs and steel and aluminum mills continued to ramp production as a result of reopenings following COVID-19 shutdowns in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 We commenced operations at our new facility in Kentucky in late November and also recently broke ground on a new greenfield tolling facility in Texas, with both focused on carbon steel tolling to support increased capacity of our toll processing customers, who are primarily metal producers and their end users. \u2047 Demand in heavy industry for both agricultural and construction equipment rebounded to solid levels in the fourth quarter as production schedules continued to ramp following customer reopenings from COVID-19-related shutdowns and to meet equipment dealer restocking needs. \u2047 Semiconductor demand steadily improved from the third quarter of 2020, and the market continues to be one of our strongest. \u2047 Demand in commercial aerospace further declined in the fourth quarter as a direct result of reduced air travel due to COVID-19, which has reduced airplane build rates. \u2047 We believe the fourth quarter represented the trough. \u2047 That said, demand in the military, defense and space portions of our aerospace business remained stable at solid levels throughout the fourth quarter. \u2047 Finally, demand in the energy sector, which is mainly oil and natural gas, remained under pressure in the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 And throughout 2020, we took prudent cost-reduction measures, including the closure of certain facilities, which helped strengthen our overall efficiency and position us to support a recovery in this market. \u2047 We are optimistic on both demand and pricing trends in the first quarter of 2021 as we have experienced strength in both so far in the first quarter. \u2047 And Arthur will now review our financial results. \u2047 I'll start with our sales discussion. \u2047 Fourth quarter 2020 sales were down 12.8% from the prior year period as our markets continued to recover following the reopening of the economy. \u2047 Approximately half of the decline in our sales can be attributed to our businesses supporting the commercial aerospace and energy end markets, as evidenced by the disproportionately higher declines in our sales of aluminum and alloy products. \u2047 For the full year of 2020, sales were down 19.7% from 2019. \u2047 Approximately half of the decline in sales was due to lower shipping volumes across all major end markets we sell to, and the remaining half was due to lower average selling prices. \u2047 However, both recovering demand and pricing from the reopening of the economy in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 helped to mitigate the annual decline in our sales. \u2047 As Jim and Karla highlighted, we generated a record quarterly gross profit margin of 33% in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 60 basis points from both Q3 2020 and Q4 2019 and a record gross profit margin of 31.5% for the full year of 2020, up 120 basis points from our previous annual record of 30.3% in 2019. \u2047 Our non-GAAP FIFO gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2020 was up 450 basis points from Q4 2019, and for the full year of 2020 was up to 280 basis points from 2019. \u2047 We incurred LIFO expense of $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 due to rapidly increasing mill costs for most of our products. \u2047 However, for the full year of 2020, we still recognized LIFO income of $22 million as our cost of inventory on hand at the end of the year was still below the levels at the beginning of the year. \u2047 This compares to LIFO income in the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 of $81 million and $156 million, respectively. \u2047 We ended 2020 with a LIFO reserve of $115.6 million on our balance sheet. \u2047 Based on current market conditions, we expect to incur an annual LIFO expense of $340 million in 2021. \u2047 Consistent with our accounting policy, we allocate our annual estimate on a pro rata basis in each quarter. \u2047 As such, our current projected Q1 2021 LIFO expense is $85 million. \u2047 As in prior years, we will update our expectations each quarter based upon our inventory cost and metal pricing trends. \u2047 Our fourth quarter non-GAAP SG&A expenses decreased $51 million or 9.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 on a 7.9% reduction in shipments. \u2047 For the full year, same-store SG&A expenses declined $241 million or 11.5% on a 10.8% reduction in shipments. \u2047 The decline in SG&A expenses was due to reduced spend across every major expense category. \u2047 As you've heard us say before, approximately 60% to 65% of our SG&A expenses are people related. \u2047 When looking at the 11.5% year-over-year decline in same-store SG&A expenses, approximately half of the decrease was people-related as our headcount declined 14% compared to the prior year. \u2047 In addition, lower incentive pay due to lower gross profit and pre-tax income levels also contributed to the decline in our compensation costs. \u2047 Although we are entering the first quarter of 2021 with a more efficient expense structure because of strong volume and pricing trends, we expect our expenses will increase in the first quarter"],
