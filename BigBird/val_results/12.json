{"article": ["The slides for today's call can be found on the Investors section of our website, along with the news release that was issued today. \u2047 These uncertainties include economic conditions, market demands and competitive factors. \u2047 Also, the discussions during this conference call may include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \u2047 Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the slide deck for today's call, which is posted on the Investors section of our website. \u2047 Turning to slide three. \u2047 Also joining us on the call is Ram Mayampurath, who was announced earlier today has been appointed Rogers' Chief Financial Officer, effective May 1. \u2047 Rogers delivered another strong financial performance in Q1 driven by growth in advanced mobility markets, a strengthening market recovery and continued operational excellence. \u2047 First quarter net sales increased 9% to $229 million and exceeded the top end of our guidance. \u2047 Gross margin improved to 39% as a result of our strong operational performance. \u2047 EPS also exceeded the high end of our guidance, and we reported earnings of $1.66 per share on a GAAP basis and record adjusted earnings of $1.92 per share. \u2047 The increase in Q1 sales was broad-based, and nearly all of our markets increased at double-digit rate. \u2047 The impressive growth was enabled by both our strategic focus on fast-growing markets and the ongoing economic recovery. \u2047 We continue to realize the benefits of our multiyear investments in innovative technologies to capitalize on the accelerating opportunities in advanced mobility markets. \u2047 EV/HEV and ADAS sales increased at double-digit rates sequentially and grew more than 30% compared to Q1 of 2020. \u2047 Sales of compression pads and related solutions for EV batteries were especially strong and more than doubled year-over-year. \u2047 Sales of our power semiconductor substrate solutions were also higher. \u2047 We anticipate further top line growth as these markets continue to accelerate. \u2047 As announced last quarter, we are investing aggressively in additional capacity for our advanced battery compression pad and ceramic substrate technologies to take advantage of this opportunity. \u2047 We are also investing in additional resources and capabilities to support this growth. \u2047 We are at a growth inflection point, and these investments will position Rogers to capitalize on the significant momentum in these markets and add to our strong market positions in the near term and longer term. \u2047 Sales in the defense market increased at an impressive rate in Q1, similar to the EV/HEV and ADAS markets. \u2047 Our focused strategy and new product introductions continue to drive design wins and growth. \u2047 We saw a resurgence in industrial demand in Q1 as sales grew sharply versus the prior quarter and returned to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Our sales in the industrial market are closely tied to levels of capital investment, which continues to improve. \u2047 Demand was strongest for applications used in semiconductor equipment. \u2047 Other markets, such as clean energy and wireless infrastructure, also showed strong improvements in Q1 with sales growing at double-digit rates. \u2047 In the portable electronics market, sales were seasonally lower in the first quarter and consistent with our expectations. \u2047 The impact to sales from the disruption to our UTIS facility was minimal as a result of selling our undamaged finished goods inventory. \u2047 We continue to work closely with our customers during this time, and we remain on track to resume production in the fourth quarter of this year. \u2047 Q1 sales were largely unaffected by global supply chain disruptions, but we began seeing more impacts as we exited the quarter. \u2047 In the second quarter, the lack of availability of certain raw materials, primarily due to weather interruptions along the U.S. Gulf Coast, will somewhat temper our sales growth and gross margin. \u2047 However, we expect this headwind to moderate by the end of Q2. \u2047 Higher commodity costs reduced Q1 gross margin, while our copper hedging strategy largely offset the impact to earnings per share. \u2047 In Q2, we are continuing to offset the impact of higher commodity costs through hedging activities and commercial actions. \u2047 In summary, we had an excellent quarter delivering strong sales growth, improved profitability and robust cash generation. \u2047 Continuing on to slide five, I'll discuss the latest market outlook. \u2047 As mentioned, we are seeing broad strength across our market portfolio. \u2047 This is driven by two major factors. \u2047 First, we are benefiting from our strategic positioning in markets with long secular tailwinds, such as advanced mobility. \u2047 We are also seeing exceptional growth in this area, primarily driven by the accelerating adoption of EVs and HEVs. \u2047 Second, the global economic recovery continues to gain momentum. \u2047 Our expectation is that near-term economic activity will continue to improve, aided by stimulus measures and vaccine rollouts. \u2047 This should continue to support strong demand, and we are maximizing output at existing manufacturing facilities in response. \u2047 Turning to the long-term outlook for advanced mobility, estimates continue to point to an extremely strong growth outlook for the EV/HEV market. \u2047 Recent analysis from industry experts points to an acceleration in EV/HEV adoption. \u2047 In their updated report, BCG now expects that by 2026, EVs and HEVs will account for more than half of global light vehicle sales, four years earlier than previously expected. \u2047 Underscoring this trend is the ongoing investments and commitments by global automakers. \u2047 Some examples in recent weeks include commitments from Volvo and Honda to phase out internal combustion engines and announcements of sizable investments in battery capacity from VW, GM and others. \u2047 It's important to note that full electric vehicles are expected to be the fastest-growing segment of this market with a CAGR of over 40%. \u2047 This is significant for Rogers because our content opportunity increases with higher degrees of electrification. \u2047 For example, our ceramic substrate content opportunity in a full EV ranges from around $25 to $40 compared to a content opportunity of approximately $5 in a 48-volt mild hybrid. \u2047 The same concept applies to our battery compression pad solutions used in plug-in HEVs and EVs. \u2047 Our content can be greater than $30 per vehicle and rises meaningfully as the battery size increases. \u2047 Other solutions, which are used across the entire EV/HEV market, include vibration dampening pads and battery pack sealing solutions. \u2047 Also, we have secured design wins with several promising entrants to the EV market with our power interconnect solutions. \u2047 We continue to see a very strong mid-teens growth potential over the next five years driven by increasing penetration rates and higher levels of vehicle autonomy. \u2047 Near-term auto production faces some challenges from the limited supply of certain semiconductors, but the long-term outlook remains robust. \u2047 We are encouraged by our progress in this market, and we continue to expand our customer base with new design wins. \u2047 In addition to the opportunities in advanced mobility, we also see attractive growth potential in other markets, such as renewable energy and defense. \u2047 The renewable energy market is expected to grow at a 10% CAGR over the next five years, which we anticipate will continue to drive robust demand for our power semiconductor substrates. \u2047 Rogers has a very rich heritage of innovation and a proven track record of developing solutions that drive growth end markets with strong secular tailwinds. \u2047 We achieved these results by combining our deep expertise in material science with collaborative engineer-to-engineer customer relationships. \u2047 Our global innovation in R and D centers are key to maintaining a strong development pipeline. \u2047 They are staffed with world-class personnel who identify, develop and acquire the technology needed to enable the next-generation of products. \u2047 Through partnerships with universities and other research institutions, we can further expand our product development pipeline in an efficient and cost-effective manner. \u2047 The progress we've made in our EV/HEV business is a prime example of how innovation drives growth at Rogers. \u2047 For example, our advanced battery pad and battery pack sealing solutions and silicon nitride substrates were all developed through our innovation and R and D process in recent years. \u2047 These products form the core of our solutions for the EV/HEV market, which has now increased to more than 11% of total sales. \u2047 Our focus on innovation continues with a number of advanced solutions that are currently under development. \u2047 Some of these -- some of the products in our development pipeline include next-generation silicon nitride substrates with improved thermal performance, advanced battery compression pad solutions and high-performance antennas for next-generation auto radar. \u2047 Our ability to drive organic growth through innovation is a source of competitive advantage for Rogers and will continue to be a core element of our strategy. \u2047 Turning to slide seven. \u2047 I'll recap our key messages from today's call. \u2047 First, we delivered strong Q1 results driven by our strategic focus on advanced mobility markets and by continuing our market recovery. \u2047 We also continue to drive operational improvements and higher sustainable gross margins. \u2047 The growth opportunities in advanced mobility markets and especially the EV/HEV space continue to accelerate driven by powerful, long-term secular tailwinds. \u2047 This opportunity is extremely compelling, and we are investing aggressively to capitalize on this growth. \u2047 As a longtime Rogers employee and a seasoned senior finance leader, it gives me great confidence to have Ram step into the Chief Financial Officer role. \u2047 Ram has over 30 years of corporate finance experience and has held senior finance leadership positions at Rogers, where he has had responsibility for financial operations, financial planning and analysis, business transformation and treasury. \u2047 I have appreciated Mike's wise and insightful counsel, which has helped Rogers navigate through some difficult situations and has helped make Rogers a stronger and more resilient company. \u2047 Mike will remain with the company during the transition period to help facilitate a seamless transition with Ram. \u2047 Please join me in wishing Mike a long, healthy, happy retirement. \u2047 Your thoughts are truly appreciated. \u2047 I've enjoyed my time at Rogers immensely, and I'm appreciative of the opportunity to have made a positive impact on the results and culture of Rogers. \u2047 It's been my fortune to work with a tremendous senior management team, a supportive Board and a hard-working dedicated Rogers global community. \u2047 Let's jump back to the results. \u2047 On the slides ahead, I'll review our first quarter 2021 results. \u2047 Turning to slide nine. \u2047 As Bruce mentioned, Rogers delivered strong financial results in the first quarter. \u2047 Revenues increased sequentially in both our EMS and AES business segment. \u2047 As communicated in our Q4 earnings call, the AES business segment is comprised of the former ACS and PES business segments. \u2047 We delivered gross margin that was 70 basis points higher than Q4 through increased volumes and operating efficiency, despite a less favorable product mix and significantly higher commodity and freight costs. \u2047 In Q1, we delivered strong earnings through increased revenues, improved gross margins and increased other income. \u2047 In our GAAP results, we recognized $1.5 million in restructuring costs related to the footprint optimization activities communicated in our third quarter 2020 call and $1.3 million for the loss resulting from the fire at our UTIS facility, net of expected insurance proceeds. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 25.2%. \u2047 Turning to slide 10. \u2047 Our Q1 revenues of $229.3 million increased by $18.6 million compared to the fourth quarter, reflecting broad strength across our product markets. \u2047 AES revenues increased 10% to $131.9 million, while EMS revenues grew 6% to $91.8 million. \u2047 Currency exchange rates favorably impacted first quarter revenues by approximately 1.5% compared to Q4. \u2047 AES revenues grew sequentially due to strong demand in all three product lines: RF solutions, power semiconductor substrates and power interconnects. \u2047 Within RF Solutions, the Aerospace and Defense business accounted for 19% of the business segment revenues and grew 15% sequentially. \u2047 The ADAS business accounted for 18% of the revenues and grew 12%, and wireless infrastructure accounted for 17% of the revenues and grew 26%. \u2047 Defense applications continue to be a solid growth area for Rogers as customer programs continue to ramp. \u2047 Record ADAS revenues continue to benefit from the rebound in automotive manufacturing and, to date, have not been adversely impacted by the semiconductor chip shortage. \u2047 Wireless infrastructure revenues experienced a nice sequential increase due to 5G installations, both inside and outside of China. \u2047 Clean energy, which is comprised of the renewable energy revenues in both the power semiconductor and the power interconnect business as well as the variable frequency drive business in the power semiconductor business, accounted for 16% of the business and grew 15% sequentially. \u2047 The sequential increase in our variable frequency drive business was the first in several quarters and is reflective of the general economic recovery. \u2047 We believe the renewable energy demand will be uneven in the short term as this business is comprised of project opportunities but will have meaningful long-term momentum. \u2047 EV/HEV application revenues accounted for 12% of the segment revenues and increased 2% sequentially as order timing tempered the Q1 increase in ceramic substrate revenues. \u2047 EMS revenues grew sequentially primarily due to significant increases in nearly all applications, highlighted by a 41% increase in EV/HEV applications which accounted for 11% of the segment revenues and a 23% increase in general industrial applications, which accounted for 44% of the segment revenues. \u2047 The EV/HEV applications continue to gain momentum, consistent with the accelerated demands in the EV/HEV market. \u2047 And the increase in general industrial revenues continues a recovery trend that commenced in the fourth quarter and mirrors the general economic recovery. \u2047 As expected, revenues for the portable electronics, which accounted for 22% of the segment revenues, experienced a 31% sequential seasonal decline off a very strong second half of 2020. \u2047 Revenues from our UTIS factory were down just slightly compared to Q4 despite the fire that occurred in mid-February. \u2047 Turning to slide 11. \u2047 Our gross margin for the first quarter was $89.5 million or 39% of revenues, 70 basis points higher than Q4. \u2047 The increase in gross margin was due primarily to higher volume and improved manufacturing execution, more than offsetting the unfavorable product mix and increased raw material and freight costs. \u2047 While both the AES and EMS businesses had to overcome the aforementioned headwinds, the AES business was able to produce increased gross margin in all three product lines. \u2047 The EMS gross margin declined sequentially, even though manufacturing execution improved. \u2047 Although our gross margin percentage increased by 70 basis points sequentially, the significant increase in copper cost meaningfully dampened our gross margin percentage in the quarter. \u2047 To mitigate the higher cost of copper on our profitability, we enter into copper hedging contracts. \u2047 The gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in other income expense below our operating profit results. \u2047 In addition to hedging our copper purchases, we have taken commercial actions to mitigate the increased cost of commodity and other raw materials. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports qtrly adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.92.  \u2047  qtrly diluted earnings per share$1.66.
