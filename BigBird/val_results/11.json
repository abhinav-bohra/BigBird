{"article": ["We hope you are all well. \u2047 We will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. \u2047 We believe that these measures provide useful supplemental data that, while not a substitute for GAAP measures, allow for greater transparency in the review of our financial and operational performance. \u2047 At this point, it is my pleasure to turn things over to Philippe Krakowsky. \u2047 As always, I'll start with a high level view of our performance in the quarter. \u2047 Ellen will then provide additional details, and I'll conclude with updates on key developments at our agencies to be followed by Q&A. \u2047 These include the transition to work from home, and now are planning for return to office in many parts of the world, as well as the significant personal difficulties presented by the long course of the pandemic. \u2047 It's due to the efforts of our people, their commitment to their craft, our clients and to each other that we can share with you today these very strong results. \u2047 Performance that demonstrates our resilience represents a remarkable rebound from the impact of the pandemic, and is also the largest second quarter in our company's history. \u2047 Our strong results in the quarter build on IPG's consistent record of industry outperformance and margin expansion. \u2047 Our growth across regions, disciplines and client sectors speaks to more than a recovering global economy. \u2047 It underscores the elevated value that marketing and media partners can deliver in the integration of creativity, technology and data at scale made the significantly increased velocity of digital transformation. \u2047 At Interpublic, we're confident that we are attuned to the powerful currents that are transforming consumer behavior and are required for business relevance. \u2047 And then we are increasingly delivering differentiated and higher-end solutions that help our clients win in a world of accelerated technological and societal change. \u2047 That takes creativity and precision, data and accountability, all of which we're able to bring together in customized teams that drive talent from across our portfolio. \u2047 Ultimately, our growth speaks to our ability to drive outstanding business results for our clients. \u2047 Our net organic revenue growth in the second quarter was 19.8%. \u2047 That's against the second quarter of 2020 when as you will recall our organic change was negative 9.9%, which while well ahead of our peer group did mark our steepest decrease of the recession. \u2047 It's also important to note that our 7.9% organic increase this quarter relative to the pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019. \u2047 Compared to last year, our organic growth was at double-digit rates around the world. \u2047 In the US, it was 17.4%, growth in our international markets ranged from 14% in the Asia-Pacific region to 49% in Latin America. \u2047 We also had a very broad contribution from our operating segments and disciplines. \u2047 Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically with increases led by media, data and technology and with solid contributions from our global integrated networks. \u2047 There was also strength across most of our disciplines led by healthcare. \u2047 At our DXTRA segment, organic growth was 15.1% with strong increases from last year's heavily impacted Q2 across Octagon's sports and entertainment and Jack Morton's experiential offerings. \u2047 Looking at client sectors, the picture is also one of comprehensive acceleration. \u2047 Each of our eight major sectors had double-digit increases from a year ago. \u2047 The auto, retail and other sectors were up more than 20%, consumer goods, tech and telecom and healthcare increased in the mid to high teens, food and beverage and financial services were up in the low double-digit range. \u2047 Turning to operating expense and profitability. \u2047 Our teams once again demonstrated outstanding discipline. \u2047 And while remaining focused on appropriate cost control, we're also continuing to invest to support accelerating growth. \u2047 We continue to see the benefits of cost improvements from strategic restructuring actions taken last year, notably in our payroll expense and our expense for occupancy. \u2047 We also continue to see the benefits of low variable expenses as a result of the highly restrictive global travel environment and from the cost efficiencies of a largely remote workforce. \u2047 As we look ahead to post-pandemic work life, it's worth noting that we can, of course, expect that expenses for travel, meetings, office utilities and alike will begin to return in the second half of this year, most notably in Q4 and of course into next year. \u2047 Our second quarter net income was $263.3 million as reported. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $405.8 million and adjusted EBITDA margin on net revenue was 17.9%. \u2047 Our results reflect significant operating leverage compared to both last year and the 2019 period on our expense for base payroll and our office and other expenses. \u2047 We delevered on our expense accrual for our performance based incentive compensation plans, but our operating performance is tracking well ahead of planned target. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share was $0.66 as reported and was $0.70 as adjusted for the after tax expense of the amortization of acquired intangibles. \u2047 As we look to the balance of the year, you'll recall that in April, we shared a full year 2021 performance outlook based on the assumption that there will continue to be a reasonably steady course of public health and global economic recovery. \u2047 At that time, we outlined our view toward full year organic growth of 5% to 6% and adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 15.5%. \u2047 In light of our very strong second quarter and also having recently refreshed our bottom-up outlook for the second half of the year based on conversations with our clients and operating teams, we believe it's appropriate at the mid-point of this quite unusual year, unprecedented, in fact, to upgrade those expectations. \u2047 Of course, we do sadly need to recognize that the COVID pandemic and the related risks to the macro environment are not yet behind us. \u2047 In particular, as we look ahead, we all understand that lagging vaccination rates in many parts of the world and the emergence of new variants may entail a higher COVID risk. \u2047 That's something we'll watch closely as we enter the second half of the year, especially our seasonally important fourth quarter. \u2047 With predicated on the continued progress and public health issues, we believe that we can deliver organic growth for the full year of 9% to 10%. \u2047 And with that level of growth, we would expect to achieve 2021 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 16%. \u2047 As such, we see this as another year of strong value creation for all of our stakeholders. \u2047 We'll of course keep you apprised of progress as the year develops and we look forward to those conversations. \u2047 On that note, I'd like to hand over the call to Ellen now for more in-depth view of our results. \u2047 I hope that everyone is safe and healthy. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA, before a small restructuring adjustment, was $405.8 million, and margin was 17.9%. \u2047 These are levels that compare very favorably against any previous second quarter. \u2047 With growth having accelerated, certain variable expenses continue to lag and we are additionally seeing the structural benefits of last year's restructuring program. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share were $0.66 as reported and $0.70 as adjusted before the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangibles. \u2047 Turning to slide three, you'll see our P&L for the quarter. \u2047 I'll cover revenue and operating expenses in detail in the slides that follow. \u2047 Turning to second quarter revenue on slide four. \u2047 Our net revenue in the quarter was $2.27 billion, an increase of $416.2 million from a year ago. \u2047 Compared to Q2 2020, the impact of the change in exchange rates was positive 3.1% with the US dollar weaker against currencies in most of our largest markets. \u2047 Net divestitures were negative 40 basis points. \u2047 Our organic net revenue increase was 19.8%, which brings us to 10.6% organic growth for the six months. \u2047 At the bottom of this slide, we breakup segment revenue in the quarter. \u2047 Our IAN segment grew 20.5% organically. \u2047 We had notably strong growth across our offerings in media, data and tech, McCann, FCBs with healthcare, a significant driver, MullenLowe, Huge and R/GA. \u2047 At IPG DXTRA, organic growth was 15.1%, which reflects some recovery of the events and sports marketing offerings within the segment, the disciplines that have been most significantly impacted by the pandemic. \u2047 Our public relations offerings also had solid growth in the quarter. \u2047 Moving on to slide five, which is a look at our organic revenue change by region. \u2047 In the US, which was 63% of net revenue in the quarter, organic growth was 17.4%. \u2047 Revenue decreased a year ago in the same period by 8%. \u2047 Year-on-year performance was very strong across media, data and tech, FCB driven by healthcare, IPG DXTRA, McCann, MullenLowe and Huge. \u2047 International markets were 37% of our net revenue in the quarter and increased 24.4% organically. \u2047 You'll recall that the same market decreased 13.1% a year ago in the second quarter which ranged by region between negative 10% and negative 15%. \u2047 Continental Europe grew 27.9% with notably strong growth in Germany, Spain and France. \u2047 There were a number of operating highlights in the region led by media, data and tech, McCann, R/GA and DXTRA. \u2047 The UK increased 18.7% organically, led by McCann, DXTRA, media, data and tech and R/GA. \u2047 Asia-Pac grew 14% organically. \u2047 Our organic growth was paced by Australia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and India, while China and Japan decreased. \u2047 Our organic growth in LatAm was 49% with exceptional results across the region, including Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. \u2047 Our other markets group grew 29.2% with notably strong performance in the Middle East and Canada. \u2047 Moving on to slide six, and operating expenses in the quarter. \u2047 Our operating expenses excluding billable expenses, the amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges increased only 11% from a year ago and to 22.5% growth of net revenue. \u2047 The result was second quarter margin expansion to 17.9% from 9.4% a year ago. \u2047 We continue to see efficiencies in a number of different expense categories as we had in this year's first quarter and these were both structural and variable. \u2047 In the structural category, we are seeing the benefit of the strategic restructuring actions, which we initiated in the second quarter of last year and continued to execute over the second half. \u2047 As a reminder, these actions involve the elimination of certain positions, and resulting headcount reduction that will not return with revenue growth. \u2047 We also reduced our real estate footprint by 15% last year. \u2047 We are currently seeing the benefit of most of these actions and at a full run rate they will generate $160 million in annual cost savings. \u2047 We've also had over the course of the pandemic a sharp decrease in certain variable operating expenses. \u2047 I would call out specifically lower travel and related expenses, which was the case in the second quarter of 2020 and that's continued through Q2 2021. \u2047 As you can see on this slide, a ratio of total salaries and related expense, as a percentage of net revenue was 65.4%, which has significantly improved from the second quarter of 2020 when revenue had decreased sharply. \u2047 Underneath that, we drove very strong leverage on our expense for base payroll, benefits and tax, which was 53% of net revenue in the quarter. \u2047 That reflects the benefit of last year's restructuring and the fact that the pace of new hiring lags our significant revenue growth, as was in the case in past business cycles. \u2047 Our severance expense ratio also decreased sharply to only 40 basis points of net revenue, compared to 3% in Q2 2020, which was at an elevated level due to the impact of the recession. \u2047 Going the other way, our expense for performance-based incentive compensation increased to 6.4%, consistent with our very strong operating results. \u2047 Expense for temporary labor also increased, as a percentage of net revenue to 4.5%, as a result of servicing the top line's quick acceleration. \u2047 At quarter-end, total worldwide headcount was approximately 53,000, a 1.4% increase from a year ago and up 5.2% from the beginning of this year, with hiring to support our growth. \u2047 Also on this slide, our office and other direct expense decreased as a percentage of net revenue by 380 basis points to 13.3%. \u2047 Our occupancy expense decreased to 5% of net revenue, mainly due to the restructuring of our real estate, as well as leverage on our revenue growth. \u2047 We leveraged all other office and other direct expense by 220 basis points, which reflects lower expense for bad debt and acquisition costs and leverage as a result of our revenue growth. \u2047 Our SG&A expense was 1.3% of net revenue, with the increase from a year ago due to the higher unallocated performance-based incentive expense and increased employee insurance expense, which was at a very low level a year ago. \u2047 On slide seven, we present detail on adjustments to our reported second quarter results, in order to provide greater clarity and a picture of comparable performance. \u2047 This begins on the left-hand side with the reported results and steps through to adjusted EBITDA and our adjusted diluted EPS. \u2047 Our expense for the amortization of acquired intangibles in the second column was $21.6 million. \u2047 The restructuring refinement in the quarter is a benefit of $200,000. \u2047 To be clear, this is a small adjustment to estimate of the 2020 restructuring program. \u2047 Below operating expenses in column four, we had a pre-tax loss in the quarter of $1.7 million in other expenses due to the disposition of small non-strategic businesses. \u2047 At the foot of the slide, you can see the after-tax impact per diluted share of these adjustments was $0.04 per share, which bridges our diluted earnings per share as reported at $0.66 to adjusted earnings of $0.70 per diluted share. \u2047 On slide eight, we turn to cash flow in the quarter. \u2047 Cash from operations was $468.2 million, compared with the use of $87.1 million a year ago. \u2047 We generated $101.6 million from working capital compared to a use of $264.9 million last year. \u2047 Investing activities was $43.3 million in the quarter, mainly for capex of $34 million. \u2047 Financing activities used $101.8 million, mainly for our dividend.
