{"article": ["References to margins and adjusted operating margins reflect the performance for the Americas and International segments. \u2047 We will refer to Net Service Revenue or NSR, which is defined as revenue excluding pass-through revenue. \u2047 Our discussion of year-over-year NSR growth for the fourth quarter and full year is adjusted to exclude the benefit of the extra week to the prior year fourth quarter. \u2047 As a reminder, we sold the Management Services business in January of 2020 and we closed on the sale of the Power and Civil construction businesses in October 2020 and January 2021 respectively. \u2047 The financial results of these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements. \u2047 Lara Poloni, our President will discuss key operational priorities and Gaurav Kapoor, our Chief Financial Officer will review our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. \u2047 We will conclude with a question-and-answer session. \u2047 I want to begin by acknowledging our teams across the globe whose contributions made fiscal 2021 a tremendous success. \u2047 Our people remain our greatest assets, and it's because of their commitment to our success that we are so well positioned for the future. \u2047 I'm proud of our team's accomplishments, and I'm energized by the opportunity we see in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Turning to our results. \u2047 We exceeded our expectations on every key metric, highlighted by accelerating organic NSR growth, record operating margins, double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow. \u2047 It really was a very successful year. \u2047 Our NSR for the fourth quarter increased by 6.5%, which marked a third consecutive quarter of accelerating organic growth and included the strong contributions from both the Americas and International businesses. \u2047 We delivered a 14.8% segment adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter and 13.8% for the full year. \u2047 Both results exceeded our expectations and extends our lead over the industry. \u2047 To put this performance in context, our margin in the fourth quarter is more than 600 basis points higher than in fiscal 2018. \u2047 This performance directly reflects the high value we provide to clients and the actions we have taken to create the best industry delivery platform. \u2047 Looking back to February, at our Investor Day, we set margin targets at the time that we were very ambitious. \u2047 Today, we are ahead of schedule on our plans, and we have even greater conviction in our 17% longer-term goal, which we now view as achievable rather than aspirational. \u2047 Importantly, our strong margins afford us the opportunity to accelerate investments in our teams to drive organic growth and into our Digital AECOM capabilities, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment. \u2047 Turning to earnings, we delivered at the high end of our guidance ranges for both adjusted EBITDA and EPS. \u2047 Full-year adjusted EBITDA was $830 million and adjusted earnings per share was $2.82, which marked an 11% and 31% increase respectively. \u2047 Free cash flow was $583 million and was driven by our strong earnings and continued high cash flow conversion. \u2047 Our cash flow result is a testament to the focus on efficiently converting our earnings to cash as well as the high quality lowest mix of our business. \u2047 We have repurchased more than $1 billion of stock since last September, or 13% of the Company. \u2047 And we have $940 million remaining under our current authorization. \u2047 We remain committed to repurchasing stock with available cash and cash flow, which we believe is the best and highest returning use of our capital after our investments in growth. \u2047 Turning to our wins and backlog. \u2047 Our win rate remains high, and we continue to gain market share. \u2047 We delivered $3.7 billion of wins in the fourth quarter, including a 1.2 book-to-burn ratio in the design business. \u2047 Our contracted backlog, which is a key indicator of revenue growth increased by 18% and included 4% growth in design business. \u2047 Our pipeline of opportunities is up to double-digits in the Americas design business. \u2047 And based on our clients' strengthening funding backdrop, including benefits from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in the US, we expect our backlog to continue to grow. \u2047 Overall, our performance demonstrates that we are outgrowing the industry organically and capturing market share. \u2047 There are two areas in particular that highlight our success and showcase the value we deliver to clients. \u2047 First, we set as a key objective to substantially grow our Program Management business and we are delivering. \u2047 This is especially apparent in the Middle East where we had several recent successes on high priority and larger programs where a combination of technical leadership, global thinking and program management expertise were instrumental in our success. \u2047 This includes winning significantly expanded program management and design roles in transformational projects in Saudi Arabia, such as for AlUla City and a large transportation project in Qatar, where more than 100 employees have joined AECOM from the incumbent to support this work. \u2047 Second, we are demonstrating our leadership on ESG. \u2047 Our investment at the Natural Capital Laboratory in UK is a great example. \u2047 We established this project in 2019 to study the environmental change and biodiversity impact with precision by leveraging drones, artificial intelligence, GIS Data and thermal imaging. \u2047 The ability to more exactly measure the impacts of decarbonization is a critical element of the global agenda to drive decarbonization and carbon sequestration. \u2047 Our investment in our work at the NCL underscores how AECOM and our professionals are leading in the development of standards and methods to measure decarbonization which will be especially important for creating reliable markets for sustainability investments. \u2047 Let's turn to the next slide. \u2047 I mentioned earlier that our strong performance in fiscal 2021 has created the opportunity to accelerate investments and expand our advantages. \u2047 We break these investments into three categories: People, Clients and Digital. \u2047 Beginning with our people. \u2047 We are a knowledge-based business and our diverse professionals serve as our greatest advantage. \u2047 Therefore, it is critical that we have the right culture and programs in place to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. \u2047 To do this, we've implemented a flexible work model designed to facilitate optimal work life balance. \u2047 In addition, we've enhanced the benefit programs and increased our investment in technical and professional development. \u2047 Most importantly, our people are winning and delivering the most challenging and iconic projects. \u2047 All of this culminates in a culture of high engagement, high satisfaction and low attrition. \u2047 Turning to how we deliver for clients. \u2047 We are leading with our higher margin program management and advisory capabilities and investing across our key account programs to ensure our clients are benefiting from our best expertise globally. \u2047 We're also developing technology to automate and pre-populate certain elements of our designs, which capitalizes on our vast expertise, accelerates the design process and extends the capacity of our workforce. \u2047 Finally, today we unveiled Digital AECOM which brings together all of our innovative digital capabilities. \u2047 After more than a year of focused investment and the launch of many digital solutions, we are now formally rolling out our digital products. \u2047 A great example of this is PlanEngage, a digital platform that reinvents the public engagement process for an infrastructure project by creating greater certainty on cost, time and stakeholder management. \u2047 Successful community engagement is a critical step in a project, but this process is really digitized. \u2047 PlanEngage simplifies this process by integrating all the key elements of a project into a digital tool, which allows our clients to capture information to make more informed decisions and advance projects more quickly. \u2047 This solution is years ahead of the competition by our estimation. \u2047 And we see PlanEngage becoming the industry standard. \u2047 With the passage of the Infrastructure Act in the US, this tool will be even more valuable. \u2047 Across these focus areas, one theme is constant. \u2047 Our investment will expand our advantage as demand grows and labor constraints challenges some in our industry. \u2047 Please turn to the next slide. \u2047 Looking to fiscal 2022 and beyond, the spotlight on infrastructure has never been brighter. \u2047 In the US, the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure and Jobs Act marks a generational investment in America's infrastructure. \u2047 This bill provides much needed long-term funding certainty across our strongest end markets such as transit modernization, electrification, environmental remediation and climate resilience. \u2047 Importantly, we are positioned to benefit from nearly every line item in this bill. \u2047 We anticipate this funding will increase our addressable market in our most profitable business by double-digits over the coming years. \u2047 And we expect the most meaningful benefits in fiscal 2023 and beyond. \u2047 In addition to the strengthened federal funding environment, all of our state and local clients are on an equally strong footing. \u2047 Today, state DOT[Phonetic] budgets are significantly above prior projections and the fiscal outlooks are stronger. \u2047 Our public sector pipeline in US is up double-digits and with the strong funding backdrop now in place, we anticipate the pace of decisions will accelerate as well. \u2047 Our international markets are equally strong. \u2047 Conditions in our largest markets have improved, and we're delivering strong growth across all major international markets in the fourth quarter. \u2047 In addition, we had strong backlog growth in each of our larger geographies. \u2047 I'm especially pleased to see that our strategy with a focus on Program Management contributing to the success in places like the Middle East and in key transportation wins in the UK, where regaining market share has been a key priority. \u2047 As the number one ranked transportation facilities and environmental engineering firm as well as the number two ranked water design firm, we are uniquely positioned to benefit. \u2047 Turning to our financial guidance. \u2047 We've initiated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share guidance of between $880 million and $920 million and between $3.20 and $3.40. \u2047 This reflects 8% and 17% growth at the respective midpoints. \u2047 Underpinning this growth is an expectation for another year of accelerating organic NSR growth and at least 30 basis point increase in our margins to another record high of 14.1%. \u2047 Our guidance incorporates all the planned growth investments we are making in our people, business development, client delivery and digital capabilities. \u2047 I also want to comment on the 2024 financial projections we shared at our Investor Day in February. \u2047 Based on our strong performance to date and the returns we expect on our investments, we are raising our long-term adjusted earnings per share guidance to at least $4.75 in fiscal 2024. \u2047 This represents a more than doubling of our fiscal 2020 earnings and a nearly 20% CAGR from 2021 to 2024. \u2047 I am pleased with how well our teams have responded to our new strategy and their many accomplishments in fiscal 2021. \u2047 In particular, I'd like to highlight our success on some of our larger key pursuits, our global approach, technical leadership, program management capabilities, advisory expertise and multiyear investments are bearing fruit. \u2047 A great example of this is in the Middle East where we prioritize as a long-term growth opportunity. \u2047 We have gained market share with wins from megacities, including NEOM and AlUla in Saudi Arabia. \u2047 Key to these successes was the integration of global capabilities, including expertise from every region and market sector. \u2047 Our culture of collaboration has truly distinguished us from competitors, particularly as our clients work to address multi-decade investment programs that require more holistic thinking. \u2047 Another great example is in the US where we were recently selected for a large program for a client who selected us based on our leadership capabilities in many verticals including in PFAS, even as PFAS expertise wasn't the main criteria in the pursuit. \u2047 We are continuing to prioritize our time and capital on the best opportunities, which has been instrumental in our high win rate over the past year and in our confidence in continued market share gains. \u2047 Looking ahead, our clients continue to prioritize investments in ESG, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. \u2047 At the COP26 Summit earlier this month, this commitment was front and center as the most prominent public and private sector voices spoke with unity on the challenge and the opportunity. \u2047 In demonstrating how we are leading in ESG alongside our clients, we published our Global ESG Report last week, which includes disclosures aligned with the SASB and TCFD frameworks. \u2047 This report is an important step in our ESG journey and underscores our commitment to regularly communicating our progress on our sustainable legacy strategies. \u2047 Finally, Troy spoke about our focus on ensuring we attract and retain the industry's best and brightest. \u2047 And I'm pleased to report we are operating from a strong position. \u2047 To that point, we conducted a global employee survey in September that revealed very strong levels of engagement, including the vast majority recommending AECOM as a great place to work. \u2047 High employee engagement is also leading to the highest client satisfaction scores in our Company's history in fiscal 2021. \u2047 With our momentum, we are in an enviable position from which to deliver another strong year in fiscal 2022. \u2047 Please turn to the next slide. \u2047 Our fourth quarter and full year results serve as clear evidence of the strength of our business and the benefit of our focused strategy. \u2047 We delivered: Accelerating NSR growth; the highest margins in our Company's history; another year of double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth; more than 30% adjusted earnings per share growth and; a seventh consecutive year of free cash flow at or above our guidance range. \u2047 Our strong financial performance is creating increased opportunities to invest in organic growth while also bolstering our confidence in delivering on our long-term organic growth and financial goals. \u2047 Importantly, all of this was achieved while making critical investments in people, teams and digital capabilities that will sustain our advantages in fiscal 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Please turn to the next slide. \u2047 In the Americas, NSR increased by 7% in the fourth quarter, including growth in both design and construction management businesses. \u2047 Contracted backlog increased by 21% to set a new record. \u2047 This included growth in the design business and a large construction management project that moved into contracted backlog and firmed up our outlook for the year. \u2047 I should note that our awarded backlog was reduced by $1.3 billion as a result of this client only advancing the first phase of this project at this time. \u2047 However, the economic impact of the shift is not material to our earnings outlook. \u2047 And, our confidence in the growth outlook for the construction management business is higher than it ever has been in many years. \u2047 The fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, a 290 basis point increase from the prior year to a new all-time high and reflects strong execution. \u2047 Please turn to the next slide. \u2047 Turning to the International segment. \u2047 NSR increased by 6% in the fourth quarter, including growth across all of our largest regions, and backlog increased by 10%. \u2047 This is a result of our organic growth investments, market share gains, steadily improving market conditions. \u2047 Our adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 7"], "gold_summary": ["q4
