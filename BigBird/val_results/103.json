{"article": ["Both of these documents are available in the Investor Relations section of applied.com. \u2047 In addition, the conference call will use non-GAAP financial measures, which are subject to the qualifications referenced in those documents. \u2047 On behalf of our entire team at Applied, we hope you and your families are healthy, safe and managing well. \u2047 I'll start today with a business update, including how we continue to respond to the pandemic as well as progress with various internal initiatives and color on the external environment. \u2047 Dave will follow with a summary of our financials and some specifics on our first quarter and outlook, and then I'll close with some final thoughts. \u2047 Into early fiscal 2021, we're seeing a modest recovery gain momentum and are executing well. \u2047 I'm encouraged by the start to the year and believe we are in a solid position to build off this positive momentum as we move forward. \u2047 Our operations are functioning productively. \u2047 Our supply chain and inventory levels are in a good position and we are responding effectively to customers' increasing requirements as an initial demand recovery appears to be under way. \u2047 Throughout the past several quarters, we have quickly adapted to the evolving environment, including implementing new processes and ways to support our customer needs. \u2047 A key part of our message to all our stakeholders during these evolving times is how Applied is stronger today than in prior cycles. \u2047 This includes benefits from our expanded offerings, greater technical focus and a more diversified end market mix. \u2047 We've also strengthened our marketing and sales efforts to showcase our comprehensive and leading technical offering and to further develop our cross-selling opportunity. \u2047 We are increasingly critical to our customers as maintenance, production and efficiency requirements begin to ramp across their core operational infrastructure. \u2047 These elements are providing near-term sales support and leave us increasingly constructive on our growth potential going forward. \u2047 In addition, investments in systems, talent, analytics and operational processes in recent years are yielding additional benefits in the current environment. \u2047 We quickly aligned our cost structure and once again are demonstrating our operational discipline and the resilience of our operating model. \u2047 This is highlighted by better-than-expected decremental margins in the quarter as well as ongoing strengthening of our balance sheet following strong cash generation performance and a nearly 30% reduction in net debt levels over the prior year. \u2047 Our capabilities and company-specific opportunities, combined with the improving outlook, positions us to be a growth leader with increasing earnings power entering the next phase of recovery in the industrial economy. \u2047 This is demonstrated by our recent tuck-in acquisition of Advanced Control Solutions earlier this month. \u2047 ACS represents the next step in expanding our automation offering, which is further differentiating our value proposition, diversifying our end market mix and enhancing our growth profile to include next-generation industrial solutions. \u2047 As it relates to the broader demand environment, underlying trends remain below prior year levels during our first quarter as business activity continued to adjust to the ongoing pandemic. \u2047 That said, customer order activity improved sequentially through the quarter, and we continue to gain traction with our internal growth initiatives. \u2047 As a result, the year-over-year organic sales decline of 13.4% in the quarter improved notably from the 18.4% decline last quarter. \u2047 Year-over-year organic sales declines improved each month and sequential trends in daily sales rates seasonally strong. \u2047 We're starting to see greater maintenance activity and break/fix requirements with customers increasing access to their facilities and expanding equipment utilization as production gradually ramps back up, including at smaller local accounts. \u2047 Feedback from our sales leaders suggest order sizes are increasing, customer inventory levels are being replenished and maintenance projects are getting authorized as businesses increase activity and new safety protocols support a productive path forward. \u2047 In addition, we saw several industry verticals return back to growth during the quarter with 10 of our top 30 verticals up year-over-year versus only two last quarter. \u2047 Areas such as Food & Beverage, Aggregates, Technology, Chemicals and Transportation were all showing positive momentum. \u2047 And while weakness remains greatest across heavy industries, such as Machinery, Metals and Oil & Gas. \u2047 Demand within these verticals appears to be stabilizing and improving slightly. \u2047 We view these dynamics as a positive sign for the industrial economy and demand for our critical products and solutions. \u2047 That said, the pace of end market improvement remains gradual and at times inconsistent. \u2047 Organic sales through our first 18 business days of October are down by mid-teens percent over the prior year. \u2047 We saw some easing in sales early in the month following a strong end to our fiscal first quarter. \u2047 Sales trends have improved each week in October, with order momentum increasing sequentially across both our segments month-to-date. \u2047 However, it's important to note that visibility remains limited ahead of the seasonally slower winter months as customers continue to manage through an uncertain macro and pandemic outlook near term. \u2047 Additionally, customer purchasing discipline can be more restrained around any given election cycle. \u2047 As we've shown in recent quarters, we know how to manage and execute in this still uncertain business environment and will remain prudent in our cost focus and capital deployment near-term while focusing on our self-help growth opportunities. \u2047 Overall, we're seeing signs that reinforce our view that the worst is behind us, and a recovery is starting to gain traction. \u2047 This bodes well for when we enter the seasonally stronger second half of our fiscal year as comparisons become easier and we continue to execute on our internal growth initiatives. \u2047 Before I begin, I will remind everyone that a supplemental investor deck recapping key financial performance and discussion points is available on our investor site for your additional reference. \u2047 To provide more detail on our first quarter, consolidated sales decreased 12.7% over the prior year quarter. \u2047 Acquisitions contributed 1.1% growth, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 0.4%. \u2047 Netting these factors, sales decreased 13.4% on an organic basis with a like number of selling days year-over-year. \u2047 Turning to sales performance by segment, as highlighted on slides six and seven. \u2047 Sales in our Service Center segment declined 14.9% year-over-year or 14.4% on organic basis. \u2047 The decline reflects the ongoing impact from COVID-19, including reduced industrial production activity and customer facility restrictions which continues to impact MRO demand across our service center network. \u2047 However, the 14% organic decline year-over-year represents an improvement from the 21% decline during last quarter. \u2047 In addition, average daily sales rates were up more than 4% sequentially and above the normal seasonal progression. \u2047 As Neil highlighted, we saw greater maintenance activity in break/fix demand. \u2047 More customers are providing access into their facilities and releasing working capital spending following a slow pace during the summer months. \u2047 Year-over-year declines remain greatest within Metals, Oil & Gas and Machinery end markets but were balanced by underlying improvement within Food & Beverage, Pulp & Paper, Aggregates, Forestry and Chemical Industries as well as ongoing growth in our Australian operations. \u2047 Within our Fluid Power & Flow Control segment, sales decreased 7.4% over the prior year quarter with our August 2019 acquisition of Olympus Controls, contributing 3.8 points of growth on roughly half a quarter of remaining inorganic contribution. \u2047 On an organic basis, segment sales declined 11.2%, reflecting lower demand across Industrial, Off-Highway Mobile and process-related end markets. \u2047 This was partially offset by sales growth within Technology, Life Sciences, Food & Beverage and Chemical end markets during the quarter as well as ongoing traction with our cross-selling initiatives and firm sales activity across our emerging automation platform. \u2047 Moving to margin performance. \u2047 As highlighted on Page eight of the deck, gross margin of 28.9% declined approximately 50 basis points year-over-year or 40 basis points when excluding noncash LIFO expense of $1.1 million in the quarter and $0.4 million in the prior year quarter. \u2047 Year-over-year declines primarily reflect unfavorable mix tied to sales declines across our local service center accounts, albeit more modest relative to last quarter as well as more subdued pricing opportunities given the softer demand environment. \u2047 That said, on a sequential basis, gross margins improved 13 basis points or 17 basis points when excluding LIFO expense, and we're slightly ahead of our expectations. \u2047 While we expect some of the volume-driven year-over-year headwinds to persist near term, we remain focused on driving annual gross margin expansion as demand levels normalize, reflecting benefits from our systems investments, the positive contribution of expansionary products, strategic growth driven by our technical service-oriented solutions and initiatives to expand business across our local customer base. \u2047 In addition, we are starting to see a slightly greater level of supplier price increase announcements, which, combined with firming demand, could provide some positive momentum for pricing contribution and margin expansion into the second half of our fiscal year. \u2047 Turning to our operating cost. \u2047 Selling, distribution and administrative expenses declined 13.4% year-over-year or approximately 15% when excluding incremental operating costs associated with our Olympus Controls acquisition. \u2047 Both of these figures exclude $1.5 million of nonroutine cost in the prior year quarter. \u2047 The year-over-year decline reflects the ongoing benefit from various actions we've taken in recent quarters to align expenses with lower demand. \u2047 This includes a mix of both structural and temporary cost actions as we continue to assess the environment. \u2047 And while we have begun to roll back some of the temporary actions, our team continues to demonstrate great discipline in controlling costs and identifying internal opportunities. \u2047 Combined with improving sales trends during the quarter, we reported a 9.5% decremental margin on operating income during our recent fiscal first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and highlights the adaptability and durability of our operating model. \u2047 Going forward, we will remain prudent and disciplined in maintaining our cost structure as we continue to gradually roll off temporary cost actions to align with our recent performance, a more constructive outlook and our growth initiatives. \u2047 EBITDA in the quarter was $67.6 million, down 13.6% compared to adjusted EBITDA of $78.2 million in the prior year quarter while EBITDA margin was 9%, down a modest 10 basis points over the prior year despite the double-digit sales decline. \u2047 We reported net income of $34.8 million or $0.89 per share, down from adjusted net income of $39.9 million or $1.02 per share in the prior year quarter. \u2047 Moving to our cash flow performance and liquidity. \u2047 During the first quarter, cash generated from operating activities was $81.8 million while free cash flow was $78.2 million or approximately 225% of net income. \u2047 This was up from $50 million and $45 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year quarter, and represents record first quarter cash generation. \u2047 The strong cash performance during the quarter reflects ongoing contribution from our working capital initiatives as well as the countercyclical cash profile of our business model. \u2047 Given the strong cash flow performance in the quarter, we ended September with over $271 million of cash on hand with approximately 75% of that unrestricted U.S. held cash. \u2047 Of note, this is after utilizing $62 million of cash during the quarter to pay down debt. \u2047 We have now paid down over $200 million of debt since early 2018, including over $80 million the past year. \u2047 Our net debt is down nearly 30% over the prior year, and net leverage stood at 2.1 times adjusted EBITDA at quarter end, below the prior year quarter level of 2.3 times and the prior year level of 2.6 times. \u2047 Additionally, our revolver remained undrawn with approximately $250 million of capacity and an additional $250 million Accordion option. \u2047 Combined with incremental capacity on our uncommitted private shelf facility, our liquidity is ample and our balance sheet is strong entering what appears to be an emerging recovery. \u2047 This provides flexibility to fund incremental working capital requirements in coming quarters as customer demand continues to improve as well as opportunistically pursue strategic M&A aligned with our growth initiatives. \u2047 Our M&A focus near-term remains on smaller bolt-on targets that align with our growth priorities, including additional automation and fluid power opportunities. \u2047 Transitioning now to our outlook. \u2047 Visibility remains limited on how customers will proceed with operations into the seasonally slower winter months. \u2047 That said, to provide some directional views near term based on month-to-day trends in October and assuming normal sequential patterns in daily sales rates for the balance of the quarter, we would expect fiscal second quarter 2021 sales to decline 13% to 14% organically on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 This includes an assumption of low-teen organic declines in both our Service Center segment and Fluid Power & Flow Control segment. \u2047 Again, this direction is meant to provide a starting framework on how second quarter sales could shape up if trends follow normal seasonality over the next two months. \u2047 If customers reduce underlying production activity, or extend these plant shutdowns, this could drive organic declines that are greater than the 13% to 14% assumption. \u2047 On the other hand, if we see ongoing improvement in underlying industrial activity and further traction with our internal growth initiatives, organic declines could be better than the 13% to 14% assumption. \u2047 In addition, we expect our recent acquisition of ACS to contribute approximately $6 million in sales during our fiscal second quarter. \u2047 Based on the 13% to 14% organic sales decline, we believe a low double-digit to low-teen decremental margin is an appropriate benchmark to use for our second quarter. \u2047 This assumes gross margin to be relatively stable sequentially to first quarter levels as well as the ongoing gradual rollback of temporary cost actions. \u2047 As indicated, we will continue to take a mindful and balanced approach to our operating costs going forward, including ongoing focus on internal opportunities and margin initiatives, which we expect to provide balance into our cost trajectory moving forward. \u2047 We are encouraged by our cost and margin execution year-to-date which are providing the flexibility to further roll back temporary cost actions as we take an offensive approach to an emerging recovery and our strategic growth targets. \u2047 We also note an effective tax rate of 23% to 25% is still an appropriate assumption near term. \u2047 Lastly, from a cash flow perspective, we would expect moderation from first quarter levels sequentially for the balance of the year, given potential greater working capital requirements as we look to support growth and the recovery as the year plays out. \u2047 We remain confident in our cash generation potential over the cycle and reiterate our normalized annual free cash target of at least 100% of net income. \u2047 Overall, I'm encouraged by how we started the year. \u2047 Our entire team has shown tremendous resiliency over the past several quarters which"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $0.89.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $0.89.  \u2047  applied industrial
