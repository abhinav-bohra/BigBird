{"article": ["I'm joined on the call today by Michael Happe, president and chief executive officer; and Bryan Hughes, senior vice president and chief financial officer. \u2047 These factors are identified in our SEC filings, which I encourage you to read. \u2047 As always, we appreciate your interest in Winnebago Industries and taking the time to discuss our fiscal '22 second-quarter results. \u2047 I'll start the call with an overview of our performance during the second quarter and what factors are driving those results. \u2047 Winnebago Industries is built on our strong momentum and delivered robust results in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, capitalizing on sustained and elevated demand for our portfolio of premium products. \u2047 We grew revenues by 39% year over year to $1.2 billion, matching the previous sales record set last quarter. \u2047 Overall, our results were shaped by two key dynamics: first, sustained and powerful consumer demand drove higher unit sales compared to the prior year; and second, Winnebago Industries' successful execution of pricing actions to offset higher material and component costs. \u2047 Also, the Barletta pontoon boat business recently acquired this past August, contributed nine percentage points of growth, and continues to exceed our expectations and gain market share in the pontoon boat market. \u2047 I want to spend a minute talking about these drivers in more detail. \u2047 It all begins with the consumers' continued strong affinity for the outdoor lifestyle and in particular, Winnebago Industries premium brands. \u2047 Through our interactions with our consumers and feedback we receive from our dealers, consumers clearly recognize our products as being differentiated. \u2047 This differentiation is a result of our relentless focus on our golden threads of quality, service, and innovation. \u2047 Robust consumer demand is a powerful undercurrent that we believe will continue to propel our company's growth through the current fiscal year and beyond. \u2047 A recent RV industry association study confirmed that 51% of new RVers in the 2020 and 2021 time periods suggested that that reasons surrounding COVID were certainly the impetus for purchasing in RV. \u2047 We are confident though that many of these interest trends have become ingrained and that consumers will continue to invest in products that enable them to pursue their love for the outdoors. \u2047 Compelling data supports our thesis. \u2047 Our friends at the campgrounds of America cited a 16% projected increase in households camping through November of 2021 versus the same period in 2020. \u2047 Here are some other nuggets from the previously noted and recently released new RV owners survey conducted by the RVIA. \u2047 Contrary to some theory speculating on possibly low retention of 2020 and 2021 first-time RV buyers. \u2047 New purchasers are most likely to keep and use their current RV into 2022 and beyond. \u2047 With 50% already seeking an upgrade via new parts or a different RV altogether. \u2047 Six in 10 new millennial RVs, those who bought an RV for the first time in 2020 and 2021, already say they are likely to purchase another RV in the future. \u2047 As it relates to the growing popularity of flexible work, among new RVers 25% of millennials and 27% of Gen Xers stated that they used an RV for a place to stay while working as a reason for purchasing the RV. \u2047 Importantly, Winnebago Industries is already capitalizing on the sustained demand drivers. \u2047 Our second-quarter total unit sales grew year over year despite a tough comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which was nearing the height of the COVID-19-driven demand spike. \u2047 Strong attendance at the recent Tampa RV show and the Miami Boat Show resulted in retail sales that exceeded our expectations. \u2047 In fact, most of our retail shows this spring are seeing record sales for our brands. \u2047 This foreshadows a solid spring selling season that is historically reflected in our second-half results. \u2047 The combined tailwinds of societal trends, Winnebago Industries proven portfolio brand strength, and sharp execution spells great opportunity in the future for our business. \u2047 We remain confident that there remains strong engagement in the outdoors by consumers and Winnebago Industries is positioned to continue growing market share in both the RV and marine industries. \u2047 On a trailing three-month basis through January, our RV market share was 14.3%, up a full 100 basis points from 13.3% for the same period in 2021. \u2047 And in our marine segment, Barletta has now grown to be the fifth-largest pontoon boat company by market share at 4.6% on a trailing three-month basis through December, and recent retail results show them approaching and breaking the 5% barrier. \u2047 This is a meaningful improvement from just seven months ago when we completed the Barletta acquisition. \u2047 Speaking of Barletta, I am pleased to report that its differentiated pontoon portfolio has continued to perform above our expectations and exceeded the calendar 2021 performance targets we set when we announced the acquisition. \u2047 The second major driver of our revenue results was pricing actions. \u2047 The positive demand environment and the unique strength of our brands positioned Winnebago Industries well to take continued pricing actions to offset component and material cost inflation and preserve margin performance across our segments. \u2047 We began taking pricing actions ahead of inflation in the second quarter of last year. \u2047 As the spring selling season gets underway, we will continue to evaluate our pricing power as needed as a lever to offset higher materials and component costs while still balancing and driving market share gains. \u2047 This is a testament to the resiliency of the demand environment and the clear quality of our expanded product portfolio. \u2047 Our strong top-line performance was coupled with excellent operational efficiencies internally. \u2047 I tip my cap to the entire Winnebago Industries team for another quarter of net strong execution, which is especially appreciated these days as the supply chain remains volatile. \u2047 We continue to work collaboratively with our suppliers to get materials on time so we can get products out the door as efficiently as possible for our customers and dealer partners while not sacrificing quality and service. \u2047 Our motorhome business this past quarter probably faced the most significant supply chain constraints, holding that segment back from optimal performance in this period. \u2047 Our teammates efforts, though, enabled us at a consolidated level to power through the supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures that we continue to experience at levels comparable to the first quarter. \u2047 With our strong execution and pricing actions, Winnebago Industries delivered gross margin of 18.6% during the second quarter, equal to the great results last year. \u2047 A focus on operational excellence will continue to be a critical component of our strategy going forward, creating organic and flexible capacity, driving productivity and margin improvement opportunities, and ensuring industry-leading product quality. \u2047 Winnebago Industries robust backlogs have increased versus last year and are significantly higher than the second quarter 2020 period due to continued strong in consumer demand. \u2047 Keeping dealer inventories in all of our segments at acceptable levels throughout the fiscal 2022 year for our dealer partners is a key focus area for all of our teams. \u2047 And I am fully confident they will continue to rise to the challenge to meet the high retail and wholesale demand levels in a disciplined manner. \u2047 We are fortunate to have a world-class team of Winnebago Industries employees and strategic partners. \u2047 Working together, we remain uniquely well-positioned to continue capturing outsized growth and delivering value to all our stakeholders as more families take to the great outdoors. \u2047 As Mike mentioned, second-quarter revenues, including results for Barletta were $1.2 billion, reflecting an increase of 39%, compared to $839.9 million for the fiscal 2021 period. \u2047 Excluding Barletta, our organic growth for second quarter was 29%. \u2047 We were pleased to see that revenue growth was achieved in all three segments against a very robust 2021 comparison period. \u2047 Growth in total was driven by a combination of pricing actions and unit shipments. \u2047 We delivered another period of very strong profitability in the quarter, evidenced by meaningful growth despite a steep year-over-year comparison. \u2047 Gross profit was $216.6 million, representing an increase of 38%, compared to $156.6 million for the fiscal 2021 period. \u2047 Gross profit margin of 18.6% was equal to last year, driven by operating leverage and pricing offset by higher material and component costs as well as some operating inefficiencies caused by supply chain constraints and the associated inconsistencies in the deliveries of parts and subcomponents. \u2047 Operating income was $136.8 million for the quarter, an increase of 37% compared to $100 million for the second quarter of last year. \u2047 Our second-quarter operating income includes $0.5 million in acquisition-related costs and $4.6 million of incremental amortization of intangible assets related to the Barletta acquisition. \u2047 Fiscal 2022 second-quarter net income was $91.2 million, an increase of 32%, compared to $69.1 million in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 Note that fiscal 2022 net income includes $6.5 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustment, which is included in non-operating income related to the earn-out included in the deal structure associated with the Barletta acquisition. \u2047 You will note that we are removing this deal consideration in the calculation of adjusted EPS. \u2047 We are pleased to note that Barletta performance through the end of calendar 2021 as specified by the July 2021 purchase agreement will result in the full dispensation of $15 million which is the maximum payout for the first earn-out period tied to calendar year 2021 performance. \u2047 As stated previously, recall that we structured the earnout in such a manner that the multiple on this deal is further reduced as the earn-out that is paid increases. \u2047 Reported earnings per diluted share was $2.69, compared to reported earnings per diluted share of $2.04 in the same period last year. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $3.14, which represents an increase of 42%, compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.21 in the same period last year. \u2047 Now I'll turn to our segment performance, starting with our towable segment. \u2047 towable segment revenues were $646.6 million for the second quarter, up 47% over the prior year, primarily driven by pricing increases across the segment and unit growth of 13%. \u2047 Unit growth of 13% is especially strong given last year's 55% growth versus fiscal year 2020 for the same time period. \u2047 Segment adjusted EBITDA was $100.6 million, up 61% over the prior-year period. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6% increased 140 basis points over the prior year, driven by operating leverage and pricing, partially offset by cost input inflation. \u2047 Next, let's turn to our motorhome segment. \u2047 In the second quarter, revenues for the motorhome segment were $417.6 million, up 9% from the prior year driven by pricing increases across the segment. \u2047 Segment adjusted EBITDA was $46.1 million, representing a decrease of 10% from the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin was a strong 11%, while a decrease of 230 basis points from the prior year. \u2047 In the current quarter, we experienced ongoing supply chain inconsistencies in the delivery of chassis and other key components that were disruptive to our operational flow and introduce inefficiencies into the environment as compared to very high productivity across our operations in the prior year. \u2047 While we expect such inefficiencies to be remedied in the longer term, they did impact the current quarter. \u2047 It should be noted that the pricing actions taken to date in the motorhome segment continued to outpace the inflationary impacts on our products. \u2047 And the pricing versus inflation equation is not a driver of the margin reduction versus last year. \u2047 Finally, let's turn to our marine segment. \u2047 In the second quarter, revenues for the marine segment were $97.3 million. \u2047 The retail trends for the Barletta and Chris-Craft businesses remain strong and dealer inventories remain low. \u2047 marine segment adjusted EBITDA of $13.0 million was $11.9 million higher than the same period last year, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.3%, 620 basis points higher than last year, reflecting the addition of the Barletta business. \u2047 Turning now to the balance sheet. \u2047 We continue to maintain a healthy liquidity position with approximately $327 million available, including an untapped ABL of $192.5 million. \u2047 Our leverage ratio is currently at 0.8 times. \u2047 From a capital allocation perspective, we continue to prioritize investment in our businesses to fuel organic growth. \u2047 On a fiscal year-to-date basis, capex spending is $43.4 million, which is three times higher than last year's year-to-date capex. \u2047 We continue to carry elevated inventory as a means of mitigating some of the supply inconsistencies that we encounter on a daily basis. \u2047 While this is a detraction from generating high cash flow in the near term, we continue to view this as a prudent action to support our operations and believe that this cash investment will liquidate in the longer term and be available for other capital allocation priorities as the eventual drawdown in working capital occurs. \u2047 During the quarter, share buybacks totaled $40 million, and on a year-to-date basis, we have bought back $59.6 million worth of shares. \u2047 As discussed previously, our dividend this year is running at a 50% higher than it was last year. \u2047 Combining share buybacks with dividends, we have returned a robust $115 million to shareholders on a trailing 12-month basis through the second quarter of fiscal 2022. \u2047 This is approximately four times the prior year's trailing 12-month period. \u2047 That concludes my review of our quarterly financials. \u2047 Mike, back to you. \u2047 In addition to delivering strong financial results and market share growth, Winnebago Industries continued our deep commitment to our corporate responsibility in our communities and for our shareholders. \u2047 At the January RV consumer show in Tampa, we revealed the e-RV, the first all-electric zero-emission motor home concept from a major RV manufacturing. \u2047 The e-RV concept vehicle is an entirely new all-electric zero-emission RV that incorporates an advanced drivetrain and battery package that also powers all the living area systems of the coach. \u2047 Designed by our advanced technology group for a new generation of RVers who want to preserve the natural world as much as they want to enjoy it, the e-RV combines all-electric operation with sustainable and innovative materials. \u2047 We look forward to talking more about the e-RV as we move closer to commercialization. \u2047 Our go-to-market version is sure to bring significantly enhanced features and capabilities than the concept model shown. \u2047 In addition to the exciting e-RV, our Advanced Technology Group is also actively engaged on electrification relevant to marine and RV towable products as we continue our legacy of innovation and explore new front"], "gold_summary": ["winnebago industries delivers strong second quarter fiscal 2022 results.  \u2047  q2 adjusted earnings per share
