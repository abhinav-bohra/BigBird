{"article": ["Our discussion today includes certain non-GAAP financial measures, which provide additional information we believe is helpful to our investors. \u2047 These measures have been reconciled to the related GAAP measures in accordance with SEC regulations. \u2047 Please consider the risks and uncertainties that are mentioned in today's call and are described in our periodic filings with the SEC. \u2047 Barnes Group delivered a very good quarter to begin 2021, with the recovery we had anticipated to occur later in the year starting a little earlier than expected. \u2047 Strong order intake continuing sequential revenue growth now for the third consecutive quarter and better than expected earnings performance add confidence to our view that the second half of the year will show meaningful recovery progress. \u2047 For the first quarter, organic sales were down 10% compared to a year ago as a result of lower volumes at Aerospace. \u2047 However, our Industrial segment generated high single-digit organic growth, which was better than our February expectation given solid orders and sales in March. \u2047 While we previously envision business improving as the year progressed, now with the stronger momentum exiting the first quarter, we have increased our outlook for the year. \u2047 Earnings per share were $0.38, down 46% from last year's adjusted $0.71, so firmly exceeding the high end of our February expectation. \u2047 Moving now to a discussion of end market dynamics, beginning with Industrial. \u2047 Our Industrial segment had a strong first quarter, with each of our SBUs generating year-over-year organic sales and revenue growth. \u2047 For the segment, orders were up 25% organically, with a book to bill of approximately 1.1 times. \u2047 Sequential orders were up 7% further exemplifying the momentum we're seeing. \u2047 On a macro level, manufacturing PMIs in the US and eurozone remain particularly robust. \u2047 China, while a bit softer, remains an expansion territory. \u2047 And despite the semiconductor issue that's impacting automotive bills, IHS still predicts 2021 global production to be up 12% over last year. \u2047 Within the segment, our Molding Solutions business had strong orders across all brands, up 35% organically. \u2047 Our larger end markets, automotive, medical, packaging and personal care, each saw in excess of 25% orders growth, some well above that. \u2047 Sequentially, orders improved high single digits, marking the fourth quarter in a row of sequential growth. \u2047 Organic sales were up mid-single digits, while sequential sales were up low single digits. \u2047 Book-to-bill was approximately 1.1 times. \u2047 Backlog, which is predominantly our longer cycle mold systems, grew by approximately 25% year-over-year and low double digits from the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 There is definitely a lot to like about the activity of Molding Solutions and the business has been recently adding more talent to the sales and marketing team with a clear focus on driving long-term growth and margin expansion. \u2047 While near-term investments in such talent coupled with our innovation and digital initiatives, that I discussed last quarter, will hinder short-term margins. \u2047 We expect long-term performance to benefit[Phonetic]. \u2047 Our 2021 expectation for Molding Solutions has improved, as we now forecast organic sales growth to be in the low teens. \u2047 Moving to Force & Motion Control. \u2047 Organic orders were up low double digits with organic sales up high single digits. \u2047 FMC via sheet metal forming end market is seeing the benefit of its automotive customers push to electric and hybrid vehicles. \u2047 Year-over-year orders are up across each of our primary geographic markets, North America, Europe and China. \u2047 Likewise, we're seeing good demand in our general industrial end markets, particularly heavy-duty truck and industrial equipment. \u2047 Our FMC sales growth expectation has likewise increased, as we now anticipate organic sales to be up in the mid-teens for 2021. \u2047 Engineered Components generated organic orders growth in excess of 25% and organic revenue growth in the low double digits. \u2047 Sequentially, we saw a modest growth in orders and sales, constrained somewhat by the automotive semiconductor concern. \u2047 As a result of this issue, we estimate a first quarter impact of approximately $1 million, with the second quarter impact likely to be in the range of $4 million to $5 million before recovering in the second half. \u2047 General industrial markets remain very healthy. \u2047 Our 2021 outlook has increased for this business as well with organic sales now forecast to be up mid-teens. \u2047 Moving to Automation, we continue to see sequential performance in both orders and sales, up low teens and high-single digits, respectively. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, organic sales were up high single digits and organic revenues up mid-teens. \u2047 A very good quarter of growth and execution from the Automation team. \u2047 Demand for our end-of-arm tooling solutions in automotive, medical and pharma and industrial automation applications remain good, as has been the trend now for a few quarters. \u2047 We now expect 2021 to deliver total growth of 20%, with organic growth in the mid-teens, again, better than our February expectation. \u2047 Overall, for the Industrial segment, we see 2021 organic growth in the mid-teens, with operating margins of approximately 13%. \u2047 Moving now to Aerospace. \u2047 Our Aerospace business experienced continuing impact from the pandemic as OEM sales were down 32% from the prior year and aftermarket sales were down 48%, not surprising as commercial aviation remain significantly disrupted. \u2047 However, we still believe that the bottom is behind us and that we're slowly recovering. \u2047 Case in point for the third quarter in a row, we have seen total Aerospace sequential sales improve. \u2047 In the first quarter, the sequential improvement was driven by our MRO business. \u2047 Our expectations for the Aerospace industry overall has not changed. \u2047 We continue to believe that OEM production levels for narrow bodies will show modest improvement, while wide bodies will remain pressured. \u2047 We did see a second consecutive quarter of good orders and OEM book-to-bill was approximately 1.5 times. \u2047 In the aftermarket, industry challenges of lower aircraft utilization, weakened airline profitability and government imposed travel restrictions all remain. \u2047 Recovery will depend on the pace and effectiveness of vaccinations. \u2047 Domestic travel activity will proceed any improvement in international travel. \u2047 We continue to expect aftermarket activity to gradually improve beginning in the second half of 2021. \u2047 In the meantime, the Aerospace team continues to execute on several items to best position our business for recovery. \u2047 For example, in the first few months of the year, we completed an extension of our West Chester, Ohio facility, expanding our capabilities, received supplier recognitions from Boeing and Rolls-Royce and announced a significant B-2 Bomber Exhaust System Contract award from Northrop Grumman. \u2047 Our 2021 expectation as for OEM sales to be up mid-single digits over 2020 and spare parts down in the mid-teens, both are unchanged from our prior view. \u2047 Our forecast for MRO is slightly improved, now down low single digits versus our prior view of been down mid-single digits. \u2047 Segment operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 13%. \u2047 Julie is a proven leader with significant experience, leading the financial operations of global businesses. \u2047 Her extensive background and proven strategic leadership in corporate finance, financial planning and analysis, mergers and acquisitions, and risk management will help us advance our long-term profitable growth strategy. \u2047 In closing, we're off to a good start in 2021. \u2047 Favorable macroeconomic indicators and our solid orders generation provide us with a high degree of confidence in our improved outlook for the year. \u2047 However, that's not to say there aren't challenges that remain, so our teams are proactively implementing risk mitigation plans. \u2047 As we move forward, we'll continue to add the necessary talent and skill sets to enable us to drive growth and improve profitability. \u2047 Those efforts will be supported by our organic investments in innovation, digitalization and strategic marketing. \u2047 Our focus remains squarely on controlling our own destiny and positioning the Company to prosper as global markets recover. \u2047 Let me begin with highlights of our first quarter results on Slide 4 of our supplement. \u2047 First quarter sales were $302 million, down 9% from the prior year period with organic sales declining 10% as ongoing impacts from the pandemic offset our Aerospace end markets. \u2047 The divested Seeger business had a negative impact of 2% on sales, while FX had a positive impact of 3%. \u2047 Operating income was $32.4 million versus $49.3 million a year ago. \u2047 Compared to last year's adjusted operating income of $51.7 million, the first quarter was down 37% and operating margin of 10.7%, decreased 490 bps from last year's adjusted 15.6%. \u2047 It's important to keep in mind that this result was not unexpected. \u2047 The first quarter of last year saw Aerospace aftermarket performance -- saw record Aerospace aftermarket performance, which generated very strong margins. \u2047 Interest expense was $3.9 million, a decrease of $400,000 as a result of lower average borrowings, offset in part by a higher average interest rate. \u2047 For the quarter, our effective tax rate was 28.1%, lower than last year's 31.5% tax rate. \u2047 The decrease is largely due to the absence of tax expense related to the completed sale of the Seeger business and the reduction of the statutory tax rate at one of our international operations, both of which occurred in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Offsetting these items is the impact of the global intangible low taxed income tax or GILTI tax on foreign earnings in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 Net income was $19.4 million or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $29.7 million or $0.58 per diluted share a year ago. \u2047 On an adjusted basis, net income per share was down 46% from last year's $0.71. \u2047 Last year's first quarter adjusted net income per diluted share excluded $0.13 of Seeger divestiture adjustments. \u2047 Turning to our segment performance, beginning with Industrial. \u2047 First quarter sales were $220 million, up 10% from a year ago. \u2047 Organic sales increased 8%. \u2047 The foregone sales from the Seeger divestiture had a negative impact of 3%, while favorable FX primarily driven by the euro to US dollar exchange increased sales by 5%. \u2047 Relative to the fourth quarter of 2020, sequential sales were up 5%. \u2047 So good news on the revenue front with three sequential quarters of improvement and a positive year-over-year result. \u2047 Industrial's operating profit for the first quarter was $21.3 million versus $17.9 million in the prior year period. \u2047 Operating profit increased from the contribution of higher volumes and productivity improvements. \u2047 These were offset in part by higher personnel costs, including incentive compensation. \u2047 Last year we saw a reduction in the quarter for incentive comp, while this year sees an uptick based on performance expectations for 2021. \u2047 On an adjusted basis, which excludes $2.4 million of Seeger divestiture adjustments last year, first quarter operating income was up 5% from last year's $20.3 million. \u2047 Compared to a year ago, adjusted operating margin was down 50 bps from 10.2%. \u2047 One of the contributing factors is the additional investments being borne by the Industrial segment. \u2047 As Patrick mentioned, these investments squarely put a focus on our long-term growth strategy. \u2047 While our end markets and businesses within Industrial showing -- are showing signs of the solid recovery, there are some supply chain concerns related to raw material availability and inflation, as well as increased freight costs. \u2047 With respect to raw materials, we've seen instances where certain customers have extended the time horizons of their order commitments, looking to ensure availability of supply and acknowledging the longer lead times required for some materials. \u2047 In the first quarter, we experienced approximately $1 million of combined freight and material inflation in the Industrial segment. \u2047 For the full year, we expect an impact of about $6 million, which is built into our outlook. \u2047 Our teams are working on[Phonetic] these issues, looking to decrease the risk exposure and to take actions to offset the inflation where appropriate. \u2047 Moving to Aerospace, sales were $82 million for the first quarter, down 38% from last year. \u2047 Operating profit of $11.1 million was down 65%, primarily driven by the lower sales volume. \u2047 Operating margin was 13.6%, versus a strong 23.9% a year ago. \u2047 You may recall, last year's margin was a high watermark, driven by the contributions of the aftermarket. \u2047 Aerospace OEM backlog ended the quarter at $600 million, up 5% from the fourth quarter and we expect to ship 45% of this backlog over the next 12 months. \u2047 First quarter cash provided by operating activities was $36 million, a decrease of $12 million versus a year ago, free cash flow was $28 million, versus $35 million last year, and capital expenditures of $8 million were down about $4 million from a year ago. \u2047 Regarding the balance sheet, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined by our credit agreement, was 3.1 times at quarter end, essentially flat to the prior quarter result. \u2047 The Company is in full compliance with all covenants of our credit agreements and maintains adequate liquidity to fund operations. \u2047 While we anticipated the leverage ratio to peak with our first quarter 2021 results, we performed better than expected with the stronger financial results of the first quarter. \u2047 We see leverage further declining from this point absent any acquisition activity. \u2047 Our first quarter average diluted shares outstanding was 51 million shares. \u2047 We now expect to resume some share repurchase activity to offset equity compensation dilution, with respect to incremental share repurchases that will depend on a number of factors related to capital deployment and growth opportunities that are available to us. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5 of our supplement, let's discuss our updated financial outlook for 2021. \u2047 We now expect organic sales to be up 10% to 12% for the year, an increase from our prior view of up 6% to 8%, driven by stronger industrial growth. \u2047 FX is expected to have a 2% favorable impact on sales, while divested revenue -- divested Seeger revenues will have a small negative impact. \u2047 Operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 13%. \u2047 At this point, we're not anticipating significant residual restructuring charges to come through, so no forecasted adjustments to 2021 net income. \u2047 EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $1.98, up 9% to 21% from 2020's adjusted earnings of $1.64, that expectation is an increase from our prior view of $1.65 to $1.90, and we expect the first half of the year to contribute approximately 43% of"],
