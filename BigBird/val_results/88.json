{"article": ["I appreciate you all joining us today to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2021 results. \u2047 In particular, more than two-thirds of our people are essential workers, and they have continued to come to work every day, enabling us to continue to deliver for our customers. \u2047 I'm very proud of our entire team. \u2047 Regarding the business, as we indicated last quarter, overall, we have seen our commercial volumes stabilize and continued strong performance out of our government business. \u2047 While we remain in a difficult and uncertain environment, we are encouraged by the stabilization, as well as the positive developments regarding the vaccines, which not only will protect our people, but should also ultimately lead to more travel and a recovery in our commercial markets. \u2047 With that, turning to the quarter, our sales decreased 28% year-over-year from $561 million to $404 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 52% from $0.64 per share to $0.31 per share. \u2047 Our sales to commercial customers decreased 48%, and our sales to government and defense customers increased 13%. \u2047 For the quarter, sales to government and defense customers were 52% of our total sales. \u2047 Our Aviation Services segment grew 6% sequentially from our first quarter. \u2047 This was a result of increased volume in our MRO business, which is seasonally higher in Q1 over -- Q2 over Q1, as well as the continued strength of our government business. \u2047 Our commercial parts volumes overall were relatively stable throughout the quarter and remained above the lows we saw in April and May. \u2047 That said, I am particularly encouraged by our margin improvement progress. \u2047 Over the last several quarters, we have reduced our footprint across the enterprise, decreased our indirect and overhead spending, exited or restructured several underperforming contracts and divested a loss-making non-core business. \u2047 You are now starting to see the results of these actions in our adjusted operating margins, which improved meaningfully from 2.5% to 4% sequentially on stable revenue. \u2047 With respect to cash, we generated $28 million from operating activities from continuing operations and also reduced our accounts receivable financing program by nearly $7 million, further improving our already strong balance sheet position and putting our net leverage below 1 times EBITDA. \u2047 We also continue to add significant new business that positions us for growth going forward. \u2047 Our CFM56 partnership with Fortress solidifies a source of supply to meet growing demand for used serviceable material on the -5B and the -7B engine variants. \u2047 We expect demand for USM to increase across the board as we emerge from the pandemic and to be particularly strong for these engine platforms. \u2047 Also, our follow-on contract from the Navy to support the C-40 aircraft recognizes our performance over the last five years and provides for an expanded statement of work over the next five years. \u2047 It's worth noting that this was the first time that this contract was awarded to an incumbent, which speaks to the high-quality of our service. \u2047 Additionally, our 10-year agreement with Honeywell to be its sole authorized service center for 737 MAX Electronic Bleed Air System components positions us to support MAX operators worldwide when that aircraft to return to service. \u2047 These new contracts, along with others we have announced over the last several months, such as the Unison expansion and extension, represent nearly $1.7 billion in total contract value captured so far this fiscal year. \u2047 This demonstrates the unique value of our Aviation Services offerings, and these business wins will help accelerate our recovery coming out of the downturn. \u2047 Our sales in the quarter of $403.6 million were down 28% or $157.3 million year-over-year, driven by the impacts of the pandemic on commercial passenger flying activity. \u2047 Sequentially, Aviation Services sales were up 5.9% or $21.4 million, while sales in Expeditionary Services were down 50% or $18.6 million. \u2047 The sequential decline in Expeditionary Services was driven by two factors. \u2047 First, the exit of the composites business was completed at the end of Q1, and this business generated $7 million of revenue in Q1 and zero in the current quarter. \u2047 Second, as previously discussed, mobility had a particularly strong Q1 due to elevated shipments of pallets. \u2047 Within Aviation Services, our government and defense business was up 19% or $30 million year-over-year, reflecting strong performance on existing contracts. \u2047 In the quarter, as well as in Q1, our program to deliver two C-40 aircraft to the U.S. Marine Corps generated strong revenue due to elevated activity on the program. \u2047 Gross profit margin in the quarter increased to 17.2% from 15.3% in the prior year quarter, driven by the CARES Act payroll support. \u2047 On a sequential basis, gross profit margin was up 12 -- was up from 12.1% in our first quarter, reflecting the actions we have taken to reduce our indirect costs and to exit underperforming contracts and product lines. \u2047 SG&A expenses were $43.4 million for the quarter. \u2047 On an adjusted basis, SG&A was $38 million or 9.4% of sales, down $13 million from the prior year quarter, reflecting the reduction of our overhead cost structure. \u2047 Of this improvement, approximately $3.2 million was the result of temporary reductions in compensation and benefits, which we restored beginning on December 1. \u2047 As an update on our previous disclosure, we have been in settlement discussions with the Department of Justice regarding an investigation of airlift under the False Claims Act. \u2047 During the quarter, we recorded $6 million of additional accrual and discontinued operation, which brings our total reserve for this matter to $8 million based on our latest settlement offer. \u2047 We generated $27.6 million of cash in our operating activities from continuing operations for the quarter. \u2047 This is net of a use of cash of $6.8 million as we continue to reduce the size of our accounts receivable financing program. \u2047 Excluding the accounts receivable financing program, cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $34.4 million. \u2047 Inventory decreased $12.7 million during the quarter. \u2047 Our net debt at quarter end was $112.1 million, down $37 million from $149.3 million at the end of Q1. \u2047 Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong with net leverage of 0.95 times adjusted EBITDA, unrestricted cash of $110 million and unused capacity under our revolver of approximately $390 million. \u2047 As such, we're well positioned to fund what we expect to be unique opportunities to grow our business over the coming quarters. \u2047 Overall, we are pleased with our results given the current environment and also pleased with the progress we have made in improving our operating efficiency. \u2047 As I mentioned, for many reasons, we are encouraged by the multiple vaccines coming to market and the plans for distribution. \u2047 As the vaccines are distributed and case numbers decline, we expect travel restrictions to be lifted and people to start flying again. \u2047 Until then, we expect to be in a relatively stable revenue environment, and we will continue to focus on driving cash flow, as well as continued margin improvement. \u2047 We will also remain focused on capturing new business, I am confident that our strong balance sheet, combined with the airlines' increasing desire for our lower-cost value-added services, will lead to even more growth opportunities. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["second quarter sales of $404 million, down 28% from the prior year
