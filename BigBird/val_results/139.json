year, we will be providing financial information compared to FY '19 or pre-pandemic and FY '20 where applicable. \u2047 For a full reconciliation of corresponding GAAP financial information, please visit our website, www. \u2047 Now let me outline the speakers and topics for this conference call. \u2047 Joanne will begin with highlights from the fiscal year for Tapestry and each of our brands. \u2047 She will also provide an overview of the progress we've made on our Acceleration Program, along with goals for FY '22. \u2047 Scott will continue with our financial results and priorities going forward. \u2047 Following that, we will hold a question and answer session where we will be joined by Todd Kahn, CEO and Brand President of Coach. \u2047 After Q&A, Joanne will conclude with brief closing remarks. \u2047 We delivered standout results in fiscal 2021, a transformational year for Tapestry. \u2047 We are a fundamentally different company today than we were just one year ago. \u2047 Through our Acceleration Program, we reached new customers in new ways and effectively adapted to a rapidly changing environment. \u2047 Our success is a testament to our powerful brands and talented team. \u2047 We achieved many strategic milestones this year, which have strengthened our organization. \u2047 We've sharpened our focus on the consumer and clarified the unique positioning of each of our brands. \u2047 This drove improvements in key customer metrics, including recruitment, retention and reactivation. \u2047 We enhanced our digital capabilities, highlighted by our global e-commerce channel, a margin accretive business for Tapestry, reaching approximately $1.6 billion in revenue, nearly doubling versus prior year and over $1 billion ahead of pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 This was fueled by the acquisition of nearly 4 million new customers in North America alone, including a growing number of millennial and Gen Z consumers. \u2047 And we sustained double-digit e-commerce sales growth in the fourth quarter, even as we lapped more difficult comparisons online. \u2047 At the same time, we drove continued sequential sales improvement for our global store fleet with operating margins that were once again above pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 We further strengthened our positioning in China, which still has tremendous runway, supported by the growth of the rising middle class. \u2047 In fact, Tapestry's business in Greater China reached $1.1 billion in sales this fiscal year, led by over 60% growth on the Mainland. \u2047 At the same time, we grew our business with Chinese consumers globally, increasing at a high-single-digit rate as compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 We successfully leveraged data and analytics, embedding capabilities across the company to enhance our understanding of the customer, increased responsiveness and drive faster, more effective decision making. \u2047 This has underpinned our ability to optimize the assortment planning process, lower SKU counts by 40% to 45% and reduced promotional activity, supporting higher AUR and gross margin as well as improved inventory turns. \u2047 We also embraced new ways of working with a leaner operating model and more empowered teams. \u2047 This resulted in $200 million of gross expense savings in fiscal year '21, which funded investments in areas such as digital and marketing to fuel our continued growth as well as our purpose-led initiatives to accelerate and amplify our work within our social fabric to effect positive change for our industry and stakeholders. \u2047 Importantly, the traction of our strategy is clearly evidenced by our financial performance, including the achievement of record operating margin at Tapestry Inc. as well as operating income and earnings per share growth versus both FY '20 and FY '19 in each quarter of the year. \u2047 We also exceeded pre-pandemic sales in the fourth quarter, representing an important financial milestone. \u2047 In addition, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow and ended the year in a strong cash position, while reducing our leverage through organic profit growth and the pay down of the company's revolver. \u2047 Given our strong financial position and underlying business trends, our board of directors approved the reinstatement of our capital return programs with a plan to return over $750 million to shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases in fiscal year '22. \u2047 These actions underscore our conviction and Tapestry's ability to drive long-term growth along with our commitment to enhancing value for our stakeholders. \u2047 Scott will discuss our capital allocation priorities in more detail shortly. \u2047 Now let me touch on our results and strategies for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. \u2047 Coach, our largest brand, led Tapestry, outperforming in each quarter of the year. \u2047 The brand fueled momentum through innovation across consumer touch points, driving engagement with new and existing customers. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, Coach revenue rose 117% versus prior year, outpacing pre-pandemic levels of sales by 2%, a meaningful achievement given the volatile backdrop. \u2047 In addition, we delivered significant profitability enhancements during the fiscal year, resulting in operating income increases of 67% on a one year basis and 14% on a two year basis. \u2047 This outstanding performance was the result of both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, reflecting strategic actions and structural changes we've made to sustain long-term growth. \u2047 Throughout the fiscal year, we made significant progress at Coach against the pillars of our multi-year growth agenda. \u2047 First, we've deepened our engagement with consumers by leaning into our brand values of inclusivity and authenticity to drive increased recruitment and reactivation. \u2047 In addition, through the launch of our loyalty program in North America and more targeted marketing, we drove significant gains in the number of repeat transactions. \u2047 Second, we created innovative, unique and compelling product to meet the needs of our target consumer segment. \u2047 We are building enduring icons that create a foundation for our product pipeline and future seasons. \u2047 This was evidenced by the recent success of newness within the Tabby family, including our Pillow and Mini versions. \u2047 In addition, we saw continued strength in our signature platforms across an expanded assortment of refresh styles, highlighting desirability for the brand. \u2047 Third, we drove triple-digit sales growth in our digital channels on both the one and two year basis led by new customer recruitment. \u2047 During the fiscal year, we acquired nearly 2.5 million new Coach customers through our digital channels in North America alone, a meaningful increase versus prior year. \u2047 Importantly, we sustained strong momentum in the fourth quarter even as we comped our digital initiatives and the initial uplift in e-com sales that occurred during the pandemic in the prior year, highlighting continued opportunity in the channel. \u2047 Fourth, we accelerated growth in China by leveraging our foundation in the country, which resulted in over 60% revenue growth on the Mainland in fiscal year '21 with strength across channels. \u2047 This performance reflected our integrated and comprehensive brand building strategy, including investments in marketing, innovative product and a continued focus on digital channels. \u2047 Most recently, we hosted our live stream fashion show in Shanghai, which was extremely well received and highlights our commitment to the Chinese consumer. \u2047 Finally, we enhanced profitability to realize an operating margin of over 31%. \u2047 This performance was driven by higher gross margin, which reached nearly 74% through a focus on streamlining our offering, sharpening our merchandising efforts and reducing SKU counts by approximately 45%. \u2047 These initiatives resulted in global handbag AUR growth in each quarter of the fiscal year. \u2047 In fact, in the fourth quarter, our handbag AUR rose high-single-digits globally led by particular strength in North America. \u2047 In addition, we made structural changes to SG&A, including our fleet optimization efforts. \u2047 Looking ahead to fiscal year '22, our goals are to increase market share in our core handbag and small leather goods categories through a combination of AUR and unit growth by continuing to develop the brand's iconic families, approachable and inclusive messaging and consistent global positioning, invest and grow in digital while delivering differentiated and compelling omnichannel experiences, continue to drive growth in China with key initiatives to capitalize on market trends of the emerging middle class and increased digitalization and grow men's by expanding lifestyle, building brand awareness and increasing our presence in Asia in keeping with our ambition to deliver over $1 billion in revenue in this category over our planning horizon. \u2047 In summary, Coach has both a remarkable 80-year history and a bright future. \u2047 We are confident that the deliberate actions we've taken to improve the foundation of the brand, including the realization of higher AUR and stronger margins are sustainable over the long-term as revenue continues to inflect. \u2047 We're continuing to improve on the momentum we've built to drive market share gains at sustainably high margins in fiscal '22 and beyond. \u2047 Now moving to Kate Spade. \u2047 Throughout the year, the brand delivered consistent improvement on the top-line, resulting in fiscal year '21 sales growth of 3% compared to prior year or 13% decline compared to pre-pandemic revenue levels. \u2047 In the most recent quarter, sales increased 95% versus prior year and were 4% below fiscal year '19. \u2047 Direct sales in the fourth quarter, excluding wholesale, increased on a two year basis. \u2047 In addition, for both the quarter and fiscal year, operating income rose meaningfully with margin expansion compared to prior year on both a stronger gross margin and SG&A leverage. \u2047 We are pleased with Kate Spade's progress across its growth strategies, which highlight the traction we're making to build stronger connections with consumers. \u2047 In fiscal '21, we crystallized the brand's purpose, returning to its roots of unique and best-in-class storytelling and fulfilling its promise as a lifestyle brand, representing joy, optimism and color. \u2047 During the most recent quarter, we continued to rereengage lapsed customers and an increasing rate as we reactivated 550,000 customers through our North America digital channels, an increase of nearly 35% compared to prior year, demonstrating our focus on building lasting relationships with our customers. \u2047 Second, we embedded a laser focus on the customer by harnessing the power of the broad and loyal Kate Spade community to engage consumers in new and exciting ways. \u2047 This was evidenced by our viral Happy Dance Campaign on TikTok, which has over 11 billion views and counting. \u2047 Third, we reenergized our core handbag offering by introducing innovative and universal brand elements. \u2047 We're seeing traction in leather with the introduction of the Knot, which has already grown to approximately 20% of our retail assortment, proving its position as a key family in the assortment going forward. \u2047 In addition, our new signature branding, the Spade Flower continues to perform, while the reimagine Sam and Nylon has outpaced expectations. \u2047 These platforms represent strong foundations for future growth. \u2047 Fourth, we leaned into our digital strength, delivering approximately 35% growth compared to prior year across our e-commerce channels, reaching 35% of sales for the fiscal year. \u2047 This growth was driven by both the acquisition of nearly 1.4 million new customers through our North America digital channels as well as the engagement of existing customers. \u2047 Fifth, we improved profitability by focusing on acquiring, reengaging and retaining customers to drive top and bottom line growth. \u2047 Through the use of data, we adjusted our assortment and pricing strategies, which resulted in approximately 40% lower SKU count and disciplined promotional activity. \u2047 This ultimately drove overall handbag AUR growth, which increased mid-single-digits in both the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year. \u2047 Finally, we've continued to focus on talent and culture. \u2047 This year, we reorganized our creative structure with the formation of the cross-functional ideation studio spanning across our brand creative, design, merchandising and marketing teams. \u2047 This has increased collaboration and cohesion to drive more impactful and consistent storytelling. \u2047 As we head into fiscal '22, we are building on the strong foundation we've established with the goal to deliver profitable and sustainable global growth. \u2047 To achieve this, we will maintain a consumer-centric approach across all aspects of the business, amplify recent product introductions, while continuing to build out our core handbag platforms, continue to engage newly acquired reactivated and existing customers to drive higher lifetime value, drive brand heat through marketing focused on our Kate Spade community, particularly in social channels, maximize lifestyle positioning by strengthening the foundation of ready-to-wear, jewelry and footwear and improve the global omnichannel experience and drive continued growth in digital. \u2047 Overall, we are pleased with Kate Spade's execution and the traction we gained with consumers in fiscal '21, including AUR improvement and strong customer engagement. \u2047 This progress is reflected in Kate Spade's outperformance versus internal expectations, reinforcing our confidence in the brand's potential. \u2047 Kate Spade is a unique yet universal brand, and our teams are galvanized around driving our clear strategy. \u2047 We continue to believe in the significant runway ahead and our ability to achieve $2 billion in revenue and enhanced profitability in the future. \u2047 Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. \u2047 Throughout the fiscal year, the brand progressed on its growth strategies. \u2047 Specifically, we continued to renew the brand's reputation for fit, comfort and quality by listening and responding to customer needs. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see a significant increase in demand for dress styles as much of the world began to reopen and events and in person socialization returned. \u2047 Second, we grew our key categories by building strength in boots, booties and sandals through fashion innovation, highlighted by the continued success of our iconic 5050 Land and Nudist families, which brought a new and younger customers. \u2047 We also expanded the casual assortment, including a broader sneaker offering in the recently introduced on-trend Jelly styles. \u2047 At the same time, we dramatically simplified the product assortment with SKU counts declining approximately 45%. \u2047 Third, we focused our distribution on markets and channels of greatest opportunity to create a foundation to return to profitability as revenues inflect. \u2047 This included the exit of unprofitable markets across the globe and rightsizing of the fleet in North America. \u2047 At the same time, momentum continued for our China business in fiscal '21 with revenue on the Mainland increasing over 35% compared to prior year or nearly 50% on a two year basis. \u2047 We kept the Chinese consumer at the forefront of our strategy, highlighted by our tailored product offering featuring capsule collections, relevant marketing with key opinion leaders and continued outperformance across digital channels. \u2047 China remains an important area of long-term opportunity for Stuart Weitzman at structurally higher margins. \u2047 Fourth, we strengthened our relationship with wholesale partners by providing relevant products and faster more consistent execution. \u2047 As previously shared, we reentered 90 Nordstrom doors in the year, fueling North America wholesale revenue ahead of"], "gold_summary": ["q4 revenue rose 126 percent to $1.62 billion."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q4 earnings per share $0.32.  \u2047  q4 earnings per share
