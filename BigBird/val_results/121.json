{"article": ["They will be joined by Scott Oaksmith, Senior Vice President, Real Estate & Finance. \u2047 We're glad you could join us and hope you are all well. \u2047 Our company, like the hotel industry overall, continues to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is far from over. \u2047 The response of our franchisees, their hotel staff and Choice associates has been remarkable. \u2047 Despite the pandemic, I'm pleased to report that Choice Hotels has continued to drive results that significantly outperform the industry in the third quarter. \u2047 Systemwide domestic RevPAR outperformed the industry by nearly 20 percentage points, declining only 28.8% from the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 All of our limited service brands had significant RevPAR index gains against their local competitors. \u2047 We continued to grow our effective royalty rate, a reflection of the continuously improving value proposition to our franchisees. \u2047 And we grew our total system size, especially in our more revenue intense, upscale, mid-scale and extended-stay segments. \u2047 We attribute this success to Choice's key differentiators, including our diversified brand portfolio, the geographic footprint of our domestic system, the profile of our core customer and our franchise-focused business model. \u2047 These core strengths have positioned us well to capture the shifts in consumer demand that occurred over the last eight months. \u2047 We believe that the strategy of growing our limited service brands in the right segments and the right locations will allow us to continue to increase our share of travel demand over the long term. \u2047 And now that we're entering the ninth month of the pandemic, we are beginning to see trends emerge that are likely to have a long-term impact on the travel industry. \u2047 Let me begin with the trend of remote work and virtual learning. \u2047 The significant investment in remote access technology by businesses, schools and consumers is creating more options in where and when traditional activities take place. \u2047 In a post-pandemic world, this may afford Americans even more flexibility in their schedules to travel for leisure. \u2047 For the last several years, we've seen a trend in leisure travel demand spreading more evenly throughout the month of the year, which we attribute in part to school schedules shifting over the years as well as the increase in baby boomers retiring and having more time and disposable income to travel. \u2047 More employees can now work from anywhere with an Internet connection, while their children attend virtual schooling. \u2047 For the past two months, we saw continued leisure demand extending into weekdays. \u2047 A second trend is the increase in road trips. \u2047 which we're benefiting from with our high concentration of hotels in drive-to markets. \u2047 Consumers' appetite for road trips has only accelerated since the onset of the pandemic as Americans are showing a clear preference for trips that are closer to home. \u2047 Destinations that may have been overlooked before the onset of COVID-19 are getting fresh consideration. \u2047 With over 4,000 domestic hotels located within a mile of an interstate exit, our hotels are well positioned to serve travelers as they hit the open road. \u2047 And with over 2,000 domestic hotels near beaches and national parks, our hotels are also located in the right markets to capture growing demand from travelers who increasingly are looking to rediscover the great American outdoors. \u2047 Another emerging trend is the economic disruption brought on by the pandemic and its effect on consumers as the recovery takes place. \u2047 We believe that in uncertain times, as in previous down cycles, consumers will be looking for more moderately priced limited service hotel offerings, presenting an opportunity for our portfolio to capture this demand. \u2047 Another anticipated economic effect of the pandemic is higher relocation rates. \u2047 As people shift jobs and industries, demand for longer-term hotel stays rises, a trend we believe will benefit our brands, particularly those in the moderately priced extended-stay segment. \u2047 And finally, there are signs that consumers' risk tolerance is climbing, even before a vaccine is available. \u2047 According to a recent survey, the perception of travel safety is up, and Americans likelihood to take a domestic leisure trip and stay in a hotel during the next six months is the highest since mid-March. \u2047 As a result of these trends, we've seen a rise in our weekday occupancy quarter-over-quarter, on top of the existing base of weekend leisure demand we've historically enjoyed. \u2047 In fact, our weekday RevPAR index is up eight percentage points year-over-year in the third quarter. \u2047 Our year-over-year RevPAR change continued to improve month-over-month in the third quarter. \u2047 At this time, we remain optimistic that we will see sequential month-over-month improvements related to our year-over-year RevPAR change. \u2047 Our loyalty program has remained a key driver of our business throughout the pandemic enhancing our ability to drive franchisees top line revenue. \u2047 We particularly benefited from Choice Privileges Diamond Elite members, our best customers, who contributed an even higher percentage of overall revenue year-to-date versus last year. \u2047 We expect this bedrock of loyalty business to deliver even higher value going forward as more Americans return to travel and enrollments in our award-winning Choice Privileges loyalty program continues to climb. \u2047 Our long-term strategy of growing the right brands in the right segments in the right markets allow Choice brand hotels to continue to outperform the competition. \u2047 Throughout the third quarter, we generated significant month-over-month increases in our proprietary revenue contribution to our hotels. \u2047 More specifically, our website contribution increased by 400 basis points and our loyalty contribution increased by 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 This has helped drive RevPAR index share gains versus our local competitors across all location types as reported by STR. \u2047 For the past 34 weeks through October 31, we observed significant RevPAR share gains against the competition. \u2047 In the third quarter, all of our select service brands achieved material RevPAR index gains versus their local competitors, with each of our upscale and extended-stay brands experiencing share gains of over 10 percentage points. \u2047 I'll now provide a brief update on our segments. \u2047 Our upscale portfolio once again achieved impressive year-over-year growth in the third quarter, where we increased our domestic upscale room count by 33%. \u2047 The Ascend Hotel Collection is the industry's first and largest soft brand. \u2047 Now with nearly 300 hotels around the globe and fast approaching its 200th domestic location, Ascend Hotels achieved the following performance in the third quarter: RevPAR change outperformance by over 26 percentage points versus the upscale segment; RevPAR share gains against local competitors of nearly 19 percentage points; and average daily rate index gains of approximately nine percentage points. \u2047 In fact, for the past six months, Ascend has significantly outperformed the upscale soft brands as well as the segment as a whole in terms of year-over-year RevPAR change. \u2047 Our extended-stay hotels are purpose-built for long-term guests. \u2047 Choice Hotels brands in this cycle-resilient segment continue to outperform in this unprecedented environment, and our portfolio of over 420 extended-stay hotels grew 6% year-over-year in the third quarter. \u2047 Our WoodSpring Suites brand achieved an average occupancy rate of 77% in the third quarter, and the brand's monthly occupancy levels have remained north of 75% since the last week of June. \u2047 Our Suburban extended-stay brand experienced year-over-year occupancy gains in the third quarter, further enhancing the brand's attractiveness to developers looking for a smart, extended-stay conversion opportunity. \u2047 At the same time, our MainStay Suites mid-scale extended-stay brand gained more than 16 percentage points in RevPAR index versus its local competitors in the third quarter. \u2047 We remain optimistic about the growth potential of our extended-stay portfolio whose pipeline increased by 9% year-over-year in the third quarter. \u2047 Year-to-date through September, Choice has awarded over 40 extended-stay franchise agreements, demonstrating sustained interest in both new construction and conversion opportunities during a challenging time for the industry. \u2047 I'd now like to turn to our mid-scale segment, whose brands represent 2/3 of our total domestic portfolio and over half of the franchise agreements executed year-to-date. \u2047 All of our select-service mid-scale brands achieved year-over-year RevPAR index and average daily rate index gains versus their local competitors through the third quarter. \u2047 The Comfort brand captured RevPAR share gains of over seven percentage points versus local competitors in the third quarter. \u2047 And Clarion Pointe, a conversion brand extension of Clarion that launched less than two years ago, recently opened its 20th hotel in the U.S. and now has over 50 hotels open or in the pipeline, demonstrating its strong growth as the brand continues its coast-to-coast expansion. \u2047 Demand for Choice's brands continues despite the challenging environment, aided by our strong value proposition and recent outperformance. \u2047 Developers choose our brands as they seek to boost the value of their hotels. \u2047 We have a conversion brand to fit most developers' price points which has driven our development growth through past downturns. \u2047 Year-to-date, through the end of September, we have awarded over 230 new domestic franchise agreements, nearly 70% of which were for conversion hotels. \u2047 In the third quarter alone, we executed over 80 domestic agreements, of which nearly 3/4 were for conversions and over 40% of which were executed in the month of September. \u2047 We have a long history of enhancing the diversity of our ownership base through our one-of-a-kind emerging markets development team, which helps underrepresented individuals such as minority and veteran entrepreneurs enter the rewarding business of hotel franchising. \u2047 Nearly 70% of our hotels have minority ownership. \u2047 Despite the pandemic, we have awarded and financially supported 17 franchise contracts with black and Hispanic entrepreneurs year-to-date. \u2047 Most recently, we entered into the largest minority-owned multiunit franchise agreement in the program's history. \u2047 Our long-standing commitment to diversity and further details regarding our efforts to improve the communities we serve will be outlined in our forthcoming ESG report. \u2047 While this year's challenges have been unique, the cyclical nature of our industry is known. \u2047 It's something our experienced and disciplined management team, many of whom have led the company through previous down cycles, planned for. \u2047 Our resilient franchisee base also has deep experience leading their small businesses through down cycles, and they are at the center of everything we do. \u2047 Over the course of the pandemic, we have supported our franchisees in a number of ways. \u2047 First, by reducing costs through extending brand program deadlines, implementing cost savings, operational initiatives, reducing certain fixed fees, implementing a tailored fee deferral program and modifying brand standards. \u2047 Second, by capturing business through our global sales efforts aimed at first responders and other essential travel; a multichannel, multi-brand marketing campaign; and tailored promotional programs. \u2047 Finally, by leveraging hygiene and infection prevention experts like Ecolab in launching our Commitment to Clean initiative, helping to make sure their hotels are clean and safe. \u2047 We also have been advocating and will continue to advocate with policymakers for additional relief measures aimed at assisting small businesses to provide targeted help for the travel industry. \u2047 Specifically, we've been urging enactment of a second draw loan program for existing Paycheck Protection Program borrowers, greater accommodation and more streamlining for borrowers to obtain forgiveness and liability protections for hotel owners who comply with health and safety protocols during the pandemic. \u2047 We've also called for additional stimulus to support American discretionary spending, including in areas such as travel. \u2047 In closing, Choice Hotels is positioned to emerge from these trying times stronger just as we have before in our 80-year history. \u2047 Our proven portfolio of well-segmented brands, geographic footprint, and asset-light business model position us well to benefit from current consumer trends as they continue to evolve. \u2047 I'll now invite our CFO to provide his update. \u2047 I hope that you and your families are well and healthy. \u2047 Today, I'd like to provide additional insights around our third quarter performance, update you on our balance sheet and liquidity, as well as our approach to capital allocation, and finally, share our thoughts on the outlook for the road ahead. \u2047 Let's now take a closer look at our results. \u2047 For the third quarter of 2020, total revenues, excluding marketing and reservation system fees, were $103.6 million. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $74.9 million representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of over 72% and adjusted earnings per share were $0.66. \u2047 Our domestic systemwide RevPAR for the third quarter outperformed the overall industry by nearly 20 percentage points, declining only 28.8% from the same quarter of 2019. \u2047 In addition, our results exceeded the primary chain scale segments in which we compete as reported by STR by six percentage points. \u2047 We've long focused our brand strategy on driving growth across the higher value and more revenue intense upscale, extended-stay and mid-scale segments, and it's paying off. \u2047 In the third quarter, all three segments achieved year-over-year RevPAR outperformance against their respective industry chain scales and gains versus their local competitors. \u2047 Specifically, the RevPAR change of our upscale portfolio exceeded that of the overall segment by 14 percentage points, and our upscale portfolio outperformed its local competitive set by over nine percentage points. \u2047 With average domestic systemwide occupancy rates of 74%, our extended-stay portfolio outperformed the industry's RevPAR change by an impressive 40 percentage points beating its local competitive set by 14 percentage points. \u2047 And finally, RevPAR change for our mid-scale portfolio exceeded the segment by nearly eight percentage points. \u2047 This RevPAR outperformance is the result of both continued occupancy gains and our franchisees' ability to maintain rate. \u2047 Our domestic systemwide occupancy rate has seen improvements since the trough of 28% that occurred back in early April. \u2047 Since the week of June 21 through late October, our average weekly occupancy rates have consistently exceeded 50%. \u2047 In addition, we continue to see gains in our average daily rate index, which was up 1.7 percentage points against local competitors in the third quarter. \u2047 These experts have been advising our franchisees on the best use of tools to maximize their pricing strategies and provide sophisticated market intelligence and channel management. \u2047 Despite the challenging environment, we expanded our system size, growing the number of domestic hotels by 0.7% and rooms by 1.9% year-over-year. \u2047 Across our more revenue intense brands in the upscale, extended-stay and mid-scale segments, we experienced even greater growth, increasing the number of hotels by 2.1% and rooms by 3.4% year-over-year. \u2047 We're especially pleased that Comfort, our flagship brand, continue to experience positive unit and rooms growth in the third quarter following its brand transformation. \u2047 Comfort's development"], "gold_summary": ["choice
