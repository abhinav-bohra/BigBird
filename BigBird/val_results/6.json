{"article": ["While we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. \u2047 Descriptions of the risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC. \u2047 Also, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 References to adjusted items, including organic net sales, refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. \u2047 Today, Dave and I will discuss our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, our expectations for fiscal 2022, and our perspective on how the Conagra Way playbook positions us for continued success in this dynamic environment. \u2047 Slide 5 lays out the key points we're going to cover today. \u2047 As you saw in our release, we reported very strong results for fiscal 2021 and we could not have done so without our people executing the Conagra Way with excellence. \u2047 Their dedication enabled us to capitalize on an unprecedented time of consumer demand. \u2047 Over the last year, we acquired and retained multiple years' worth of new consumers, and we grew share across categories, all while continuing to invest in the future. \u2047 This translated into strong growth across the portfolio. \u2047 We saw continued strength in frozen and snacks, as well as increased relevancy for our large staples business. \u2047 The work we've done modernizing and premiumizing our portfolio continues to pay off. \u2047 We believe our brands are healthier than ever and well-positioned to manage through the current inflationary challenges. \u2047 But I can tell you now that we're taking aggressive actions on a number of fronts. \u2047 It's also important to note that our plans provide for continued brand-building investments to drive consumer demand and further enhance brand health. \u2047 Our business remains very strong, but we are revising our fiscal '22 guidance to reflect the lag effect associated with the aggressive mitigating actions we are taking. \u2047 Essentially, we see fiscal '22 as a tale of two halves with the lag effect concentrated in the first half and particularly in Q1. \u2047 We expect many of our actions will start to flow through the P&L in Q2, setting up a second-half adjusted earnings per share in line with what was assumed for H2 within our prior guidance. \u2047 Given our resiliency over the last year and the compelling consumer trends we're continuing to track, we remain confident in the underlying strength of the business and the opportunities ahead for long-term value creation. \u2047 Finally, we plan on hosting an investor meeting next spring to provide an update on our progress and discuss fiscal '23 and beyond. \u2047 Be on the lookout for more information regarding the event. \u2047 We hope you can join us. \u2047 So with that as the backdrop, let's jump into the agenda for today's call. \u2047 We'll start with our business update and then cover our priorities and value-creation opportunities in fiscal 2022. \u2047 As you can see on Slide 7, we ended fiscal 2021 with a strong fourth quarter that was in line with our guidance. \u2047 As you know, our Q4 growth rates were impacted by the unprecedented demand we experienced in 2020 when at-home food consumption surged due to the onset of the pandemic and organic net sales increased 21.5%. \u2047 And as you can see, on a two-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased by more than 4% and our two-year adjusted earnings per share grew by more than 22%. \u2047 On a full-year basis, our organic net sales, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted earnings per share were all up materially versus fiscal 2020. \u2047 Continued execution of the Conagra Way playbook served as the foundation for our strong fiscal 2021 performance. \u2047 Within our industry, success is defined by creating meaningful and lasting connections between consumers and brands. \u2047 We believe that our playbook is the most effective framework for delivering on that objective. \u2047 Our modern approach to brand building is based on three tenets. \u2047 First, it all starts with developing superior products through perpetual modernization. \u2047 Second, we ensure the physical availability of our items, both in-store and online. \u2047 And third, we drive the mental availability of our products to ensure we remain salient and relevant with consumers. \u2047 The foundation of the Conagra Way to brand building is our people. \u2047 Our exceptional results this past fiscal year reflect our team's dedication to executing the Conagra Way each and every day. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of the team's resilience in responding to the volatile environment throughout the year. \u2047 We know our long-term performance is a function of the caliber and engagement of our team. \u2047 That's why we're continuing to invest in our current employees and keeping the door open to talented new additions. \u2047 In fiscal '21, our team's engagement was clearly evident in their intense focus on capturing opportunities. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, the pandemic created a unique environment for new consumer acquisition, and we were able to capitalize by having modern products available when and where consumers wanted them. \u2047 We estimate that over the course of the last fiscal year, we gained the equivalent of more than four years' worth of incremental new buyers. \u2047 COVID effectively amplified new product trials at a level rarely seen in our industry. \u2047 In the chart on the left, on Slide 10, you can see the increase in household penetration across our portfolio during fiscal 2021, clear evidence of the magnitude of our new consumer acquisition. \u2047 But what's even more encouraging is the chart on the right. \u2047 We didn't just acquire new consumers. \u2047 The data shows that our new consumers discovered the tremendous value proposition our portfolio provides, and we're proud that our products are repeatedly appearing in pantries and freezers across America. \u2047 Importantly, our performance over the last year was not only strong in the absolute, it was strong relative to the competition. \u2047 We performed better than our peers in terms of household penetration and repeat rates and we continued to gain share. \u2047 Keep in mind that we delivered these results despite hitting an upper control limit on the amount of product we could produce in certain categories. \u2047 If we had additional capacity, these numbers would likely be even more impressive. \u2047 Our disciplined approach to modernization and innovation across our product portfolio is key to our success. \u2047 As you can see on Slide 11, we delivered an impressive innovation slate in fiscal '21. \u2047 Our performance on innovation launched and sold in fiscal '21 surpassed the record performance we set in fiscal '20. \u2047 And importantly, our innovation outperformed the competition. \u2047 This strong outperformance is why even during the height of the pandemic, customers continued to ask for our new products. \u2047 This is a clear testament to the innovation engine at Conagra and the solid reputation we built with customers and consumers. \u2047 Slide 12 highlights a handful of our important launches in fiscal '21. \u2047 We continued our successful Gardein co-branding strategy with the launch of Marie Callender's pot pie with Gardein protein. \u2047 We continued to modernize and premiumize Birds Eye with the launch of vegetable bakes that are as good as any side dish you can order from a Chicago steakhouse. \u2047 We began modernizing the Hungry-Man brand with the launch of the Double Meat platform that satisfies the hungriest of appetites. \u2047 We also continued to work on Duncan Hines with the Instagrammable EPIC line of baking kits along with our keto-friendly mixes. \u2047 And we found even more ways to keep evolving our Healthy Choice Power Bowls with the launch of these vegetarian and vegan options. \u2047 I'm particularly excited about the Birds Eye breaded vegetables platform we launched in fiscal '21. \u2047 It's already started to take off with three of the cauliflower wings products being among the best-selling SKUs in the frozen vegetable category this year. \u2047 If you haven't tried them, you're missing out. \u2047 We supported the launch with a robust advertising campaign to drive awareness and mental availability. \u2047 This campaign included digital, social, and TV advertising. \u2047 In addition to mental availability, we remain focused on the physical availability of our products in Q4, whether through brick-and-mortar or online. \u2047 Slide 14 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce have continued to yield results. \u2047 Growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business continued in fiscal 2021, both against our peers and as a percentage of our overall retail sales. \u2047 We consistently outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the year. \u2047 E-commerce sales now represent nearly 8% of our total retail sales. \u2047 And importantly, our success in fiscal 2021 was broad-based. \u2047 Just take a look at Slide 15. \u2047 Total Conagra retail sales grew an impressive 11.7% on a two-year basis in the fourth quarter with contributions from each of our retail domains. \u2047 On a two-year basis, we delivered double-digit growth rates in retail sales across our frozen and snacking domains and a solid 5.2% growth rate in staples. \u2047 Let's dig into each domain a bit more, and let's start with frozen on Slide 16. \u2047 Over the last two years, our frozen retail sales have surged across desserts, single-serve meals, and multi-serve meals. \u2047 We've also seen consistent growth in retail sales of frozen vegetables. \u2047 All in, our strategic frozen business grew 13.5% over the two-year period ending in fiscal 2021. \u2047 And importantly, our buyers repeatedly returned to our frozen products. \u2047 As you can see on Slide 17, consumer repeat rates for our leading frozen brands have been stronger than for the competition. \u2047 Turning to Slide 18. \u2047 Our snacks business has seen similar success, delivering strong two-year retail sales growth of 21% in fiscal '21, led by increases of more than 25% across hot cocoa, microwave popcorn, ready-to-eat pudding, and meat snacks. \u2047 As with frozen, consumer repeat rates for a number of our leading snack brands beat those of competition during the fiscal year. \u2047 Staples was also a meaningful contributor to our success. \u2047 On Slide 20, you can see the strength of our staples portfolio. \u2047 Staples retail sales increased 5.2% over the past two years, spurred by steady growth across key staples categories. \u2047 Having increasingly rediscovered the joys of cooking last year, consumers reengaged with our staples products in a meaningful way. \u2047 As you can see on Slide 21, the solid performance from staples was not isolated. \u2047 We saw strong two-year growth rates across many of our largest staples brands. \u2047 Overall, we're pleased by the performance across our retail business, both within the quarter and over the fiscal year. \u2047 And as fiscal '22 begins, we believe our branded portfolio is stronger than ever. \u2047 So let's talk about what we see looking ahead. \u2047 We have a unique opportunity in fiscal '22 to leverage our current momentum and maximize long-term value-creation potential. \u2047 New behaviors and habits created during the pandemic resulted in an elevated and sustained level of at-home eating. \u2047 Shoppers are engaging or reengaging with our products now more than ever, creating a larger, high-quality consumer base. \u2047 To sustain this engagement, we plan to continue making investments in the physical and mental availability for our products. \u2047 This includes building additional capacity to fulfill consumer demand, making further strategic e-commerce investments, pursuing efficient and thoughtful marketing campaigns, and introducing a robust fiscal '22 innovation slate. \u2047 As we invest in our brands to create new and stronger connections with our consumers, we will also strategically navigate the inflationary environment that accelerated quickly during Q4 and continues today. \u2047 We're aggressively pulling on all our margin levers to minimize the inflation-related profit lag during the first half. \u2047 Regardless of near-term cost challenges, we plan to stay focused on the long-term priorities of our business, including continued investments to further support our brands. \u2047 Our objectives are ultimately focused on driving long-term value creation achieved by pursuing growth in frozen and snacks and maintaining our staples portfolio as a reliable contributor. \u2047 Let's spend a few minutes on our fiscal '22 innovation plans for each of the domains. \u2047 I'm excited to provide you a preview of what we have in store. \u2047 Starting with frozen, once again, we have high expectations for our innovation slate. \u2047 Slide 24 highlights some of the frozen products that will be rolled out during the year. \u2047 Hungry-Man has responded very well to recent innovations. \u2047 We're extending its new Double Meat platform with this Double Chicken Bowl, which is sure to satisfy any big, bold appetite. \u2047 Our broad snacks portfolio also provides us with plenty of opportunities to innovate. \u2047 And here is just a sample of our fiscal '22 slate. \u2047 Among the products on deck, household favorite Duncan Hines will soon be offering additional EPIC kits with versions of classic cookie mixes that combine many of the brand's delicious ingredients. \u2047 Our highly relevant staples portfolio is also receiving a new slate of innovation as shown on Slide 26. \u2047 Notably, our great P.F. Chang's brand is launching a variety of new restaurant-inspired products. \u2047 Also, as more consumers seek plant-based foods, Gardein continues to expand its portfolio with new offerings, including a new line of plant-based chili. \u2047 Overall, we're confident that the investments we're making in product innovations across our portfolio will produce strong ROIs. \u2047 Ultimately, long-term brand health is dependent on the type of perpetual modernization that we're committed to here at Conagra. \u2047 Before I turn things over to Dave to walk you through the financials, I want to quickly touch on our thoughts around inflation and our updated guidance for fiscal 2022. \u2047 Dave will discuss the cost environment in more detail, but I want to reinforce that we are aggressively pulling on all of our levers to navigate the current inflationary environment. \u2047 We began executing our aggressive response plan in fiscal 2021, given the inflation we were already seeing and talking to you about in Q3. \u2047 The incremental inflation that arose as Q4 unfolded called for additional actions, and you can be assured that we've begun to respond accordingly. \u2047 As I've shared in my remarks, we're also not pulling back from investing in the business. \u2047 We remain squarely focused on long-term value creation. \u2047 But I also know that a more short-term focused question on all of your minds is, will Conagra take list pricing increases? \u2047 And the short answer is yes. \u2047 In fact, we began implementing pricing actions on some of our products in the fourth quarter related to the initial inflation we experienced. \u2047 The very early read on the data from those actions is that our elasticities look good so far, and we have more pricing coming. \u2047 Because our pricing is being implemented strategically and thoughtfully, we're cautiously optimistic that our elasticities will remain strong as our full array of pricing enters the market in fiscal '22. \u2047 This timing mismatch is expected to be particularly impactful in H1 and more"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.54.  \u2047  q4 sales $2.7 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $2.71 billion.  \u2047  2022 organic net sales growth is expected to be approximately flat compared to fiscal 2021.  \u2047  2022 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.50.  \u2047  now expect fiscal 2022 input cost inflation to be materially higher than we anticipated at end of fiscal q3."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.16.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.16.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.16."]}
