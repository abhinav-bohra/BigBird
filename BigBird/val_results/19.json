{"article": ["Last night, we reported results and posted all of the earnings-related materials on our website. \u2047 For the call today, our speakers are Chris Swift, Chairman and CEO of The Hartford; Beth Costello, Chief Financial Officer; and Doug Elliot, President. \u2047 Just a few final comments before Chris begins. \u2047 These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results could be materially different. \u2047 A detailed description of those risks and uncertainties can be found in our SEC filings. \u2047 Our commentary today include non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Explanations and reconciliations of these measures to the comparable GAAP measure are included in our SEC filings as well as the news release and financial supplement. \u2047 Finally, please note that no portion of this conference call may be reproduced or rebroadcast in any form without The Hartford's prior written consent. \u2047 Last quarter, I shared that I had never been more excited about the future of The Hartford. \u2047 Our second quarter results support that optimism. \u2047 All the components of our strategy are coming together to deliver growth, margin expansion and operating efficiencies. \u2047 In the second quarter, we reported core earnings of $836 million or $2.33 per diluted share; 8% growth in year-over-year diluted book value per share, excluding AOCI; and a trailing 12-month core earnings ROE of 13.1%. \u2047 In addition, we returned $694 million to shareholders in the quarter from share repurchases and common dividends. \u2047 The outstanding financial performance of The Hartford reflects strong execution and success of our strategy to focus on high-return businesses where we have market leadership and sustainable competitive advantages. \u2047 Economic growth, as measured by GDP, reached a record level in the second quarter. \u2047 And while moderation is expected, the overall trend will remain elevated through 2021. \u2047 This economic expansion will grow the premium base of our employment-centric businesses and other lines as they benefit from job creation and new business formations. \u2047 Meanwhile, we are closely monitoring the recent elevated inflation data and remain confident that our loss ratio assumptions are sufficient against this backdrop in 2021. \u2047 At the same time, we are considering pricing actions as we gauge inflation trends going forward. \u2047 Finally, our investment portfolio is well diversified and positioned for the evolving macroeconomic environment. \u2047 As we enter the second half of '21, while watching developments with COVID-19 and inflation, I am very confident that The Hartford franchise has never been better positioned to continue to generate industry-leading returns and enhance value for all our stakeholders. \u2047 Let me now make some high-level comments about the results within the business. \u2047 In Property & Casualty, improved results were driven by higher investment income and a very strong contribution from Commercial Lines with double-digit top line growth, underlying margin expansion and reduced COVID impact. \u2047 For nearly 40 years, we have been a leader in the small commercial market and have consistently generated highly profitable margins. \u2047 Results continue to be exceptional. \u2047 Our differentiated products and digital capabilities are driving a superior customer experience, which contribute to higher written premium levels as we capture more profitable market share. \u2047 For the second consecutive quarter, our next-gen Spectrum, new sales reached record levels. \u2047 In Middle & Large Commercial, our team has done a tremendous job improving margins while growing the top line, as demonstrated by new sales and written premium levels. \u2047 As the country invests in new infrastructure over the next decade, our specialized verticals are well positioned as a go-to-market for risk products and services. \u2047 In Global Specialty, we are growing in targeted lines that provide very attractive risk-adjusted returns. \u2047 Cross-selling within The Hartford's retail distribution has been very successful, and the feedback from our distribution partners has been exceptional regarding product breadth and teamwork. \u2047 As Doug will discuss further, we expect to exceed our cross-sell targets a year ahead of plan. \u2047 I am extremely pleased with what the team has accomplished in a short period of time since the strategic transaction of Navigators closed. \u2047 The timing was ideal given the growth in this market segment and the robust pricing environment. \u2047 Just two years ago, this business was generating combined ratios above 110%. \u2047 We thoughtfully developed a plan to improve the financial performance and the results are self-evident, and we believe there is more improvement to come. \u2047 We have nearly $2.5 billion of annual premium in Global Specialty, and I am very optimistic about the future as we realize the full potential of the products and capabilities of this business. \u2047 Across Commercial Lines, our technology investments have improved the speed and effectiveness of the underwriting process. \u2047 We continue to further leverage data and analytics to make more informed underwriting decisions and respond to the needs of our distribution partners and our customers. \u2047 Overall, our Commercial Lines businesses are well positioned to compete and win in the marketplace. \u2047 Turning to Personal Lines. \u2047 We are the fifth largest direct writer of personal auto through our partnership with AARP, one of the largest affinity groups in America. \u2047 Over the next decade, this mature market demographic is estimated to grow three times as fast as the rest of the U.S. population. \u2047 To capitalize on this growing segment, we are modernizing our products in both home and auto and further enhancing our already strong digital capabilities. \u2047 This transformation provides greater ability to grow in the 50-plus demographic that has become more reliant on digital technologies in the way they live and work. \u2047 Before turning to Group Benefits, I would like to briefly comment on the bankruptcy of the Boy Scouts. \u2047 Earlier this month, the Boy Scouts filed an amended plan, which included a request to be released from its settlement agreement with The Hartford. \u2047 We are vigorously contesting this request and have filed strong opposition with the bankruptcy court. \u2047 That said and consistent with our policy regarding active litigation, I am not going to comment further on this matter. \u2047 Turning to Group Benefits. \u2047 We posted solid results for the quarter, driven by excellent investment returns as well as continued favorable disability trends, offset by elevated excess mortality. \u2047 Higher year-over-year earned premiums, excluding buyouts, reflect expanding payrolls as well as new sales and strong persistency. \u2047 The group life industry has been impacted by excess mortality over the past five quarters. \u2047 During the second quarter, our excess mortality losses have dropped significantly versus the first quarter. \u2047 U.S. COVID-19 deaths have declined rapidly since peaking in January, but continue to drive elevated mortality in our book of business and across the industry. \u2047 Consistent with U.S. trends, the average age of our COVID-19 life claimant has decreased. \u2047 Since younger age cohorts tend to carry higher face amounts, the average claim severity has increased relative to earlier periods in the pandemic. \u2047 We are optimistic about the efficacy of vaccines. \u2047 However, we are closely monitoring variant strains and the slowing rate of vaccinations, particularly among the younger age cohorts. \u2047 That said, we do expect lower excess mortality in the second half of '21 compared to the first half of this year. \u2047 We are a top three carrier in the group benefits industry with strong market share, a diverse product portfolio and capabilities across customer segments from small business to national accounts. \u2047 We continue to invest in our technology platform to extend our service offerings, including digital access for employers and employees to improve the overall customer experience. \u2047 The workplace remains an important access point for many people to obtain desired protection products, and we see that relationship growing stronger in the years ahead. \u2047 In addition, the pandemic created new focus on the products and services we provide. \u2047 We are confident that our innovative mindset positions us well to maintain our competitive advantages and grow in Group Benefits. \u2047 To conclude, we are executing with confidence and precision. \u2047 Our top line is benefiting from strong macroeconomic tailwinds. \u2047 Margins are expanding with a positive renewal rate environment, and excess mortality losses are expected to decline. \u2047 With enhanced underwriting capabilities, broad product offerings and strong distribution partnerships, we are positioned to grow and capture more profitable market share. \u2047 Last quarter, we shared our target of a core earnings ROE of 13% to 14% in 2022 and into 2023 driven by top line growth across the businesses, margin improvement with strong earned pricing trends in excess of loss costs, operating efficiencies and proactive and prudent capital management. \u2047 I am optimistic and confident we will continue to deliver on our financial objectives and enhance value for all stakeholders. \u2047 Overall, we are very pleased with the results for the quarter and our progress on our priorities to enhance value creation for shareholders. \u2047 Second quarter core earnings were $836 million or $2.33 per diluted share and up 91% from last year. \u2047 We had strong performance across all our businesses, excellent investment results and significantly lower COVID losses as compared to the prior year period. \u2047 In P&C, the combined ratio of 88.5 improved 8.4 points from the second quarter of 2020, including improvements in both the loss and expense ratios. \u2047 The expense ratio in the quarter improved by 220 basis points to 31%, reflecting earned premium growth as well as cost savings from Hartford Next and a lower provision for doubtful accounts. \u2047 In Commercial Lines, we produced an excellent underlying combined ratio of 89.4, which included ex COVID loss ratio improvement in Middle & Large Commercial and in Global Specialty and expense ratio improvement across all businesses. \u2047 Results in Commercial Lines also improved year-over-year due to lower direct COVID losses of $3 million compared to $213 million or 9.9 points in second quarter 2020. \u2047 Written premium was up 15% with growth in all lines of business, including the effect of higher audit and endorsement premiums reflecting the economic rebound. \u2047 Personal Lines generated an underwriting gain of $96 million and an underlying combined ratio of 88.2%. \u2047 Results were down from second quarter 2020 as last year benefited from significantly lower auto frequency due to the pandemic. \u2047 Across Property & Casualty, catastrophes were $128 million in the quarter, $120 million lower than second quarter 2020, which included $110 million for civil unrest. \u2047 P&C prior accident year reserve development within core earnings was a net favorable $188 million, including an $82 million reduction in catastrophe reserves as well as decreases in workers' compensation, personal auto liability, package business and bond. \u2047 This compared to $322 million of net favorable reserve development in second quarter 2020, which included a $400 million decrease in catastrophe reserves, including the subrogation benefit from PG&E. \u2047 In second quarter 2021, we ceded an additional $39 million of unfavorable Navigators reserve development to the adverse development cover primarily related to U.S. financial lines. \u2047 Although these losses are economically ceded, the reserve development resulted in a deferred gain, representing a charge against net income in the quarter. \u2047 Group Benefits core earnings were $149 million, up 46% over prior year. \u2047 Earnings for the quarter reflect strong investment results, the lessening effect of excess mortality related to COVID-19 and an increase in fully insured ongoing premium as our customers emerge from the pandemic. \u2047 Sales were nearly $100 million in the quarter, and we experienced a continuation of strong persistency at 91.1%. \u2047 All-cause excess mortality in the quarter was $25 million, which includes $88 million for second quarter death dates, offset by $63 million of favorable development for prior period excess mortality estimates, predominantly related to the first quarter. \u2047 Through the first six months of the year, our results include excess mortality of $210 million. \u2047 As Chris mentioned, although we were encouraged by the trend of declining excess mortality from first quarter to second quarter, we continue to watch a variety of factors, including vaccination rates and the impact of variants. \u2047 While uncertainty remains, we would expect excess mortality trends in the second half of 2021 to improve significantly. \u2047 Disability loss trend for the quarter remained favorable, though up slightly from the prior year quarter. \u2047 The disability loss ratio for the quarter was 64.2%, up 1.6 points as the prior year benefited from favorable short-term disability claim frequency due to the deferral of elective medical procedures at the beginning of the pandemic. \u2047 Long-term disability claim incidence was favorable to prior year. \u2047 And claim recoveries, although down from the prior year, remain strong. \u2047 At Hartford Funds, core earnings for the quarter were $51 million compared with $33 million for the prior year period, reflecting the impact of daily average AUM increasing 36%. \u2047 Mutual Fund net flows were very strong at $2.4 billion of net inflows for the quarter. \u2047 The Corporate core loss was higher at $52 million in second quarter 2021 compared to a loss of $6 million in the prior year quarter due to income from our investment in Talcott in the second quarter of 2020 of $68 million before tax. \u2047 On June 30, 2021, we received $217 million from the sale of our ownership interest in Talcott, resulting in a realized capital gain of $46 million before tax in the quarter. \u2047 As a reminder, within core earnings, the Corporate category primarily includes interest expense on debt and investment management fees and expenses related to managing third-party business, including management of the invested assets of Talcott. \u2047 Net investment income was $581 million for the quarter, up 71% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from very strong annualized limited partnership return of 33%, driven by higher valuations and sales of underlying investments within private equity funds. \u2047 The total annualized portfolio yield, excluding limited partnerships, was 3.1% before tax compared to 3.4% in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 The portfolio credit quality remains strong with no credit losses on fixed maturities in the quarter and a $10 million gain from the partial reduction of the valuation allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans due to improved economic scenarios. \u2047 Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities before tax were $2.8 billion at June 30, up from $2.3 billion at March 31 due to lower interest rates and tighter credit spreads. \u2047 Improving operating efficiencies and a lower expense ratio from Hartford Next have been a contributor to margin expansion. \u2047 The program delivered $195 million in pre-tax expense savings in the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to the six-months period in 2019. \u2047 We continue to expect full year pre-tax savings of approximately $540 million in 2022 and $625 million in 2023. \u2047 Book value per diluted share, excluding AOCI, rose 8% since June 30, 2020, to $49.01. \u2047 And our trailing 12-month core earnings ROE was 13.1%. \u2047 During the quarter, The Hartford returned $694 million to shareholders, including $568 million of share repurchases and $126 million in common dividends paid. \u2047 For the 6-month period, we returned $933 million with $691 million of share repurchases and $242"], "gold_summary": ["continue to expect full year pre-tax savings of approximately $540 million in 2022 and $625 million in 2023."], "pred_summary": ["qtrly core earnings per share $2.33.  \u2047
