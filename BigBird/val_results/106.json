{"article": ["They will be joined by Scott Oaksmith, Senior Vice President, Real Estate & Finance. \u2047 We appreciate you taking the time to join us and hope you are all well. \u2047 This week we lost a leader who had a major impact on our industry and on the lives of many who call the travel industry their home. \u2047 On behalf of all of us at Choice Hotels, I'd like to express our deepest condolences to Arne Sorenson's family and to the many people across our industry who are inspired by his personal and professional leadership. \u2047 We will all miss him. \u2047 As we look back, 2020 was a year unlike any other, a year that challenged leaders and companies around the globe and Choice Hotels was no exception. \u2047 But it was the collective response, dedication and resilience of our franchise owners, their hotel staff and Choice associates that made all the difference for our Company and franchise system. \u2047 During a year of significant challenges brought upon the industry by the pandemic, Choice Hotels achieved a number of key milestones that demonstrate our long-term strategy of growing our presence in more revenue-intense segments and locations is working. \u2047 2020 was the year that our flagship Comfort brand returned to unit growth after its successful transformation, increasing its domestic system size by 2%. \u2047 As we celebrate Comfort's 40th anniversary this year, the success of the brand is proof positive that we invest for the long term. \u2047 And as you can see by both unit growth and impressive RevPAR performance, those investments are paying off and position the brand for growth into the future. \u2047 2020 was also the year our extended stay segment rapidly expanded by 44 units to nearly 450 domestic hotels and the domestic pipeline for that segment alone reached over 315 hotels. \u2047 The segment now represents nearly 8% of our total domestic portfolio and strong developer interest reaffirms that our strategic commitment and continued investments in this highly cycle-resilient segment are driving a competitive advantage. \u2047 And finally, 2020 was a year of continued growth for our upscale portfolio, highlighted by an 8% growth of Cambria Hotels. \u2047 The brand now has a pipeline of nearly 80 hotels and is expected to accelerate its unit growth in 2021. \u2047 Consumer confidence in our upscale products drove the brand's outperformance versus their local competitors and is a proof point to current and prospective owners of Choice Hotels' value proposition in the upscale segment. \u2047 The results we achieved confirm our strategic focus to grow in these segments, which will further fuel the long-term revenue intensity of our system. \u2047 I'm also pleased to report that we have continued to drive RevPAR results that significantly outperformed the industry in the fourth quarter and 2020 as a whole. \u2047 Our domestic, systemwide year-over-year RevPAR change surpassed the industry by nearly 17 percentage points for the full year, declining 30.7% from 2019. \u2047 Since the onset of the pandemic in mid-March, our performance has achieved sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement with our fourth quarter domestic systemwide RevPAR declining 25.1% from the same quarter of 2019. \u2047 Our results continued to outpace the overall industry and our chain scales segments. \u2047 In fact our outperformance expanded in the fourth quarter. \u2047 In 2020 Choice Hotels grew RevPAR faster than our local competitors, increasing RevPAR index by over 5 percentage points through notable lifts in weekday and weekend RevPAR index. \u2047 Our RevPAR index growth strengthened in the fourth quarter of 2020 and continued to improve through year-end. \u2047 Throughout 2020 we also continued to grow our effective royalty rate, a reflection of the improving value proposition we deliver to our franchise owners. \u2047 Our success is highlighted by Choice Hotels' key differentiators, including the strength of our proven and well-distributed brands, our customer profile and the continued resilience of leisure travel demand, our powerful reservations delivery system and loyalty program and our franchise-focused business model. \u2047 These four attributes, along with our relative outperformance versus the industry, reaffirmed our confidence in our strategy. \u2047 Therefore, in the fourth quarter we decided to accelerate certain strategic investments in our product portfolio and value proposition capabilities to position the Company for continued success in the future. \u2047 Consumer and developer demand for our products encouraged us to invest in new prototype development and brand initiatives in our key strategic segments. \u2047 We also advanced our pricing optimization and merchandising capabilities to further enable our owners to reach their target customers and effectively drive top line revenue to their hotels. \u2047 Turning to 2021, we expect our momentum to continue into the first quarter, allowing Choice Hotels to further outperform the industry in the current environment. \u2047 We recognize that a high degree of uncertainty remains and our Company, like the hotel industry overall, continues to be significantly affected by the pandemic. \u2047 Nevertheless, we are observing positive signs that give us confidence for 2021 and beyond. \u2047 First, given the vaccine rollout we believe consumers are beginning to feel more optimistic about future travel prospects. \u2047 In fact, we've observed that our customers are beginning to plan their travel further in advance as noted by improvements in our 31-day-plus bookings since November. \u2047 Furthermore, we expect the trend of American vacationing domestically and taking road trips will continue. \u2047 Second stimulus checks from the December federal relief package, the prospect of additional government aid this year and high household savings point to a continued recovery for our small business owners and middle class consumers, our core customers. \u2047 Finally, and as discussed on our last call, we believe that long-term consumer trends such as remote work and virtual learning will likely continue to provide Americans flexibility in where and when they travel for leisure. \u2047 We feel confident that our core strengths, combined with the tactics we deployed in response to the pandemic, have positioned us well to continue to capture and increase our share of travel demand over the long term. \u2047 Our long-term strategy of growing the right brands in the right segments in the right locations, while enhancing our distribution capabilities, continues to pay off. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we generated significant quarter-over-quarter growth in our proprietary revenue contribution mix which drove our full-year results to match our prior year's strong performance. \u2047 More specifically, our website contribution increased by 150 basis points, ending the year with the three strongest months in 2020 while our loyalty program increased its contribution by 280 basis points quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 In addition, we continued to benefit from our most loyal customers Choice Privileges Diamond Elite members who contributed an even higher percentage of overall revenue for full year 2020 as compared to the prior year. \u2047 These results have helped drive RevPAR index share gains of over 600 basis points in the fourth quarter versus our local competitors, up significantly across all location types as reported by STR. \u2047 In the past 46 consecutive weeks through mid-February, we've observed significant RevPAR share gains against the competition, giving us further optimism about our future revenue trajectory. \u2047 I'll now provide a brief update on our key brand segments. \u2047 Our mid-scale brands represent two-thirds of our domestic portfolio, nearly half of the franchise agreements executed last year and over half of the total domestic pipeline. \u2047 All of our select service mid-scale brands achieved year-over-year RevPAR index gains driven by occupancy and average daily rate index gains versus their local competitors through the fourth quarter and full year. \u2047 We're especially pleased with the performance of our Comfort portfolio where our efforts to transform the brand have led to RevPAR index gains versus its local competitors of nearly 9 percentage points and a RevPAR change that was over 10 percentage points more favorable than the upper mid-scale chain scale in the fourth quarter. \u2047 At the same time, we continue to add new construction hotels to the Comfort pipeline and attract high quality franchise conversion agreements to the brand that will fuel revenue intense growth in the near term. \u2047 And finally, Clarion Pointe, a relatively new conversion brand extension to our Clarion portfolio, ended the year by opening the doors of its 25th hotel in the US, a fourfold increase of its portfolio since the prior year. \u2047 The brand now has over 50 domestic hotels open or in the pipeline. \u2047 Moving onto our extended stay segment where we nearly quadrupled the size of the portfolio during the last five years. \u2047 Once again, our purpose-built brands tailored for long-term guests outperformed the competition in this cycle-resilient segment. \u2047 Our WoodSpring Suites brand achieved an average occupancy rate of 72% for full year 2020 and experienced year-over-year RevPAR growth of 2% in the month of December, a truly remarkable achievement given the current environment. \u2047 The brand's pipeline continues to expand and reached 150 domestic hotels at the end of 2020. \u2047 At the same time our Suburban extended stay brand experienced year-over-year occupancy gains in the fourth quarter and an over 40% increase in franchise agreements activity for the full year. \u2047 Our MainStay Suites mid-scale extended stay brand captured more than 20 percentage points in RevPAR index gains versus its local competitors both in the fourth quarter and full year and developer interest is growing. \u2047 Most recently we signed and on-boarded the largest multi-unit transaction in MainStay's history, 15 units which significantly increased the brand's presence in the segment. \u2047 Last year alone, the brand's portfolio expanded to 90 domestic hotels open and over 20% increase year-over-year and its pipeline has swelled to more than 140 domestic properties. \u2047 For full year 2020 Choice Hotels awarded nearly 110 extended stay franchise agreements, validating our strategic focus on this segment for both new construction and conversion opportunities. \u2047 Given these results, we remain optimistic about the growth potential of our extended stay portfolio. \u2047 I'd now like to turn to our upscale portfolio whose choicehotels.com contribution increased by nearly 500 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter and marked the strongest quarterly revenue share in 2020. \u2047 Our upscale Cambria Hotels brand continues its ongoing momentum, growing its portfolio size by 8% and its pipeline to nearly 80 domestic hotels, 19 of which were already under construction at year-end. \u2047 Developer interest in the brand remains high with 16 franchise agreements executed for the full year, including one-third of those awarded in the fourth quarter. \u2047 The Ascend Hotel Collection continues to lead the industry as the first and largest soft brand. \u2047 With nearly 300 hotels open around the globe Ascend Hotels outperformed the upscale segment in year-over-year fourth quarter RevPAR change by over 20 percentage points. \u2047 The brand also achieved RevPAR index gains of nearly 13 percentage points against its local competitors for the full year, further enhancing the brand's attractiveness to developers looking for a smart conversion opportunity. \u2047 Choice Hotels brands remain in demand despite the challenging environment aided by our strong value proposition and continued outperformance. \u2047 Developers continue to choose our brands as they seek to improve their operations and boost the long-term value of their hotels. \u2047 For full year 2020 we awarded 427 new domestic franchise agreements of which over 70% were for conversion hotels. \u2047 Demand continued to accelerate throughout the year with over one quarter of the total agreements executed in the month of December. \u2047 In the fourth quarter alone, we executed 195 domestic agreements, of which over 70% were for conversions. \u2047 Additionally, our developers remain optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of lodging industry. \u2047 In fact, nearly 30% of total domestic franchise agreements we awarded in 2020 were for new construction contracts. \u2047 Our emerging markets development team, which is dedicated to driving diverse ownership of Choice franchised hotels among underrepresented minority owners awarded two dozen franchise contracts in 2020 including the largest minority owned multi-unit franchise agreement in the program's history. \u2047 These results and critical initiatives are major drivers for our optimism in the years ahead. \u2047 We're also committed to enhancing our value proposition by growing our platform business. \u2047 We recently announced the further expansion of our attractive upscale platform with the addition of 22 Penn National Gaming casino resort properties, representing nearly 7,000 rooms joining our Ascend Hotel Collection. \u2047 This strategic agreement will offer more than 47 million Choice Privileges members the opportunity to earn and redeem points at these Penn properties by booking their stay directly on choicehotels.com. \u2047 Our focus remains centered on franchisee profitability through reducing the cost of ownership at the hotel level and driving top line outperformance versus competitors. \u2047 Our franchisees are at the core of everything we do and we are committed to helping them along the road to economic recovery. \u2047 Throughout 2020 we conducted 49,000 individual consultations with hotel owners and operators that helped our franchisees remain open and continue serving guests. \u2047 We've also rolled out offerings like grab-and-go breakfast, housekeeping on-demand and contactless check in that further lowered franchisees' total cost of ownership, while ensuring appropriate safety precautions for our owners, hotel staff and guests. \u2047 We are particularly pleased that legislation we advocated for became law in December, providing additional relief and stimulus to small businesses like our franchisees. \u2047 Specifically, we supported the establishment of a second draw loan program for existing Paycheck Protection Program borrowers that were hit hard by the pandemic, the extension and improvement of the program itself and increased flexibility for lenders. \u2047 We will continue to advocate with the new Congress and administration for additional relief measures aimed at assisting small businesses and providing targeted help for the travel industry. \u2047 In closing, I'm confident that these trying times have made us even more resilient and agile as a company. \u2047 Looking beyond the crisis, I am convinced we will emerge even stronger over the long term. \u2047 Our long-term view, resilient business model, proven brands and strong balance sheet will help us to further capitalize on growth opportunities in 2021 and beyond. \u2047 With that, I'll hand it over to our CFO. \u2047 I hope that you and your families are all well and healthy. \u2047 Today, I'd like to provide additional color around our fourth quarter and full year results and share updates regarding our balance sheet, liquidity and approach to capital allocation. \u2047 I'll close with our thoughts on the outlook for the road ahead. \u2047 Taking a closer look at our results, for full year 2020 total revenues, excluding marketing and reservation system fees, were $371.5 million, $88 million of which was generated in the fourth quarter and adjusted EBITDA totaled $241.1 million, $54.7 million of which was generated in the fourth quarter. \u2047 And our adjusted EBITDA margin for full year 2020 was 65%. \u2047 As a result, our adjusted earnings per share were $2.22 and $0.51 for full year 2020 and the fourth quarter respectively. \u2047 Let me now dive into our three key revenue levers, beginning with RevPAR. \u2047 Our domestic systemwide RevPAR outperformed the overall industry by nearly 17 percentage points for the full year, declining 30.7% from the prior year. \u2047 Our fourth quarter 2020 domestic systemwide RevPAR surpassed the industry by nearly 26 percentage points, declining 25.1% from the same period of the prior year and improved by 370 basis"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.51.
