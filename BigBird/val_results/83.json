{"article": ["I am Alexandra Deignan, the company's Head of Investor Relations. \u2047 Today's discussion also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are meaningful when evaluating the company's performance. \u2047 Hosting our call today are Kenneth Jacobs, Lazard's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Evan Russo, Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Today, Lazard reported strong results for the fourth quarter and full year 2020. \u2047 We achieved record quarterly operating revenue. \u2047 Financial Advisory had a record quarter with strong performance across practices and regions. \u2047 Asset Management's fourth quarter revenue increased 12% and achieved a record year end level of AUM. \u2047 We entered 2021 with significant momentum as we serve clients positioning themselves for a post pandemic recovery. \u2047 In Financial Advisory, our M&A activity progressed throughout 2020. \u2047 Our global announcement volume increased 3% even as the markets volume declined 10%. \u2047 This reflected strong activity in both the US and Europe. \u2047 In particular, our volume of French and UK announcements increased 34% and 37% respectively from the prior year. \u2047 Our preeminent global restructuring practice continued its work on a wide range of complex assignments. \u2047 In 2020, Lazard ranked number one in the league tables for completed restructurings globally. \u2047 As we anticipated, the pace of new restructuring assignments in Europe increased. \u2047 Our sovereign capital and private capital advisory businesses all had strong years as we advise governments, corporations and partnerships on financing strategy and capital raising. \u2047 Our private equity secondary business continues to grow and we are advising on a significant number of growth equity investments globally. \u2047 We continue to see opportunities for growth in Financial Advisory and have increased our pace of lateral hiring. \u2047 In 2020, we recruited 12 new Managing Directors globally, plus two more in January of this year. \u2047 In addition, we are promoting 15 new Managing Directors in Financial Advisory this month. \u2047 10 of them began their careers here as analysts or associates. \u2047 Our ability to develop talent organically remains a powerful competitive strength. \u2047 Our Asset Management business also had a strong fourth quarter, with higher management and incentive fees, reflecting AUM growth and the performance of our strategies. \u2047 On assets under -- our assets under management increased by $31 billion or 14% from the start to the finish of the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our investments in new strategies and product extensions continue to create new avenues for growth. \u2047 Our quantitative business achieved net inflows for both the fourth quarter and full year as did our global equities and our global and multiregional fixed income platforms. \u2047 We are also seeing an increase in solutions oriented mandates as we serve more clients with customized strategies. \u2047 We continue to invest in Asset Management's growth through investment in people, technology and distribution as well as the development of new funds and the scaling up of existing platforms. \u2047 In 2020, we introduced eight new strategies for clients across our traditional and alternative platforms. \u2047 Three of the strategies are from independent teams we recently recruited. \u2047 As the asset management industry undergoes a wave of consolidation, we see substantial opportunities to accelerate our recruitment of talent and investment teams, adding strategies that are complementary to our existing platforms. \u2047 We also continue to build our talent pool from within. \u2047 This year, Asset Management will name seven new Managing Directors in its annual promotion process. \u2047 Firm wide, Lazard's results -- record results for the quarter underscore the strength of our diversified business model, our global platform and our deep culture of client service. \u2047 We entered 2021 with momentum across our businesses. \u2047 We see substantial opportunities for growth in both Financial Advisory and Asset Management and are investing to capitalize on them. \u2047 Evan will now provide some color on our results and then I will comment on our outlook. \u2047 Lazard's full year and fourth quarter results reflect the stability and continued high performance of our businesses. \u2047 Our fourth quarter operating revenue of $849 million was a record quarter for the firm, 20% higher than last year's period. \u2047 Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.66 increased 82%, reflecting the significant operating leverage in our model. \u2047 Annual revenue of $2.5 billion was about even with 2019, representing a strong recovery from the volatile environment of 2020. \u2047 Our Financial Advisory business had a breakout fourth quarter, with record quarterly revenue of $509 million, which is 23% higher than our previous peak level in 2018. \u2047 The compelling story behind Financial Advisory's record quarter is that it was driven by strong contributions across our advisory practices and across regions. \u2047 Our revenue performance demonstrates the earnings power of the diversified advisory business we have built. \u2047 In Asset Management, this story was similar as we generated $336 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, up 12% from the prior year. \u2047 This reflected contributions across our global platforms with accelerating momentum in a year of extreme volatility. \u2047 Fourth quarter management and other fees increased 10% sequentially from the third quarter, reflecting higher average AUM. \u2047 Fourth quarter incentive fees were up substantially from the prior year, primarily reflecting strong performance in our alternative strategies. \u2047 Average AUM for the fourth quarter was $246 billion, up 3% from last year's period and up 9% from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 The sequential increase was driven by market appreciation of $25.4 billion and foreign exchange appreciation of $5.8 billion, partially offset by net outflows of $0.3 billion. \u2047 For the full year, we experienced net outflows of $11.4 billion, primarily in our value strategies within emerging markets and local equities. \u2047 Platforms with net inflows for the year included global and quantitative equities as well as our global and multiregional fixed income strategies. \u2047 We finished 2020 with AUM of $259 billion. \u2047 And as of January 28, AUM was approximately $258 billion. \u2047 The decrease was driven by foreign exchange depreciation of $1.3 billion and net outflows of $1 billion, partially offset by market appreciation of $1.3 billion. \u2047 Looking ahead across our franchise, in Financial Advisory, client activity is strong across our advisory practices globally in an improving environment. \u2047 Asset Management is off to a good start in 2021 with AUM well above its average level for 2020. \u2047 We have a strong pipeline of unfunded mandates. \u2047 We continue to see demand for both our quantitative and fundamental strategies across our platforms as well as growing demand for our sustainable and customized solutions. \u2047 Turning to expenses, our compensation ratio for 2020 on an adjusted basis was 59.5%, up from 57.5% in 2019. \u2047 On an awarded basis, our annual compensation ratio was 59.8% compared to 57.7% for 2019. \u2047 The increase reflected our investments for growth as well as the change in business mix this year. \u2047 We are maintaining our cost discipline while we navigate a volatile market environment. \u2047 Non-compensation expense of $117 million in the fourth quarter was 10% lower than the same period last year, primarily reflecting a continuation of global travel restrictions and lower business development costs. \u2047 Our adjusted non-compensation ratio for the fourth quarter was 13.7% and the ratio for the full year was 17.1%. \u2047 As business activity picked up in the fourth quarter, we saw commensurate rise in non-compensation costs especially related to variable expenses. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for 2020 was 20.2% compared to 24.1% a year ago. \u2047 For 2021, we expect an annual effective tax rate in the low to mid 20% range. \u2047 Regarding capital allocation, our business continues to generate significant free cash flow, which supports our goal of returning excess capital to shareholders. \u2047 Throughout the year, we have been consistent in returning capital through our quarterly common dividend. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we returned $51 million of capital to shareholders. \u2047 Yesterday, we declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.47 per share. \u2047 In 2021, we have resumed our share repurchase program in order to at a minimum, offset dilution from our year end equity grants. \u2047 Our total outstanding repurchase authorization is now $267 million. \u2047 Lazard's financial position remains strong with ample liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. \u2047 As of December 31, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.4 billion. \u2047 Ken will now conclude our remarks. \u2047 A few words on our outlook before we open the call to questions. \u2047 In the near-term, the macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain based on the ongoing health crisis. \u2047 However, fiscal and monetary stimulus in developed countries and the rollout of vaccines globally are driving expectations of a recovery by the second half of this year. \u2047 Both of our businesses are already benefiting from growing optimism in boardrooms and investment committees. \u2047 In Financial Advisory, the forces driving global strategic activity have accelerated. \u2047 Technology-driven disruption continues to be a catalyst for M&A across industries. \u2047 Shareholder activism has resumed its growth after a brief pause during the first half of 2020 with increasing impact in Europe. \u2047 The rapid growth of SPACs alongside strategic and private capital, adds substantial dry powder to the M&A market. \u2047 In addition, climate risk is becoming increasingly relevant to company valuations and is an emerging catalyst for strategic activity. \u2047 Our ESG expertise is well entrenched in our Asset Management business and increasingly in our Financial Advisory business as well. \u2047 In Asset Management, the expectation of low interest rates for the foreseeable future is a tailwind for our business. \u2047 Investors need for income and return is driving increased demand for risk assets, including equities and corporate and emerging market debt as well as alternative investments. \u2047 In addition, institutional investors are seeking sources of differentiated alpha, including ESG, thematic and alternative strategies. \u2047 We are in an excellent position to meet this demand with a world class investing franchise in markets that reward deep fundamental research and our quantitative strategies are competing effectively in the market for low-cost products. \u2047 We see substantial opportunities for growth across our businesses and we continue to invest in our people, capability and technology infrastructure to enhance our competitive edge. \u2047 We remain focused on serving all of our clients well, while we manage the firm for profitable growth and shareholder value over the long-term. \u2047 In one of the most challenging environments in modern history, they rose to the occasion serving our clients with outstanding financial advice and solutions and reinforcing this great franchise. \u2047 I am proud to work with them. \u2047 Now, let's open the call to questions. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $1.66.  \u2047  q4 revenue rose 20 percent to $849 million.  \u2047  for q4 of
