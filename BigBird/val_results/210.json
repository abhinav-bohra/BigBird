{"article": ["I hope you are all well and safe. \u2047 Joining me virtually today are Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO; and CFO, Suketu Upadhyay. \u2047 Just given the backdrop of COVID, let me just start by saying that I certainly hope that all of you are doing well and staying safe and continuing to, as much as it's frustrating I'm sure by now, continuing to social distance and wear your masks. \u2047 I think at this point we're all pretty good at it so let's make sure that we continue to do it. \u2047 And as a result of that continue to deliver for our customers and our patients and move with our mission forward. \u2047 And I'll just continue to be very proud of everything this team has accomplished against a significantly challenging backdrop in 2020. \u2047 So I'm proud of you and glad to see what you've been able to do, and I'm looking forward to what you can do in 2021. \u2047 And here we are, right? \u2047 We're in 2021 and there's going to be challenges. \u2047 We've seen already early on in 2021, but I'm confident that we're ready to deal with the challenges as ZB, and I'm pretty confident we're going to see real opportunities for 2021 as well. \u2047 And there's just a lot of updates that I want to share with you today, but I'm going to keep my comments to a minimum, if possible. \u2047 I really want to make sure that we have time for Suketu to get into a little more detail on Q4 and then, ultimately, say how that's going to translate into 2021. \u2047 Now we're not going to give too many specifics on 20201, but he'll give you some color on what we're seeing from Q4 and, again, the impact we think that's going to have on 2021. \u2047 So for today I'm going to kind of keep it to three main topics. \u2047 The first is really how we're continuing to navigate COVID-19 and, to continue inside of that, to ensure that we're executing against our strategy. \u2047 The second one is really going to talk about the ongoing transformation of the company. \u2047 We really are making sure that we're moving forward with active portfolio management, and, obviously, we're taking the next steps there with the planned spin-off of our Spine and Dental business. \u2047 So we'll talk a bit about that. \u2047 And then third, I want to make sure that we again touch upon our long-term growth strategy and how it positions us to drive growth, obviously as a company, but also value for you and value for us. \u2047 And so, let's start again navigating the challenges and executing here in the short-term. \u2047 There's just no doubt that COVID, unfortunately, remains a challenge. \u2047 Coming out of Q4, we're seeing the pandemic pressure and the surges continue and, frankly, worsen across pretty much all of our regions and markets. \u2047 There's clearly more lockdown measures that we're seeing throughout Europe, Middle East and Africa; to a far lesser extent but still impacting Asia-Pacific as well. \u2047 And certainly, in the Americas, we're all seeing it in the U.S. \u2047 It may be different by state, but clearly seeing increased pressure as a result of surges in the pandemic so all of that is kind of the backdrop that we saw coming out of Q4. \u2047 And, unfortunately, this pressure, in the corresponding decline and elective procedures, grew throughout Q4 and actually was worse at the end of December. \u2047 And at this point, we expect that increase in pressure will continue throughout Q1 at least and will impact all three of our regions. \u2047 As a matter of fact, we're actually seeing this probably increase in pressure coming out of Q4. \u2047 So we would expect Q1 to be a little more challenging than even what we saw in Q4. \u2047 But even given that backdrop, I'd say that I'm optimistic. \u2047 We're currently rolling those out around the world. \u2047 We do believe the vaccines are going to change the COVID-19 dynamic, and we're going to see positive impact as a result of it. \u2047 As soon as we start to see the surges stop, we see the impact of COVID end, and we're confident that the recovery's going to mean that the normal patient flow is going to start again and we're going to have the pull-through effect of a sizable patient backlog that's been created over the past number of quarters. \u2047 We expect that when that recovery occurs, we're going to see a period of what I would define as normal market growth augmented by deferred procedures that will be coming in as well. \u2047 And we're going be ready for that, and we're excited about that. \u2047 So as much as it's going to be a little rocky in the short-term and potentially more challenging than what we saw at the fourth quarter, we see a light at the end of the tunnel. \u2047 And that's a good thing. \u2047 The big question is when? \u2047 When is that going to happen? \u2047 We know the vaccine is going to have the impact. \u2047 The big question is when. \u2047 And that's certainly going to be the key variable we're going to be looking at as we try to predict what 2021 is going to look like. \u2047 So while I would just say, against this backdrop of COVID, what is clear to us is we can't control when the vaccines allow the surges to stop, but what we can control inside of that is how we execute; how we execute our strategy. \u2047 And I have confidence we're going to continue to move it forward. \u2047 Our core business is strong. \u2047 Our execution is on point. \u2047 I would just say momentum around our key commercial launches and programs continues to be strong, and I would say that, overall, our commercial confidence is better than it has ever been. \u2047 So I'll just give a few examples of this. \u2047 I can say it all day long, but unless we talk about it and actually it reflects in the numbers, who cares. \u2047 So let's first start with ROSA Knee. \u2047 Obviously, this is something that everyone is going to be paying attention to. \u2047 Certainly, I am, and on note, we said we're going to hit between 200 to 300 cumulative placements by the end of 2020. \u2047 Obviously, you know that we were in that range as of Q3. \u2047 So I'm happy to report that not only did we achieve that goal, we achieved the high-end of that goal. \u2047 And I would tell you that the momentum is strong coming into 2021. \u2047 Q4 was actually our strongest quarter as of the date of launch of ROSA Knee. \u2047 So we've had some pretty strong quarters in the past. \u2047 Q4 was our best, and we're on the high-end of the goal that we set for the year. \u2047 And as I've said before, with some of the new launches that we have coming, specifically associated with[Indecipherable], I feel pretty confident that 2021 is going to continue to show that kind of resilience and strength for ROSA Knee. \u2047 On the percent of revision side, again, this product continues to be very successful for us. \u2047 We now showed that in Q4, we actually had the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth that we've seen since launch. \u2047 We did realize our 2020 expectations of $100 million in gross revenue and almost $40 million in net of cannibalization revenue during the year. \u2047 And I would just tell you that that's just the beginning because Persona Revision serves as a really compelling tip of the spear product for our commercial team. \u2047 Once we get Persona Revision in, we've got an opportunity to hunt for the typical primary knee as well. \u2047 So we're very excited about that launch and it continues to be strong. \u2047 On the hip side, Avenir Complete continues to be a strong one for us. \u2047 Even in the pandemic, it continues to beat our expectations. \u2047 And if I just look at Q4 specifically, we grew about 30% over Q3, again, even with the increased pressures of the pandemic in Q4, so very excited with what we're able to do with Avenir Complete. \u2047 And we expect big things to continue with this product throughout 2021. \u2047 And as you obviously know, we also expect at the end of 2021 to launch the ROSA Hip, which again gives us a lot of confidence in the Hip category for our business. \u2047 And then finally for Signature ONE Planner, we demonstrated this again, strong sequential growth with registrations up nearly 25% in Q4 over Q3. \u2047 And we expect utilization to continue to expand significantly in 2021 with really a goal of having more than 50% of our shoulder procedures using pre-surgical planning. \u2047 And that's important for a lot of reasons. \u2047 Remember the pre-surgical plan creates stickiness with the customer, but it also enhances our ability to get more guides and augments using the procedure, which can really take-up the ASP for that procedure. \u2047 So again, exciting stuff for Signature ONE Planner as well. \u2047 So all-in we continue to execute -- we continue to execute as a team. \u2047 The way we're showing up every day, the way we're showing up in the market frankly versus our peers gives me confidence in our business as does our continued innovation and our product launches. \u2047 We're going to see more this year, some pretty pivotal innovation that we're going to see this year. \u2047 As I mentioned before we're going to see ROSA Partial Knee, we're going to see ROSA Hip and we're also going to see the first smart implant, Persona-IQ, launched this year so definitely exciting for us from an innovation standpoint in 2021. \u2047 We continue the transformation of ZB. \u2047 That's been the goal since I got here. \u2047 You've heard me talk about our three phases of transformation. \u2047 First was the hearts and minds and the execution challenges that we had in the very beginning. \u2047 It's what we talked about a lot in the beginning. \u2047 The second phase of this was really building a more robust longer-term strategy, making sure that we brought innovation to the market and getting our execution straight. \u2047 We're clearly well into that phase. \u2047 And third is our portfolio transformation, and that's the goal of active portfolio management to change the complexion of the organization so that we can have better goal of sustained mid-single-digit growth. \u2047 And I'm proud to say that we're squarely positioned in Phase III now as well. \u2047 And as you've seen by our recent announcement, we're going to continue to move this forward. \u2047 We have the portfolio management strategy and the process in place and to have built a pretty strong capability to move us forward in this area. \u2047 Late last year, we executed a number of smaller, but still important, M&A deals to fill portfolio gaps and to better position us in higher-growth areas that we do believe we have a right to win in. \u2047 I truly believe by separating out these businesses, we're going to create two stronger companies, two companies that are going to be better positioned to meet customer needs and improve patient lives. \u2047 And ultimately, and very importantly, deliver greater value to you, our shareholders. \u2047 Let me give you a bit more detail on why we believe this is an opportunity for value creation and really why we think it delivers value for ZB and NewCo. \u2047 First of all, the transaction increases our management focus and resource prioritization. \u2047 We truly do believe for both companies, we think about NewCo and we think it's going to thrive as an independent company with prioritized capital allocation to pursue strategies and growth opportunities and truly investments inside of Spine and Dental. \u2047 That has not been a focus for ZB. \u2047 It will absolutely be a focus for NewCo. \u2047 And for Zimmer Biomet, the transaction is an important next step in our transition into a more streamlined company with sharper focus and greater and more optimized resource allocation toward innovation in those core businesses that we are committed to, that are profitable for us, where we see attractive markets with a right to win in those markets and be market leaders. \u2047 And really the second thing is it's going to drive increased growth and efficiency for both companies. \u2047 We really do believe that. \u2047 And simply put, we expect that these two companies with their simplified operating models and just reduced complexity and increased focus will be able to grow revenue, margin and earnings per share faster than they would if we remain combined as one company. \u2047 And Suke's going to talk more about the specific financial impact that we expect in just a few minutes, but just know it's positive for both organizations, financially speaking, as we separate the organizations. \u2047 And third, it's going to enhance value creation for our patients and our providers and all of our key stakeholders including our own team members. \u2047 This is the next step in ZB's transformation, and it underscores our commitment to ensuring long term priorities remain aligned with shareholders' best interest. \u2047 It's going to drive the business forward to meet customer needs and advance our mission to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life of people around the world. \u2047 We think we can do it better as two separate organizations, OK? \u2047 So that's the backdrop of the spin. \u2047 And today obviously is just day one in terms of announcements around this process. \u2047 You can absolutely expect that we're going to continue to provide updates as we move forward, as NewCo takes shape, and as we move toward the transaction close, which we're currently expecting to be around mid-2022, OK? \u2047 So we're confident in these steps we're taking and our ability to keep executing and in our overall ZB strategy, and that brings me really to the third and really the final topic that I have for these remarks. \u2047 And it's our plan to drive long-term growth and ultimately as a result of that deliver increased value for you, and to do that, we remain fully committed and confident in ZB's long-term growth and margin expansion expectations. \u2047 In fact, the spin-off transaction that we're going to do over the next year serves to de-risk if not accelerate our path to that 4% to 5% growth rate that we have talked about and our 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023. \u2047 And to get there, to be able to deliver on both of those, we're going to have to be committed to our priority growth areas. \u2047 And we've talked about these in the past. \u2047 I'm going to remind you of them again. \u2047 The key areas of concentration for us would be Knee, Hips and S.E.T. If we think about Knees first and foremost, we need to be able to"], "gold_summary": ["compname announces q4 adj earnings per share of $2.11.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $2.11.  \u2047  q4 earnings per share $1.59.  \u2047  q4 sales $2.085 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $2.08 billion.  \u2047  not providing financial guidance at this time."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q4 gaap earnings per share $0.16.  \u2047  q4 gaap earnings per share $0.16.  \u2047  q4 gaap earnings per share $0.16.  \u2047  q4 gaap earnings per share $0.16."]}
