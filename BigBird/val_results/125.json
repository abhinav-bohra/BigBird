{"article": ["Total revenue was approximately $1.5 billion, representing a 7.5% decline versus last year, which exceeded our expectation and reflects continued sequential improvement. \u2047 As anticipated, our Aviation segment remains the primary driver behind the revenue decrease. \u2047 On both the GAAP and an adjusted basis, earnings grew by a 160% or more year-over-year. \u2047 GAAP continuing earnings per share grew to a $1.10 per share or $1.01 per share on an adjusted basis. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded more than 400 basis points to 8.3% compared to last year. \u2047 Anchoring these results was elevated demand for higher margin Work Orders for virus protection as well as our EnhancedClean services which are longer term in nature. \u2047 Effective labor management continued to be a lever for profitability. \u2047 As you may remember, the majority of our contracts are performance based, so any efficiencies we find in staffing as occupancy drops or schools are in a hybrid situation[Phonetic] in order to our benefit. \u2047 This is the advantage of having a flexible labor model. \u2047 Earl, will discuss our segments in more detail, but overall, our industry group drivers are similar to what we saw during the balance of last year. \u2047 Not surprisingly our Aviation and Technical Solutions segments were challenged by the pandemic due to decreased global travel and limited site access for retrofit projects and educational facilities. \u2047 Education as the segment though grew top and bottom line during the quarter, which shows how well our team has adapted operationally to the hybrid learning system and Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing are still strong outperformers. \u2047 We've been able to offset COVID related revenue compression with higher margin Work Orders, EnhancedClean contracts and labor management. \u2047 We're now almost at the one-year mark since the start of the pandemic and I've just summarized our fourth consecutive quarter of strong results. \u2047 This sustained performance suggests that we have reached a level of consistency in our results and stabilization across our client portfolio. \u2047 Let me now provide some thoughts on where we believe the operating environment is headed, especially in light of our full year guidance. \u2047 Before I dive into what momentum to normalcy looks like in 2021, I want to underscore that normalcy does not imply less vigilance around virus protection. \u2047 Over the past several months, there have been countless news and scientific journals reminding us that COVID-19 and its after effects will continue to linger over the foreseeable future. \u2047 Many believe it will be a permanent fact of life with people getting regularly vaccinated similar to how we handle flu vaccinations. \u2047 We are so enthusiastic that vaccine rollouts are under way across the country. \u2047 Most importantly, the vaccines will save lives, but the rollouts will also lead to momentum back to work, school, travel and attending entertainment venues. \u2047 However vaccine rollouts have not been uniformed on a state by state basis nor have stayed policies on masking, public gatherings and other factors that impact infections and new cases. \u2047 These factors as well as the ongoing discovery of new variants highlight how societies need to respond to COVID-19 on an elevated level, will not end in the near-term. \u2047 This is why it's so critical for us to partner with our clients and assess their evolving needs and engage our expert advisory panel. \u2047 In B&I, the vaccines will spur momentum back to work, which for us means a return of more traditional janitorial work as well as the continuation of disinfecting given higher occupancy. \u2047 Currently, average occupancy across the country is approximately 15%. \u2047 We anticipate this could increase to 25% by Labor Day and grow to 50% plus through calendar year-end. \u2047 As clients begin to plan their returns, they are focusing on building trust in their facilities through health and safety protocols, rigor around cleaning, disinfecting and especially physical spacing will be incorporated into their plans. \u2047 For this reason, we do not anticipate a near-term reduction space utilization across commercial real estate, especially with Class A buildings and blue-chip clients. \u2047 For a sector like education, we believe the hybrid models will be in effect for at least the rest of the school year. \u2047 Soon, if not already, institutions will start planning for the fall 2021 semester with a push for more in-person learning in the K through 12 segment and higher ed. \u2047 How this unfolds could vary by region. \u2047 We should have a better line of sight when we speak to you after Q2 earnings. \u2047 And I'm sure as vaccine adoption continues to expand, there's probably no sector more poised for a robust volume recovery than Aviation. \u2047 We are definitely hearing about pent-up demand for personal travel and minimally a modest return of business travel. \u2047 For ABM, our business portfolio consists of both airlines and airports. \u2047 As airports were opened during the pandemic, operations in areas like terminal cleaning, transportation and shuttle service enabled us to mitigate reduced volumes on the airline side. \u2047 And ultimately, this diversification helped us breakeven last year, which was a major achievement. \u2047 On the airline side, current travel volumes are approximately 50% of pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Assuming vaccine rollouts gain traction, we believe we could see that grow moderately by year-end. \u2047 As both airlines and airports see increased traffic, the need for disinfection, virus protection and EnhancedClean will grow. \u2047 On an enterprise level, we conducted a Pulse Survey of approximately 200 clients last month that largely aligned to our own full year expectations. \u2047 Most respondents are expecting their facilities to more fully reopen and their companies to be endorsing reoccupancy in varying forms by September and they plan to continue taking multiple measures to protect spaces against COVID-19 as they reopen primarily in the areas of surface and air disinfection. \u2047 And even with the increase in flexible work schedules and work from home protocols, the vast majority of our clients say that they expect the total amount of space utilization to remain largely the same. \u2047 Now, the size of our survey, it's just a subset of our client base, but it supports what we are hearing more broadly as we communicate with our customers on their future plans. \u2047 It also speaks to our confidence in providing full year guidance today. \u2047 For fiscal 2021, we are introducing full year guidance of earnings per diluted share of $2.85 to $3.10 or $3.00 to $3.25 on an adjusted basis. \u2047 Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA margins is 6.6% to 7%, which compares to 6% last year. \u2047 We also expect to return to growth by the second half of this year and consistent demand for high margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services through year-end. \u2047 We also anticipate retaining most of our labor arbitrage through year-end. \u2047 Our success will not translate to complacency. \u2047 Based on how the pandemic has changed our trajectory, we have been capitalizing on our momentum to elevate our brand and business. \u2047 At the end of February, we launched ABM's first national TV commercial. \u2047 It was a celebratory moment for the entire firm and we could not be proud of. \u2047 If you've not seen it on CNBC or Bloomberg TV, you can find it on our IR website today. \u2047 As we discussed last year, we are going to be investing in our clients, team members, and infrastructure. \u2047 We're focused on providing technology and data analytics capabilities to enhance client and team member experiences. \u2047 We are also prioritizing areas like talent development to further empower our people and create even more consequential relationships with our clients. \u2047 We are committed to building upon our strong culture and fostering a community of belonging where team members feel connected, valued, and inspired. \u2047 This reinforces our mission and vision as an organization and will have significant long-term commercial outcomes for us. \u2047 Internal initiatives such as our culture and inclusion council are dedicated to driving meaningful social change and cultivating an inclusive environment for everyone at ABM and we are taking active steps to turn this vision into reality. \u2047 I'm excited to share that we have entered into partnerships with organizations that are focused on building a more equitable society. \u2047 ABM has made a commitment to support the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Funds, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the Afterschool Alliance, and the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. \u2047 We are partnering with these organizations in an effort to make a difference in the areas of advocacy and civil rights, basic human needs, education, and workforce development. \u2047 We were just starting to discuss the coronavirus and its impact on the economy. \u2047 At that time I reiterated how our diversified portfolio coupled with our nimble operating model or hallmarks of our long-term success over the past 110 years. \u2047 Our results over the past 12 months has proven this beyond a doubt and with our solid liquidity and leverage, we are better positioned than ever to pursue growth and profitability that will unlock even greater shareholder value. \u2047 The dedication of the ABM team continues to fuel our performance quarter-after-quarter. \u2047 We have a culture like no other in our industry. \u2047 I'm proud that our results have been the greatest proof point of our resilience, agility and excellence. \u2047 Today marks my 100th day at ABM and my early impressions about the organization's drive to collaborate and execute have only grown. \u2047 As I continue to evaluate and assess our business needs, my main area of focus will be on helping to determine the appropriate enablers for both strategic growth and continuous improvement. \u2047 As I will discuss in more detail shortly, our strong results over the past several quarters coupled with our leadership position in the marketplace provides us with great opportunity to invest in our future growth potential. \u2047 I look forward to finalizing our thoughts on areas such as our internal investment strategy and sharing with all of you over the course of the year. \u2047 Now onto the results. \u2047 Revenue for the quarter was $1.5 billion, a decrease of 7.5% compared to last year. \u2047 The decrease in revenue reflects the continued impact COVID-19 has had across our business segments. \u2047 As a reminder, the pandemic had not yet impacted operations significantly until our second quarter last year and as such this quarter reflects the full year-over-year impact. \u2047 Partially offsetting this revenue decline was the ongoing demand for higher margin disinfection related Work Orders and EnhancedClean services. \u2047 Work Orders were particularly strong within our Business & Industry and Technology & Manufacturing industry groups. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, our income from continuing operations was $74.6 million or $1.10 per diluted share compared to $27.9 million or $0.41 last year. \u2047 In addition to our strong operational performance, the increase versus last year was driven by favorable development in prior year self-insurance adjustments. \u2047 We saw an $11.4 million benefit this year compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. \u2047 Additionally, we saw our second consecutive quarter of current year positive insurance trend recording a benefit of approximately $3 million. \u2047 On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations for the quarter increased to $68.3 million or $1.01 per diluted share compared to $26.2 million or $0.39 last year. \u2047 Our GAAP and adjusted earnings growth versus last year continued to be driven by significant increases in higher margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services. \u2047 As our clients have incorporated health and hygiene services such as disinfection into their operation at higher levels, we continue to experience higher margin as a result of direct labor efficiencies, as our operators proactively manage the deployment of labor commensurate with COVID-19 related revenue decline. \u2047 Additionally, results also reflect one less working day, which amounted to labor expense savings of approximately $6 million. \u2047 Other items such as corporate discretionary expense, amortization, and interest were also lower compared to last year. \u2047 These results were partially offset by our planned infrastructure and organizational investment in areas such as IT. \u2047 However, I want to note that our investment spend for the quarter was approximately $4 million, which was lower than originally anticipated. \u2047 During the quarter, we generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $124 million for a margin rate of 8.3% compared to $68.8 million or 4.3% last year. \u2047 I will now discuss our segment results. \u2047 As I referenced earlier, these results reflect the ongoing impact of COVID-19, which has resulted in revenue compression across our services. \u2047 As Scott discussed, our diversified segment structure has been a strength for us during the pandemic and each segment has been impacted by the pandemic in different ways, both positively and negatively. \u2047 In most cases though with perhaps the exception of Technical Solutions, our segment results reflect some combination of a mix shift toward higher Work Orders and EnhancedClean services. \u2047 Labor modulation on lower service demand as well as operational investments in areas such as EnhancedClean. \u2047 B&I revenue was $809.4 million, which was down just $11.5 million or 1.4% versus last year. \u2047 The parking and sports and entertainment businesses were the predominant drivers of the revenue decline due to the ongoing pandemic. \u2047 Almost entirely offsetting this decline was increased demand for higher margin Work Orders and EnhancedClean services at our national accounts and certain client in corporate sectors such as financial institutions. \u2047 Operating profit for the quarter reflected this more favorable mix of business resulting an $85.7 million or a margin of 10.6% compared to last year's $38.2 million and 4.7% respectively. \u2047 Technology & Manufacturing remains one of our most resilient segments. \u2047 T&M produced solid results for the quarter as it has since the beginning of the pandemic. \u2047 The segment reported revenue of $249.2 million, an increase of 6.5% versus last year with an operating profit of $26.9 million or a margin rate of 10.8%. \u2047 Work orders and EnhancedClean services drove demand for T&M particularly within the industrial manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and high-tech sectors. \u2047 We also experienced growth with our logistic clients as we supported them during the peak holiday season. \u2047 Our Education segment grew revenues of $209.4 million with operating profit of $21.5 million or 10.2% margin. \u2047 We believe these results reflect some stabilization as schools have continued the hybrid learning model that has been in effect since the back half of last year. \u2047 Performance was primarily attributable to direct labor management due to modified staffing levels and other expense savings as well as demand for disinfection and COVID related Work Orders. \u2047 Looking ahead, we anticipate some reinstitution of a traditional selling season in 2021, which did not really exist last year due to the pandemic. \u2047 We continue to monitor how schools are going to evolve their approach to teaching in the current environment particularly as vaccination rollouts progress. \u2047 Aviation reported revenue of approximately $143 million with operating profit of $3."], "gold_summary": ["q1 adjusted earnings per share $1.01 from continuing operations.  \u2047  q1 gaap earnings per share $1.10 from
