{"article": ["We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. \u2047 Mike will focus his comments on Q3 performance as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q4 full year 2021 guidance. \u2047 During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith; and Dr. Ken Stein. \u2047 Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. \u2047 Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively, as well as Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively. \u2047 Divestitures include BTG Spec Pharma, which closed on March 1, 2021, and the global embolic microspheres portfolio and intrauterine health franchise, which were divested in August 2019 and second quarter of 2020 respectively. \u2047 Guidance excludes the recently announced Devoro Medical and Baylis Medical acquisitions, which are expected to close in Q4 '21 and Q1 '22, respectively. \u2047 Finally, growth goals of 6% to 8% ex-COVID represent comparisons between time periods in which results are not materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. \u2047 Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. \u2047 These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. \u2047 I'm proud of our global team's execution despite the various challenges presented by the COVID surge in third quarter. \u2047 The third quarter was impacted by COVID more than we anticipated as the Delta variant surged globally and some electric procedures were deferred. \u2047 While we aren't satisfied with this quarter's sales results, we delivered on our third quarter earnings per share and margin targets. \u2047 And we're confident that as global vaccination rates continue to increase and COVID wanes, we are well positioned to achieve our long-term sales goals. \u2047 We continue to be excited and confident about the opportunities we laid out at our recent Investor Day, further enabled by our strategy of category leadership, entry into higher adjacent growth markets and tuck-in M&A. \u2047 Total company third quarter operational sales grew 10% versus 2020, while organic sales grew 11% versus '20 and 4% versus 2019, just below our guidance of 12% to 14% versus 2020 as Delta impacted procedure volume globally. \u2047 Despite the temporary impact of procedure volumes, we saw strength in new product launches, generated robust clinical evidence and executed broadly across the portfolio. \u2047 Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 grew 10.5% versus 2020 and 4% versus 2019, reaching the high end of our third quarter guidance range of $0.39 to $0.41. \u2047 Adjusted operating margin at 25.6% continues to improve and was in line with our third quarter expectations. \u2047 We continue to be pleased with our cash flow with third quarter free cash flow generation of $360 million and adjusted free cash flow of $525 million. \u2047 We're updating our fourth quarter and our full year guidance ranges for both sales and EPS, which assumes some level of impact to procedures from COVID and staffing shortages. \u2047 Compared to 2020, we target fourth quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 12% to 16% and full year growth of 18% to 19%. \u2047 Compared to 2019, we target fourth quarter '21 organic revenue growth of 4% to 8% and for full year organic revenue growth of 5% to 6% versus 2019. \u2047 Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share estimate is $0.43 to $0.45, and we're updating full year adjusted earnings per share to a revised range of $1.60 to $1.62. \u2047 Dan will provide more details on both sales and earnings per share performance and outlook, including the revenue contribution from our acquisitions this year. \u2047 I'll now provide additional highlights in Q3 '21 results along with comments on our fourth quarter and '21 outlook. \u2047 Within the regions on an operational basis Q3 2020, the US grew 15%; Europe, Mid-East Africa grew 8%, Asia Pac grew 8% and the emerging market sales grew 18%. \u2047 Operationally, despite the impact from Delta, EMEA delivered solid growth in third quarter across the majority of businesses and countries with notable strength in PI, EP and Endo, fueled by new and ongoing product launches like TheraSphere, POLARx and AXIOS. \u2047 We [Technical Issues] performance with strong utilization driving double-digit growth versus both '20 and 2019. \u2047 Asia Pac was impacted by pandemic-related lockdowns in parts of the region, though growth in China remained very strong. \u2047 We're encouraged heading into fourth quarter in 2022 as countries within Asia Pac are reopening as vaccination rates increase and COVID cases decline. \u2047 Although Japan was in a state of emergency throughout third quarter, we were able to advance new product launches, achieving Number 1 share position with our Ranger Drug-Coated Balloon as well as launching POLARx in October. \u2047 China continues to deliver excellent results and sales grew 14% versus 2020. \u2047 We continue to see momentum across the portfolio driven by complex PCI and imaging as well as new product launches like Eluvia and AXIOS. \u2047 Digital tools are also playing a role, enabling virtual physician training and allowing us to expand our reach with differentiated products like IVUS. \u2047 We continue to expect double-digit full year 2021 growth from China versus both 2020 and 2019. \u2047 I'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. \u2047 Urology and Pelvic Health sales grew 7% organically versus 2020. \u2047 And the Lumenis acquisition closed in September, which expands the urology portfolio and stone offering to include the MOSES laser, which is complementary to the LithoVue single-use flexible ureteroscope in our broad portfolio of disposables that support kidney stone removal. \u2047 The prostate health franchise grew double digits with continued strength in our Rezum and SpaceOAR businesses, and we're excited to initiate two trials in this space within the quarter. \u2047 The global SABRE clinical trial, which will examine the effectiveness of SpaceOAR Vue in reducing late toxicity in patients receiving a stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment for prostate cancer; and the VAPEUR trial, which compares Rezum to dual drug therapy for BPH. \u2047 Our elective procedures within the pelvic health portfolio were impacted by the third quarter surge in Delta but historical growth trends have shown a quicker recovery as COVID surges wane. \u2047 In Endoscopy, sales grew 11% organically versus 2020. \u2047 Our market-leading global endoscopy portfolio continues to benefit from differentiated, innovative technology launches, including AXIOS, Resolution Ultra hemostasis clip, and single-use scopes. \u2047 During the quarter, EXALT B received FDA clearance and is now available in both US and Europe, with physicians pleased with this image quality and suction capabilities. \u2047 We continue to make progress with EXALT-D and are launching the 1.5 enhanced EXALT-D design, which features improved physician ergonomics. \u2047 Additionally, we're pleased to now have approximately 40% of ERCP procedures qualify for additional reimbursement with NTAP approval as of October 1. \u2047 In Cardiac Rhythm Management, organic sales were flat versus 2020. \u2047 S-ICD sales grew mid-single digits versus Q3 '19, supported by the launch of the enhanced electrode. \u2047 While core CRM third quarter trends improved over first half '21 across both defib and pacer, we believe that growth likely lagged the market. \u2047 Looking ahead, we anticipate stabilization in our core CRM growth exiting 2021 and to early 2022, supported by S-ICD and our differentiated HeartLogic offering. \u2047 Within our Diagnostics franchise, our LUX-Dx implantable cardiac monitor continues to gain share as physicians are pleased with the implant experience, technology and remote programming capability. \u2047 Our Preventice business remains on track to deliver plus 20% growth for the full year versus 2020 on a pro forma basis, fueled by the broad and differentiated ambulatory ECG portfolio. \u2047 Electrophysiology organic sales were up 10% versus 2020, driven by strong international sales in both Europe and Japan. \u2047 International growth is well above market, driven by the innovative portfolio, including POLARx and STABLEPOINT. \u2047 POLARx was recently approved in Japan with the first cases occurring in October. \u2047 In addition, the FROZEN-AF trial completed enrollment, which represents an important step in bringing POLARx to the US with an expected launch in 2023. \u2047 We also closed our Farapulse acquisition in third quarter, which is the only commercially available PFA technology, and we are seeing strong early usage in a limited number of launched accounts in Europe. \u2047 Finally, we announced our acquisition of Baylis Medical, further enabling our strategy of category leadership with a novel approach to left heart access. \u2047 Within the US, the Baylis platform is used in close to 40% of EP ablation procedures on the left side of the heart. \u2047 Furthermore, it is used in left atrial appendage closure and mitral valve intervention. \u2047 We expect to close this acquisition in first quarter 2022. \u2047 In neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 2% versus 2020 as underlying procedure volumes was impacted by the Delta surge throughout much of the quarter. \u2047 Within our pain management franchise, we continue to see excitement for our WaveWriter Alpha SCS system and differentiated FAST algorithm as well as our Cognita digital solution. \u2047 Within deep brain stimulation, the majority of our accounts have transitioned to Vercise Genus, and we continue to drive new account openings as physicians are pleased with the integrated platform and personalized therapy. \u2047 And last week, we received approval for our Essential Tremor indication and are excited to begin our limited launch in fourth quarter 2021, which expand our addressable market by $2 billion. \u2047 In Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 26% versus 2020, which includes a 1,200 basis point tailwind related to the WATCHMAN consignment sales return reserve taken in third quarter '20. \u2047 Our WATCHMAN franchise had another strong quarter of double-digit growth as physicians continue to be pleased with the next-generation of FLX performance and differentiated clinical data. \u2047 This positive sentiment has been further supported by ongoing real-world clinical evidence presented at HRS demonstrating the high rates of effective LAA closure and low rates of complications post procedure. \u2047 We continue to innovate and are launching our Fixed Curve Sheath, offering greater deployment control and ability to reach an expanded range of anatomies. \u2047 We also anticipate enabling our US label to include DAPT to support physician and patient choice in patient implant care by year-end. \u2047 In TAVR, ACURATE neo2 continues to do well with physicians pleased with its clinical performance and ease of use, backed by strong real-world clinical data, resulting in approximately 20% market share in open accounts. \u2047 Momentum continues with SENTINEL, our cerebral embolic protection device, which is exceeding 20% share in the US, where it's utilized. \u2047 Coronary Therapies grew 8% versus 2020 as the China DES tender impact begins to annualize and our portfolio mix shift into higher growth markets continues to strengthen. \u2047 We continue to see excellent growth in complex PCI and imaging being driven by ROTAPRO and IVUS. \u2047 We also just received FDA clearance for AVVIGO II, our next-generation guidance platform. \u2047 Peripheral Interventions consistently delivers with organic sales up 8% versus Q3 2020. \u2047 TheraSphere was a standout once again and grew double digits in the quarter with continued momentum for the positive EPOCH trial, a first of its kind where TheraSphere was studied as second-line therapy where the primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with mCRC was met. \u2047 Additionally, we've begun patient enrollment in the MANDARIN trial, an important first step for bringing HCC treatment to China patients. \u2047 In arterial, our drug-eluting portfolio continues to perform well, growing double digits versus 2020 with positive late-breaking clinical data presented at VIVA earlier this month. \u2047 Eluvia, our drug-eluting stent exhibited superiority in the EMINENT trial compared to bare metal stents and 2-year data from the RANGER 2 trial demonstrated continued high rates, primary patency and significant reduction in reinterventions with our Ranger DCB. \u2047 In venous, we continue to push forward with our first patient enrolled in the HI-PEITHO trial. \u2047 We also had late-breaking clinical data from the KNOCKOUT PE registry presented at VIVA confirming the safety and efficacy of EKOS. \u2047 Building our strategy of category leadership, we announced our acquisition of Devoro Medical in the WOLF Thrombectomy Platform, which is an innovative technology designed to rapidly capture and extract blood clots in arterial and venous systems while minimizing blood loss. \u2047 We look forward to closing this acquisition in fourth quarter '21. \u2047 More broadly, we're furthering our commitment to sustainability, and I'm proud to report that Boston Scientific is joining the United Nations Race to Zero campaign. \u2047 And since 2017, we've reduced the BSC carbon footprint by 50% and are on track to meet our goal to be carbon neutral in all manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030. \u2047 We're building on this foundation to establish ambitious science-based targets to set us on the path to net zero emissions across our entire value chain. \u2047 We are bullish about the future outlook of Boston Scientific. \u2047 At our recent Investor Day, we detailed our LRP plans for growth of 6% to 8% growth, operating margin expansion of 50 basis points or more each year and double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. \u2047 And I'll now turn things over to Dan. \u2047 Third quarter consolidated revenue of $2.932 billion represents 10.3% reported revenue growth versus the third quarter of"], "gold_summary": ["q3 sales rose 10.3 percent to
