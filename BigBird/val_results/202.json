{"article": ["Along those lines, recall that in the third quarter of 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $99 million related to an equity method investment. \u2047 So we will speak to the quarterly results excluding that charge. \u2047 A full transcript and download will be posted after the call. \u2047 It is now my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman, President and CEO, Jim Squires. \u2047 Our third quarter results reflect a strong performance from the team as we delivered third quarter records for operating ratio, net income, income from railway operations and earnings per share. \u2047 While volume held steady with last year, revenue grew an impressive 14% and our 60.2% operating ratio reflects a 230-point improvement on a year-over-year adjusted basis, our second-best OR performance ever, outpaced only by last quarter's 58.3% mark. \u2047 In the midst of significant supply chain disruptions and labor shortages across the country, we're delivering upon our commitments. \u2047 And we could not have achieved those milestones without the tireless work of our employees who day in and day out, keep our customers' goods moving safely and efficiently. \u2047 Now let's turn to Cindy to go through our operations. \u2047 In the quarter, we continued to successfully drive productivity improvement throughout the network. \u2047 We worked to be as efficient as possible as we adjusted to accommodate demand shifts in many of our markets. \u2047 This quarter shows continued progress as we attack our cost structure while positioning ourselves for further improvement in both cost and service levels. \u2047 The quarterly operating metrics on slide six clearly show that, once again, we generated positive operating leverage on flat unit volumes and GTMs that were up 5%. \u2047 While we are proactively hiring train crews, efficiency in all areas of our operations, including engineering, mechanical and communications and signals, enabled us to run the network with 7% fewer people in the quarter compared to a year ago. \u2047 Because assets drive activity, reducing the number of active locomotives was an important lever in managing the size of the workforce. \u2047 Both train weight and train length continue to improve, driven by a focus on improving the productivity in our bulk network. \u2047 Coal, grain and other single commodity unit trains offer real opportunity for gains through collaborating with our customers on operating trains with more cars per set and by doubling up existing trains over portions of their route. \u2047 I expect we will show continued progress in the fourth quarter as we see the fruits of our efforts. \u2047 While strong coal traffic helped drive train weight more than length, train length continued to improve and set another quarterly record. \u2047 After seven consecutive quarters of fuel efficiency improvements, we saw a modest deterioration this quarter despite the increase in train size as our horsepower leverage was challenged at times due to volatile traffic flows and we had modestly fewer of the very heavy, highly fuel-efficient trains. \u2047 I am pushing the team to respond more quickly in the face of change, and we are committed to closing the gap with our peers over time and are redoubling our efforts in this critical area. \u2047 As you can see on slide seven, train speed and terminal dwell were generally flat versus second quarter and do not reflect performance at desired levels. \u2047 While there were some effects from Hurricane Ida, those impacts were localized, and I'm extremely proud of how the team, especially engineering and our signal forces, helped us return our routes in Louisiana to operation and reopen the New Orleans Gateway very quickly. \u2047 As I mentioned last quarter, we are experiencing hiring and retention conditions that are increasingly challenging, especially in some of our more critical locations, and it is having an impact on our network. \u2047 Despite hiring all year long, attrition has been accelerating in each of the last two quarters in several of those critical areas. \u2047 In many of these locations, we've been able to absorb the impact by executing upon productivity initiatives, and this will be very much a part of the equation going forward as we grow capacity, which I'll talk about more in a moment. \u2047 Some of the things we are doing to create relief: we've more than tripled our conductor trainee rank since the first quarter so that we can effectively backfill in critical areas; we've implemented tools such as perfect attendance bonuses, referral bonuses and signing incentives to improve the stickiness of our current and future workforce; and we continue to leverage the valuable Go Teams to quickly respond to business opportunities where needed. \u2047 People are the backbone of the railroad, and we need to make progress on these initiatives to better manage the effects of a tight labor market. \u2047 We are committed to having the right amount of resources in the right place at the right time, which will drive both cost control and service quality. \u2047 As our business mix continues to evolve, creating capacity across our market segments has become an even more significant area of focus as highlighted on slide eight. \u2047 Some shippers are looking to take advantage of unexpected market opportunities by shipping extra volume. \u2047 Others are looking for us to help them adjust to volatility coming from other parts of their supply chains, and of course, all place a high value and service predictability. \u2047 We're adjusting our network and operations to generate the various types of capacity that customers are looking for. \u2047 For example, increases in both train sizes give shippers extra lift without further demands on our crew base. \u2047 Train size increases often require connecting railroads, customers and Norfolk Southern to change processes, and we have found those process changes are worth the effort because they improve asset turns and capacity. \u2047 We also continue to focus on terminal efficiency, whether helping to drive dwell at our biggest hump yard, Elkhart, to very low levels or tactically redirecting trains to intermodal terminals that have the capacity to unload quickly. \u2047 Moving to slide nine. \u2047 I want to show how we can use these capacity efforts to drive productivity. \u2047 We've had great success over the past two years driving train size and, in doing so, have addressed a handful of infrastructure bottlenecks. \u2047 We're fast-tracking a set of siding improvements, the first of which went into service at the end of the third quarter so we can keep making progress. \u2047 Bigger trains unlocked by siding extensions helped drive locomotive utilization because it allows us to fully match train size to available pulling power. \u2047 And because locomotives are at their most efficient when pulling hard, this is a key lever to our fuel efficiency improvement. \u2047 While I've used locomotives and fuel as my primary example, capacity additions have a similar effect on our crew productivity: more cars per crew, asset turns, keeping trains moving with greater train capacity, and also helps our customers with improved train and car performance. \u2047 On slide 10, we are complementing our investment in physical capacity with a comprehensive technology strategy that makes our crews more efficient and our assets more productive. \u2047 Virtually all of our routine signal and track maintenance is now scheduled via the mobile track authority app, a process that used to be measured in minutes can now be accomplished in seconds. \u2047 It is inherently more efficient than the radio process of the past, and most importantly, safer because it reduces transcription errors. \u2047 In the words of our chief engineer, the app has been a game changer for the productivity of his forces. \u2047 We're doing the same with our mobile train reporting app, which enables our train crews to quickly report completed work and to receive updated customer work requests while in route. \u2047 This takes a lot of hands out of the process, including significant retyping and delay and enables our crews to be more productive. \u2047 We're still early in the deployment of this application with rollout to the local trains that do the preponderance of pickups and setoffs just beginning. \u2047 The use cases for this technology in the field are numerous, and driving adoption and innovation around this platform is a focal point that will allow us to capture additional benefit. \u2047 The common use thread in these apps is that better information allows people to plan. \u2047 Our track supervisors can better plan their schedule knowing the availability of track time, and our customers can better plan their plant operations and product pipeline with up-to-date shipment information. \u2047 In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our growth plan, yielding double-digit revenue gains in each of our three markets, further demonstrating our ability to deliver value for our customers and shareholders. \u2047 Beginning on slide 12, I will highlight our results for the third quarter. \u2047 We achieved total revenue of $2.9 billion, representing a 14% increase from the same period last year despite flat volumes. \u2047 Our revenue performance this quarter was driven by significant gains in revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel, both reaching record levels with double-digit year-over-year growth. \u2047 This reflects the success of our ongoing efforts to yield up and improve revenue quality, a strategy that enhances our long-term potential for revenue and margin growth as conditions improve. \u2047 Revenue in our merchandise segment improved 10% year-over-year, while volume increased to 5%. \u2047 Growth was led by our Chemicals franchise that benefited from recovering energy demand that drove higher shipments of crude oil and natural gas liquids. \u2047 Also contributing to merchandise growth was sustained strength in steel markets due to record-high commodity prices and growth in manufacturing activity. \u2047 Steel shipments were up an impressive 34% from the same period a year ago. \u2047 Partially offsetting these gains were declines in shipments of finished vehicles and vehicle parts due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. \u2047 This limited automotive production activity and further depleted finished vehicle inventories to new lows. \u2047 Both revenue per unit and revenue per unit less fuel improved year-over-year due to price increases. \u2047 Our intermodal franchise experienced several headwinds related to supply chain disruptions that negatively impacted volume in our domestic and international business lines. \u2047 In both segments, unprecedented demand from inventory restocking and consumer spending outpaced available capacity in the supply chain ecosystem. \u2047 The combination of drayage shortages, warehouse productivity, equipment availability, labor force participation and rail network fluidity pressured intermodal volume throughout the quarter, resulting in a 4% year-over-year decline. \u2047 Overcoming these headwinds, we delivered revenue growth of 16% in the third quarter due to higher revenue from storage services, increased fuel surcharge revenue and price strength. \u2047 Coal revenue increased 32% in the third quarter as both domestic and global economies continued to recover from the pandemic and drive demand for electric power. \u2047 Export coal shipments increased significantly as strong demand and record high seaborne prices increased opportunities for US. \u2047 Utility volumes declined in the third quarter as coal supply was limited and some crossover tons moved into the higher-rated export market. \u2047 The mix shift from utility to export, coupled with price gains, led to a 20% increase in revenue per unit less fuel for coal in the third quarter, a new record for the franchise. \u2047 Moving to our outlook on slide 13. \u2047 We expect the third quarter environment to continue through the end of the year. \u2047 Strong consumer demand will continue, while pressures from material shortages and labor issues remain challenging global supply chains. \u2047 Inventory levels remain at historic lows despite the continued push to replenish stock, providing a boost to transportation demand. \u2047 We remain confident in our ability to leverage our strengths in these market conditions and deliver robust revenue growth for the full year. \u2047 We expect merchandise business will continue to benefit from recovering economic activity as conditions that limited business and recreational activities in the fourth quarter of last year have been much less impactful in the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 We anticipate our markets for crude oil, natural gas liquids and waste to experience higher volume as a result. \u2047 Ongoing demand for steel will also be a growth driver, with forecast for industrial production up more than 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and steel prices currently above $1,900 a ton. \u2047 A projected 4% year-over-year fourth quarter decline in US. \u2047 light vehicle production will remain a headwind as the industry remains challenged by the chip shortage. \u2047 Within intermodal, we continue to see strong demand from consumer spending and tightness in the truck sector. \u2047 These favorable conditions are offset by constraints from supply chain congestion and equipment availability. \u2047 We are working closely with our customers and our channel partners to mitigate these challenges. \u2047 However, we do not see meaningful improvement in these headwinds before the end of the year. \u2047 Coal demand is expected to remain strong with extremely favorable market conditions, although coal supply will be the governor on year-over-year growth. \u2047 Natural gas prices continue to climb, and declining inventory levels leading into the winter months are the current focus of utility customers. \u2047 Seaborne prices are at decades-long highs in the export market, creating demand beyond capacity and supply abilities. \u2047 Overall, we are optimistic about the opportunities in the fourth quarter and confident in our ability to execute our plan to generate value and grow our business. \u2047 Turning to slide 14. \u2047 There are several factors impacting the supply chain in which we participate. \u2047 This includes external factors, such as the chip shortage and intensifying congestion in the intermodal supply chain. \u2047 Coal supply availability continues to be a constraint to meet the higher demand in every market as both thermal and met production remain tight. \u2047 NS has taken action to mitigate some of these factors and effectively position us for revenue growth. \u2047 As drayage challenges affected international intermodal, we provided an alternative storage solution to our customers. \u2047 We're working diligently to add chassis capacity to support demand and alleviate shortages across the supply chain. \u2047 Last quarter, we outlined our plan to repair a portion of our chassis fleet that was impacted by a manufacturing defect. \u2047 I appreciate the quick action and effort from our team, and I'm pleased to report that this issue is effectively behind us as we have repaired and returned approximately 95% of the recall chassis back to service. \u2047 We are also in the process of taking delivery of leased chassis to augment our fleet. \u2047 We've added terminal capacity to support growth driven by e-commerce and a recovering economy as well as reduced terminal congestion and improved network fluidity. \u2047 We remain focused on growth opportunities across our network. \u2047 We are continuously innovating to compete in the $800 billion plus truck and logistics market, as shown by our Thoroughbred Freight Transfer or TFT service launched earlier this year. \u2047 TFT is one of our initiatives to drive growth by targeting opportunities for highway conversions to rail. \u2047 This service combines the efficiency of our intermodal trains, the capacity of our boxcar assets and the last mile flexibility of trucks to provide an innovative door-to-door service. \u2047 We're also leveraging our sustainability advantage to propel long-term growth. \u2047 The choice of transportation mode is one of the most powerful levers any shipper has to reduce the size of its carbon footprint, and we are working closely with our customers to deliver additional value through sustainability. \u2047 We have proven our ability to deliver results despite challenging market conditions by providing innovative solutions that our customers value and position"], "gold_summary":
