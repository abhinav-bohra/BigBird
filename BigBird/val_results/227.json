{"article": ["If you do not yet have a copy, you can access them on our website. \u2047 We are providing that information as a supplement to information prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. \u2047 With us on the call today are John Arabia, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bryan Giglia, Chief Financial Officer; and Marc Hoffman, Chief Operating Officer. \u2047 I can say without hesitation, that I'm glad 2020 is behind us, and I firmly believe the better days lie ahead. \u2047 It goes without saying, that 2020 posed the most difficult challenges the hotel industry has ever faced, and we are forced to do things we never thought we would have to do. \u2047 That said, in rising to the occasion, we and others working together, also accomplished things we never thought possible. \u2047 Simply stated, we are not out of the woods yet. \u2047 We have recently witnessed evidence of a recovery in demand, including leisure, commercial and group demand. \u2047 We believe if these trends continue and a gradual recovery has started, and we are likely to resume hotel profitability sometime late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of this year. \u2047 Today, I'll provide a recap of 2020 including our accomplishments here at Sunstone, as well as our annual and quarterly operating results. \u2047 I will then provide comments on recent operating and booking trends, followed by an update on our liquidity, and an overview of our 2021 capital projects as we continue to focus on long-term growth. \u2047 Bryan will later provide more details on our recent earnings, finance transactions, liquidity and dividends. \u2047 So let's begin with a recap of last year. \u2047 Despite the extremely challenging operating environment, we were able to navigate the pandemic and execute on several transactions that increased the quality of our portfolio, reduced our debt, and better positioned the Company for long-term growth. \u2047 During the year, we sold two hotels, the Renaissance Baltimore and the Renaissance LAX for combined gross proceeds of nearly $172 million. \u2047 These two transactions bring the number of hotels sold in the past three years to a total of nine hotels for gross proceeds of approximately $575 million. \u2047 In July, we sold the Renaissance Baltimore at a reasonable discount to pre-pandemic pricing, which we believe was a good outcome, considering the asset is lower quality, urban group-oriented hotel that was losing money and expected to lose money for some time. \u2047 In December, we are fortunate to compete the sale of the Renaissance LAX, and what we believe to be a pre-pandemic valuation. \u2047 This was a fantastic execution, and a direct result of our strong balance sheet and nimble investment team. \u2047 We did not have to sell this hotel, nor did we need the incremental liquidity, and because of this, we were able to hold the line and extract premium pricing equating to a 6.8% cap rate on 2019 actual earnings. \u2047 Additionally, during the fourth quarter, we reached a resolution with the lender of the mortgage on the Hilton Times Square, resulting in in assignment-in-lieu. \u2047 Given the operating challenges this hotel faced prior to the pandemic, which were only exacerbated by a proposed uneconomic ground rent reset, and an increase in property taxes, we expected the hotel to generate sizable cash losses for the foreseeable future. \u2047 While we are hoping for another outcome, the assignment of our interest in this hotel mitigated what we believe to be a deteriorating situation, and all things considered was the best outcome in a terrible situation. \u2047 The departure of these three hotels in 2020 further consolidates our portfolio into long-term relevant real estate, and further reduces our ground lease exposure. \u2047 It is worthwhile to note that the combined 2019 RevPAR and EBITDA per key of these three hotels, in aggregate, was approximately 19% lower and 54% lower respectively than the remainder of our portfolio. \u2047 Additionally, the dispositions leave us with only two ground lease assets in the portfolio, which we believe compares about the best across all publicly traded hotel REITs. \u2047 Despite the limitations on the incurred environment, we continue to make selective capital investments in 2020 that we believe will result in long-term value creation. \u2047 During the year, we invested $51 million into our hotel portfolio, with the largest project being the complete repositioning renovation of the Bidwell Portland, which turned out just beautifully. \u2047 As many of you know, we take a long-term view of our business, and so despite the uncertainty facing the industry in 2020, we chose to accelerate several highly disruptive projects that were on hold awaiting a quiet time to be completed. \u2047 At our Renaissance Orlando, we completed the first phase of a refresh of the hotel large atrium lobby, including replacing nearly 50,000 square feet of flooring, which would have otherwise resulted in millions of dollars of displacement. \u2047 The lobby looks amazing. \u2047 And we were able to complete this investment without any displacement or guest impact. \u2047 At our Wailea Beach Resort, we added 32 beautiful lanai decks, which has significantly increased the appeal and the revenue potential of these oceanfront rooms. \u2047 Also in Wailea, we remain on track to complete our solar project in this quarter, which will eliminate approximately 650,000 kilowatts annually of energy, and reduce not only our carbon footprint, but also our energy bill by roughly $160,000 per year. \u2047 And finally at our DC Renaissance, we have completed the refresh of our product to share and the meeting space escalator modernization, both of which have result -- would have resulted in meaningful group displacement during normal operating times. \u2047 In summary, despite very challenging times, we had a productive year at Sunstone. \u2047 Let's move on to 2020 operating results. \u2047 Of our 17 hotels, 15 were in operation at the end of the year, which represents 92% of our rooms in the portfolio, and nearly 98% of our comparable 2019 hotel EBITDA. \u2047 For the full year, comparable portfolio revenues were $233 million, and RevPAR was just over $46, which represent declines of 76% and 77% respectively, compared to 2019. \u2047 To put this into perspective, roughly 75% of our comparable revenues in the year were generated in the first quarter prior to the pandemic. \u2047 Full year comparable property-level EBITDA was a loss of $64 million, which represents a decline of 120% relative to 2019, despite a previously thought unattainable 56% decline in same-store operating expenses. \u2047 Three of our hotels, Wailea Beach Resort, Embassy Suites La Jolla and Oceans Edge achieved positive EBITDA for the year. \u2047 Moving on to the fourth quarter. \u2047 Comparable portfolio revenues were $32 million and RevPAR was $25.36, which represents a decline of 86% and 87% respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 Our fourth quarter RevPAR was challenged by the seasonal slowdown in business and the increase in both COVID cases and stay-at-home restrictions, which had a temporary impact on transient reservations. \u2047 Nevertheless, our portfolio RevPAR of just over $25 increased from the nearly $18 witnessed in the third quarter and the $3 in the second quarter, as we opened up additional hotels, and as occupancy at several hotels increased, particularly our higher-rated properties. \u2047 Demand in the fourth quarter came from a combination of leisure transient, contract business, and event-driven groups that were primarily related to either government or emergency management business. \u2047 Fourth quarter group business, which was made up of non-congregating room blocks, was generally limited to our hotels in San Diego and New Orleans. \u2047 We have also recently seen a very small, but growing number of commercial transient rooms, particularly in October and November, as workforce started to return to traditional offices and get back out on the road. \u2047 Furthermore, in December, we saw an increase in holiday travel at Oceans Edge, Wailea Beach Resort, Renaissance Orlando and both of our hotels in San Diego. \u2047 Leisure demand continues to be the primary source of business for many of our hotels. \u2047 Our drive-to hotels and resort destinations continued to outperform our City Center hotels, particularly on the weekends as people seek travel opportunities away from their homes. \u2047 Our Oceans Edge Resort in Key West ran at 53% occupancy in the fourth quarter, and a slightly higher rate than the fourth quarter of 2019 driven completely by transient leisure business. \u2047 This spacious resort with six separate pools is an ideal destination for a socially distance vacation. \u2047 Over the New Year's holiday, Oceans Edge ran nearly 90% occupancy, with an average rate that was competitive that of the prior year. \u2047 Similarly, our hotel in Wailea continues to rebound despite the flighty nature of the Hawaiian Islands, which reopened for business in mid-October, albeit with significant testing requirements and limited open amenities. \u2047 As expected, demand in Wailea has been building slowly with occupancy levels in the range of 19% to 23% per month. \u2047 As Wailea's occupancy builds, we continue to maintain our premium pricing integrity and have been disciplined in our approach to revenue management as opposed to lowering prices in hopes of creating demand. \u2047 Our November ADR at the property was 13% higher than the previous year, and our ADR from Christmas to New Year was over $725. \u2047 We continue to believe that our outstanding hotel product, and desire by travelers to vacation in Mali, will allow us to maintain our high rates, while building our occupancy, as more people feel comfortable travel. \u2047 Now let's take a look at our quarterly group performance. \u2047 Group business increased sequentially in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter from 21,000 room nights to 32,000 room nights or about 24% of the total room nights achieved in the quarter. \u2047 Current group business continues to be composed primarily of government and emergency management-related groups, all of which tend to book with little lead time. \u2047 That said, we have also started to see a few incidences of traditional groups keeping their meetings as planned. \u2047 For example, while certain isolated events that showed up were small compared to historic events, its sports group kept our room block at our Renaissance Orlando in early January, and two medical groups recently showed up at Wailea Beach Resort. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, property-level expenses declined by 70%, which includes the benefits -- benefit of approximately $8.7 million of operational level credits and adjustments, including several real estate tax adjustments and employee tax credits. \u2047 Despite such a material decline in cost, the challenging demand environment resulted in property-level adjusted EBITDA loss of $18 million in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Now, a loss of $18 million is nothing to get excited about, but it does show continued improvement from the third quarter, which had a loss of $32 million for the comparable portfolio. \u2047 Similar to the third quarter, the fourth quarter property-level loss was several million dollars better than we had anticipated, even after accounting for the credits we received. \u2047 We continue to work with our operators, not only to reduce expenses in the short term, but also to identify efficiencies and other improvements to our operating model that are expected to generate sustained cost savings for owners as demand returns to our hotels. \u2047 We believe 2021 group business will ultimately depend on the speed and efficacy of the vaccine distribution, and the degree to which that allows us to return to normal. \u2047 In the near term, cancellations in the first quarter of '21 are trending in line with that of the fourth quarter of last year, and we would expect a limited group room nights outside select government-related groups. \u2047 Looking at the second quarter, our group cancellations have increased over the last 90 days, but at a much slower pace than what we saw in recent quarters. \u2047 Several groups remain intent on holding their events in the second quarter, including a couple of association events in San Diego, and a few small city wise in Boston. \u2047 This gives us some confidence that group room nights will begin to increase in the second quarter. \u2047 And then as the distribution of the vaccine becomes more widespread, this travel restrictions and social distance requirements ease, group trends will accelerate in mid-to-late summer. \u2047 Given the expected vaccination trajectory, meeting planners have become more confident about holding their events in the third and fourth quarter, and we've witnessed minimal group cancellations for that time period. \u2047 Based on these assumptions, we expect our portfolio will perform materially better in the second half of 2021, and specifically in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Recent pace of future group bookings also points to recovery. \u2047 Following the loosening of stay-at-home orders in the earlier part of this year, we saw a meaningful increase in bookings in group lead volume. \u2047 In January, our portfolio group lead volume was up 130% over December, and the total number of leads reached a level not seen since last March. \u2047 From a production standpoint, Hilton San Diego Bayfront had its highest January group production in the last six years, with over 17,000 room nights booked, and Boston Park Plaza booked several large pieces of business for the third and fourth quarter. \u2047 In New Orleans, Jazz Fest, French Quarter Fest and two other festivals were rescheduled for October, and now every weekend in October has the potential for market compression, which is great and something we have not seen in quite some time. \u2047 Looking further group bookings. \u2047 Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, we booked 140,000 new group room nights for all future months, excluding the rebooking of previously cancelled groups. \u2047 While a portion of these bookings relate to isolated driven event business, the remaining balance still represents an acceleration from previous months and demonstrate there is pent-up demand to hold meetings when conditions permit. \u2047 In addition to new bookings, to date we have rebooked 266,000 group rooms -- group room nights that previously cancelled or approximately 25% of all cancelled group room nights since the start of the pandemic. \u2047 We would expect that number of rebook rooms to increase as another 3% of cancelled rooms are at various stages of reworking their contracts, and an incremental 24% of cancelled room nights have expressed an interest in rebooking and are working with our sales team to potentially secure new dates. \u2047 Taken together, the new group -- groups booked, since the beginning of the fourth quarter and all rebook groups, and those in the contracting process, represent approximately $100 million of group room revenue, and approximately $125 million of total group revenue. \u2047 We are confident we would not have captured all of this business, if we did not keep sales professional on property to work with and take care of our meeting planners and group customers. \u2047 While our 2021 group room night pace is down materially compared to pre-pandemic levels, we currently have approximately 290,000 group rooms on the books for 2021, representing $62 million of group room revenue, a significant increase from the depressed 2020 levels. \u2047 In addition to the more optimistic outlook for group business,"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted ffo loss per share $0.16.17 hotel
