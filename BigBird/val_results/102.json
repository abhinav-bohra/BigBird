{"article": ["Before we begin, I have an important reminder. \u2047 We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www. \u2047 After their prepared comments, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. \u2047 Third quarter operating earnings were reduced by pandemic claims and other charges and helped by strong alternative investment results. \u2047 Adjusting out these various items, our underlying earnings and earnings growth potential remains strong. \u2047 Our expectation remains to be at the high end or above our 8% to 10% earnings per share growth target in the intermediate and longer term. \u2047 Intermediate term expectations are primarily based on recovering sales momentum, strong fees on assets under management, incremental expense management initiatives and the combination of $900 million of buybacks related to our recent block sale and ongoing share repurchases. \u2047 Taking each of these in turn. \u2047 Sales year-to-date are consistent with our expectations of building off the levels achieved as we exited 2020. \u2047 We are also achieving returns in the low- to mid-teens on capital backing sales across all business lines. \u2047 Overall, sales growth is reemerging due to our distribution strength, added shelf space, digital capabilities and product innovation. \u2047 After introducing 10 new products since the beginning of the year, including the industry's first combined life plus long-term care policy built on a variable chassis, we have more updates planned and additional products in development. \u2047 Expense efficiency has long been a key focus for Lincoln. \u2047 This quarter, we once again reported a lower expense ratio across most of our businesses. \u2047 We also have a track record of delivering on past cost savings initiatives. \u2047 We expect Spark, our new cost savings initiative to drive savings well in excess of the impact of spread compression through 2024 and to improve both our operational effectiveness and the customer experience. \u2047 Finally, our buyback strategy, as just mentioned, is comprised of two components: first, our ongoing repurchases, which returned to pre-COVID levels this year, driven by the capital efficiency of our products, including the impact of the recently announced VA living benefit flow reinsurance deal, low levels of credit losses and net ratings upgrades in our high-quality investment portfolio and our well-managed hedge strategy. \u2047 Second, the buybacks funded by the block deal. \u2047 Before turning to the business segments, I want to congratulate Ellen Cooper. \u2047 In August, the Board announced that Ellen will succeed me as CEO after our Annual Shareholders Meeting next May. \u2047 Since joining Lincoln in 2012, Ellen has worked with me and the rest of our executive team to shape and execute on Lincoln's strategy. \u2047 She joined us as Chief Investment Officer, and her responsibilities have grown to include leading our enterprise risk efforts and our annuities business. \u2047 Ellen is a gifted leader with a proven track record of empowering high-performing teams and executing effectively in challenging environments. \u2047 I know that Lincoln will be in great hands with Ellen at the helm as she moves forward and fully capitalizing on the exciting opportunities ahead for Lincoln. \u2047 Ellen will be joining Randy and me on the first quarter's earnings call. \u2047 Now turning to the business segments. \u2047 In Annuities, we reported sales growth of 7% and over the prior year quarter, driven by our industry-leading product breadth and distribution force plus shelf space added over the last two years. \u2047 Sales were down sequentially as we led the industry with weight reductions on indexed variable annuities in response to market conditions as well as typical third quarter seasonality. \u2047 We remain pleased with our sales mix of guaranteed and nonguaranteed products, providing us diversification and attractive new business returns. \u2047 Looking forward, we are expanding customer choice by adding new investment options and index strategies and have improved the attractiveness of our indexed variable annuity product setting us up for sales growth in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Finally, we expect our earnings to continue to benefit from the high-quality and diversified in-force book we have built over the years. \u2047 In Retirement Plan Services, we reported another quarter of excellent results and remain well positioned with award-winning digital technology, a competitive cost structure an expanding set of product solutions and scale in our target markets. \u2047 Total deposits were up 2% despite being negatively impacted by some sales shifting into the fourth quarter. \u2047 While we reported slightly negative flows this quarter, trailing 12-month net flows remained strong at positive $1.2 billion, and we expect full year 2021 net flows to be positive. \u2047 Sales of YourPath or alternative to target date funds remain strong. \u2047 We have continued to innovate, enhancing our in-plan income solution called PathBuilder Income and integrating the solution inside our YourPath investment option. \u2047 As a result of the SECURE Act, we also see significant long-term opportunities around in-plan guarantees, pooled employer plan solutions and advisor managed accounts. \u2047 Finally, the macro environment continues to provide a tailwind to Retirement Plan Services. \u2047 In addition to healthy equity markets, the economic recovery is contributing to better wage growth, higher employee contribution rates and a greater employer deposits. \u2047 The retirement business is having an outstanding year as we continue to execute on our strategy. \u2047 In life insurance, our focus on expanding both consumer value propositions and distribution shelf space resulted in sequential sales growth of 32% this quarter with sales totaling $166 million and all product categories reporting double-digit increases. \u2047 The focus on expanded customer choice aligns with our ongoing efforts to diversify our product risk profile. \u2047 As examples, in the life business, our variable MoneyGuard and our principal VUL products offer the customer the choice of lower guarantees and higher upside potential. \u2047 Sales of these types of products have been growing faster than segmentwide sales. \u2047 The products have less potential tail risk and better capital efficiency. \u2047 In addition to the property and casualty distribution partnership we added in the second quarter -- We recently launched our variable MoneyGuard product at two of our largest strategic partners, providing 25,000 more advisors with access to this first-of-its-kind solution. \u2047 Complementing our distribution and product expansion efforts, our digital-first focus continues to drive a lower cost per policy and an improved customer experience. \u2047 Looking ahead, we are enthusiastic about the future of the life business, we are introducing new solutions that will further expand our customer and distribution reach with more introductions planned for the first half of 2022. \u2047 Lastly, our Group Protection business continues to be impacted by the pandemic particularly as the Delta variant affected more individuals under age 65 driving increased claims. \u2047 While the pandemic continues to be a headwind, the underlying fundamentals of the business are strong, and we are pleased with the progress we are making. \u2047 We achieved 5% premium growth over the prior year which is a result of a stronger persistency rate of nearly 90% and renewal rate increases implemented earlier this year. \u2047 Year-over-year sales are flat as we stick to our pricing discipline. \u2047 We're seeing more sales from our higher-margin employee-paid products year-to-date. \u2047 59% of Group Protection sales have come from these products as more individuals see the value of them. \u2047 Within this category, we have begun to quote our new hospital indemnity product rounding out our suite of supplemental health products. \u2047 Underlying margins after adjusting primarily for pandemic-related claims or again, in the middle of our target range this quarter. \u2047 We will continue to build on our progress and expect margins to grow toward the top end of our 5% to 7% target range. \u2047 As we remain disciplined on pricing, new business, reducing costs and managing claims. \u2047 Briefly on investment results. \u2047 Credit quality remains excellent. \u2047 Our general account portfolio is predominantly comprised of fixed income investments, of which 97% are investment-grade equivalent. \u2047 We continue to expect a benign credit outlook and have seen favorable credit trends within our portfolio with minimal credit losses and positive net credit migrations. \u2047 During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 2.6% with 1/2 in shorter-duration assets versus 1/3 for the full year 2020. \u2047 And reflecting the increase in shorter-duration product sales and our disciplined asset liability matching. \u2047 Approximately 60% of our purchases were in investments other than public corporates, providing diversification and good relative value and yielding approximately 100 basis points over comparability rated public corporates. \u2047 Lastly, our alternative investment performance was once again strong with an 8% return in the quarter, exceeding our long-term targeted quarterly return of 2.5%. \u2047 In summary, reported results this quarter continue to reflect ongoing impacts from the pandemic in life insurance and Group Protection. \u2047 Our product strategy, distribution strength and ongoing innovation are helping to build sales momentum at attractive returns. \u2047 Our new expense savings initiative is expected to more than offset spread compression, improve overall operational effectiveness and drive earnings growth. \u2047 And ongoing share buybacks driven by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation, combined with the incremental buybacks enabled by our recent block deal will further boost EPS. \u2047 In sum, our underlying earnings power is improving, and we remain confident in our ability to grow earnings per share at or above our 8% to 10% target range. \u2047 Last night, we reported third quarter adjusted operating income of $307 million or $1.62 per share. \u2047 Also, this quarter's results were impacted by pandemic-related claims, which reduced earnings by $180 million or $0.95 per share. \u2047 While results benefited from strong performance in the alternative investment portfolio, boosting earnings by $89 million or $0.47 per share above target. \u2047 Additionally, we experienced some unfavorable nonpandemic mortality in the Life Insurance segment that I will discuss further in the life commentary. \u2047 From a reported adjusted operating income standpoint, it was a bit of a noisy quarter, but we have strong underlying earnings power as we exit the quarter. \u2047 Net income totaled $318 million or $1.68 per share, boosted by gains in the investment portfolio and strong performance from the variable annuity hedge program. \u2047 Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. \u2047 Consolidated adjusted operating revenue grew 9% from the prior year, which included growth in each of the four businesses. \u2047 Average account values increased 17%, and book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% and stands at $76.96, an all-time high. \u2047 Now turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. \u2047 Operating income for the quarter was $338 million, which included a $5 million net unfavorable impact from our annual review. \u2047 Compared to $196 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $101 million net unfavorable impact from the annual review. \u2047 Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income increased 15% from the prior year quarter, driven by record average account values of $170 billion, up 17% over the past year. \u2047 The current quarter included $10 million of favorable alternative investment income. \u2047 The expense ratio improved 80 basis points compared to the prior year period as our focus on expenses continues to benefit the bottom line. \u2047 Return metrics remained solid with return on assets coming in at 80 basis points and return on equity at 26%. \u2047 Risk metrics on our VA book once again demonstrate the quality of our in-force with a net amount at risk at 63 basis points of account values for living benefits and at 43 basis points for death benefits. \u2047 So a great result for the Annuities business with another quarter of high-quality earnings, strong returns and solid risk metrics, leaving us well positioned to finish the year with another excellent quarter. \u2047 Retirement Plan Services reported operating income of $60 million compared to $50 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase driven by higher fees and account values, continued expense efficiency and higher alternative investment income, which was $6 million favorable to our expectation in the current quarter. \u2047 Our annual review had no impact in the current quarter, but did have a net unfavorable impact of $3 million in the prior year quarter. \u2047 Favorable equity markets drove average account values up 21% to $97 billion. \u2047 The expense ratio improved 80 basis points over the prior year quarter as revenue growth combined with continued diligent expense management contributed to improved results. \u2047 Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter, in line with our stated 10 to 15 basis point range as crediting rate actions continue to take hold. \u2047 Overall, the retirement business had an excellent quarter, and continues to be well positioned to drive strong results. \u2047 Turning to life Insurance. \u2047 Operating income for the quarter was $93 million which included a $26 million net unfavorable impact from our annual review compared to an operating loss of $311 million in the prior year quarter, which included a $440 million net unfavorable impact from the annual review. \u2047 Additionally, the current quarter included an unfavorable notable item of $19 million related to a legal expense associated with the reinsurance arbitration award. \u2047 Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating income increased 7% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher alternative investment income, as the current quarter included $65 million compared to $37 million in the prior year quarter. \u2047 Elevated mortality related to the pandemic was $60 million in the quarter compared to $70 million in the prior year quarter. \u2047 This quarter's impact for 10,000 COVID deaths of $6 million was down year-over-year as expected, but was up sequentially and as the severity of our average COVID claim was elevated. \u2047 We believe this elevation is normal volatility as we had a few larger COVID claims in the quarter. \u2047 In addition to the impacts of the pandemic, underlying mortality was negatively impacted by $34 million. \u2047 We believe this was driven by two factors. \u2047 First, over the course of the pandemic, when COVID cases have been increasing, which they did in the third quarter, we have seen elevated non-COVID mortality as well. \u2047 And second, normal quarterly volatility. \u2047 I'd point out that we experienced favorable underlying mortality in the prior two quarters, and when viewed on a year-to-date basis, our actual to expected mortality ratio remains under 100%, better than expected. \u2047 Earnings drivers continue to grow, with average account values up 9% and average life insurance in-force up 7% over the prior year. \u2047 Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, declined 13 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, above our five to 10 basis point expectation. \u2047 Our expense ratio improved 30 basis points over the prior year quarter as our efficiency efforts continue to benefit margins. \u2047 This was a noisy quarter for life earnings, but growth in earnings drivers, long-term mortality results in line with expectations and continued expense discipline keep us confident in our underlying business. \u2047 Group Protection reported an operating loss of $32 million which included a $16 million net favorable impact from our annual review of reserve assumptions compared to"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share of $1.68.  \u2047  q3 adjusted operating earnings per share $1.62.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $1.68."], "pred_summary": ["qtrly adjusted operating earnings per share $1.62.  \u2047
