{"article": ["carlisle.com in the Investor Relations section. \u2047 Today's call will begin with Chris discussing business trends experienced during the fourth quarter of 2020, views of what's to come in 2021 and context around our continued confidence in achieving Vision 2025. \u2047 Bob will discuss Carlisle's fourth quarter performance and current financial position. \u2047 Those considering investing in Carlisle should read these statements carefully and review reports we file with the SEC before making an investment decision. \u2047 Entering what is now the second year of operating in this COVID-19 pandemic, I hope everyone is healthy and staying safe. \u2047 I'd like to open by saying how proud I am of the global Carlisle team for their perseverance and ability to execute in these uncertain times. \u2047 Our COVID statistics reflect the strong compliance to the CDC guidelines and safety measures all Carlisle employees have followed. \u2047 In 2020, we suffered 470 infections, 15 hospitalizations and sadly, three deaths. \u2047 We continue to do our part to combat the spread of the virus in combination with further progress on the vaccination rollout. \u2047 We anticipate that we will continue to show our safety measures are working because at Carisle maintaining health and safety is always our first priority. \u2047 Vision 2025 provided clear direction and consistency of mission during a tumultuous 2020 and will continue to guide our efforts as we accelerate into the recovery. \u2047 As we passed the mid-year mark and entered the third quarter, we continued to build on the momentum started in late Q2 when our employees, customers and supply chain partners increasingly were able to work safely and efficiently and began to get back to contributing to economic growth. \u2047 As the global community returned to work, strong underlying deferred demand became more evident, especially in our building products business. \u2047 While we expect this momentum to continue as vaccines help decrease risk, the construction industry is still contending with uneven regional disruptions due to COVID restrictions, severe weather in certain areas and tight labor dynamics, which is resulting in deferred demand continuing to build the backlog of work. \u2047 Turning to Slide 4. \u2047 2020 demonstrated yet again the exceptional and sustainable earnings power of the Carlisle business model. \u2047 Over the past several decades, Carlisle has been categorized as a diversified industrial company and rightly so as evidenced by our portfolio contact -- or content multiple acquisitions in a variety of segments ranging from fluid handling to medical technologies and our legacy strategic goals. \u2047 However, since CCM introduced the first single-ply EPDM roofing membranes to the market in the early 1960s. \u2047 Carlisle's growth and earnings have increasingly been powered by our construction materials business. \u2047 With over a half century of outstanding performance, CCM's influence on our overall performance has consistently expanded despite our diversification efforts peaking in 2020 when it accounted for over 70% of revenues and over 90% of earnings. \u2047 In the past three years, CCM has accelerated their world-class performance leveraging consistent organic growth focused on providing the ultimate customer service, the Carlisle Experience, and instituting greater price discipline, developing sophisticated sourcing and purchasing capabilities and maintaining a continuous improvement culture, all aiming to drive increased profitability and shareholder value. \u2047 In 2017, when we first contemplated Vision 2025, we turned a critical eye to our capital deployment efforts and started to pivot to a more disciplined ROI focus. \u2047 It was that critical assessment and objective view of value creation that drove our focus under Vision 2025 to apply a greater investment spotlight on the CCM. \u2047 A consistent 30% plus returns business, CCM's performance warranted and earn the right to share the majority of investment dollars that were allocated to portfolio diversification. \u2047 At that time, a key strategy of Carlisle's legacy approach of building out higher growth and presumably higher margin platforms as a path to sustainable value creation. \u2047 With the official rollout of Vision 2025 in February of 2018, our evolution was actualized evidenced by our recent extensive M&A and capital investments at CCM. \u2047 As shown on Slide 5, CCM has continued to evolve from its roots, the early 1960s of a simple, single-ply roofing membrane division to today where we deliver innovative easy to install and energy-efficient solutions throughout -- through the Carlisle Experience for customers who are creating the sustainable building for the future. \u2047 With our extensive line of building envelope products CCM offers complete set of solutions and systems to aid in the design of efficient building envelope efficient projects backed by industry leading warranties and a focus on green principles. \u2047 On Slide 6, you can see how this building envelope concept can deliver substantial energy savings for building owners. \u2047 CCM products provide a substantial offset to the estimated 40% of greenhouse gases globally generated from the construction and maintenance of buildings and our teams are focused on continuing to support the growing efforts in global energy efficiency. \u2047 It is because of this history of innovation, investment and continuous improvement that we have more conviction than ever that CCM's future success is secure. \u2047 We believe the extensive planning of Vision 2025 identified the strengths of CCM's core markets, demonstrated a consistent reroofing revenue stream and elevated the power of CCM's sustainable business model. \u2047 2020 only served to crystallize our confidence. \u2047 Turning to Slide 7. \u2047 I'd like to spend a few minutes talking in more detail about CCM's future and what drives our confidence in the CCM business model. \u2047 First, as you've heard us speak about it like CCM's core business is predominantly driven by replacement roofing demand. \u2047 Non-residential buildings built 10 to 20 years ago make up over 25% of current infrastructure and those roofs will need replacing in the next decade. \u2047 As a reminder, roof replacements are not discretionary. \u2047 Aided by the Carlisle experience and our market position, CCM should continue to capture placement of installed roofing systems and grow share with new energy-efficient, labor reducing and cost-effective product and solutions in the $6 billion and growing market. \u2047 While the majority of our core CCM business revenue comes from reroofing, past construction cycles evidenced residential construction as a strong leading indicator of new commercial construction, which augments core CCM growth. \u2047 Growing residential construction demand, which accelerated in 2020 coinciding with urban relocation due to COVID will require increased commercial infrastructure, including big-box retailers, hospitals, warehouses and educational buildings to support a growing population of suburban families and workers. \u2047 Second, as shown on Slide 8, the recent addition of our Polyurethane platform to CCM included spray foam insulation, which is a sustainable high single-digit growth market. \u2047 Our top performing formulations provide unmatched energy efficiency in both residential and non-residential applications. \u2047 Driven by our industry-first concept of the combined material and equipment solution, which we call IntelliSpray, it was developed and introduced with engineering support from Carlisle Fluid Technologies. \u2047 Carlisle's CCM is uniquely positioned to grow at above market levels in spray Polyurethane foam insulation. \u2047 This innovative new system will allow us to provide the contractor, builder and homeowner with greater application efficiency and control, savings from application efficiency improvements and ultimately a better foam insulation product. \u2047 Third, like Polyurethane, Architectural Metals is an exciting new platform for CCM, it's a $1 billion market growing at approximately 2 times GBP provides an attractive opportunity to diversify into the sloped roof market with a highly sustainable product. \u2047 Our metals platform is seeing healthy organic growth as it offers a lasting high ROI system solution to building owners, generating solid pull through sales of CCM insulation and other layman products. \u2047 To support our regional growth strategy, we are expanding our metals footprint in 2021 by opening three new locations in the U.S. Metal roofing systems also complement our drive to deliver solutions that support the construction of an efficient building envelope. \u2047 Metal roofs are 100% recyclable, increase energy efficiency of the building up to 20% versus traditional materials and reduce waste in the manufacturing process. \u2047 Fourth, we are committed to accelerating growth in Europe, a $10 billion -- or EUR10 billion addressable market. \u2047 To drive this growth, we recently changed leadership in the region and announced the investment of over $25 million to expand capacity in our German manufacturing facility. \u2047 Increasing demand and regulations for improved thermal performance along with integrated roofing systems are driving a shift to single-ply membranes in Europe. \u2047 CCM's leading environmental energy-efficient solutions lend themselves well to trends in the European market. \u2047 Recent industry dynamics reinforce our ability, the new ownership of the recently acquired competitor and it announced management addition at another competitor, shows the widespread belief of the strong prospects for the non-residential building product space. \u2047 The industry dynamics also support our strategy to accelerate growth in Europe. \u2047 And finally, as it was widely discussed after the recent acquisition, our increased focus on delivering the Carlisle Experience for the sustainable building of the future is in line with macro industry trends. \u2047 Before moving to our three other businesses, I want to reiterate how remarkable our CCM business and the team performed in 2020. \u2047 CCM was largely the story for Carlisle in 2020 and we expect that to continue into 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Regarding our other three businesses, on Slide 9, 2020 was obviously a difficult year due to the pandemic. \u2047 In the face of significant declines, the teams did a commendable job managing through the crisis, taking actions to reduce costs and position their businesses for the future, including leveraging COS, investing in new product development and rightsizing footprints. \u2047 While the results did not meet our expectations, these remain good -- very good businesses with solid management teams committed to weathering the current macroeconomic challenges. \u2047 We are optimistic that the actions taken in 2020 to improve CIT, CFT and CBF will position these businesses for a solid recovery, especially in 2021 for CFT and CBF where markets have signaled the bottom. \u2047 While we believe CIT will recover over a longer timeline, we are confident that there will be a recovery. \u2047 With higher inoculation rates from rapid vaccine rollouts, easing of COVID travel restrictions and an improved outlook for both aerospace and hospital capital spending, CIT will drive exceptional leverage with the resumption of growth. \u2047 Before Bob gives the financial details of the quarter, I'd like to touch on a few other notable achievements in 2020. \u2047 We've generated $2.5 billion of free cash flow over the last six years and recently accelerating significantly with almost half of that was generated in 2019 and 2020. \u2047 This track record of success supports our confidence and this team's ability to execute on our capital allocation strategy and to create value. \u2047 While 2020 was a subdued year for M&A, we are managing an active pipeline for accretive and synergistic acquisitions to rapidly scale our high returning businesses. \u2047 As always, our financial strength and cash flow generating capabilities afford us flexibility and we intend to remain opportunistic. \u2047 Notably, and as we've discussed in the past, when acquisition activity is subdued, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders. \u2047 This is evidenced by our deployment of more of than $380 million of share repurchases in 2020, totaling approximately $1.5 billion in share repurchases since 2017. \u2047 And at our latest Board meeting, our Board approved an incremental $5 million share repurchase authorization for Carlisle. \u2047 We also returned over $112 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in 2020, raising our dividend in August for the 44th consecutive year. \u2047 An finally, we spent $96 million of capex in 2020 and that plans to significantly increase that in 2021. \u2047 On Slide 11, we touch on our continued and expanded actions around ESG where Carlisle remains steadfast in our commitment. \u2047 Supported by COS, we are continually examining ways to improve the design and manufacturing of our products, seeking to better engage our employees and communities and improve an already strong regulatory framework. \u2047 In 2020, we also made progress in diversity and inclusion exiting 2020 with 50% of our Board of Directors identifying as gender, racially or ethnically diverse and meeting our 2020 target for percent of females in senior leadership positions. \u2047 And as we've stated many times before, ESG is part of Carlisle's culture of continuous improvement and we look forward to sharing more progress with you in the future. \u2047 We also encourage you to read more about Carlisle's ESG efforts on the Sustainability pages of our website. \u2047 In 2020, COS delivered savings of 1.3% of sales, well within our Vision 2025 annual target of 1% to 2%, a remarkable feat considering 2020's challenging conditions and proving that Carlisle employees truly embody and live our continuous improvement culture every day. \u2047 Another major milestone in 2020 was the launch of the Path to Zero, which represents our commitment to creating the safest possible work environment and features the goal of zero accidents and zero injuries. \u2047 COS will continue to be a unifying cultural imperative for our businesses to rely on as they seek new opportunities to make our operations and business processes more efficient. \u2047 Bob will now provide operational and financial details about our fourth quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. \u2047 Revenue decreased 7% to $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Organic revenue declined 9%. \u2047 Acquisitions contributed 1.4% of sales growth for the quarter and FX was a 60 basis point tailwind. \u2047 Turning to our margin bridge on Slide 14. \u2047 Q4 operating margin declined 180 basis points, pricing and volume headwinds combined for a 320 basis point decline and acquisitions were a 40 basis point tailwind. \u2047 Offsetting these declines, freight, labor, raw material, other operating costs netted to a 60 basis point improvement. \u2047 COS benefits added 120 basis points. \u2047 On Slide 15, we have provided an earnings per share bridge where you can see the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.57, which compares to $1.81 last year. \u2047 Volume, price and mix combined were a $0.74 year-over-year decrease. \u2047 Partially offsetting, interest and tax contributed $0.09 and raw material, freight and labor costs netted to a $0.16 benefit. \u2047 Share repurchases contributed $0.09, COS contributed $0.19, and finally, operating expenses were a $0.03 headwind. \u2047 While COVID-related volume declines clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter, our teams around the world did a commendable job managing costs, leveraging COS-improved efficiencies and taking actions to both position Carlisle for the recovery while mitigating the pandemic impact on earnings. \u2047 At CCM, the team again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 1% driven by volume and 30 basis points of foreign currency translation tailwind. \u2047 CCM continued to exhibit its resilience with solid U.S. commercial roofing performance despite the continued COVID-related restrictions in some areas restraining the recovery. \u2047 Our newer platforms of Architectural Metals"], "gold_summary":
