{"article": ["As a reminder, before we begin, the Company has a slide deck to accompany the earnings call this quarter. \u2047 Because these statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from the Company's current expectations. \u2047 I'm going to pass it over to Tom to begin. \u2047 Just as a preface, I think most of you who're on the call are aware that the major factor for the Company in this quarter is the -- really the same as it was in the first quarter and that is that we have not received either a proposed decision or a decision on our California General Rate Case, which was expected prior to January 1st of 2020. \u2047 I'm going to begin the results discussion on Slide 8 of the deck and talk a little bit about the quarter, and then on the year-to-date basis and then go on from there. \u2047 For the second quarter, I'll start at Slide 8, our net income decreased by $11.7 million to $5.3 million and that is a difference from a $0.35 gain in the second quarter of 2019 to an $0.11 gain in the second quarter of 2020, is that we had no rate relief from the California Commission. \u2047 And we estimate that if the rate relief would come in, there is two big factors here and it's the same two factors we talked about on the first quarter call. \u2047 There is a total of $29.1 million that we believe would have been achieved versus additional pre-tax income if the Commission has rendered a decision on a favorable basis to the Company. \u2047 And of that, for the second quarter, $10.9 million represents the pure delay of -- resulting from the settlement agreement that the Company filed with the consumer advocate back in October of 2019. \u2047 And so that is being tracked in an interim rate memorandum account for future recovery. \u2047 And then $18.2 million, which represents income from our disputed cost recovery regulatory mechanisms and those, remember, are mechanisms that we've had for many years, first of all, to decouple our sales from revenue. \u2047 We'll talk quite a bit more about that later in the call. \u2047 And then secondly, our regulatory mechanism for the pension and healthcare balancing accounts. \u2047 Because those are in dispute in the case, we didn't record them as we would normally have. \u2047 And had we recorded them in the quarter, we estimate an additional revenue of -- would have been $18.2 million. \u2047 Those regulatory mechanisms match up to some cost increases that we had in the quarter. \u2047 We had $6.5 million of increased water production expenses, of which $5.7 million would have been offset by those regulatory mechanisms and we had $2.1 million of increased pension benefit expenses which also would have been offset by those regulatory mechanisms, had they have been in place. \u2047 Other factors for the quarter, we saw a rebound in our unrealized benefit plan investment performance that was $3 million higher than in the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 And other things that happened which would be typical of a utility company in our situation, our depreciation expense went up very similar to the first quarter. \u2047 So it was up $2.2 million in the second quarter and that's related to increased plant investments in 2019, and we did have an increase in our maintenance costs of about $1 million. \u2047 Turning to Slide 9, on a year-to-date basis, very similar story and very similar explanation. \u2047 The numbers are different, but the explanation is the same. \u2047 So, our net income decreased by $24.4 million to a loss of $15 million on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 In terms of earnings per share, we have a loss of $0.31 per year to date as compared to a gain of $0.19 in 2019. \u2047 But, again, the two factors related to the rate case, we believe that had a rate case been adopted and it was favorable to the Company on these matters, the $19.8 million representing the delay of the settlement agreement amounts and $26 million related to our regulatory balancing accounts that we've been discussing. \u2047 For the year-to-date basis, our unrealized benefit plan investment performance was $4 million lower than in the first half of 2019 and that's really due to a comparatively strong market conditions in the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 And other impacts on a year-to-date basis, again, very similar. \u2047 We see depreciation expense increase $4.3 million and maintenance expense increase $1.6 million. \u2047 On Slide 10, this is a very similar slide to what we gave you in the first quarter earnings deck. \u2047 Our opinion of the estimated benefit from -- on a full year basis, from the California GRC has not changed. \u2047 As shown in the table on that chart, we believe the benefit is between $38.9 million at $42.2 million on an annual basis. \u2047 And so we continue to expect that when we get a decision in the case that that will be the benefit to the Company. \u2047 Our 2020 sales forecast, as we mentioned in last quarter, are about 7% lower than the 2019 adopted sales. \u2047 So in discussion of the WRAM and the MCBA, we believe that we're much more likely to be closer to adopted sales than we were in 2019. \u2047 And, as I mentioned earlier, we would have been allowed to record additional revenue of $5.6 million to $10.9 million in the second quarter if the settlement had have been adopted, with the low end of the revenue range linked with $5.2 million reduction in depreciation expense. \u2047 So, getting a little bit more granular on Slide 11 on the disputed GRC items. \u2047 I just wanted to point out that -- the two things that are the WRAM and the MCBA, we believe that on the -- in the second quarter, that's about $14.9 million that would have been recorded in those balancing accounts and the pension and medical cost balancing accounts, we believe, would have been $3.3 million. \u2047 And again, we're highly confident that past amounts that are recorded in those accounts are recoverable, regardless of the Commission's decision on a go-forward basis in our current General Rate Case. \u2047 And the other disputed items in the rate case, we don't believe are major factors in either the second quarter or the year-to-date results. \u2047 It certainly has been an interesting second quarter dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic as, I think most people know, utility workers are considered essential workers, and therefore, most of our employees, 90%-plus of our employees have been at work, in the field every day. \u2047 Accordingly, that makes protecting those employees as well as protecting our customers very, very important. \u2047 We are complying with all local regulations in our service areas, as well as we were an early mandator of mask and other PPE for all of our employees. \u2047 As you've probably seen in the press, California, and specifically, Southern California, LA counties and Kern counties have seen a surge in cases and we have seen increasing caseloads and hospitalizations in the past few weeks, as well as we've seen a handful of employees also contract the virus outside of work. \u2047 So in cases like that, we've been able to minimize any disruption of service. \u2047 Obviously, we isolate any employee that has any type of exposure, in order to keep them from getting other employees sick and we've have been successful in doing so. \u2047 Our Customer Centers in all four states have remain closed and will remain closed until further notice. \u2047 And we have suspended all collection activities in an effort to keep people supplied with water. \u2047 In addition, we've offered additional help through a direct grant program. \u2047 As you may recall, the Company allocated $0.5 million for charitable contributions. \u2047 Some of that went to work in local food banks and local food pantries throughout their service areas. \u2047 Another part of that grant went to what we called a direct aid or direct grant for customers who were struggling to pay their bills. \u2047 And so that's proven to be, I think, beneficial, and more importantly, I've received a lot of letters from customers who appreciate the fact that we were helping them out. \u2047 To date, we've had no disruption of service despite COVID-19 in addition to some of the rioting and stuff that we saw in Southern California at the end of May and in early June and so we have continued on track doing what we do best, which is providing clean drinking water for our customers. \u2047 Tommy, do you want to go through the business impacts of the pandemic? \u2047 So we have seen increased customer account aging. \u2047 And remember, this is due in part to the increased unemployment rate and also in part to the regulatory commissions telling us that we can't have collection activity. \u2047 The Company, I think as Marty may have noted last quarter, we voluntarily suspended collection activity before our state regulatory commissions required us to do that. \u2047 But nevertheless, there are now regulatory mandate to suspend collection activity. \u2047 And in California, that mandate, at this point, goes through April of 2021. \u2047 So it's going to be a long-term suspension of collection activity. \u2047 Our bills that are outstanding more than 90 days and those are the bills that would normally have been sent to collection, those bills increased to $3.4 million. \u2047 And in the past, when we've had those bills sent to collection only a portion of those amounts are typically uncollectible. \u2047 So we've raised our estimate on the balance sheet. \u2047 This is the bad debt reserve balance for doubtful accounts from $0.8 million to $1.6 million as of the end of the second quarter. \u2047 Our water sales have continued strong, particularly on the residential side. \u2047 That is offsetting a drag on sales in business, industrial, and public authority sales. \u2047 That last bit, I think, was school closures, for example, in the late spring. \u2047 We do see in resort areas in Hawaii, in particular, a decline in sales that we're observing there. \u2047 The California utility Cal Water, as we mentioned in the first quarter, activated the catastrophic event memorandum account that allows us to track costs associated with COVID. \u2047 And in the second quarter, we recorded approximately $600,000 of incremental operating expenses to the memorandum account. \u2047 Those are amounts that we will seek to recover in a later filing from the commission. \u2047 Memorandum account, as you'll recall, is not something that we typically book the revenue from until there is an authorization to recover that revenue. \u2047 In addition to the $600,000 of incremental operating expenses, when we do have bad debts and those do go to collection at the end of this period that will be included in our request to the Commission for recovery. \u2047 Hawaii has a very similar mechanism that we're working to put in place. \u2047 There has been a filing with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission as well there. \u2047 Our liquidity is strong. \u2047 At the end of June, at the end of the quarter, we had $114 million in cash and additional current capacity on our lines of credit of more than $170 million. \u2047 Marty, you want to talk to us about all the fun stuff in California? \u2047 Boy, there is a lot going on in California. \u2047 Starting off with, some of you may have seen the CPUC, the California Public Utilities Commission extended its deadline for considering and concluding on our 2018 General Rate Case to September 30th. \u2047 That means, in order to meet that deadline, the Commission must issue a proposed decision no later than August 25th. \u2047 So we continue to monitor that and hopes that we can get that wrapped up. \u2047 As Tom pointed out earlier, we're feeling the financial consequences of not having rate relief and it gets pretty confusing each quarter to talk about our results with and without rate relief. \u2047 So we hope to get that wrapped up in the third quarter. \u2047 Perhaps more importantly, from a policy perspective, on June -- excuse me July 3rd, the CPUC issued an unexpected proposal in an unrelated case and I want to read to you the full name of this OIR and I'll come back and talk about it. \u2047 The full name is called, Evaluating the Commission's 2010 Water Action Plan Objective of Achieving Consistency between Class A Water Utilities' Low-Income Rate Assistance Programs, Providing Rate Assistance to All Low Income Customers of Investor-Owned Water Utilities, and Affordability. \u2047 So it was an OIR looking at the consistency and the goals of achieving consistency of low income in rate assistance programs. \u2047 So this July 3rd proposed decision that kind of came out of[Indecipherable], if adopted would require Cal Water and other water utilities that are regulated by the CPUC to propose removing it's decoupling mechanism in the next General Rate Case. \u2047 This decision is troubling for a number of reasons. \u2047 First and foremost, it draws conclusions on a very, very limited set of data and evidence. \u2047 In fact we don't even know what was used to construct the data tables used by the Commission to draw these conclusions. \u2047 So we're very much involved and talking to the Commission last week and this week about this proposed decision and find it going in the wrong direction of the State's policy in support of conservation and the conservation goals of the state. \u2047 Just to remind everyone, California has Ag business that's over $60 billion. \u2047 It's the largest Ag state in the Union and we're growing in population from almost 40 million to 45 million over the next decade. \u2047 So the idea of getting rid of decoupling and basically implementing what's in this OIR essentially increases rates for most of the customers, including low income customers. \u2047 So we are just flat out against it and we're lobbying against it. \u2047 It's also unclear what the effect of this policy[Phonetic] decision could have on the current proposed decision that we're waiting for. \u2047 So legally, it should push into the next rate case cycle. \u2047 But we're looking into that and digging into that right now. \u2047 So, there'll be more to come on this -- on this PD that was issued here in early August. \u2047 We have a lot of efforts focused on basically asking for a halt to get more evidence on the record and to have a full examination of all the data that's available for the last 12 years of decoupling. \u2047 And we believe that the Commission would get to a different conclusion if they had all the evidence on the table. \u2047 Looking at the capital investments for the quarter, and this, frankly, was a highlight with everything going on that's been kind of negative news, it's nice to see that our capital program was up 9.5% compared to the same period last year. \u2047 So"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q2 earnings per share $0.11.  \u2047  q2
