{"article": ["I'm Pankaj Gupta, Dow investor relations vice president. \u2047 And joining me on the call today are Jim Fitterling, Dow's chairman and chief executive officer; and Howard Ungerleider, president and chief financial officer. \u2047 Dow's Forms 10-Q and 10-K include detailed discussions of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. \u2047 Unless otherwise specified, all financials, where applicable, exclude significant items. \u2047 We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. \u2047 On Slide 2, you will see our agenda for the call. \u2047 Jim will begin by reviewing our third-quarter highlights and operating segment performance. \u2047 Howard will share our modeling guidance and outlook, and then Jim will recap our strategy for disciplined value growth that we outlined at our investor day earlier this month and why Dow continues to be a compelling investment opportunity. \u2047 Starting on Slide 3. \u2047 In the third quarter, Dow achieved top and bottom-line growth, both year over year and sequentially. \u2047 Our proactive storm preparations enabled us to maintain the safety of our team and community and recover quickly. \u2047 We delivered a 53% sales increase year over year with double-digit gains in every segment, business, and region. \u2047 We also recorded a 7% increase in sales over the prior quarter. \u2047 We captured strong price momentum, driven by tight supply demand balances across our key value chains, and we achieved volume growth of 2% both year over year and sequentially, supported by continued strong end-market demand despite supply and logistics constraints. \u2047 We increased operating EBIT by more than $2.1 billion year over year with improvements in all segments and businesses and $58 million higher sequentially. \u2047 Key contributors included year-over-year margin expansion of 1,170 basis points, driven by price momentum and demand growth, and increased equity earnings, up $189 million, for margin expansion at our Sadara and Kuwait joint ventures. \u2047 Our continued focus on cash generation and our balanced disciplined capital allocation enabled us to deliver cash flow from operations of $2.7 billion, up $958 million year over year, driven by margin expansion from price momentum in key value chains. \u2047 We returned a total of $918 million to shareholders through our industry-leading dividend of $518 million, plus $400 million in share repurchases. \u2047 And we also reduced gross debt by more than $1.1 billion in the quarter. \u2047 Our proactive liability management actions to tender existing notes have resulted in no long-term debt maturities due until 2026, and we've reduced annual interest expense by more than $60 million. \u2047 Overall, Dow continues to deliver on its priorities, and we see further strength ahead as we benefit from a favorable macro backdrop and execute our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our footprint and grow earnings, driving significant value for all stakeholders. \u2047 Moving to our segment performance on Slide 4. \u2047 In the packaging and specialty plastics segment, operating EBIT was $2 billion, compared to $647 million in the year-ago period. \u2047 Sequentially, operating EBIT was down $60 million. \u2047 Price gains in both businesses and in all regions led to margin improvement in the core business and increased equity earnings. \u2047 On a sequential basis, operating EBIT margins declined by 300 basis points on higher feedstock and energy costs. \u2047 The packaging and specialty plastics business reported a net sales increase year over year, led by local price gains in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. \u2047 Volumes declined year over year due to lower polyethylene supply as a result of planned maintenance turnarounds and weather-related outages in the quarter. \u2047 Compared to the prior quarter, the business delivered price and volume gains on strong demand in industrial and consumer packaging applications, which were partly offset by hurricane-related outages. \u2047 Moving to the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment. \u2047 Operating EBIT was $713 million, up $609 million year over year, primarily due to continued tight supply and demand in both businesses. \u2047 Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $65 million, and operating EBIT margins expanded by 50 basis points on volume and price gains in both businesses. \u2047 The polyurethanes and construction chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year-ago period with price gains in all regions on tight supply demand balances. \u2047 Volume declines year over year primarily reflected the planned transition of a low-margin coproducer contract, as well as weather-related outages and third-party supply constraints. \u2047 Sequentially, the business delivered sales growth due to increased local price and volume from additional supply availability to meet resilient demand. \u2047 The industrial solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year-ago period with local price gains in all regions. \u2047 Volume increased year over year on strong demand for materials in industrial manufacturing and energy applications. \u2047 Net sales also increased sequentially, driven by volume growth, primarily in coatings and industrial applications from increased supply and local price gains in all regions. \u2047 And finally, the performance materials and coatings segment reported operating EBIT of $284 million, up $209 million versus the same quarter last year as margins increased 750 basis points due to strong price momentum and robust demand recovery for silicones and industrial coatings offerings. \u2047 Sequentially, operating EBIT was up $59 million on price gains, leading to margin expansion of 210 basis points. \u2047 The consumer solutions business achieved higher net sales year over year with price gains in all regions. \u2047 Volume increased over the prior year on stronger consumer demand for personal care, mobility and electronics offerings. \u2047 Sequentially, sales were down as price increases in all regions were more than offset by volume declines as a result of planned maintenance and third-party supply and logistics constraints. \u2047 The coatings and performance monomers business delivered increased net sales year over year as higher raw material costs and tight supply/demand balances led to price gains in all regions. \u2047 Volumes were down year over year as demand recovery for industrial coatings was more than offset by weather-related outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints. \u2047 Sequentially, the business delivered local price gains in all regions, supported by increased volume due to continued strong demand for acrylic monomers and architectural coatings and increased supply availability. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we see a continuation of robust demand growth across our packaging infrastructure, consumer, and mobility end markets. \u2047 Brand owner inventory levels remain low. \u2047 And as a result, we anticipate higher seasonal demand continuing into the holiday season this year. \u2047 In packaging and specialty plastics, we continue to see resilient demand for packaging applications and for our differentiated functional polymers. \u2047 Global polyethylene supply remains constrained as the industry completes higher turnaround activity and supply chains recover from weather events on the U.S. Gulf Coast. \u2047 We exited the third quarter experiencing higher raw material and energy costs which we anticipate will likely persist through the fourth quarter. \u2047 We expect these costs to be an approximately $350 million headwind sequentially. \u2047 Dow will continue to utilize our broad geographic footprint and best-in-class feedstock flexibility to help mitigate these impacts. \u2047 We also anticipate a $175 million tailwind from turnarounds in the quarter as we completed our planned maintenance at our cracker in Canada. \u2047 In industrial intermediates and infrastructure, continued consumer demand for furniture and bedding, appliances, pharma, and home care are expected to keep supply tight in our key value chains. \u2047 Due to the weather-related outages in the third quarter, some of our planned turnaround activity was moved to the fourth quarter. \u2047 Sadara will also start a turnaround at its isocyanate facility in the fourth quarter as well. \u2047 Altogether, we anticipate $100 million in this segment from turnaround impacts. \u2047 Short-term increased energy costs in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Europe are expected to be an additional $100 million headwind in the quarter. \u2047 We continue to see sequential recovery in industrial activity, particularly for energy applications. \u2047 We anticipate this recovery will continue at least through the fourth quarter as industrial production continues to ramp up from very low inventory levels to meet demand. \u2047 In performance materials and coatings, demand for electronics, mobility, building, and construction continues to outpace supply. \u2047 Demand for architectural coatings is also expected to remain elevated due to persistently low inventory levels across the value chain. \u2047 Global production for silicones has been impacted by the recent dual control policy enforcement actions in China, with silicone metal prices almost three times their previous highs. \u2047 We intend to pull forward a scheduled turnaround at a siloxane facility in Zhangjiagang in China to coincide with government actions to curtail power usage. \u2047 Our current estimate for the quarter includes $125 million from increased raw material costs and turnaround impacts. \u2047 We'll continue to work on mitigating the impacts of rising raw material costs through our integrated position in both businesses. \u2047 Despite higher raw material and energy costs in the fourth quarter, Dow will continue to leverage its advantaged global footprint, structural cost, and feedstock advantages, as well as our broad suite of differentiated products, to meet growing demand. \u2047 On Slide 6, as we look ahead, we expect robust economic growth to continue. \u2047 With the Delta variant slowing the reopening of economies around the world, there remains significant pent-up demand globally, particularly across our industrial and consumer end markets. \u2047 Many industries continue to see elevated order backlogs, coupled with low inventory levels, as supply chain struggled to keep up with robust demand. \u2047 These supply chain disruptions are expected to persist, which will certainly prolong the ability to restock inventories across most value chains. \u2047 As a result, we expect tighter-than-forecasted market conditions to continue, a view strengthened by China's recent dual control policy that has impacted both cold olefins and methanol to olefins-based capacity, which represent more than 30% of China's total polyethylene production. \u2047 2022 GDP growth forecasts are well above historical averages in most areas of the world as industries ramp up to match the robust consumer demand with further upside as global chip shortages continue to extend the recovery in manufacturing. \u2047 Collectively, G7 countries have not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic GDP. \u2047 This points to additional upside as economies return to more normalized consumption levels with degree of vaccination increasing, particularly in Asia, where levels remain low relative to the rest of the world. \u2047 Moving to Slide 7. \u2047 At our investor day earlier this month, we outlined how our differentiated portfolio and our focus on sustainability-driven innovation will enable more than $3 billion in underlying EBITDA improvement across the cycle. \u2047 Our restructuring program and digital investments will yield $600 million in increased EBITDA. \u2047 Both are in progress, and our restructuring program is on track to achieve its $300 million run rate by year end. \u2047 We also have a suite of higher return, lower risk, and faster payback capital and operating investments that will enable an additional $2 billion in EBITDA in the near term. \u2047 And our investments to decarbonize and grow at our Fort Saskatchewan site in Alberta, Canada are also expected to deliver approximately $1 billion in increased EBITDA. \u2047 And as we've already shared, we're executing against a favorable macro backdrop that we expect will continue to support constructive market fundamentals for our key value chains. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8. \u2047 You'll see the detailed list of these low-risk growth investments. \u2047 Our capital investments are expected to generate $1 billion in EBITDA through incremental capacity expansions, debottlenecking, and enhanced feedstock flexibility across our operating segments. \u2047 We're already making good progress. \u2047 For example, in packaging and specialty plastics, our Fort Saskatchewan expansion to add ethylene capacity of 65,000 metric tons per year to support growing polyethylene demand is now complete and will ramp by the end of the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our FCDH pilot plant in Louisiana will start up in 2022, featuring 20% to 40% lower capex and 5% to 7% lower opex while reducing CO2 emissions by up to 20% compared to other PDH technologies. \u2047 In industrial intermediates and infrastructure, our debottlenecking project to add 60,000 metric tons per year of aniline will be fully online by year end. \u2047 And earlier this year, we signed an MOU for a new South China hub to advance local supply and formulating capabilities to serve the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market. \u2047 In performance materials and coatings, we recently completed a capacity expansion at one of our silicone polymer plants. \u2047 And by year end, we will complete a new silicone sealant compounding unit to enable sustainable solutions for high-performance building and infrastructure applications. \u2047 And we are progressing our 50 kt methacrylate investment on the U.S. Gulf Coast to support global end markets, such as inks, resins, and packaging materials, which is scheduled to come online in the first half of next year. \u2047 In addition, our operating investments are also expected to generate another $1 billion in EBITDA as we improve our production capabilities and shift our product mix to higher growth and higher value markets. \u2047 For example, in industrial intermediates and infrastructure, we're increasing capabilities and shifting our mix toward higher-margin polyurethane systems for mobility and consumer applications. \u2047 Our industrial solutions business is increasing capabilities to supply differentiated materials into the textile market. \u2047 Our ECOFAST collaboration with Ralph Lauren lowers energy usage by 40% and water usage by 50% in the fabric dying process. \u2047 And by 2025, the brand aims to incorporate this technology in more than 80% of its solid cotton products. \u2047 In performance materials and coatings, we're expanding our ability to formulate differentiated silicones for a number of attractive markets, including silicone adhesives for foldable displays in consumer electronics, thermal conducted silicone solutions for electric vehicles, and silicone solutions for 5G where the market is expected to more than double over the next 10 years. \u2047 And we recently partnered with customers on high-value innovations like paper barrier coating applications that use our award-winning Rhobarr polyolefin dispersion technology and Callaway's Supersoft golf balls, which feature a new hybrid cover made with Dow's paraloid-impact modifier. \u2047 In packaging and specialty plastics, we're enhancing our extensive conversion and testing capabilities to commercialize residents through packaging design, speeding the innovation process, and expanding the addressable market for higher margin and more sustainable products. \u2047 For example, we're already benefiting from the nine-layer blown film extrusion line project completed this year. \u2047 We're also making investments to improve asset reliability, which will increase output and expand margins. \u2047 And we're using digital technology for customer trials and process automation to accelerate catalyst development for new resins and processes like FCDH where we can typically be 100x more efficient than conventional experimentation. \u2047
