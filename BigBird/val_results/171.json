{"article": ["They involve risks and uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially. \u2047 Our comments also include non-GAAP measures. \u2047 On a U.S. GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2021, NOV reported revenues of $1.25 billion and a net loss of $115 million. \u2047 Later in the call, we will host a question-and-answer session. \u2047 2020 is 1-2 punch of an oil supply price war, followed closely by an oil demand crushing global pandemic led to a sharp decline in demand for oilfield equipment and consumables through the year. \u2047 NOV's results for its first quarter of 2021 reflect the full impact of the shock wave emanating from the combination of these events that led to this historically painful downturn in an industry noted for painful downturns. \u2047 As we reported in our operational update on March 16, the quarter was further impacted by other factors: severe winter weather and power outages in Texas and Oklahoma led to 63 NOV facilities being shuttered for a week or more. \u2047 Additionally, new pandemic control measures flared up overseas, which shut down another couple of large plants and disrupted our supply chains for certain raw materials, notably fiberglass and resin. \u2047 And as if that weren't enough, the quarter also ended up being impacted by higher costs on two projects related to poor execution on our part. \u2047 In one case, a new pipe design has proven more expensive to manufacture than expected. \u2047 And another, an offshore platform component was delayed because our engineering took longer than expected. \u2047 Both have been corrected. \u2047 Despite these, the final quarterly results, slightly exceeded our March forecast due to better progress on cost reductions overall as well as, and this is important, more and more green shoots emerging in the oil field, particularly in Wellbore Technologies and particularly in North America. \u2047 Although we would still face headwinds in many markets, our confidence continues to mount that the worst is behind us. \u2047 North American oilfield activity continued its recovery during the quarter, with March revenues up sharply from January for certain of our earlier cycle domestic businesses, while international results began to point to early signs of a recovery as well. \u2047 Nevertheless, the first quarter sequential decline in capital equipment revenues reflect the pummeling our backlog took in 2020, which led to consolidated revenue declines of 6%. \u2047 EBITDA fell to breakeven, which is unacceptable and is prompting further cost reductions. \u2047 As a provider of capital equipment and spares to the oilfield, our results lag those of our customers, generally speaking. \u2047 The first quarter of 2021 reflects the preceding nine months of crashing oil demand and a virtual cessation of capital spending, offset by substantial downsizing and cost reductions. \u2047 We believe this down cycle is the worst our industry has ever seen. \u2047 Oil prices went negative in April. \u2047 In August, the U.S. rig count hit its lowest level since records began in World War II. \u2047 North American frac fleet utilization hit single digits. \u2047 By year-end, more than 100 North American oil and gas companies had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with a combined debt of over $100 billion. \u2047 Were not for a couple of large projects that were awarded before the lockdown, FIDs for offshore projects in 2020 would have marked the lowest since 1960. \u2047 Although the recovery has begun taking hold in many markets, average first quarter rig counts were down 46% for North America land, 36% for international land and down 31% for offshore year-over-year. \u2047 When I say that it has been a historically bad downturn, what I mean is that it has been a measurably provably historically bad downturn. \u2047 In this environment, our oilfield service customers are sticking to the tried and true survivor playbook of cannibalizing equipment, spares and consumables, deferring maintenance, reducing spending to bear substance levels and hoarding precious cash. \u2047 NOV's largest competitor in this environment is idled equipment. \u2047 By fall, every stacked rig had become an incremental source of drill pipe, shaker screens, handling tools, etc at same dynamic applies across all categories of oilfield equipment when utilization collapses and service companies fight to keep the lights on. \u2047 A year ago, day rates began racing to find bottom at daily cash costs, which were insufficient to cover long-term maintenance cash costs, much less the capital consumption costs represented by depreciation. \u2047 For many sectors, year-end 2020 day rates reflected desperation. \u2047 Companies discounting to keep some assets and crews working and spending cash only as a last resort. \u2047 Consequently, NOV's oilfield backlogs fell throughout the year and first quarter annualized revenue run rate is down 45% from just five quarters ago. \u2047 Here's the good news. \u2047 160 years of oilfield history demonstrates that this dynamic is always temporary. \u2047 The amount of idled equipment available to be parted out falls as activity resumes and dwindling spares and consumables must be restocked as utilization improves. \u2047 We're beginning to see the early signs of this in certain areas as rigs and frac fleets go back to work. \u2047 Idled stripped drilling rigs must have cannibalized pumps and handling tools replaced to go back into service. \u2047 And this rebuilding, restocking and reactivation phenomenon occurs at a time when service company desperation is evaporating and optimism is growing with rising oilfield activity. \u2047 We know this because NOV has lived it through recovery cycles like this in the past. \u2047 As the oilfield goes back to work, customers will soon start to worry about nontrivial cash investment required to reactivate rigs and equipment. \u2047 Think about the courage required to put your precious cash into the business that almost killed you last year. \u2047 That's what these customers face when it comes to reactivations. \u2047 We believe our customers will require higher pricing on their incremental assets going back to work in order to mitigate risk by achieving quicker paybacks on their reactivation investments. \u2047 Plus they'll need to cover rising wage pressures and other inflationary forces and more on that in just a moment. \u2047 And if oil prices remain constructive, pricing momentum will lift margins and return significantly, such is the nature of the cyclical business we serve. \u2047 NOV will be a key recipient of this unit reactivation investment. \u2047 As various basins and categories of equipment pass through the inflection to emerge into higher day rate regimes, their orders for capital equipment will accelerate. \u2047 This is the sweet spot of our business model. \u2047 The historical oilfield events of 2020 have led predictably to an enormous disassembly of well construction capability by the oilfield services industry, the tried and true playbook I referred to earlier. \u2047 Every surviving oilfield service company on the planet has made it this far by downsizing extraordinarily well. \u2047 Collectively, our surviving customers are the dream team of cost-cutters. \u2047 And they have been hard at it for several years before, tripling their cost-cutting ferocity in 2020. \u2047 It stands to reason that the aggregate capacity to construct wells has been materially diminished in our view. \u2047 If the global economies continue to recover out of COVID and demand more oil, the oilfield services industry will be tested to get back to normalized levels of wellbore construction sufficient to meet rising oil demand. \u2047 We think that's more likely than not. \u2047 First, governments around the world responded to the economic turmoil of the pandemic with unprecedented stimulus packages. \u2047 For instance, the G10 plus China passed more than $20 trillion of stimulus in the aggregate. \u2047 This has led to stunning money supply growth. \u2047 The U.S. M2 is up 27% year-over-year, as an example. \u2047 Generally, money supply growth and low interest rates inflate asset prices, including commodity prices like oil. \u2047 Next, drug companies invented a vaccine, several, actually. \u2047 While there are fits and starts, global vaccination efforts are progressing, positioning the world to emerge from the pandemic lockdown. \u2047 Huge economic stimulus and a powerful catalyst, vaccines, to more or less simultaneously open economies, coupled with sharply improved household balance sheets and a widespread desire to get our lives back to normal, well, I cannot conceptualize a more compelling recipe for a synchronized global economic recovery of a size that we have not seen since the 1950s post-war boom. \u2047 We believe this synchronized recovery will lead to rising oil consumption. \u2047 In fact, leading demand indicators for crude oil, gasoline and distillate already point to a stronger recovery than many economists expected, and global inventory levels appear to be normalizing ahead of schedule. \u2047 On the whole, this is a highly constructive backdrop for oil prices for the next few years in our view. \u2047 Key risk to this thesis include excess Saudi and OPEC capacity, which is scheduled to trickle in over the next several months, and the possibility of the return of Iranian crude production. \u2047 However, record levels of crude inventories achieved through the first half of 2020 have, to the extent we have visibility into them, largely dissipated. \u2047 That only happens because withdrawals have exceeded additions. \u2047 So supply, held artificially low by OPEC, has been less than demand, held artificially low by the pandemic lockdown. \u2047 And the key question is, what will the picture look like as artificial constraints on both ease. \u2047 Another risk is the productivity of U.S. shales which achieved extraordinary levels of growth off and on throughout the past decade. \u2047 Simul fracs and other advancements point to the relentless march of the domestic E&P industry toward greater efficiencies. \u2047 But to be fair, the domestic E&P industry was helped in the prior era by, one, gobs of cheap capital that fuel drilling programs seeking production growth; and two, duress in oilfield services that held pricing below that required to replace, let alone earn a return on the capital consumed in the construction of these wellbores. \u2047 Capital, when they can get it, is far, far more expensive now. \u2047 And it feels like it is becoming even more so as ESG factors play a more prominent role in investment decisions. \u2047 And the incremental investments that will be required to restore oilfield service well construction capabilities will also demand higher returns. \u2047 Layer in on top of that, the consolidation among domestic E&P operators, the higher cost of attracting labor back to the oilfield while a major economic expansion is under way, giving workers a lot of other high-paying options, and well, you get the picture; a return to material production growth from U.S. shales will be more challenging this time around from where we sit. \u2047 Behind the artificial production constraints imposed by OPEC, Russia and Saudi Arabia, the artificial consumption restraints imposed by COVID economic lockdowns lies impressive depletion math. \u2047 All oil wells decline. \u2047 To what level has the aggregate natural decline of oil well has been obscured by these artificial constraints. \u2047 We can debate about what the true supply demand picture looks like, but one thing we can all agree on is that both are far more opaque in 2021 than any prior year. \u2047 After all, we've never had an economic shutdown like this before. \u2047 My point is this, when the industry materially cuts its expiration, its development, it's steady construction of the platforms, projects and wells that produce the oil that our global economy relies on, and further, eviscerates the tools of the oilfield services industry that actually do the work, there will be a day of reckoning. \u2047 Throughout this historic period, NOV has been steadfast in: one, reducing our costs, which are down $12.6 billion since 2014, including approximately $2 billion in annual fixed cost reductions; two, improving our cash flow, which has delevered our balance sheet; and three, investing in the next-generation of technologies, both for the oilfield as well as emerging renewables opportunities. \u2047 Whether it's the next-generation of rig floor technology, like our robotic pipe handling system controlled in our NOVOS digital environment; our ideal e-frac fleet, outfitted with our QuickLatch system and FlexConnect frac host system to remove both emissions and manpower from the completion process; or NOV Max, our digital platform that brings out -- brings all the disparate data sources together for the operator to utilize as he or she sees fit. \u2047 NOV remains at the forefront of the next-generation of oilfield technology. \u2047 Our push into supporting the energy transition focuses on areas where we believe we can carve out significant competitive advantages while delivering superior economic returns for our customers in wind, solar, geothermal and other emerging energy sources. \u2047 seven out of eight Wellbore Technologies business units posted sequential growth in the first quarter, reflecting surging demand for certain products. \u2047 Consequently, we began to add shifts to manufacturing, and we achieved the highest level of absorption we've seen since the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 NOV witnessed share gains for our ReedHycalog bits in West Texas and Saudi Arabia, despite increasing prices due to strong performance and rising activity. \u2047 Drilling motor demand is also increasing and downhole friction reduction tools are completely sold out in certain North American markets as revenues were up more than 30% sequentially. \u2047 We pushed drilling motor pricing up double digits in some areas. \u2047 North American rig instrumentation and solids control services pricing is up double digits on new work back to pre-COVID levels and poised to rise further. \u2047 In our international markets, we expect our wired drill pipe jobs to increase over 25% in the second quarter. \u2047 As operators become increasingly convinced of the value of real time, high bandwidth data from the bottom of their drill strings, something that's only available through our proprietary IntelliServ Wired Drill Pipe technology. \u2047 Global OCTG demand appears to be picking up, which led to double-digit sequential growth in NOV Tuboscope's pipe inspection services worldwide. \u2047 And despite continuing day rate pressure on drilling contractors, Grant Prideco posted a book-to-bill greater than 100% as operators are requiring larger 5.5-inch drill pipe to accommodate better hydraulic performance, leading drilling contractors to purchase this pipe with our proprietary Delta premium connections. \u2047 On the whole, higher oil prices and higher rig counts, particularly in North America, placed Wellbore Technologies at the forefront of the oilfield recovery. \u2047 On the other hand, Completion & Production Solutions and Rig Technology segments continue to battle through low capital equipment backlogs and stingy customer spending. \u2047 However, the CAPS segment saw its book-to-bill for new capital equipment orders above 100% for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019, an indication of better results to come. \u2047 The group's North American quick turn businesses began to see improvement. \u2047 North American production chokes backlog popped 30% and our reciprocating pump backlog grew 69% sequentially. \u2047 We won another Tier four dual fuel fleet upgrade for a domestic pressure pumping service provider and demand for coiled tubing strings tripled from its low point in the second quarter of last year. \u2047 While we"], "gold_summary": ["national oilwell varco q1 2021 revenues of $1.25 billion, a decrease of six percent compared to q4 of 2020.
