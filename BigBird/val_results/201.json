{"article": ["A few orders of business before we proceed. \u2047 We are providing to the SEC our 10-Q report today. \u2047 There has been some delays on the part of the SEC. \u2047 But we will get that done today. \u2047 They deal with the quarter and they deal with our strategic growth initiatives. \u2047 So if you're all online, you will see them scrolling across your screen. \u2047 If you are on audio, telephone only, you can see such slides by going to our website. \u2047 There is an icon on the very front page that allows you to see those slides. \u2047 Our usual cautionary reminder, which we will do before beginning. \u2047 Such factors include weather conditions, changes in regulatory policies, competitive pressures and other risks that are identified in the Company's SEC reports and filings. \u2047 Such information will not necessarily be updated by the Company. \u2047 In today's call, we will first be starting with our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 David Johnson, who will review the quarter and the nine months followed by Mr. Eric Wintemute, Chairman and CEO of the Company who will talk about our strategic growth initiatives. \u2047 We also have Mr. Bob Trogele present to answer any questions you may have. \u2047 Going forward, we intend to keep you apprised on how we are doing against these targets, just as I do with respect to matters that are key to investors, understanding our business performance such as inventory and borrowing capacity. \u2047 With regard to our public filing, as Bill mentioned, our 10-Q document for the three and nine months ended September 30th, 2020 is presently in queue to be filed today. \u2047 I do understand that the agency that assists us with our filing has a large number of documents in the queue at this time. \u2047 Everything I am covering here is included in more detail in that document. \u2047 As we have noted in previous calls, the Company is fortunate to participate in industries that are considered part of critical infrastructure in all countries in which we operate. \u2047 As a result, our customers and our suppliers have all operated more or less without disruption during the pandemic. \u2047 This has continued through the third quarter. \u2047 Having said that, the pandemic has impacted us in a few ways, including our ability to present new sales and marketing ideas such as new products face to face with customers in the field. \u2047 We have also seen customer buying patterns that appear to have been moderated in the face of pandemic-related uncertainties. \u2047 On the other hand, the same restrictions have caused us to spend less on operating expenses. \u2047 These marketplace changes have been challenging to manage. \u2047 However, we have succeeded in maintaining a profitable performance throughout this difficult period. \u2047 With regard to our financial performance for the three months ended September 30th, 2020, the Company's net sales decreased by 6% to $117 million as compared to sales of $125 million this time last year. \u2047 Within that overall decline, our US sales were down about $7.5 million and our international sales were flat. \u2047 International sales accounted for 43% of net -- of total net sales as compared to 41% of net sales this time last year. \u2047 The main factors driving our third quarter sales performance are as follows. \u2047 In our US crop market, sales were affected by reduced cotton acres, which according to USDA statistics, are down about 11% or 1.5 million acres in 2020. \u2047 Acres were impacted by cotton commodity prices that are down, driving growers to plant alternative crops. \u2047 Our market performance has also been impacted by extreme drought conditions in West Texas and frequent hurricanes in the Southeast USA, both affecting grower ability to apply our products. \u2047 On a plus note, we saw a stronger than expected demand for our fumigant products, which are sold into the potato markets. \u2047 The better than expected performance is attributed to cautious reopening on schools and restaurants across the United States. \u2047 In our domestic non-crop market, there were small quarter-over-quarter changes with some decline on our pest strip products which are used in bars and restaurants that were impacted by pandemic restrictions. \u2047 With regard to international sales, which were overall flat, there were really three factors. \u2047 First, we had a very strong performance in Mexico, Central America and Australia. \u2047 By contrast, our Brazilian sales were down in real terms as a result of reduced insect pressure and challenges getting in front of customers because of pandemic restrictions. \u2047 In addition sales translated from local currency to US dollars were further negatively impacted by a decline in local currency exchange rates quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Finally, whereas we saw Mocap and Nemacur sales lower in Europe, both products recorded significant sales increases in other parts of the world. \u2047 As you can see from the table, the US crop market was where we recorded reduced sales. \u2047 This is pretty much in line with other market participants that have reported Q3 results. \u2047 Our international business increased as a percentage of consolidated net sales and our comparatively low exposure to foreign currency rate movements was a strength for the quarter. \u2047 With regard to the nine-month performance, the various market dynamics described for the quarter are broadly the same. \u2047 Our US crop business was impacted by reduced cotton acres and by growers making cautious decisions with regard to input as the pandemic gradually revealed its impacts. \u2047 As an offset, we have done a bit better than expected with fumigants as schools and restaurants reopened. \u2047 And in addition, we've had the benefit of sales of products acquired in the fall of 2019. \u2047 Our non-crop business in mosquito control has been a little lower than we hoped given the storm intensity impacting our main markets, mainly due to vector control districts using existing inventory. \u2047 Finally, our international sales have performed well, given the challenges with currency devaluation in some of our key markets. \u2047 Moving now to cover our gross profit performance. \u2047 For both the quarter and the year-to-date, the trends are fairly similar. \u2047 In our US crop business the drop in gross profit was driven by our lower sales of cotton products and partially offset by strong fumigant sales. \u2047 In non-crop, the impact of reduced sales of Dibrom and pest strips were negative for the quarter and was somewhat offset by strong sales in our horticultural business which has slightly lower margins. \u2047 During the quarter, we also recorded higher royalty income on our Envance technology business. \u2047 For the international business, the decline in foreign exchange rates was offset entirely in the three-month period and to a lesser degree in the nine-month period by strong performances in Central America, Australia and Mexico. \u2047 As a result of these various dynamics, gross margin performance in the quarter reduced from 38% to 37% and for the nine-month period from 39% to 38%. \u2047 For the quarter, our manufacturing performance was strong with factory operating cost well controlled and activity improved as compared to 2019. \u2047 Generally speaking, over the long term our net factory costs amount to about 2.5% of net sales, reflecting some latent capacity in our plants should the need arise. \u2047 This kind of available capacity is necessary to help manage our production planning effectively. \u2047 In the third quarter our factories cost approximately 2.4% of sales as compared to 2% this time last year. \u2047 The third quarter is typically a strong manufacturing period for the Company. \u2047 For the first nine months, the net factory costs amounted to 1.6% as compared to 2.4% of net sales for the same period of 2019. \u2047 For the three months ended September 30th, 2020, our operating expenses decreased as compared to the same period of the prior year. \u2047 The underlying performance is greater than its parent from the published statements because in 2019 we benefited from an adjustment to earn out liabilities on past acquisition. \u2047 That benefit did not recur this year. \u2047 On the other hand, we did record a benefit of approximately $1 million during the third quarter because we completed an update to our environmental risk assessment related to the Brazilian business we acquired at the start of 2019 which led to a decrease in our liability in this regard. \u2047 As we have reported for prior periods this year, our operating expenses were reduced because travel and entertainment costs were lower as a result of pandemic restrictions in all jurisdictions in which we operate. \u2047 Our costs were also reduced because of the translation effect caused by devaluation of currencies that are important for the Company, including the Mexican, Brazilian and Australian currencies. \u2047 With regard to the nine-month period ended September 30th, 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, our overall expenses have reduced. \u2047 The reported reduction actually understates the real improvement because in 2019 we benefited from adjustments to earn out liabilities related to past acquisitions in the amount of $3.5 million that did not recur this year. \u2047 As a result, our underlying costs are down approximately $5.5 million or 5% for the nine months. \u2047 The drivers of the reduced costs are similar to the quarter. \u2047 We have spent less on travel and entertainment because of pandemic restrictions. \u2047 Both short and long-term incentive compensation is tied to financial performance and has reduced in 2020 compared to 2019. \u2047 Finally, operating expenses incurred in currencies other than the US dollar are reduced as a result of the devaluation of those currencies I have already mentioned. \u2047 I've mentioned adverse exchange rate movements in three key currencies for the from the Company's perspective. \u2047 I want to put some color on that comment. \u2047 If we had used the 2019 exchange rates for both the three and nine-month periods of 2020, our reported net sales would have increased for the three months by $3 million and for the nine months by $7 million. \u2047 When looking at gross margin, we would have recorded additional gross margin of $700,000 in the three-month period and $1.7 million year-to-date. \u2047 Notwithstanding these impacts we have been effective at putting in place some natural hedges. \u2047 That is that the majority of our operating expenses for the businesses in territory are also in local currency. \u2047 That mitigates the impact on sales and gross margin leaving relatively immaterial differences at the bottom line resulting from translation exposure. \u2047 The Company experienced some significant transactional related exposures during the first quarter of the year. \u2047 This has reduced as exchange rates have settled at new levels during the second and third quarters. \u2047 During the third quarter, we recorded lower interest expense than this time last year. \u2047 Our average debt was lower than the prior year and we got a benefit from reduced borrowing rates in the US. \u2047 In the nine-month period, our average debt was a little higher than the prior year, but we gained the benefit for the lower federal base rate resulting in significantly lower interest expense. \u2047 Finally, our effective tax rate continues to decline in comparison to the prior year as we are having a stronger international performance in jurisdictions with lower rates this year as compared to last year. \u2047 In the three-month period, we earned $0.10 per share as compared to $0.11 per share in the same period of the prior year. \u2047 For the nine-month period, we earned $0.25 per diluted share as compared to $0.34 per share last year. \u2047 From my perspective, the operating and financial focus of the Company remains as follows. \u2047 We continue to follow a disciplined approach in planning our factory activities balancing overhead recovery with demand forecasts and inventory levels. \u2047 At the end of September 2020, our inventories were at $176 million as compared to $186 million this time last year. \u2047 During the intervening periods we have made acquisitions and added inventory as a result. \u2047 The underlying period-over-period improvement in our base inventory before the impact of recent acquisitions amounted to approximately $14 million or 7.5%. \u2047 We are highly focused on our balance sheet as we navigate through this pandemic period and having lower inventories at this point of the year is pleasing to report. \u2047 As we look at the final quarter of the year and our target for December 31st, 2020 inventory, Eric will comment in a moment about acquisitions that we closed in the first and second week of the final quarter of this year. \u2047 As a consequence, our inventory forecast will now be amended to incorporate these new businesses. \u2047 In previous conference calls, we expected to end in the region of $145 million. \u2047 Given our latest operations planning assessment, we are expecting that our underlying inventory will increase a little from our prior forecast. \u2047 In addition, the new acquisitions that Eric will mention in a moment are expected to add approximately $15 million at December 31st, 2020. \u2047 Accordingly, our latest forecast is to end the year at approximately $160 million to $165 million, effectively flat with 2019, but including the addition of inventory from recent acquisitions. \u2047 Our business has a distinct annual cycle and we continue to experience expansion -- and we routinely experience expansion in working capital in the first part of the year and a reversal in the second part. \u2047 During 2020 we, like most businesses, have been highly focused on working capital and its impact on debt levels. \u2047 During the period of the year when we typically expand working capital, we have contained the increase to only $5 million as compared to adding $49 million in the same period of 2019. \u2047 This careful management of working capital is driving the improved cash generated from our operating activities. \u2047 In the first nine months of 2020 we have generated $19 million from operations as compared to using $21 million in the first nine months of 2019. \u2047 Comparatively that amounts to a positive change of $40 million period-over-period. \u2047 At September 30th, 2020 net indebtedness ended at $149 million as compared to $165 million this time last year. \u2047 During the last year, in addition to paying down $16 million in debt, we have funded more than $27 million in investments, including fixed assets, product acquisitions and technology investments from the cash generated from operations. \u2047 These investments are focused on developing our consolidated business for the future. \u2047 With regard to liquidity at the end of the third quarter, availability under our credit line was $45 million, which compares to $30 million at the same point in 2019. \u2047 In summary, for the third quarter and for the nine-month period though our sales were down, selling prices and gross margins in each territory remained good. \u2047 We are seeing a stronger international performance than this year and the mix of US sales, generally higher gross margin, and international sales, generally lower gross margin, is tending to bring the average down slightly. \u2047 Our factory performance improved compared to 2019 and our expenses for operating costs, interest and tax are all lower in 2020 than in the comparable periods of the prior year. \u2047 From a balance sheet and cash perspective, we are doing very well, managing working capital and our debt is lower than this time last year, notwithstanding our investments in long-term growth of our business. \u2047 Finally, availability under our credit line has improved. \u2047 With that I will hand over to Eric. \u2047 Many of our investors have expressed an interest in"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports qtrly earnings per diluted share of $0.10.  \u2047  american vanguard corp qtrly net sales of $117 million,
