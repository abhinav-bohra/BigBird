{"article": ["During our call, management may discuss certain items which are not based entirely on historical facts. \u2047 And of course, on the call, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in its review of the business and believes will provide insight into the company's ongoing operations. \u2047 Joe and I will share highlights of our fourth-quarter performance and what we're seeing quarter to date. \u2047 And by now, you've heard most others in our space. \u2047 And despite the volatility we're all facing, it's good to see the category and the industry moving in the right direction. \u2047 You'll hear some of the same themes from us, like progressive improvements throughout the quarter as dining rooms reopened, growth in off-premise and digital expansion. \u2047 The biggest difference you'll hear is in our level of performance. \u2047 By staying true to our strategy and making aggressive moves to grow the business, our team has navigated this pandemic very well. \u2047 Chili's generated significant top-line progress throughout the quarter. \u2047 And with our operators' disciplined margin management, we delivered positive cash flow for the quarter, which we used to pay down debt. \u2047 Our debt load is now below our pre-pandemic level. \u2047 We continued this momentum into July, ending the month with Chili's down just 10.9%. \u2047 And in the 84% of our company-owned restaurants with open dining rooms were down just 3.8%, and 36% of our company-owned Chili's restaurants ran positive comp sales for the month. \u2047 It wasn't our quick reaction to the crisis that enabled us to deliver these results. \u2047 It was our choice to stay true to the strategy we've been working for more than two years. \u2047 We had already made significant progress in the areas required to thrive in this environment; off-premise, digital, value and scale. \u2047 We didn't have to scramble in the pandemic hit. \u2047 We walked into it with seven solid quarters of performance. \u2047 All we had to do is stay focused and push the accelerator a little harder. \u2047 As a result, we set the bar in casual dining, landing the top spot in sales and traffic for three straight months according to KNAPP-TRACK, and we're poised for continued future success. \u2047 You've heard how many restaurant companies are leaning into digital to manage through this crisis. \u2047 And while Chili's is no exception, we were leading the way in the digital space long before the pandemic. \u2047 Over the past decade, we've made significant investments to build our digital infrastructure, foster connections with guests and enabling us to quickly respond to their evolving dining needs. \u2047 Increasing convenience is a big component of how we leverage our digital capability. \u2047 We can lean into our 8 million member loyalty database, gain check-level purchasing insight from our tabletop devices and continue to improve our five-Star app with features like one-tap reorder of our guests most frequent-ordered items. \u2047 And last year, we integrated DoorDash into our POS system and our e-commerce experience, making it possible to shift our marketing focus from national TV spots to our digital platform, where we continuously test and learn to increase e-commerce conversions. \u2047 And as a result, our digital sales of off-premise meals have grown from low teens to more than 50% in the fourth quarter with only a slight dip as dining rooms reopen. \u2047 We have also driven frequency -- increased frequency through our takeout and delivery channels at a fraction of the marketing expense. \u2047 That's the beauty of a digital strategy that makes dining easier and more convenient for guests. \u2047 Because we can meet them where they are, guests use us more. \u2047 Finally, here's something you haven't heard from anyone else in our space. \u2047 During the last fiscal week or last week of fiscal 2020, we accomplished something no other restaurant company has ever done. \u2047 In a single day, we launched It's Just Wings, our first virtual brand, in 1,050 Chili's and Maggiano's across the country. \u2047 Sales continue to build every week, and we clearly see the potential to exceed $150 million in the brand's first year, which would secure It's Just wings a spot in the top 200 restaurant brands. \u2047 Over the years, casual dinings has been deemed for being overbuilt. \u2047 We believe this is our opportunity to prove that maybe it isn't overbuilt, it's just underutilized. \u2047 It's Just Wings leverages existing buildings, equipment and labor. \u2047 Even after aggressive pricing and marketing, buying quality ingredients and packaging and paying our last-mile logistics partner, we're generating strong flow-through. \u2047 The brand's guests are highly incremental to Brinker concepts, and their feedback is extremely positive. \u2047 Satisfaction ratings are among the top restaurant brands on DoorDash and[Inaudible] is high, and we're just getting started. \u2047 We created this business in six months and launched it overnight with minimal investment in a consumer channel where demand is growing by more than 100% annually. \u2047 Taking into account our scale, the capacity of our kitchens, our exclusive partnership with DoorDash, we believe our ability to win in this space is unmatched. \u2047 So we're testing additional virtual concepts and learning how to drive visibility among the millions of DoorDash guests looking for food delivery options and how to continually improve our operations to meet consumer demand for speed, food quality and value. \u2047 We are pleased to have not one but two brands that rank among the most popular on the DoorDash platform, and we're excited about the potential that lies ahead. \u2047 Obviously, things aren't back to normal for any of us yet, but we see a bright future for all the Brinker brands. \u2047 We promised you last quarter that no matter what came our way, we would do two things; put the safety of our guests and team members first and continue to perform and take share. \u2047 I couldn't be more proud of how our operators and our support teams have delivered on both of those promises and how we're creatively and boldly building our future together. \u2047 No matter what lies ahead, with the talent on our team, the power of our brands and the scale at our disposal, we start from a position of strength. \u2047 Regardless of the descriptor you put on the operating environment to the most recent quarter and a number of less complementary ones come to mind, our operators quickly adjusted course to the realities of the pandemic and rose to the challenge to exceed expectations with the results delivered. \u2047 For the fourth quarter of FY '20, Brinker reported consolidated net comp sales of negative 36.7%, although comp sales recorded material improvement as the quarter progressed with the June period consolidated results down 19%. \u2047 Both brands generated a positive progression of performance through the quarter with Chili's leading the casual dining sector from a comp sales perspective. \u2047 While the reported quarterly net comp sales for the brand was a negative 32.2%, performance progressed from down 51% in April at the height of the dining room closures to down only 13% for the June period. \u2047 Chili's outpaced the competition throughout the quarter with comp sales positive the casual dining sector by approximately 13% and traffic positive to the sector by approximately 18%. \u2047 More than 25% of our corporate Chili's restaurants reported positive comp sales for the June period, a percentage, as Wyman earlier stated, that increased to 36% in July. \u2047 Our P&L highlights for the quarter were total revenues of $563 million, a restaurant operating margin of 6.4% and an adjusted loss per diluted share of $0.88. \u2047 Included in the $0.88 loss is a burden of approximately $0.18 due to the timing of recording expenses related to annual and long-term incentive compensation plans beyond what would typically be recorded in the fourth quarter in our G&A expense. \u2047 Throughout this crisis, our team has done an exceptional job of taking care of our guests and team members and has proven an equal ability to effectively manage expenses in the face of meaningful sales decreases. \u2047 Our managers have been efficient in utilizing our scheduling tools to optimize labor hours to fit the current business environment. \u2047 Hourly labor and payroll tax have a good degree of variability and were favorable year over year, although total labor, including restaurant management, was unfavorable in the quarter by 260 basis points driven by sales deleverage. \u2047 Restaurant expense margin for the quarter increased by 6.2%, again primarily due to sales deleverage. \u2047 Despite our operators reducing year-over-year spend in this area by more than $29 million, we recorded meaningful savings in advertising spend, repair and maintenance and supplies related to on-premise dining, a portion of which we believe will be ongoing. \u2047 As to cost of sales, we were positive 30 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to favorable menu mix. \u2047 By earlier commented, our restaurant operating margin from the quarter was 6.4%. \u2047 However, in conjunction with the progress we made, top line, our operating margin improved through the quarter, increasing to 12.2% for the June period. \u2047 Assuming an improving operating environment, we believe we are set up for additional margin improvement as we carry forward identified efficiencies, further open dining room capacity and leverage sales from our virtual brand, It's Just Wings. \u2047 Strengthening the balance sheet is an important part of our financial strategy moving forward, and we are currently focusing free cash flow toward debt reduction and liquidity enhancement. \u2047 To further enhance our liquidity position, we executed an equity offering in the quarter, raising approximately $139 million, which was used to pay down revolving credit debt. \u2047 Our overall total debt balance at fiscal year end was approximately $1.2 billion, a reduction of just over $220 million from the end of the third quarter as revolving credit borrowings decreased from $700 million to less than $473 million. \u2047 Our liquidity, which we consider to be cash balances and revolving credit availability, now exceeds $575 million. \u2047 In addition, we recently completed a 15-month extension of our revolving credit facility now maturing in December 2022. \u2047 As sales and cash flows improved, we resumed new restaurant development activity that have been temporarily halted early in the quarter. \u2047 We plan to open or relocate four new Chili's restaurants during this current quarter. \u2047 Now as to operating guidance, while in past years, we would typically provide annual guidance for Brinker during this earnings call, potential volatility and unknowns of the current operating environment makes that exercise difficult. \u2047 Instead, we are providing some limited guidance as to our consolidated performance for the current first quarter and anticipate providing quarterly insights as we move through the year. \u2047 For Brinker in the first quarter, we expect consolidated comp store sales to be down in the low to mid-teens range. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per diluted share are currently estimated to be a loss in the range of $0.25 to $0.40. \u2047 We anticipate positive operating cash flow, and weighted average shares is estimated to be 45 million to 46 million shares. \u2047 I would also like to remind everyone that fiscal year 2021 includes a 53rd week, which takes place during the fourth quarter. \u2047 Despite the difficulties experienced from this pandemic, our team has risen to the challenge. \u2047 Our strategy of focusing on value, convenience and safety has proven to be well received by our guests has given us the ability to outperform our competition and leaves us very well-positioned to continue to take market share as we move through the fiscal year. \u2047 I greatly appreciate the hard work and commitment from our team members, especially those on the front line serving our guests each and every day. \u2047 I have every confidence we will continue to demonstrate our ability to sustain our progress and return to growth on the top and bottom line for the long term. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["chili's total comparable restaurant sales decreased 10.9% in fiscal 2021 q1-to-date.  \u2047  sees q1 adjusted net loss per diluted share to be in range of
