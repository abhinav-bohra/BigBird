{"article": ["I'm joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. \u2047 We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. \u2047 I hope you and your loved ones remain safe and healthy as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect all of our professional and personal lives. \u2047 In the second quarter, we delivered better-than-expected results given uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 In terms of numbers, our revenue grew 4% operationally, with the U.S. segment up 6% and International up 3%. \u2047 Our companion animal products continue to drive our business performance, with 13% operational growth, while livestock products declined 5%. \u2047 Our adjusted net income increased 4% operationally in the second quarter. \u2047 We have built a very strong companion animal portfolio over the last several years based on our internal innovation. \u2047 And these products helped offset some of the deeper market challenges in the livestock market today. \u2047 Our recently launched parasiticides, Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12 and Revolution Plus as well as our key dermatology portfolio of Apoquel and Cytopoint, provide a solid foundation that has continued to perform well this year. \u2047 We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new triple-combination parasiticide for dogs, Simparica Trio as well as the strength of the overall Simparica franchise. \u2047 Glenn will share more details in his remarks. \u2047 Our continued focus on meaningful innovation and the diversity of our portfolio across species, products and geographies remain core advantages for Zoetis during times of economic uncertainty. \u2047 And we've also seen the essential nature of animal health playing an important role in the resiliency of our business and our industry at this time. \u2047 In terms of COVID-19, our veterinary and producer customers are under increased pressure to deliver critical animal care and maintain a reliable global food supply, and we are fortunate to be able to support them in this mission. \u2047 We continue to put the safety of our colleagues and customers first during this pandemic, and we've been very pleased with our team's ability to maintain productivity, even with safety and social distancing adjustments at our facilities as well as the ongoing use of remote work arrangements for the majority of our colleagues. \u2047 Our field force has returned to meeting with customers in many geographies based on local guidance and practices. \u2047 We monitor and adapt these plans on a daily basis based on local feedback and adjustments in markets that may be experiencing increased COVID-19 cases. \u2047 Our teams are excited to be back out with our customers, but we're also preserving the lessons we have learned from effective online interactions, webinars and e-commerce to evolve our sales and support. \u2047 In terms of supply chain, Zoetis has maintained a reliable inventory of critical medicines, vaccines and diagnostics to our customers and distributors in more than 100 markets around the world. \u2047 And our research development programs remain on track in terms of filings, clinical trials and interactions with regulatory agencies. \u2047 We remain confident in the progress of regulatory reviews of our monoclonal antibody candidates for pain in cats and dogs. \u2047 Our submissions are proceeding as expected. \u2047 This year continues to be uncharted territory due to COVID-19 and the related trends affecting our customers. \u2047 However, the underlying demand for healthy pets and a reliable source of protein remains fundamental to the global economy. \u2047 In the second quarter, we benefited from the veterinary clinics in the U.S. recovering much more quickly from the COVID-19 impact than we anticipated. \u2047 Veterinary practices in the U.S. adapted quickly to curbside visits and mobile clinics to deliver critical care and maintain relationships with their customers. \u2047 We also saw an acceleration of companion animal product sales through e-commerce channels as a result of the lockdowns in many states. \u2047 Veterinarians and pet owners are adapting more quickly to these online options as a way to fill prescriptions for parasiticides and other medicines. \u2047 We also know people are spending more time at home with their pets. \u2047 They may be observing conditions such as itchiness or pain, which have previously gone unnoticed. \u2047 And so we are actually seeing an increase in spend per visit in U.S. clinics. \u2047 Meanwhile, outside the U.S., companion animal veterinary clinic performance has been in line with expectations despite wide market-by-market variations based on local dynamics. \u2047 For Zoetis, we expect our overall revenue growth for the remainder of the year to be driven largely by companion animal products, especially our parasiticides and key dermatology portfolio. \u2047 We plan to continue investing in direct-to-consumer advertising and digital marketing to support these products. \u2047 Livestock is a very different picture and remains very challenged by the pandemic, especially in the U.S. Producers are adjusting to new market demands and distribution needs from foodservice and restaurant channels to more grocery and retail channels, while also managing ongoing labor, safety and trade issues. \u2047 As expected, U.S. livestock in the second quarter saw a significant downturn as we expect that to remain a challenge for the rest of the year. \u2047 The pace of return to more foodservice and restaurant demand, along with increased export opportunities, will be the most significant factors in the recovery of livestock producers in the U.S. Internationally, livestock grew and performed in line with expectations across a diverse set of markets. \u2047 We saw very positive results in places like China, where they're further along in their COVID-19 recovery, but we will be sensitive to see how Latin America and markets like Brazil perform in the remainder of the year due to COVID. \u2047 As we look ahead, we remain focused on advancing our five key priorities to ensure our long-term success, driving innovative growth, enhancing customer experience, leading in digital and data analytics, cultivating a high-performing organization and championing a healthier, more sustainable future. \u2047 We've continued to make important investments in products and innovations across the continuum of care from prediction and prevention to detection and treatment of disease, Supporting successful launches as well as new life cycle innovations and expansions of major products into new markets continue to be the cornerstones of our durable and steady performance. \u2047 In the second quarter, we expanded major vaccine franchises with the approval of our Vanguard B Oral for dogs in Brazil and our Fostera Gold PCV MH and Fostera Gold PCVMetastim for vaccines for pigs in Australia. \u2047 We also continue to strengthen our diagnostic and digital capabilities, building on recent acquisitions in point-of-care and reference labs, along with additional investments. \u2047 We plan to launch a new diagnostic platform for pet care in the third quarter called VetScan Imagyst. \u2047 We are very excited about the potential for this disruptive innovation, which will be the first system to bring clinical pathology right to the point of care. \u2047 This new multipurpose platform uses a combination of image recognition technology, algorithms and cloud-based artificial intelligence to deliver rapid testing results to the clinic. \u2047 Its first indication will be for testing fecal samples for parasites, making it quick and easy to test and treat pets in the same visit. \u2047 We'll have more to say in the coming weeks as we prepare for a global launch. \u2047 We also view diagnostics as playing an important role in the continuum of care for fish. \u2047 In the second quarter, we acquired Fish Vet Group to add more diagnostic tools to our aquaculture portfolio, including environmental testing, which is critical to fish farming. \u2047 Finally, at Zoetis, our key priority around high-performing teams is tied to creating a culture where all colleagues feel valued and included and is reflected in our commitment to promoting inclusion, diversity and equity across our organization. \u2047 Our leadership and Board are dedicated to being a force for positive change across the globe to drive greater equity and inclusion. \u2047 And we have dedicated financial and people resources to do so. \u2047 Now let me hand off to Glenn, who will speak more about our second quarter results and updated guidance for the full year. \u2047 I hope everyone is safe, healthy and adapting to what is certainly an unprecedented time for all of us. \u2047 Today, I will provide additional commentary on our Q2 financial results, provide an update on our liquidity position and review our improved full year 2020 guidance. \u2047 Beginning with the second quarter results. \u2047 We generated revenue of $1.5 billion, which was flat on a reported basis and 4% growth operationally. \u2047 Adjusted net income of $427 million decreased 2% on a reported basis and increased 4% operationally. \u2047 Foreign exchange in the quarter had an unfavorable impact of 4% on revenue. \u2047 This was driven primarily by the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and euro. \u2047 Operational revenue growth of 4% was driven by 2% price and 2% volume. \u2047 Volume growth of 2% includes 3% from new products, 3% from key dermatology products, 1% from acquisitions and a decline of 5% in other in-line products. \u2047 Companion animal products led the way in terms of species growth, growing 13% operationally, while livestock declined 5% operationally. \u2047 Companion animal performance was driven by our parasiticide portfolio, which includes sales of Simparica Trio in the U.S., Canada and certain European markets and our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint. \u2047 Revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance and its nutritional products, acquired in the second half of 2019, drove the growth in equine. \u2047 Livestock declines in the quarter were driven by challenges to our U.S. livestock portfolio. \u2047 Supply chain disruptions caused by reduced animal processing capacity and shifts in consumer demand from restaurant and foodservice to grocery stores affected our customers' purchasing decisions. \u2047 This decline was partially offset by strong performance internationally with growth in swine, fish and poultry. \u2047 New products contributed 3% to overall growth in the quarter, driven by Simparica Trio, ProHeart 12, Revolution Plus and our Alpha Flux parasiticide for salmon in Chile. \u2047 We remain excited by the launch of Simparica Trio and are reaffirming the range of $100 million to $125 million for full year incremental revenue. \u2047 Trio have been more robust and cannibalization of Simparica has been less than we anticipated. \u2047 Global sales of our key dermatology portfolio were $224 million in the quarter, growing 24% operationally and contributing 3% to overall revenue growth. \u2047 Recent acquisitions contributed 1% growth this quarter, which includes Platinum Performance and our reference lab expansion strategy. \u2047 Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. \u2047 U.S. revenue grew 6%, with companion animal products growing 19% and livestock products declining by 18%. \u2047 Companion animal growth in the quarter was driven by sales of the Simparica franchise, our key dermatology products and the impact of recent acquisitions. \u2047 U.S. key dermatology sales were $160 million for the quarter, growing 26%. \u2047 The continued strength of this portfolio was driven by expanded usage of both Cytopoint and Apoquel benefiting from our direct-to-consumer campaign, uptake in e-commerce channels and pet owners spending more time with their pets as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 Simparica Trio performed well in the U.S. with sales of $36 million despite challenging market conditions in Q2. \u2047 We are observing several positive trends, including rapid uptake in clinics that have adopted Trio, smaller-than-expected cannibalization of Simparica, sales coming from new patients to the category and taking share from current oral flea and tick competitors. \u2047 Diagnostic sales increased 18% in the quarter, largely driven by our reference lab acquisitions. \u2047 In addition, previous instrument placements created a solid foundation for consumables growth in the second quarter. \u2047 U.S. livestock declined 18% in the quarter, driven by lower sales across all species. \u2047 In the second quarter, we faced challenges with significant declines in feedlot placements, reduced demand from the foodservice industry and the effects that had throughout the food supply chain and our customers, in addition to increased competition. \u2047 To summarize, U.S. performance was strong in a difficult market environment. \u2047 And the diversity of our portfolio, again, proved beneficial as growth in companion animal offset the challenges faced in the U.S. by our livestock portfolio. \u2047 Our International segment had operational revenue growth of 3% in the second quarter, with more balanced performance across our companion animal and livestock portfolios. \u2047 Companion animal operational revenue growth was 2% and livestock operational growth was 4%. \u2047 Increased sales in companion animal products was a result of growth in our key dermatology portfolio and our Simparica franchise, including the launch of Simparica Trio in Canada. \u2047 While European markets were impacted significantly by COVID-19, the decline was offset by significant growth in other markets, including Japan and China. \u2047 Diagnostics had a difficult quarter as wide-scale clinic closures resulting from COVID-19 limited the ability to place instruments and negatively impacted consumable usage. \u2047 International livestock growth in the quarter was driven by swine, fish and poultry. \u2047 Swine grew double digits in the quarter, primarily driven by China, which grew 25%, as key accounts continue to expand their herds and production shifts from smaller farms to larger-scale operations. \u2047 Our fish portfolio delivered another strong quarter. \u2047 We saw favorable conditions in Chile and Norway that resulted in vaccinations being accelerated into Q2. \u2047 In addition, we continue to see an uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile. \u2047 Overall, our international segment was again a positive contributor to revenue growth, with performance in swine, companion animal, fish and poultry more than offsetting decline in cattle resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. \u2047 Adjusted gross margin of 71.1% increased slightly on a reported basis compared to the prior year due to price, favorable manufacturing costs and product mix, which were partially offset by foreign exchange, recent acquisitions and higher inventory charges. \u2047 Adjusted operating expenses were flat operationally. \u2047 The incremental advertising and promotion expenses related to Simparica Trio, recent acquisitions and R&D increases were largely offset by reductions to T&E and compensation-related costs as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%. \u2047 The increase versus prior year is driven by the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the impact of discrete tax benefits recorded in Q2 2019. \u2047 Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 4% operationally, primarily driven by revenue growth, and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew"], "gold_summary": ["sees fy 2020 earnings per share $3.14 to $3.32.  \u2047  sees fy
