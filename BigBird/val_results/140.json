{"article": ["I am so pleased to be able to open our comments by saying we have successfully eliminated several ongoing operator challenges, executed on $46 million in new investments and have an active and healthy pipeline. \u2047 At the same time, the industry is recuperating from the incredible strain created by the pandemic. \u2047 I have said before that our industry handled the unimaginable with grace and poise and is proving that seniors housing is a safe and necessary component of our national network of healthcare in the United States. \u2047 While there are still some challenges to overcome, I continue to believe that the industry's strength and perseverance will help us navigate the new normal. \u2047 In LTC's portfolio, occupancy gains are continuing, vaccination rates among patients and residents remain high, and the potential of the vaccine mandates among staff holds the promise of continuing to reduce the impact of COVID in our buildings. \u2047 It seems the recovery has begun and should continue into the new year. \u2047 Before I get into our LTC-specific discussion, I'd like to spend a moment discussing industry staffing. \u2047 The problem is very real, but our operators are working constantly and creatively to find viable solutions. \u2047 I have not spoken to an operator yet that has not had trouble finding and retaining qualified employees. \u2047 Operators are turning away residents and patients due to the labor shortage and the resulting staffing challenges. \u2047 We have heard from several operators that if not for the current labor constraints, they could increase occupancy. \u2047 So they are increasing wages and providing sign up and retention bonuses to help meet this demand. \u2047 Additionally, in-person school is now open, freeing parents to be able to reenter the workforce. \u2047 And COVID-19 related add-ons to unemployment insurance have expired, requiring a return to work for some to make up for that income shortfall. \u2047 However, the Child Tax Credit that most families are receiving and is proposed to be part of the Build Back Better legislation will likely continue to provide public support sufficient enough to keep some people from returning to work. \u2047 On the plus side, it has been reported recently that Texas, where we own 34 properties, passed a bill to support long-term care in the state. \u2047 The bill proposes $200 million in grants for skilled nursing and $178.3 million in grants for assisted living communities and other care-based providers to help fund staffing recruitment and retention. \u2047 We would love to see other states follow this example. \u2047 Government support for our industry is continuing. \u2047 There is about $17 billion available for distribution to healthcare providers through Phase four of the Provider Relief Fund and another $8.5 billion available for distribution to rural providers through the American Rescue Plan. \u2047 The portal for requesting aid closed a few days ago on the October 26 deadline. \u2047 So we anticipate receipt of funds by operators later this year at the earliest. \u2047 In a recent interview with Provider Magazine, Mark Parkinson, who has been a past guest on our earnings calls said, and I quote, \"the Delta variant has caused a pause in the financial recovery of the sector\". \u2047 Combined with increasing staff costs that we are already experiencing, we are going to need continued help from both the federal and state governments. \u2047 He believes that there is a bipartisan support stemming from the efforts made by providers throughout the pandemic, but that passing legislation in a divided Congress will make real change difficult, highlighting the need for actions that don't require congressional approval. \u2047 However, short of a new highly contagious variant or COVID surge, I truly believe that our industry is on more solid footing today than it has been since the pandemic began. \u2047 And I remain hopeful that some of the remaining pressures will continue to abate over the coming months. \u2047 Now moving to our third quarter. \u2047 Rent and mortgage interest income collections, excluding Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle were 94%. \u2047 We have received no new substantial requests for rent deferrals and abatements. \u2047 With occupancy increasing and pent up demand for needs-based care, we don't expect to see a big change in rent deferrals and abatements in the fourth quarter. \u2047 For the last several quarters the requests we've received have been from the same small subset of operators, and that has not changed. \u2047 We do expect to continue providing some amount of relief until the occupancy gains become more permanent. \u2047 The Senior Lifestyle portfolio transition is complete with the exception of one building in New Jersey that is awaiting licensure, which we are expecting at any time. \u2047 We have fully transitioned the senior care portfolio as well. \u2047 With these challenges successfully addressed, we are excited to be working with new operators and solidifying relationships with current operators who have the resources and desire to stabilize operations and further grow occupancy. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, we recently completed 46 million in investments and have built a healthy pipeline. \u2047 We remain focused on shorter-term cash flow strategic deals that have what we believe to be reduced risk profiles and look forward to announcing additional investments over the next several months. \u2047 We have ample access to liquidity to act on these opportunities to provide accretive returns for LTC and our shareholders. \u2047 We maintained our $0.19 per share monthly dividend by paying out $22.4 million in common dividends during the quarter to our shareholders. \u2047 The payout ratio on our dividend, excluding nonrecurring items was approximately 100% for the third quarter. \u2047 If we used pro forma performance, including recently completed investments, the third quarter FAD payout ratio excluding nonrecurring items would be approximately 96%. \u2047 Although this remains well above our preferred payout ratio of approximately 80% of FAD, we expect our 2022 FAD to improve with the additional revenue from the releasing of the Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle portfolios, which will help bring the payout ratio more in line with historical levels. \u2047 With respect to guidance, for the fourth quarter we expect FFO to increase approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share, excluding nonrecurring items from third quarter results. \u2047 Please note, this guidance does not include the recovery of any deferred rent or additional investments. \u2047 Now I'll turn things over to PAM. \u2047 Total revenue decreased $701,000 compared with the third quarter of last year, resulting principally from unpaid rent from senior care and senior life, abated and deferred rent and the sale of a property in Washington. \u2047 The decrease was partially offset by the write-off of straight-line rent receivable balances in the prior-year quarter, rent received from releasing 18 properties in the Senior Lifestyle portfolio, completed development projects and increase in property tax revenue, annual rent escalation, capital improvement funding and higher payments from Anthem. \u2047 Interest income was comparable year-over-year. \u2047 Interest expense decreased 751,000, mostly due to scheduled principal pay-downs on our senior unsecured notes and lower interest rates on our line of credit, partially offset by a higher outstanding balance on our line of credit. \u2047 Transaction cost increased four million, related mostly to our settlement with senior care and related fees. \u2047 During the 2021 third quarter, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of $2.7 million related to the sale of a skilled nursing center in Washington. \u2047 In last year's third quarter, we recorded a $900,000 impairment charge related to a closed assisted living property in Florida, which was sold in the first quarter of 2021 and received 373,000 in insurance proceeds for damage related to a property sold in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Net income available to common shareholders decreased by $1.2 million, primarily due to the previously discussed revenue decline and settlement and related fees for senior care. \u2047 The decrease was partially offset by a prior-year impairment charge and a current-year gain on sale. \u2047 NAREIT FFO per diluted share was $0.45 this quarter compared with $0.58 in last year's third quarter. \u2047 Excluding non-recurring items, FFO per share was $0.55 this quarter compared with $0.71 in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 The decrease excluding nonrecurring items with due to receiving 0 rent from Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle, abated and deferred rent and higher G&A expense. \u2047 These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues resulting from releasing 18 properties in the Senior Lifestyle portfolio, completed development projects, mezzanine loan funding and lower interest expense. \u2047 During the 2021 third quarter, we funded a $4.4 million mezzanine loan and a $1.8 million mortgage loan. \u2047 Additionally, we funded $2.8 million in capital improvement projects on properties we own. \u2047 Subsequent to the end of the quarter we funded two mortgage loans for a total of $39.5 million. \u2047 Clint will discuss our investment activities in a moment. \u2047 During the third quarter we borrowed $68.5 million under our unsecured revolving line of credit and paid $25.2 million in scheduled principal pay-downs on our senior unsecured notes. \u2047 Currently we have $5.9 million of cash on hand, $465.6 million available on our line of credit with $134.4 million outstanding and $200 million available under our ATM. \u2047 This leaves us with ample liquidity of $671.5 million. \u2047 We have no significant long-term debt maturities over the next five years. \u2047 At the end of the 2021 third quarter our credit metrics remain strong with a debt-to-annualize-adjusted EBITDA for real estate of 5.8 times, and annualized adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.3 times. \u2047 And a debt-to-enterprise value of 35.3%. \u2047 Pro forma for recently completed investments. \u2047 Annualized adjusted EBITDA for real estate was 5.7 times. \u2047 The annualized adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio was 4.3 times, and debt-to-enterprise value was 32.9%. \u2047 I'll finish my discussion with rent deferrals and abatements. \u2047 As Wendy mentioned, excluding Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle, we collected 94% of third quarter rent and mortgage interest income. \u2047 During the quarter we provided $1.3 million in rent deferrals and $970,000 in rent abatements. \u2047 As Wendy noted, these deferrals and abatements relate to the same small subset of operators that have been receiving ongoing relief from us. \u2047 As a reminder, Senior Lifestyle did not pay us rent in 2021. \u2047 With the exception of the one property Wendy discussed, the portfolio is transitioned and we are receiving contractual rent from the operators who now lease these properties. \u2047 Although Senior Care did not have rent in the third quarter, we do expect to receive rent from HMG as performance improves. \u2047 Clint will provide more detail. \u2047 In October, we provided rent deferrals totaling $438,000 and rent abatements totaling $240,000. \u2047 We have agreed to provide rent deferrals of up to $441,000 and abatements of up to $240,000 for each of November and December 2021. \u2047 I'll start today by putting a bell on our Senior Lifestyle and Senior Care portfolios. \u2047 As Wendy discussed, these portfolios have been fully transitioned but for the licensure of one property currently operated by Senior Lifestyle in New Jersey. \u2047 By and large, the properties in this portfolio have generated occupancy gains under new management. \u2047 In total, we have transitioned 18 of the Senior Lifestyle buildings with the 19th expected shortly. \u2047 For these 19 buildings, occupancy for the month of December 2020 was 71%, increasing to 75% for the month of September 2021. \u2047 I'd like to provide some additional color on the six properties in the portfolio with market-based rents. \u2047 At June 30, EBITDAR, excluding stimulus, on a trailing 12-month basis for these six properties was $870,000. \u2047 On a trailing three-month annualized basis, EBITDAR excluding stimulus was $150,000. \u2047 Occupancy for the month of December 2020 for these six buildings was 60%, growing to 65% for the month of September 2021. \u2047 With respect to the 11 properties in Senior Care portfolio, in late August we reached a settlement with Senior Care and Aubrey Health Services under which LTC made a one-time payment of $3.25 million in exchange for cooperation and assistance in facilitating an orderly transition of the portfolio. \u2047 As of October 1, the entire 11 property portfolio was leased to an affiliate of HMG Healthcare under a one-year master lease with rent based on cash flows. \u2047 When HMG commenced operation of the portfolio, it agreed to assume Senior Care's Medicare provider agreements and took on a known liability for stimulus funds received by Senior Care under the Medicare COVID-19 Accelerated And Advanced Payment Program. \u2047 This assumed liability is capped at $3.7 million. \u2047 HMG is responsible for the repayment of this liability, which it will fund from cash flow. \u2047 LTC expects to collect rent sometime in 2022 as performance improves and the liability has been repaid. \u2047 It is our intention to add the 11 properties to a master lease currently existing between LTC and HMG after establishing a stabilized rent rate during the first lease year. \u2047 We also agreed to provide HMG a $25 million secured working capital loan maturing on September 30, 2022. \u2047 Our strong balance sheet allowed us to provide this loan on an expedited basis to mitigate the timing risk of HMG using a third party lender. \u2047 This portfolio is based in Texas. \u2047 And as Wendy mentioned earlier, the state recently announced an additional $200 million in support for SNFs. \u2047 Next I'll provide an update on our most recent development projects that are now operational. \u2047 Weatherly Court in Oregon, which is operated by Fields Senior Living saw occupancy rise to 45% at September 30, up from 36% at June 30. \u2047 While Ignite Medical Resort in Blue Springs, Missouri grew occupancy to 90% at September 30, up from 83% at June 30. \u2047 Now we'll discuss our portfolio numbers with the caveat that we don't believe coverage is currently a good indicator of future performance at this time given the pandemic and the challenging environment it creates. \u2047 Before I detail our coverage numbers please note that Senior Care and Senior Lifestyle no longer qualify for our same-store portfolio, given the transitions. \u2047 So they are excluded from these numbers. \u2047 Q2 trailing 12 month EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage as reported using a 5% management fee was 1.06 times and 0.86 times respectively for our assisted living portfolio. \u2047 Excluding stimulus funds received by operators, coverage was 0.87 times and 0.68 times respectively. \u2047 For our skilled nursing portfolio, as-reported EBITDARM and EBITDAR coverage was 2.08 times and 1.61 times respectively. \u2047 Excluding stimulus funds, coverage is 1.44 times and 0.99 times respectively. \u2047 Now for some occupancy trends which are as of September 30"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly nareit diluted ffo per common share $0.45."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3 ffo per share $0.45.  \u2047  q3 ffo per share $0.45."]}
