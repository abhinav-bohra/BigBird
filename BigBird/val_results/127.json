{"article": ["There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. \u2047 You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in our 2020 10-K and in our Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today. \u2047 Bob was the great grandson of our founder and worked at Fluor for 42 years before retiring in 2009. \u2047 For 27 years, he led the Fluor Foundation, our charitable and community involvement organization that was established by his father and his uncle Si Fluor in 1952. \u2047 Throughout his career, Bob brought meaning and value to the active giving back, inspiring thousands of employees across the company and across the globe, to commit time and resources to bettering their communities. \u2047 The company will continue to build on Bob's legacy of supporting stronger, more sustainable communities around the world. \u2047 In a few minutes, Joe will walk through the financials of our business in each of our segments. \u2047 So let me first provide a high-level overview of what we are seeing in each of our major end markets. \u2047 Starting with Urban Solutions. \u2047 In mining, work is tracking broadly to our expectations for the next 18 months. \u2047 We have seen a few large projects shift to the right as detailed estimate reviews and scrutiny of projects by our clients prior to an investment decision being taken is higher than we have seen in quite some time. \u2047 In addition to those projects, we have a steady slate of feed and limited notice to proceed work, where we have a high level of confidence in conversion to full project awards in the next couple of years. \u2047 Our prospect list is incredibly diverse, and we are not dependent on any one region or any one commodity to see significant growth in this business. \u2047 Backlog for mining declined by approximately $1 billion in the quarter. \u2047 That was due to the cancellation of a steel project in North America. \u2047 Moving to Infrastructure on slide four. \u2047 The bipartisan bill continues to gain momentum, and we are optimistic that it will focus on more traditional infrastructure projects, including roads and bridges, which we believe will provide some upside to Fluor and more importantly, funding certainty to our clients in the coming years. \u2047 Importantly, we are starting to see shifts in contract structures and collaborative models are being applied to the infrastructure sector as well as other sectors that allow contractors to compete on capabilities and qualifications instead of solely on price. \u2047 This is a positive development, and we are encouraged by this approach to risk mitigation. \u2047 On a particularly promising note, we are seeing advisory institutions acknowledging the challenges encountered in executing public works projects. \u2047 This has led to the development of more collaborative procurement models to support their public sector clients. \u2047 Last week, we were notified by TxDOT that our co-lead joint venture was selected to design, construct and maintain the 6.5-mile long I-35E Phase two project here in Dallas. \u2047 Our portion of the work will be booked in the third quarter. \u2047 We're excited about this project and look forward to supporting TxDOT on this and other capital programs in the future. \u2047 Regarding our legacy infrastructure portfolio, I want to provide an update on the Gordie Howe Bridge Project and the $138 million charge we announced today. \u2047 The project is experiencing significant COVID-related delays as well as overruns due to procurement and subcontractor cost growth. \u2047 This charge includes additional reserves for delays and disruptions in the schedule. \u2047 Fluor is not the lead operating partner on this contract. \u2047 It's important to note that these cost growth factors may be at least partially recoverable under the contract. \u2047 We expect that it will require several quarters to analyze recoverability and negotiate with our clients before the accounting standards allow us to recognize incremental revenue for these amounts. \u2047 While we are disappointed in the performance of the project, we believe we have a solid estimate on the cost at this point. \u2047 Design is essentially complete, and we have procured approximately 85% of the materials required. \u2047 We have been revising the forecast along the way, and this contract was previously included in our 0 margin projects in backlog. \u2047 As a noncontrolling partner in this JV, we continue to work with our partners to help them get this project into the best possible position. \u2047 We have just under $1 billion in backlog remaining for this project and anticipate substantial completion by the end of 2024. \u2047 Our other infrastructure projects continue to make solid progress, including the LAX people mover, which crossed a significant milestone in early July when the joint venture placed the first forward trusses for the elevated pedestrian walkway. \u2047 Turning to slide five. \u2047 In advanced technologies and life sciences, we are successfully wrapping up some of our large data center projects in Europe. \u2047 We also see opportunities for semiconductor manufacturing facilities, both domestically and internationally. \u2047 These projects are a mix of brownfield and greenfield, and provide a lot of opportunity for add-on work as these facilities grow. \u2047 In life sciences, we continue to see a good list of opportunities, as our world-class technology capabilities support our strategy of getting front-end work. \u2047 We have been awarded a few front-end projects this quarter with the goal of converting them into EPCM contracts. \u2047 Overall, we still see the ATLS end markets as an area for growth in our business, and we are focused on deploying our teams on to projects where we can grow our market share with contract terms and conditions that we find favorable. \u2047 In Mission Solutions, we experienced strong margins this quarter due to increased execution activity on DOE projects, higher-than-forecasted performance-based fees and the release of COVID-19 cost reserves. \u2047 This strong performance was somewhat offset by a decline in execution activity on army logistics and life support programs in Afghanistan and Africa. \u2047 In June, we fully demobilized our people and successfully completed our assignment in Afghanistan after 13 years. \u2047 At its peak, Fluor had 26,000 employees from 65 countries, speaking 39 languages at 76 sites and supporting over 100,000 troops. \u2047 This included 191,000 meals prepared per day and the establishment of the first-ever biodiesel program for the U.S. military deployed overseas. \u2047 Under this program, we produced over 0.5 million gallons of fuels for the bases. \u2047 We are now continuing to support the Army through our LOGCAP V task order award in Africa. \u2047 Next, please note that on the RAPID project, we have moved into the warranty period. \u2047 This project is now essentially complete. \u2047 Our major pursuits for the second half of this year in this group include the Savannah River Management & Operations contract extension and the Y12/Pantex Management & Operations contract in Tennessee and Texas. \u2047 Moving to Energy Solutions on slide seven. \u2047 We had a particularly strong quarter due to certain favorable events driving up our gross margin. \u2047 This reflects the negotiations of change orders, scope increases and cost improvements across numerous projects. \u2047 Furthermore, margins also benefited from the release of credit loss reserves after we received payment on a significant long-standing past due receivable. \u2047 These positive segment margin results were partially offset by a $20 million loss recognized on an embedded derivative, which is excluded from our adjusted earnings per share numbers. \u2047 Turning to slide eight. \u2047 We remain pleased with the progress on our LNG Canada project in Kitimat. \u2047 During the quarter, we saw a significant easing of public health orders that had slowed progress earlier this year, and we are now fully staffed onsite per our plan. \u2047 In the second quarter, we achieved several major milestones. \u2047 First, we drove the last of the Phase one plant piles. \u2047 This program started in January 2020 and included the installation of nearly 6,500 piles. \u2047 If laid end to end, the piles would extend 130 miles. \u2047 Secondly, the project's material offloading facility is now operational, receiving and unloading the first three major pieces of process equipment shipped via oceangoing vessel. \u2047 These pieces of equipment for Train one include the 345 ton, 50-meter-long main cryogenic heat exchanger and two precooler units, each weighing over 280 tons. \u2047 We are scheduled to direct these pieces this fall. \u2047 The site has gone vertical with the steel erection of the non-process building, including the central control and administration buildings. \u2047 During the quarter, we completed the LNG storage tank wall pours. \u2047 The LNG tank group and suspended deck raising is scheduled for next week. \u2047 Module fabrication has commenced for all facets of the project across the Asia and European module fabrication centers. \u2047 Preparation and planning have commenced for the first module delivery major, which are on target for Q4 2021. \u2047 We have formalized the term sheet with our client, which outlines principles of cost and schedule relief related to delays, including COVID, engineering and procurement impacts through February 26, 2021. \u2047 We are targeting finalization of a formal variation this month. \u2047 We continue to enhance our Energy Transition portfolio and believe that Fluor will be a vital contributor to a lower carbon future. \u2047 We are seeing success in several markets, such as renewable fuels, carbon capture, clean hydrogen, battery chemicals and asset decarbonization. \u2047 First, in the renewables fuel market, Fluor is focused on brownfield or revamp capabilities with a geographic focus in North America, where low carbon fuel standard credits are available, demand for liquid fuels continue and feedstock selection is broadly based. \u2047 Next, in the carbon capture market. \u2047 Fluor can perform projects with any technology globally. \u2047 This includes our own proprietary technology for both pre-combustion and post-combustion, Fluor Solvent and Econamine FG+, respectively. \u2047 We are also seeing further opportunities for carbon capture on new and existing LNG facilities. \u2047 Our clean hydrogen efforts include both green hydrogen and blue hydrogen. \u2047 Fluor is relying on its 50 years at the forefront of the gasification industry and has executed more than 30 pre-FEED and FEED projects. \u2047 Fluor can differentiate in this market with our ability to act as integrator and OSBL contractor. \u2047 Another Energy Transition market we are exploring is battery chemicals. \u2047 We are expanding our lithium capabilities and are pursuing the growing market of electric vehicle battery production. \u2047 In asset decarbonization, Fluor is leveraging our design experience for refineries and petrochemical facilities, including steam and electrical systems. \u2047 We have global execution capabilities for conceptual front-end design through EPC for both electrification and energy efficiency projects. \u2047 Aside from these markets, we are also pursuing projects in green ammonia, chemical recycling, bio-based chemicals, long duration energy storage, waste-to-energy conversion and bio LNG. \u2047 Most of our energy transition work is in the United States and Europe. \u2047 And based on our differentiated technical position, we continue to view growth in this area as a driver for increased revenue and earnings in the coming years. \u2047 Now let's turn to NuScale, a related energy transition offering on slide 10. \u2047 For the first seven months of this year, NuScale has received $192 million in outside investments from JGC and GS Energy, Doosan, Samsung and IHI, among others. \u2047 These infusions not only eliminate the need for Fluor to provide additional funding, but also accelerate NuScale's path to commercialization and demonstrates third-party investor interest in NuScale's business prospects. \u2047 Additionally, we continue to have positive and productive conversations around nuclear power as a necessary baseload clean energy source, both in North America and abroad. \u2047 We believe that our new scale product will become a vital part of a cleaner energy future. \u2047 Before handing the call over to Joe, on slide 11, I want to share a few observations as we head into the second half of the year. \u2047 First, we expect to see some inconsistency or lumpiness in new awards as the optimism in post-pandemic capital spending from clients is partially offset by concerns about cost growth for labor and materials. \u2047 We're also keeping a close eye on the impacts of the Delta variant of COVID as it relates to our exposure to global supply chains. \u2047 While these dynamics may shift certain projects out in time somewhat and impact the near term, there are longer-term trends in our business that I view as very positive. \u2047 First, as mentioned in my infrastructure remarks, we are starting to see a better balance of risks sharing in contract structures. \u2047 Projects are increasingly structured as predevelopment agreements where clients and contractors work together to identify and mitigate risks before bids are finalized. \u2047 These collaborative models are being considered because clients are seeing contractors declining to bid on large projects as terms and conditions have shifted risk allocation too far away from the owner. \u2047 Also, we continue to see a robust pipeline of study, pre-FEED and FEED work to support future growth. \u2047 We are currently working on or have recently completed pre-EPC work that represents over $150 billion in total installed costs. \u2047 Additionally, we are pursuing another 200 study in FEED projects, representing almost $200 billion in TIC over the next several years. \u2047 So while we are seeing some near-term headwinds in 2021 with new word lumpiness, we have considerable opportunity to capture projects that are in the pipeline, and they're well suited for Fluor. \u2047 Finally, regarding our cost savings initiative, we are making solid progress and have identified significant opportunities to improve processes and reduce costs and create an organization that is competitive and fit for growth. \u2047 Our various work streams are taking specific actions to ensure that our resources are tailored to what we need today. \u2047 And we are establishing new protocols so we can efficiently scale as our markets ebb and flow. \u2047 For the second quarter of 2021, we are reporting a diluted adjusted earnings per share amount of $0.32. \u2047 Our diluted share count was $156 million for the quarter, up from $140 million in the first quarter. \u2047 This includes the additional shares from the convertible preferred offering we completed in May. \u2047 In the third quarter, we expect our diluted share count to be approximately $170 million, as the effects of the issuance will be for a full quarter. \u2047 For the quarter and the year-to-date, the offering is anti-dilutive under GAAP due to the net loss. \u2047 So common earnings per share and diluted earnings per share results are the same. \u2047 However, in terms of guidance and results, we will discuss EPS, including the aforementioned adjustments as well as using the larger diluted share count going forward for comparison purposes. \u2047 Our financial statements will continue to conform to GAAP, and we will provide the required reconciliation. \u2047 But we will use the larger dilutive share count for all periods as appropriate. \u2047 I will walk you through that a little more clearly when we talk about guidance. \u2047 Turning to slide 13. \u2047 Specific to our convertible preferred offering, we saw it as a necessary and positive step toward reinforcing financial discipline for the company. \u2047 This offering allowed us to"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts sees fy adjusted earnings per share $0.60 to $0.80.  \u2047  sees fy adjusted earnings per share $0.60 to $0.80.  \u2047  fy adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes nuscale-related expenses and other adjustments.  \u2047  for second half of 2021, we see some headwinds and inconsistency in new awards."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.32.  \u2047  q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.32."]}
