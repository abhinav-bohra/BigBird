{"article": ["On the call today are Tim Crew, Chief Executive Officer; John Kozlowski, the company's Chief Financial Officer, Maureen Cavanaugh, our Chief Commercial Operations Officer and Steve Lehrer, who leads our insulin biosimilar initiatives. \u2047 A playback will be available for at least three months on Lannett's website. \u2047 We trust you all remain safe and well. \u2047 Despite the pandemic and ongoing headwinds specific to our industry and our company, we are proud of our significant progression on several strategic fronts these past months. \u2047 First, we refinanced our debt providing significant balance sheet runway to execute on our growth plan. \u2047 Second, we advanced the development of key large pipeline assets, third, we expanded our pipeline of key assets and more such assets are being actively pursued and fourth, we maintained our operating discipline and are tracking to our near-term goals. \u2047 I'll begin my specific remarks with a brief review of our financial results. \u2047 For fiscal 2021 third quarter, we had net sales of $112 million, adjusted gross margin of 27%, adjusted EBITDA of $17 million and adjusted net income of $1 million equal to $0.02 per diluted share. \u2047 Gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income were all better than we anticipated. \u2047 Moreover, our cash position significantly improved to more than $80 million at the end of Q3 from $34 million at the end of the preceding quarter. \u2047 While we are pleased with our overall results, we believe the most important recent news was the April refinancing transaction I earlier mentioned. \u2047 We used the proceeds from the refinancing on some cash to retire our outstanding Term B loan balance of approximately $540 million. \u2047 The financing was significant for several reasons including, first, we have extended the maturity of our debt to 2026 from 2022 and that maturity is now after several of our larger and more durable pipeline assets are expected to launch and make meaningful contributions to our business. \u2047 Second, our free cash flow improved substantially, primarily due to the elimination of mandatory principal payments until maturity. \u2047 We estimate that the transaction will add approximately $50 million of free cash flow in the first year alone. \u2047 Our plan is to use a portion of the extra cash to invest in additional growth opportunities. \u2047 And third, the new debt did not have leverage covenants. \u2047 To our view, we believe the successful offering provides investors' validation of our future expected cash flows. \u2047 Similarly, I'd like to note that the part of this financing, the second-lien investors received warrants in Lannett, which have historic price of $6.88. \u2047 We believe the support of these experienced investors to accept the second-lien position in exchange in part for these warrants further validates our assessment of the future earnings anticipated from our pipeline. \u2047 So now let's turn to our pipeline. \u2047 Most recently, we launched two products in Q3 including Levorphanol, IR tablets 3 mg a partnered product and Chlorpromazine, an internally developed product. \u2047 Thus far in Q4, we launched Venlafaxine ER tablets 75 mg and expect to launch a few more products in the next few months. \u2047 In addition, we have more than 18 products in development, another 11 pending with the FDA including partnered products, plus four additional products that are approved and pending launch. \u2047 We will now turn to larger more durable opportunities in our near-term pipeline, dealing with products in the respiratory arena. \u2047 As we recently announced, we achieved a key milestone with the filing of our generic ADVAIR DISKUS product on April 1. \u2047 This asset is a partnered product and of the larger products in our pipeline is currently the closest to expected commercialization. \u2047 The investments in technology, dedicated manufacturing infrastructure and development of assets are very significant. \u2047 So we are quite pleased to be so far along the development and expect only a handful of competitors. \u2047 While we do expect more than one FDA review cycle, and we need FDA feedback to firm up our expectations, we continue to believe an approval and U.S. launch of the product is possible in calendar year 2022 and given our listing in the market, we anticipate the product will generate substantial net sales soon after launch. \u2047 Another drug device combination product in our pipeline is generic Flovent DISKUS. \u2047 The pivotal clinical trial for this product has been initiated. \u2047 So we are tracking to a possible launch in 2023. \u2047 As a reminder, we are co-developing this product with the same partner generic ADVAIR DISKUS. \u2047 This relationship means that the generic Flovent product leverages the same R&D and manufacturing platforms that support the generic ADVAIR product and will likely follow similar clinical development assets. \u2047 For both the generic ADVAIR and Flovent products, we are increasingly confident of our path to launch for three primary reasons. \u2047 First, the FDA now has clear guidance for companies developing its complex products and our development programs have been advancing rapidly. \u2047 Second, our partners already built R&D and commercial scale manufacturing facilities, both dedicated to inhalation products. \u2047 And lastly, our partnered senior management team includes members of GlaxoSmithKline team that was intently involved in developing, filing and manufacturing the ADVAIR into their product. \u2047 As we said previously, we are evaluating and in late-stage negotiations for additional product opportunities in the drug device inhalation respiratory space, particularly dry powder inhalers, and Metered Dose inhalers. \u2047 These markets are, as we have stated before, generally quite large, growing and durable. \u2047 Turning to our biologic insulin products. \u2047 The situation is similar to what we noticed for the drug device inhalation opportunities, namely, we are relatively well advanced in the programs and the investments in technology, dedicated manufacturing infrastructure and development are even more significant, it takes multiple hundreds of millions of dollars. \u2047 Let me say that again, multiple hundreds of millions of dollars. \u2047 Thus we expect only a handful of competitors in what is expected to be a multi-billion dollar market even at competitive biosimilar pricing. \u2047 And as we have shared, our partner HEC is shouldering the significant majority of these infrastructure related costs. \u2047 With regard to biosimilar insulin glargine, we believe we remain on track to; submit an IND later this calendar year, commence the clinical trial early next calendar year, submit the biologics license application later in calendar year 2022, and launch in 2023, just over two years from now. \u2047 You'll recall that representatives from Lannett and HEC's both received guidance from the FDA on the biosimilar insulin glargine clinical advancement program in June of 2020. \u2047 The FDA then requested that we submit a protocol and the statistical analysis plan for the pivotal trial for review which we did in November of 2020. \u2047 The FDA has since completed its review and provided feedback, which we incorporated into design of the upcoming pivotal trial including the type and sized of the trial, as well as primary and secondary endpoints. \u2047 Importantly, the upcoming conforming pivotal human healthy trial plan is similar to our previously completed normal healthy volunteered pilot study. \u2047 It's a modestly larger study and will be conducted at the same site as the previous study. \u2047 So the FDA's feedback is very encouraging as they reviewed in detail our human pilot study where our insulin glargine met all the primary pharamakinetic and pharmadynamic safety endpoints and the FDA has indicated the same type of study with glargine produced at commercial scale to complete the new facility will be sufficient to file a 351(k) biosimilar application. \u2047 Note, we believe we will be the first glargine outpatient to take advantage of new biosimilar insulin rules published in November of 2019, which have helped speed our progression. \u2047 In the related positive development, our partner HEC has completed virtually all the required process development scale of work required to producing insulin glargine at commercial scale at the new insulin facility, which is an important next step. \u2047 Production of clinical trial materials should occur in the upcoming quarter. \u2047 On a further positive related note, in February, we announced we have expanded our agreement with HEC to include the biosimilar insulin aspart, a fast-acting insulin, separate and distinct from longer acting insulin glargine. \u2047 Similar to the two asthma product opportunities, the experience, knowledge, dedicated infection infrastructure and investment supporting insulin glargine can be directly leveraged from the development of insulin aspart. \u2047 Accordingly, while we still need to get FDA feedback on the development plan, we currently anticipate a potential launch of the aspart product in calendar 2024. \u2047 As you can see, and I think our investors understand, we are now advancing for within our overall launch parade, a steady stream of significant new product launches in the not too distant future. \u2047 To sum up today's remarks. \u2047 We completed our refinancing transaction where we retired our Term Loan B and extended the maturity of our debt beyond the expected launch dates of our larger pipeline assets. \u2047 Moreover, the structure of the new debt substantially increased our free cash flow potential around $50 million in the first year alone that will allow us to further invest in growth opportunities. \u2047 The ANDA for our generic ADVAIR DISKUS product was submitted on April 1, 2021 and pending FDA feedback, we believe this product is tracking to a launch in calendar year 2022. \u2047 The clinical development of our other large opportunity assets including generic flovent and biosimilar insulin glargine continues to advance the launch of insulin glargine possible in 2023. \u2047 And in February, we added to our pipeline another large opportunity product biosimilar insulin aspart. \u2047 That biosimilar development should track perhaps the year behind insulin glargine and potentially launch in 2024, along with generic flovent, setting up a series of potentially significant product launches in the not too distant future. \u2047 I will begin with our financial results on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. \u2047 For the 2021 third quarter, net sales were $112.4 million, compared with $144.4 million for the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Gross profit was $30.4 million or 27% of net sales, compared with $52.3 million or 36% of net sales for the prior year third quarter. \u2047 Our gross margin for the quarter grew from the previous quarter largely due to improved manufacturing efficiencies, and to a lesser extent sales mix. \u2047 More specifically, increased sales of certain higher margin products. \u2047 Net sales for the quarter were lower than expected, primarily due to the competitive market pressure for both Levothyroxine tablets and capsules. \u2047 Research and development expenses declined to $6.0 million from $7.4 million. \u2047 SG&A expenses declined to $14.4 million from $17.7 million. \u2047 Interest expense decreased to $9.8 million from $12.7 million in last year's third quarter. \u2047 Net income was $1.0 million or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with $11.7 million or $0.27 per diluted share. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $17.0 million, which was positively impacted by lower R&D expenses in the quarter due to timing. \u2047 We expect some of that R&D spend to move to our fourth quarter. \u2047 Turning to our balance sheet. \u2047 At March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $81 million, up significantly from $34 million at December 31. \u2047 The increase was due to the receipt of income tax refunds, as well as benefits derived from initiatives to improve our working capital. \u2047 With that, I would like to provide additional details on our recently completed refinancing transaction, which was leverage neutral and as Tim mentioned, extended the maturity of our debt and enhances our cash flow. \u2047 For background, in November 2015, we acquired Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, primarily using debt to finance the transaction. \u2047 For the last six plus years, we have made excellent progress paying down this debt reducing by more than half the original outstanding debt balance of approximately $1.3 billion. \u2047 With the Term B loan scheduled to mature in November 2022, we made the strategic decision to refinance our debt. \u2047 The refinancing included two new debt instruments, specifically, $350 million of first lien senior secured notes and $190 million of second lien loans, which were used to retire the approximately $540 million outstanding balance of our Term B loan. \u2047 As part of the transaction, we also upsized our revolving credit facility to $45 million from $30 million. \u2047 The new first lien secured notes will mature in five years that will be secured on a first lien basis by all non-ABL collateral and a second lien basis on ABL collateral. \u2047 The second lien facility is junior in priority to the new first lien senior secured notes and included 8.28 million warrants exercisable into the company's common equity at a strike price of $6.88. \u2047 The second lien facility also matures in 2026. \u2047 The refinancing improved our financial flexibility in a couple of ways. \u2047 First, neither of the two new debt instruments include financial maintenance covenants. \u2047 And second, with no principal payments due until maturity, it considerably increases our cash flow. \u2047 Now, moving to our outlook, we made minor revisions to our guidance for the fiscal 2021 full year which were largely due to the refinancing. \u2047 Specifically, changes to our guidance were in the interest expense line and the income tax line. \u2047 Otherwise, our adjusted guidance range remains unchanged from the guidance we provided on February 3. \u2047 I would note that, given the sales pressure on our Levothyroxine products, combined with an expected delay to our zolmitriptan launch due to an API matter, we would anticipate to be at the lower end of our sales guidance range. \u2047 I would also add that an API issue surrounding our thalidomide product has still not yet been resolved. \u2047 The launch for the product was most recently expected for late in calendar 2022. \u2047 But as of now, we are not estimating a launch timeframe. \u2047 With that context, the revised guidance items are as follows: adjusted interest expense of approximately $44 million, up from $41 million to $42 million. \u2047 And income tax in the range of $1 million of expense to $1 million of benefit. \u2047 Please note we replaced in the income tax line of our adjusted guidance the dollar amount to provide additional clarity. \u2047 With that overview, we would now like to address any questions you may have. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.02.  \u2047  q3
