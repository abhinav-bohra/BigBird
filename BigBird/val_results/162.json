{"article": ["I'd like to start by taking a moment on behalf of our Board, our entire team and myself to recognize Henry Tippie for everything he's done for our organization over the last 68 years. \u2047 As many of you are aware, Mr. Tippie recently retired from our Board, leaving behind an incredible legacy of leadership and service to Rollins, its employees and customers. \u2047 Henry's financial knowledge and guidance helped shape Rollins to become the world's best and largest pest control company. \u2047 During his distinguished career, not only was Henry our longest-serving CFO through a period for over 17 years, he was the architect of Rollins' purchase of Orkin in 1964. \u2047 Incidentally, this is considered to be the country's first-ever leveraged buyout and was studied for years at the Harvard Business School. \u2047 Henry, along with Randall Rollins, our Chairman at the time, were the only two Rollins Directors present during our initial stock exchange listing in 1968, and again, on our 50th year New York Stock Exchange anniversary. \u2047 Additionally, in recognition of his broader impact to the business world, the New York Stock Exchange inducted Henry in 2018 into their exclusive wall of leaders. \u2047 Randall Rollins was inducted as well. \u2047 Rollins would not be the company it is today without Henry's numerous contributions. \u2047 We will continue to honor your legacy and the example of hard work and dedication that you provided. \u2047 Throughout his 12-year career with Rollins, Lee helped guide the company through several important technology advancements, while building a fantastic IT team. \u2047 He selected and developed a team to not only improve the company's performance presently, but will prevail well into our future. \u2047 In the end, it all comes down to the many positive contributions of our employees continue to make every day. \u2047 They have risen again to the occasion, going above and beyond what they've ever accomplished before. \u2047 We're grateful for their extraordinary dedication and adaptability during the past year. \u2047 They truly are our most valuable asset. \u2047 While we faced many challenges over the past year, we continue to successfully improve our operations, and we are greatly encouraged by our first quarter performance. \u2047 I think we are benefiting from our technology investments and overall business momentum and are looking forward to another successful year. \u2047 As Gary mentioned, we are pleased with our first quarter results. \u2047 Revenue grew 9.8% to $535.6 million compared to $487.9 million for the same quarter in 2020. \u2047 Net income rose to $92.6 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $43.3 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the first quarter of last year. \u2047 Eddie will review the GAAP and non-GAAP results shortly as there was one adjustment impacting our financials. \u2047 It is not just the results we are pleased with, but the returns we are seeing in the business, highlighted by strong performance in our residential and termite service lines, growing 14.9% and 12.2%, respectively. \u2047 Further, our commercial business has improved every single quarter during 2020 and continued this steady progress once again this quarter, reaching 2.9% growth over the first quarter 2020. \u2047 I am grateful, greatly appreciative of his many years of leadership as part of our management team and as a Board member. \u2047 While it's never easy to follow in the footsteps of someone who made that type of impact, we are pleased with the distinguished executives that have agreed to join our Board of Directors over the past several months. \u2047 Many of you may recall that we have enhanced an already experienced and strong Board with the recent additions of Jerry Nix, Susan Bell, Patrick Gunning and Harry Cynkus. \u2047 They each bring a wealth of knowledge and diverse experience in many different areas that we believe will make us stronger as a company moving forward. \u2047 We have also recently announced the appointment of several new committee chairs and committee designations. \u2047 Jerry Nix was appointed as our new Lead Director and was selected to chair our Compensation Committee, as well as chair our Nominating and Governance Committee. \u2047 He is also now serving as a member on our Audit Committee and will be joining our Chairman, Gary Rollins, on our Executive Committee. \u2047 Additionally, Susan Bell was selected to chair our Rollins Audit Committee and to chair our Diversity Committees. \u2047 Patrick Gunning was also appointed to be a member of our Audit Committee. \u2047 As Gary just mentioned, Lee Crump has contributed significantly to Rollins' success during his tenure, and we wish him the very best as he retires. \u2047 Succeeding Lee is our new Chief Information Officer, is Thomas Tesh. \u2047 While we have spent the last six months working to ensure a seamless transition, Thomas has been a key part of the Rollins family since 2012, previously serving as the Vice President of Information Technology. \u2047 Thomas is extremely qualified, having led our technology improvement journey through several major rollouts over the years. \u2047 And we believe his deep experience and solid track record makes him uniquely qualified for this important position. \u2047 The first quarter business environment was extremely solid across all of our business lines. \u2047 And our total revenue, less significant acquisitions, grew 7.9% over first quarter 2020 as both our residential and termite segments presented double-digit growth of 12.8% and 11.2%, respectively. \u2047 These growth levels have exceeded anything we've recently experienced. \u2047 Commercial, ex fume revenue, less significant acquisitions, presented positive growth for the first time since first quarter 2020. \u2047 This segment has enjoyed sequential improvement since last April, reaching 1.3% growth over first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Our team's continued dedication in serving our commercial customers and their recovery has been outstanding. \u2047 We're pleased with the steady progress achieved over the past 12 months in this segment. \u2047 Turning to our mosquito service. \u2047 As families spend more time outdoors recreationally and with the continued threat of mosquito-borne disease, we're realizing significant growth in this segment of our business. \u2047 For the quarter, our mosquito revenue experienced growth of over 30%. \u2047 Additionally, the strength of our termite business remains solid, and we expect continued growth in the future. \u2047 Looking deeper at our results, we continue to attract customers to all of our services and brands. \u2047 We're particularly pleased with our international performance in the U.K. and Australia. \u2047 Domestically, Northwest Exterminating, which joined the Rollins family in 2017, continues to realize strong growth in the Southeastern U.S. HomeTeam has continued their consistent high-growth levels as they capitalize on a thriving residential home construction industry. \u2047 Similar to last quarter, we experienced tremendous growth in wildlife service offerings through our Trutech and Critter Control brands. \u2047 Also, we continued to selectively purchase Critter Control franchises and combine them together with our growing wholly owned wildlife operations. \u2047 Operationally, we remain focused on ensuring our residential and commercial customers receive the highest quality of services. \u2047 As part of our approach in 2015, we began the rollout of a new branch operating system, BOSS, at our largest brand, Orkin U.S. During 2020, we successfully deployed BOSS in two additional brands, Orkin Canada and Western Pest Services. \u2047 With this new system in place, we were able to add virtual route management software to improve our routing and scheduling processes. \u2047 Even though we're still in early stages, for Orkin Canada, we've achieved routing improvements of over 20% at this time. \u2047 Over the next few years, we expect additional improvements as the system gains maturity within these brands. \u2047 Looking ahead, we remain committed to investing and implementing technology improvements to other brands in order to improve operational efficiencies as well as enhance our customers' trust by continuing to deliver a worthwhile experience. \u2047 Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made during the first quarter and as the economy continues to recover, we're encouraged about our prospects for further improvements for the rest of 2021. \u2047 I, too, have greatly benefited from Mr. Tippie's vast experience, wisdom and knowledge. \u2047 His guidance on cost containment, mergers and acquisitions and managing the balance sheet have been invaluable to me. \u2047 The results of this quarter are, in part, a testament to his steady guidance throughout his 68-year involvement with the company. \u2047 For the quarter, our residential pest control, commercial pest control, termite and ancillary service lines showed growth and key to the quarter included cost containment across all major categories throughout the organization, overall good weather conditions that helped with demand and customer retention rates improving across the board. \u2047 As John referenced, I will be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP financials for the quarter, which were positively impacted by our gain on the sale of several of our Clark properties. \u2047 As a reminder, when we purchased the initial Clark business in 2019, we bought their pest control, distribution businesses and their owned properties. \u2047 Real estate is not a core competency of ours, and we decided to make the properties available to the market and secure branch leases. \u2047 The first group that sold netted a $31 million gain included in our numbers this quarter. \u2047 Looking at the numbers, the first quarter revenues of $535.6 million increased 9.8% over the prior year's first quarter revenue of $487.9 million. \u2047 Our GAAP income before income taxes was $119.9 million or 116.3% above 2020. \u2047 Our GAAP net income was $92.6 million, up 114.1% compared to 2020. \u2047 And our GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 per diluted share. \u2047 When removing the positive impact of the property gain on the sale of $31 million, our non-GAAP income before income taxes was $88.8 million compared to $55.4 million in 2020 or up 60.3%. \u2047 Our non-GAAP net income was $69.8 million, up 61.2% compared to Q1 of 2020. \u2047 This surge in customer demand again tested our new technology to see how we would be able to handle higher levels of both existing and new customer starts. \u2047 As we move from what we would call Stage two to Stage three of our five-stage routing and scheduling transformation, our latest changes have enabled our technicians to continue to improve the efficiency of their day and give the customer a better experience. \u2047 Specifically, our latest updates are helping to maximize our ability to be proactive with our customers instead of reactive. \u2047 Our operations support has added the use of a planning board, which enables them in real time to adjust for openings in the technician schedule. \u2047 If a customer needs to reschedule service for some reason, that opens up a time slot during the day, our support group is quickly able to fill that slot with a new customer or to support the changing needs of an existing customer. \u2047 This enables our technicians to be more efficient and our customers to have a better experience with their service needs. \u2047 These changes positively impacted our margins and our customer retention rates for the quarter. \u2047 Let's take a look through the Rollins revenue by service line for the first quarter. \u2047 Our total revenue increase of 9.8% included 1.9% from significant acquisitions and the remaining 7.9% was from pricing and new customer growth. \u2047 In total, residential pest control, which made up 44% of our revenue, was up 14.9% and commercial, excluding fumigation pest control, which made up 35% of our revenue, was up 3.6%. \u2047 Termite and ancillary services, which made up approximately 20% of our revenue, were up 12.2%. \u2047 Also, as Jerry mentioned, our wildlife service continued to see strong double-digit growth. \u2047 Again, total revenue, less significant acquisitions, were up 7.9%, and from that, residential was up 12.8%; commercial, ex-fumigation, increased 1.3%; and termite and ancillary grew by 11.2%. \u2047 Our residential business continues to perform well, and our commercial pest control business has seen steady improvements each month since April 2020. \u2047 We anticipate a continued steady improvement in our commercial pest control business for the remainder of 2021. \u2047 In total, gross margins increased to 51.2% from 49.5% in the prior year's quarter. \u2047 The quarter was positively impacted by lower service salary expense as well as a lower fleet expense through continued improvements from our routing and scheduling efficiencies. \u2047 Depreciation and amortization expenses for the quarter increased $2 million to $23.6 million, an increase of 9.3%. \u2047 Depreciation increased $920,000 due to acquisitions and planned IT upgrades, while amortization of intangible assets increased $1.1 million due to several acquisitions, including McCall Pest Control in December of 2020. \u2047 Sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased $4.3 million or 2.8% to $162.2 million or 30.3% of revenues. \u2047 This was down 6.5% compared to 2020, and the quarter produced savings in administrative salaries and benefits, travel and telephone savings from better negotiated contracts. \u2047 There's been a lot of inflation discussion related to the economy and what impact companies are seeing or will see as we move through 2021. \u2047 At this point, we do not see major inflation exposure that would materially impact our margins. \u2047 As you probably know, payroll, fleet and materials and supplies are our largest three expense areas. \u2047 At this time, payroll margins are mainly improving due to enhanced technology and efficiency. \u2047 Our fleet has been positively impacted by lower fuel costs and a mid-single-digit percentage reduction in our miles driven. \u2047 Finally, our materials and supply costs are lower as a percent of revenue, even with our continued personal protective equipment use by our customer-facing employees. \u2047 As for our cash, for the period ended March 31, 2021, we spent $17 million on acquisitions compared to $47.6 million during the same period last year. \u2047 We paid $39.4 million on dividends and had $7.8 million of capital expenditures, which was slightly higher compared to 2020. \u2047 We ended the period with $117.3 million in cash, of which $71.3 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. \u2047 Yesterday, the Board of Directors approved a regular cash dividend of $0.08 per share that will be paid on June 10, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2021. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q1 earnings per share $0.19.
