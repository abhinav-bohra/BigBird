{"article": ["We have a lot of exciting news to discuss today. \u2047 The first discusses our second quarter results of fiscal 2021. \u2047 The second announces our intention to spin-off our diabetes business into a separate public company. \u2047 Given the announcement of the spin-off of our diabetes business, we will also have Dev Kurdikar, our Worldwide President of Diabetes Care, who has been named CEO of NewCo to provide his early thoughts on the transaction. \u2047 We will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures with respect to our performance. \u2047 Unless otherwise specified all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis versus relevant period. \u2047 To avoid any confusion, when we refer to any given period, whether that's on a quarter or year basis, we will be referring to the period in fiscal terms, unless we specifically call it out as a calendar period. \u2047 Finally, when we refer to NewCo, during today's call we are referring to the independent publicly traded diabetes company following the effective date of the spin, while RemainCo refers to BD post separation. \u2047 Today we will provide an update on how we are executing on creating value for our stakeholders through our BD 2025 strategy. \u2047 We have a lot of exciting updates for you, so let's jump right in. \u2047 Our second quarter results came in better than expected and we delivered strong revenue and earnings per share growth. \u2047 We are very pleased with the continued momentum in our core business, and therefore, based on our first half results and our projections for the second half we are reaffirming our fiscal 2021 guidance. \u2047 We are making steady progress on each of our growth initiatives, which include very purposely shifting our investments and portfolio into higher-growth categories and shifting our weighted average market growth rate over time. \u2047 We are advancing our product pipeline as well as our tuck-in M&A strategy, which now includes making selective investments in earlier stage and potentially disruptive technologies. \u2047 We see this planned spin as a significant value-creating opportunity for all stakeholders for our patients, customers, associates and shareholders. \u2047 As an independent public company, we believe the diabetes business can leverage its global leadership position and unleash its growth potential in this attractive market category through the more efficient allocation of its own capital. \u2047 For RemainCo BD, this transaction allows us to focus on our prioritized core businesses. \u2047 We expect this transaction to strengthen our mid single-digit revenue and double-digit total return growth profile. \u2047 We expect the spin to be completed in the first half of calendar year 2022 subject to customary closing conditions, including final approval by the BD Board of Directors and the SEC declaring our registration statement effective. \u2047 We are progressing well against our simplification initiatives, which are focused on reducing complexity, enhancing our product quality, refining our customer experience and improving cost efficiencies. \u2047 Our recode initiatives are progressing on track to generate savings of $300 million by the end of FY FY '24. \u2047 And these initiatives help unlock value and allow us the flexibility to reinvest back into our business to fuel future growth. \u2047 Chris will talk more about our capital allocation strategy later in the call, but we expect share repurchases to return as part of a more balanced capital allocation strategy, as our balance sheet position and cash flows have strengthened over the past year. \u2047 We also continue to be guided by our purpose of advancing the world of health and continue to make great progress on our ESG initiatives. \u2047 On Earth Day, we reaffirmed our climate change targets, which includes our pledge to be carbon neutral by 2040 across our direct operations. \u2047 Last week as I was preparing for our Board meeting, I reflected on where we were a year ago where we are today and the progress we've made. \u2047 First, we achieved my number one priority since taking over as CEO. \u2047 Last week, we announced that we submitted our Alaris 510(k) premarket notification. \u2047 This is an important milestone in our commitment to our customers and our patients. \u2047 The Alaris pump is the leading infusion pump in the US market administering more than one million infusions each day. \u2047 Second, we've significantly strengthened our balance sheet and cash flows. \u2047 Over the past year we've improved our net leverage ratio by a full turn from 3.4x to 2.4x and taken actions to meaningfully strengthen our cash flows. \u2047 Third, we answered the call to action with COVID. \u2047 We developed a series of innovative COVID diagnostic tests and scaled these to diagnose patients and help control the spread. \u2047 We secured our global supply chain to ensure that our essential medical devices were available to treat COVID patients in ICUs around the world including BD devices used in the treatment of an estimated 90% of US ICU patients. \u2047 And today we continue to add capacity and enable over 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine to be delivered using our injection devices. \u2047 I am very proud of our team's impact when it matters most. \u2047 Fourth, we reinvested in growth. \u2047 We set up the BD Innovation and Growth Fund and advanced impactful new innovation programs in each of our businesses. \u2047 We acquired 11 tuck-in acquisitions since the beginning of 2020 along with early stage investments and we're reinvesting some of BD Veritor profits back into the business and behind our BD 2025 strategy. \u2047 Fifth, we started to shift the BD culture to one of a growth mindset. \u2047 We've been systematically advancing our leadership capabilities and culture in this area which includes partnering with the Neuro Leadership Institute to embed an enhanced focus on innovation and growth across our culture and mindset and the progress we're making with shifting the culture is very real and tangible. \u2047 And today, we are announcing our intention to spin-off the diabetes business. \u2047 We believe this spin-off will be another value-creating opportunity for our shareholders. \u2047 But what excites me most is not what we've done it's where we're going and what's to come over the next several years all of our future successes and milestones to come. \u2047 The BD 2025 value-creation story has only just begun. \u2047 And later this year we are planning to host an Investor Day and we'll look forward to sharing greater insights into our 2025 strategy and pipeline. \u2047 Chris is going to run through our financial results in greater detail later on. \u2047 But just to highlight, we are very pleased with our second quarter results as the BD team continued to execute well. \u2047 Our second quarter revenues totaled $4.9 billion, up 15.4% on a reported basis and up 12.2% on an FX-neutral basis. \u2047 I was particularly pleased with the continued momentum of our core businesses which were above our expectations in all three business segments. \u2047 To call out a few, our market-leading BD Pharmaceutical Systems business continues to deliver robust revenue growth of nearly 10%. \u2047 Medication Delivery Solutions business was up over 8%, as we continue to deliver on our COVID vaccine injection devices commitments and our results were also driven by higher patient acuity. \u2047 Our Bioscience business turned in double-digit growth as research activity has rebounded and urology and critical care continued to perform well driven by PureWick and targeted temperature management. \u2047 In China, where we began to anniversary the impact of COVID-19 we saw a strong revenue growth of 62% and we continue to invest support our future growth including reinvesting some of the profits from our COVID diagnostics. \u2047 Our R&D spending was up 18.7% year-over-year on a currency-neutral basis. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $3.19 representing year-over-year growth of 25.1% on a reported and 22.7% on a currency-neutral basis. \u2047 The performance of our business particularly our core, gives us comfort to reaffirm our fiscal 2021 guidance ranges which include currency-neutral revenue growth of 10% to 12% and adjusted earnings per share guidance of $12.75 to $12.85, up 25% to 26% on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Turning to slide 9. \u2047 As I discussed before, we are proud to play such an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic response, across the continuum of care, from diagnostics to treatment and now prevention. \u2047 As vaccination campaigns continue to progress, I am pleased to announce, that we now have cumulative commitments for over 1.7 billion injection devices to administer COVID vaccines globally. \u2047 These commitments will stretch through our fiscal 2022 period. \u2047 And therefore, we now see higher demand in our MDS hypodermic business, as being durable into next year. \u2047 We also see potential opportunity for our prefilled business in the future, and are now working with several partners at various stages of formulation testing on possible pre-filled COVID-19 vaccines. \u2047 Turning to slide 10. \u2047 I will provide an update on our COVID-19 Diagnostic Testing business. \u2047 We recently announced several emergency use authorizations or EUAs from the FDA. \u2047 We received EUAs for our combination COVID flu assays for both BD Veritor and BD MAX and we believe combination tests are going to be important in the next flu season. \u2047 Next, we extended our EUA for the BD Veritor COVID-19 test to include a claim for screening asymptomatic individuals by serial testing. \u2047 Several peer-reviewed publications have supported the benefits of serial rapid antigen testing, and we are continuing to develop our BD Veritor at-home test. \u2047 Our test is designed to deliver a clear, digitally displayed record of test results on a smartphone to eliminate the reading guess work, and we also designed it to allow the data to be digitally shared by the user to eliminate errors and report sharing. \u2047 Our BD Veritor at-home antigen test is also expected to have some other features that we believe will further differentiate it versus others on the market. \u2047 Our antigen tests will all be manufactured on the same production lines to leverage economies of scale and our capital investments. \u2047 Turning to slide 11. \u2047 Growth through innovation is central to our BD 2025 strategy. \u2047 We are advancing our R&D pipeline across all three of our segments. \u2047 And as you can see on this slide identified by the green circles, several products have launched or achieved clearance since the beginning of the year. \u2047 I've already covered our regulatory clearances related to COVID Diagnostics, and I'm happy to share that we've made steady progress in our medical segment, with a healthy cadence of relevant portfolio expansions and extensions across the MDS portfolio, such as the broadening of our leading peripheral IV catheter position with the introduction of our first passive safety catheter in the United States, the BD Cathena IV safety catheter. \u2047 We launched a new catheter stabilization solution for peripheral IV catheters with the BD Secura stabilization device and further advanced the safety of the BD PhaSeal optimal product family with a locking injector. \u2047 In interventional, we're launching Sensica, a smart connected folly catheter, which can be an important tool for the ICU. \u2047 It provides weight-normalized urine output data that is one of the early parameters used by clinicians to help identify acute kidney injury. \u2047 BD Sensica can wirelessly transmit this data to the hospital's electronic medical record. \u2047 We're also looking forward to launching Pristine later this quarter. \u2047 Pristine is our new long-term hemodialysis catheter with unique side hole-free symmetric wide tip distal lumen design. \u2047 The design of the product is intended to help minimize thrombus adhesion, facilitate blood clot aspiration prior to hemodialysis treatment and help minimize recirculation rates in both forward and reverse. \u2047 Turning to slide 12. \u2047 As I have often said over the last year, Alaris was my number one priority and last week, we announced a very important milestone. \u2047 We submitted our 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA for our BD Alaris system. \u2047 I am extremely proud of our MMS regulatory affairs, quality and R&D teams for their dedication and hard work, to ensure a comprehensive submission. \u2047 We're also very appreciative of the FDA's collaboration. \u2047 We recognize this is one important step and we look forward to working with them through the FDA review process to obtain clearance for the updated BD Alaris system. \u2047 Just to give a sense of what is included in the submission and how comprehensive it is. \u2047 The 510(k) submission is intended to bring our file up to date for all changes to the pump, since the last 510(k) was cleared. \u2047 We are also implementing updated features and addressing open recall issues, including through a new version of the BD Alaris system software that will provide clinical, operational and cybersecurity updates. \u2047 These updates are part of our overall commitment to safeguard infusion programming. \u2047 And included in the software will be updates to our BD Alaris Guardrail Suite and BD Alaris EMR interoperability, including cybersecurity updates, network security and advanced data encryption. \u2047 From a hardware perspective, our submission includes updated PCU, LVP, syringe and EtCO2 modules, as well as our existing PCA module. \u2047 We plan to continue to advance the BD, Alaris system with future updates and subsequent submissions. \u2047 We filed a substantial amount of data to support the filing. \u2047 This is a complex and comprehensive submission. \u2047 Therefore, we would expect that the FDA review process will take some time to complete. \u2047 And while we're not intending to predict the FDA-specific time line, we certainly recognize that our stakeholders would like to have some input for modeling purposes and we believe it would be prudent to think about Alaris' clearance sometime during the second half of our fiscal year 2022. \u2047 We plan to update you if there are any significant developments. \u2047 And for now, we expect to continue to ship to our customers who qualify under medical necessity. \u2047 We've learned a lot of valuable lessons and gained insights during this journey that we're applying to our ongoing next-generation pump platform programs as well as our quality and risk management systems. \u2047 Turning to Slide 13. \u2047 We are making significant progress with our tuck-in M&A strategy. \u2047 Year-to-date, we've closed five acquisitions and we have a robust funnel of opportunities at various stages. \u2047 We continue to exercise financial discipline, in addition to ensuring deals meet our strategic and operational criteria. \u2047 This includes them being accretive to our growth profile, supporting our key innovation themes, advancing our strategic positions, meeting our financial hurdles and creating shareholder value. \u2047 As part of building a more holistic approach to expanding our inorganic growth funnel, we also expanded our evaluation and selective investment in early stage strategic opportunities. \u2047 On Slide 14, we highlight our key innovation themes and with some of our tuck-in acquisitions and R&D products across our three business segments that align to these themes, some of which I've already highlighted. \u2047 So within this theme of applying smart devices,"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 adjusted earnings per share $3.19.  \u2047  q2 adjusted earnings per share $3.19.  \u2047  q2 revenue $4.9 billion.  \u2047  bd - qtrly bd's covid-19
