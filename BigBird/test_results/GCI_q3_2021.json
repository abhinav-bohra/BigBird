{"article": ["We will be referencing it today on the call as it provides you with additional detail on this quarter's performance. \u2047 In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial information during the call today. \u2047 You can find reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the earnings supplement. \u2047 Our results in the quarter evidence continued strong growth in our digital-only subscriber counts and in our digital marketing solutions segment. \u2047 These represent stable and recurring revenue streams that are growing very rapidly with big addressable markets that we are penetrating. \u2047 The increases in these digital categories in Q3 led to year-over-year same-store revenue growth and for the fourth consecutive quarter, year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth. \u2047 Also, importantly our results are in line with previous guidance we had given at the end of the second quarter, and again, when we did our most recent refinancing about a month ago. \u2047 Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $102.1 million with a margin of 12.8% for the quarter and that brings our last 12 months adjusted EBITDA to $467 million, up meaningfully from 2020. \u2047 We achieved positive net income in the quarter of $14.7 million and adjusted net income was a very strong $26.5 million in the quarter. \u2047 Further, I'm excited to report that our last 12 months digital revenues have now exceeded $1 billion and our overall digital revenues are growing at 15% to 20%. \u2047 During the third quarter, we were able to meaningfully pay down principle on our 5-year term loan, reducing debt by $91 million in the third quarter. \u2047 Our aggressive debt repayment this year, combined with strong financial performance has allowed us to opportunistically refinance our Term Loan B. This refinancing was completed in October, just last month. \u2047 In fact, this was our second refinancing in 2021. \u2047 We have been able to materially reduce the cost of our debt, our ongoing cash interest expense and we have continued to lower our leverage. \u2047 We continue to remain on our aggressive plan to delever our balance sheet. \u2047 We were able to post strong financial results this year along with multiple refinancings despite the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the inflationary pressures that have risen here in the US and impacted so many. \u2047 It's worth highlighting that we have repeatedly shown that even in a challenging environment the compounding growth in our digital revenue businesses and our ability to strategically modulate our cost structure continues to allow us to produce stable growing adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. \u2047 With regard to our strategy, in alignment with our first strategic pillar, accelerating digital subscription growth we have accumulated our three best quarters ever of digital-only subscriber growth here in 2021, with the third quarter being our biggest growth quarter ever. \u2047 Our subscription-led strategy resulted in adding 164,000 net new digital-only subscribers in the third quarter, outpacing our previous high set in the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 The accelerating growth is built on new product launches such as USA TODAY Sports Plus, a new premium personalized sports subscription product that went live in early September. \u2047 In addition to growth in our recently launched paid Crossword app, as well as continued progress with our newly launched USA TODAY premium content subscription strategy. \u2047 These new products, combined with the continued strong growth in our local subscriber business has allowed us to begin to further accelerate our overall growth rates, more on that in a minute. \u2047 The USA TODAY Sports Plus, the immersive and interactive product gives subscribers access to augmented reality experiences, data visualization that the USA TODAY brand was built on podcast and access via live chats and text messages to the remarkable journalists across the USA TODAY Network, including Josina Anderson, an NFL expert and a veteran with over 20 years of experience who previously worked for ESPN that was named the Network's First Female National NFL Insider in 2015. \u2047 So happy to have her on board here at the USA TODAY. \u2047 USA TODAY Sports Plus is currently live in seven markets with more markets being added in the coming year. \u2047 An expanding product portfolio which includes digital subscriptions in our over 200 local markets and at the USA TODAY as well as ancillary products such as our Crossword app and Sports Plus App now allow us to test the impact of bundling on both subscriber growth and retention. \u2047 Increased rigor on content and brand marketing and on data intelligence led by our Chief Marketing and Strategy officer Mayur Gupta and our newly added Chief Data Officer, Nate Rackiewicz which who joined us in August have have also helped drive more new net subscribers in the last two quarters then in all of 2020. \u2047 We're really happy that Nate joined us as well. \u2047 While we are excited about the growth this year, we firmly believe we are in the early stages. \u2047 With 179 million average monthly unique visitors and the sixth largest reach among all domestic media peers, our digital-only subscriber volume represents less than 1% of our audience reach. \u2047 So tremendous upside as penetration increases. \u2047 We expect to end 2021 with more than 1.65 million digital subscribers and that will represent growth of over 50% versus 2020. \u2047 With expectations of an expanding product portfolio and accelerated marketing flywheel and the application of rigorous data science, we are building plans to continue this accelerated growth rate going forward into 2022. \u2047 The success in our digital subscription efforts was complemented by success in our second strategic pillar, accelerating the growth in our digital marketing solutions segment. \u2047 The digital marketing solutions business, which operates a SaaS-like model on our proprietary local IQ marketing services platform, which now generates approximately $440 million of revenue annually with growth rates that are expected to outpace the competitive market. \u2047 Our core platform revenue, which we view as customers using our proprietary digital marketing services platform, that are sold by either our direct or local market teams grew 26% year-over-year to $113 million in the third quarter. \u2047 And importantly the segment recorded record adjusted EBITDA margins again this quarter at 12.9%. \u2047 Sequentially client count demonstrated modest growth and ARPU grew 7%. \u2047 In the quarter, we also augmented our current local and direct sales channels by enabling a new freemium digital marketing solutions offering on our platform, which will serve as a low friction tool for acquiring registered users, while providing small businesses immediate marketing value and exposing them to the proprietary functionality of our broader lcoal IQ platform. \u2047 The freemium offering will operate in close connection with our marketing efforts and inside sales capabilities to create an engaged segment of new customers, which may not have previously considered local IQ. \u2047 The first 2 phases were launched in Q3 which enables a registered user to receive a free assessment of their current marketing presence and to create a local IQ account with access to the local IQ University and the ability to connect with the salesperson. \u2047 In Q4 and in 2022 we will enable additional features that drive platform engagement and the ability to purchase solutions within the freemium experience either directly or via one of our sales channels. \u2047 We look forward to updating you in the coming quarters on the metrics generated by the premium channel and are excited by the potential to expand our TAM and reduce our customer acquisition costs through these efforts. \u2047 This could represent our biggest growth category within the DMS segment over the next five years. \u2047 We continue to invest in our local IQ platform with our product team consistently rolling out product improvements to what we believe is already a best-in-class solution to help businesses build web presence, drive leads and awareness and expertly manage leads and engage customers. \u2047 In the third quarter among other enhancements we added a competitor keyword automation as soon as campaigns go live through our improved smart algorithm, which uses over 100 million national and local US businesses to drive further optimization. \u2047 We also implemented the use of first-party data as we strive to help businesses reduce their dependence on third-party cookies. \u2047 We now allow businesses to leverage their own customer data to target look like audiences at both Google and Facebook. \u2047 We believe that ongoing investment in product and marketing combined with sales channel expansion are critical to sustaining the double-digit growth in our core platform business, and expanding our core client count from over 15,000 today to a more meaningful percentage of the over 30 million small businesses here in the US. \u2047 Our third strategic pillar is optimizing our traditional print business across circulation and advertising. \u2047 In the coming year, we will be creating a focused regional effort on enhancing the performance of our Legacy print offering across the country. \u2047 We continue to have many levers to pull around our print business that we believe can improve the business performance coming from this segment despite the secular headwinds we face from data governance and intelligence impacts on customer acquisition and preferences to capitalizing on the standard systems and data analytics that have been put in place through the integration from our merger in 2019 to reinvigorating our single copy sales channel post pandemic. \u2047 Improved customer service and the focus on the right pricing all will lead to improvement in our Legacy print business in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Our fourth pillar is prioritizing investments in our growth businesses. \u2047 In the third quarter, we announced our five-year agreement with Typical USA, the US-based sports of Typical Group Limited, the leading sports betting provider in Germany. \u2047 With this announcement Typical became the exclusive sports betting and i-gaming provider for Gannett in the US. \u2047 The 5-year agreement includes $90 million in media spend by typical incremental incentives payable to Gannett for customer referrals upon reaching certain thresholds, and the ability to acquire a minority equity stake in Typical US. \u2047 In September we officially launched content assets to support this exciting partnership and engaged the avid sports betting fan. \u2047 The team launch, Sportsbook Wire,BetFTW, Bet For The Win, a site dedicated to sports betting analysis we launched a video series on site and Bet For The Win 101 to help inform and educate betters. \u2047 Additionally, the video series Lorenzo's Locks is back for another football season and more video and podcast will be launching over the next several months. \u2047 In just the first two weeks these assets drove nearly 15 million page views. \u2047 We will continue to bet big on sports with a sports audience here at Gannett of over 53 million sports fans and and we have over 500 dedicated sports journalists to help expand our coverage of the growing sports betting market. \u2047 The events business remained under pressure in the third quarter with the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic with the Delta variant, which directly impacted our ability to host live events. \u2047 While we initially saw live events accelerate in the second quarter, we largely returned to virtual events in the third quarter and expect to remain substantially virtual in the fourth quarter of this year. \u2047 Despite these challenges events revenue still grew 33% year-over-year in the third quarter and our marquee events drove impressive engagement with just over 2 million virtual and live attendees within the quarter. \u2047 RAGBRAI, the Des Moines Register's annual great bicycle right across Iowa returned in July of 2021. \u2047 The First National High School Sports Award Show was held this summer as well, featured host Michael Strahan and Rob Gronkowski and highlighted more than than 1,000 honores from 50 states. \u2047 And earlier this week, we aired the American Influencer Awards, hosted by Andy Cohen. \u2047 Our American Influencer Awards honors influential and talented social media personalities in categories, including beauty, fitness and lifestyle, and it drives significant engagement with over 5.8 million votes cast this year through our website. \u2047 This diverse portfolio of events brings a broad, engaged local to national audience into the Gannett ecosystem, and we remain firm in our belief that events will be able to generate 40%-plus year-over-year growth as we emerge from the pandemic. \u2047 Our fifth and final strategic pillar is building on an inclusive and diverse culture. \u2047 This commitment is the core pillar of our organization and influences all aspects of our operations from hiring, onboarding and educating to aligning our culture around empowering our communities to thrive. \u2047 Last year, we published our inclusion goal for 2025 and published our first companywide workforce diversity report earlier this year. \u2047 In addition, during the third quarter of 2020, our newsrooms published demographic metrics and pledge to build a workforce that mirrors the demographics of the nation and the communities we serve by the end of 2025, and to publicly report our staff demographics each year. \u2047 This September, our news organization published results from this year's survey, which reflects our Newsroom workforce as of July 13, 2021. \u2047 Similar gains were recorded in local newsrooms, including Detroit, Indianapolis, Louisville, Nashville, Phoenix and Rochester, New York. \u2047 To be sure, this work must continue in advance, but we remain committed to achieving our 2025 targets and to accurately reflect the interest, issues and lived experiences of the people we serve. \u2047 I would also like to highlight the fantastic work that Gannett Foundation has done this year. \u2047 In October, the Gannett Foundation announced $5.4 million in grants through the company's A Community Thrives Program. \u2047 In its fifth year, A Community Thrives awards grants to worthy causes and organizations across the United States, aiming to improve their communities. \u2047 Supported by the Gannett foundation, the program encourages nonprofits to promote their ideas and efforts on a national platform, leveraging the USA Today Network, including USA Today and over 200 local media brands to drive further awareness and support through donations. \u2047 Gannett's driving mission is to empower our local communities, and A Community Thrives is honored to support this year's recipients in their efforts to create change in their local communities. \u2047 Now turning our attention to the fourth quarter, we are estimating same-store total revenues to decline in the low single digits. \u2047 This decline reflects the impact of small market newspapers we have sold or in rare cases closed during 2021, combined with the impact that pandemic continues to have on the Events business as well as cycling against a strong fourth quarter last year, both in terms of revenue and adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 Despite small same-store revenue declines expected in Q4 for the reasons noted, our two-year CAGR continues to improve, and we expect that to improve again in Q4. \u2047 We are very encouraged by this improving trend. \u2047 As we march toward sustainable revenue growth, our two-year total revenue CAGR trend improved from down 12.8% in Q1 to down 12% in Q2 to down 10.1% in Q3, and we expect to be inside 10% in Q4. \u2047 With respect to adjusted EBITDA, we expect margins to be higher in the fourth quarter than the 12.8% we posted in Q3, we expect margin to be in the range of 14.5% to 16%. \u2047 As I mentioned before, we have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to modulate our cost structure in response to macroeconomic conditions. \u2047 The upcoming fourth quarter and early 2022 will be no different. \u2047 We consistently review our print portfolio and operations and optimize"], "gold_summary": ["q3 revenue fell 1.8 percent to $800.2 million.  \u2047  qtrly same store revenues increased 0.9% compared to q3 of 2020."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted
