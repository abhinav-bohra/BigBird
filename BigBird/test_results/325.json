{"article": ["Slide 2 contains our safe harbor statement. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, we had adjusted earnings of 1.3 billion or $2.94 per share. \u2047 For the year, adjusted earnings were 2.5 billion or $5.70 per share. \u2047 We delivered record results in midstream, chemicals and marketing and specialties, demonstrating the strength of our diversified portfolio. \u2047 For the third quarter in a row, we saw improved refining performance. \u2047 Looking ahead, we're optimistic about the outlook for our business. \u2047 In 2021, our employees exemplified the company's values of safety, honor, and commitment. \u2047 Our 2021 combined workforce total recordable rate of 0.12 was more than 25 times better than the U.S. manufacturing average. \u2047 Last year, our strong cash flow generation allowed us to invest $1.9 billion back into the business, returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, and paid down $1.5 billion of debt. \u2047 The 2022 capital program of $1.9 billion reflects our commitment to capital discipline. \u2047 Approximately 45% of our growth capital this year will support lower carbon opportunities, including Rodeo Renewed. \u2047 As cash flow improves further, we'll prioritize shareholder returns and debt repayment. \u2047 In October, we increased the quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share. \u2047 We remain committed to a secure, competitive, and growing dividend. \u2047 We'd like to resume share repurchases this year and on our path toward getting back to pre-COVID debt levels over the next couple of years. \u2047 We're taking steps to position Phillips 66 for the long-term competitiveness. \u2047 Across our businesses, we're assessing opportunities for permanent cost reductions. \u2047 Mark and Kevin are leading this initiative and will provide additional details on the first quarter call in April. \u2047 We're committed to a lower carbon future while continuing to deliver our vision of providing energy and improving lives around the globe. \u2047 We announced targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity last year. \u2047 By 2030, we plan to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30% and Scope 3 emissions by 15% compared to 2019 levels. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we had strong earnings from midstream, chemicals, and marketing and specialties, and we saw a continued recovery in refining profitability. \u2047 We made progress advancing our growth projects as well as taking strategic actions to position Phillips 66 for the future. \u2047 In midstream, we began commercial operations of Phillips 66 Partners' C2G Pipeline. \u2047 At the Sweeny Hub, construction of Frac 4 is 50% complete, and we expect to begin operations in the fourth quarter of this year. \u2047 CPChem is investing in a portfolio of high-return projects, growing its asset base as well as optimizing its existing operations. \u2047 This includes growing its normal alpha-olefins business with a second world-scale unit to produce 1-Hexyne, a critical component in high-performance polyethylene. \u2047 CPChem is also expanding its propylene splitting capacity by 1 billion pounds per year with a new unit located at its Cedar Bayou facility. \u2047 Both projects are expected to start up in 2023. \u2047 CPChem continues to develop two world-scale petrochemical facilities on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Ras Laffan, Qatar. \u2047 In addition, CPChem completed its first commercial sales of Marlex Anew Circular Polyethylene, which uses advanced recycling technology to convert difficult-to-recycle plastic waste into high-quality raw materials. \u2047 CPChem has successfully processed pyrolysis oil in a certified commercial scale trial and is targeting annual production of 1 billion pounds of circular polyethylene by 2030. \u2047 During the year, we began renewable diesel production at the San Francisco refinery and continued to progress Rodeo Renewed, which is expected to be completed in early 2024, subject to permitting and approvals. \u2047 Upon completion, Rodeo will initially have over 50,000 barrels per day of renewable fuel production capacity. \u2047 The conversion will reduce emissions from the facility and produce lower carbon transportation fuels. \u2047 In marketing, we acquired a commercial fleet fueling business in California, providing further placement opportunities for Rodeo renewable diesel production to end use customers. \u2047 Additionally, our retail marketing joint venture in the Central region acquired 85 sites in December, bringing the total to approximately 200 sites acquired in 2021. \u2047 These sites support long-term product placement and extend our participation in the retail value chain. \u2047 Our Emerging Energy Group is advancing opportunities in renewable fuels, batteries, carbon capture, and hydrogen. \u2047 We recently signed a technical development agreement with NOVONIX to accelerate the development of next-generation materials for the U.S. battery supply chain. \u2047 We own a 16% stake in the company, extending our presence in the battery value chain. \u2047 In December, we entered into a multiyear agreement with British Airways to supply sustainable aviation fuel produced by our Humber Refinery beginning this year. \u2047 For 2022, we'll execute our strategy with a focus on operating excellence and cost management. \u2047 We will do our part to advance the lower carbon future while maintaining disciplined capital allocation and an emphasis on returns. \u2047 Starting with an overview on Slide 4, we summarize our financial results for the year. \u2047 Adjusted earnings were $2.5 billion or $5.70 per share. \u2047 We generated $6 billion of operating cash flow or $3.9 billion excluding working capital. \u2047 These results reflect our highest annual earnings for the midstream, chemicals, and marketing and specialty segments. \u2047 Cash distributions from equity affiliates totaled $3 billion, including a record $1.6 billion from CPChem. \u2047 We ended 2021 with a net debt-to-capital ratio of 34%. \u2047 Our adjusted after-tax return on capital employed for the year was 9%. \u2047 Slide 5 shows the change in cash during the year. \u2047 We started the year with $2.5 billion in cash. \u2047 Cash from operations was $6 billion. \u2047 This included a working capital benefit of $2.1 billion, mainly due to the receipt of tax refunds as well as the impact of rising prices on our net payable position. \u2047 During the year, we paid down $1.5 billion of debt. \u2047 In November, both S&P and Moody's revised their outlooks from negative to stable. \u2047 We are committed to further deleveraging as we continue to prioritize our strong investment-grade credit ratings. \u2047 We funded $1.9 billion of capital spending and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends. \u2047 Our ending cash balance increased to $3.1 billion. \u2047 Slide 6 summarizes our fourth quarter results. \u2047 Adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion or $2.94 per share. \u2047 We generated operating cash flow of $1.8 billion, including a working capital benefit of $412 million and cash distributions from equity affiliates of $757 million. \u2047 Capital spending for the quarter was $597 million. \u2047 $265 million was for growth projects, which included approximately $100 million for retail investments in the marketing business. \u2047 We paid $403 million in dividends. \u2047 Moving to Slide 7. \u2047 This slide highlights the change in adjusted results from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, a decrease of $105 million. \u2047 Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 20% for the fourth quarter. \u2047 Slide 8 shows our midstream results. \u2047 Fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $668 million, an increase of $26 million from the previous quarter. \u2047 Transportation contributed adjusted pre-tax income of $273 million, up $90 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 The increase mainly reflects the recognition of deferred revenue. \u2047 NGL and other adjusted pre-tax income was $284 million, compared with $357 million in the third quarter. \u2047 The decrease was primarily due to lower unrealized investment gains related to NOVONIX, partially offset by higher volumes at Sweeny Hub and favorable inventory impacts. \u2047 Our investment in NOVONIX is marked to market at the end of each reporting period. \u2047 The total value of the investment, including foreign exchange impacts, increased $146 million in the fourth quarter, compared to an increase of $224 million in the third quarter. \u2047 The fractionators at the Sweeny Hub averaged a record 417,000 barrels per day, and the Freeport LPG export facility loaded a record 45 cargoes in the fourth quarter. \u2047 DCP midstream adjusted pre-tax income of $111 million was up $80 million from the previous quarter, mainly due to favorable hedging impacts in the fourth quarter compared to negative hedge results in the third quarter. \u2047 The actual hedge benefit recognized in the fourth quarter amounts to approximately $50 million. \u2047 Turning to chemicals on Slide 9. \u2047 Chemicals' fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $424 million was down $210 million from the third quarter. \u2047 Olefins and polyolefins adjusted pre-tax income was $405 million. \u2047 The $208 million decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to lower polyethylene margins, reduced sales volumes, as well as increased utility costs. \u2047 Global O&P utilization was 97% for the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted pre-tax income for SA&S was $37 million, compared with $36 million in the third quarter. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we received $479 million in cash distributions from CPChem. \u2047 Turning to refining on Slide 10. \u2047 Refining fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income was $404 million, an improvement of $220 million from the third quarter, driven by higher realized margins and improved volumes. \u2047 This was partially offset by higher costs. \u2047 Realized margins for the quarter increased by 35% to $11.60 per barrel. \u2047 Impacts from lower market crack spreads were more than offset by lower RIN costs from a reduction in our estimated 2021 compliance year obligation and lower RIN prices. \u2047 In addition, we had favorable inventory impacts and improved clean product differentials. \u2047 Refining adjusted results reflect approximately $230 million related to the EPA's proposed reduction of the RVO, of which about 75% applies to the first three quarters of the year. \u2047 Pretax turnaround costs were $106 million, up from $81 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 Crude utilization was 90% in the fourth quarter and clean product yield was 86%. \u2047 Slide 11 covers market capture. \u2047 The 3:2:1 market crack for the fourth quarter was $17.93 per barrel, compared to $19.44 per barrel in the third quarter. \u2047 Realized margin was $11.60 per barrel and resulted in an overall market capture of 65%. \u2047 Market capture in the previous quarter was 44%. \u2047 Market capture is impacted by the configuration of our refineries. \u2047 Our refineries are more heavily weighted toward distillate production than the market indicator. \u2047 During the quarter, the distillate crack increased $3.10 per barrel, and the gasoline crack decreased $3.76 per barrel. \u2047 Losses from secondary products of $1.88 per barrel improved $0.10 per barrel from the previous quarter due to increased butane blending into gasoline. \u2047 Our feedstock advantage of $0.18 per barrel improved by $0.17 per barrel from the prior quarter. \u2047 The Other category reduced realized margins by $2.02 per barrel. \u2047 This category includes RINs, freight costs, clean product realizations, and inventory impacts. \u2047 Moving to marketing and specialties on Slide 12. \u2047 Adjusted fourth quarter pre-tax income was $499 million, compared with $547 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 Marketing and Other decreased $52 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 This was primarily due to lower marketing fuel margins and volumes as well as higher costs. \u2047 Specialties generated fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $97 million, up from $93 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 On Slide 13, the corporate and other segment had adjusted pre-tax costs of $245 million, an increase of $15 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 This was primarily due to higher employee-related costs and net interest expense. \u2047 Slide 14 shows the change in cash during the fourth quarter. \u2047 We had another strong quarter for cash. \u2047 This is the third consecutive quarter that our operating cash flow enabled us to return cash to shareholders, invest in the business, pay down debt while increasing our cash balance. \u2047 This concludes my review of the financial and operating results. \u2047 Next, I'll cover a few outlook items for the first quarter and the full year. \u2047 In chemicals, we expect the first quarter global O&P utilization rate to be in the mid-90s. \u2047 In Refining, we expect the first quarter worldwide crude utilization rate to be in the high 80s and pre-tax turnaround expenses to be between 120 and $150 million. \u2047 We anticipate first quarter corporate and other costs to come in between 230 and $250 million pre-tax. \u2047 For 2022, we plan full year turnaround expenses to be between 800 and $900 million pre-tax. \u2047 We expect corporate and other costs to be in the range of 900 to $950 million pre-tax for the year. \u2047 We anticipate full year D&A of about $1.4 billion. \u2047 And finally, we expect the effective income tax rate to be in the 20 to 25% range. \u2047
