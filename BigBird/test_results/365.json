{"article": ["I'm excited that we also have Mark Parkinson from the American Health Care Association with us to discuss how our industry is responding to the COVID-19 crisis, specifically as it relates to the CARES Act and government support in the seniors housing and skilled nursing space. \u2047 It bears repeating that we could not be more in awe of their responses to the extraordinary challenges they have faced over the last many months. \u2047 And we know they will valiantly face several months to come as some areas experience resurgence of cases and we enter the winter and flu season. \u2047 I would also like to quickly update you on the story we told you last quarter about Mary Daniel, the wife of an Alzheimer's patient at one of our communities. \u2047 Mary took a part-time dishwashing job so that she could spend time with her husband amid visitation restrictions. \u2047 Because the Governor of Florida recently eased COVID-related restrictions for senior housing and care visitation, Mary completed her professional dishwashing career and can now visit her husband at will, adhering to all proper safety protocols, of course. \u2047 The community Rosecastle at Deerwood, which is operated for us by ALG Senior, has maintained close ties with Mary. \u2047 She continues to be active in the media, speaking positively about Rosecastle as well as advocating for families across the nation who are trying to find ways to see and visit their loved ones. \u2047 We wish Mary and Steve nothing but the best. \u2047 Unfortunately, there has not been a consistent meaningful decrease in COVID-19 cases around the country. \u2047 In fact, many states and regions are seeing spikes in new cases. \u2047 Some states, however, have been able to flatten the curve with several easing restrictions as they pertain to senior housing and care. \u2047 While our industry continues to face cost challenges, related to supplies, testing and staffing, I believe our operating partners now have better tools and a much better understanding of how to manage in the world of COVID. \u2047 LTC is continuing to provide support where we are needed. \u2047 For example, we're in the process of rolling out a new program called Smart Design, which was conceived by our Executive Vice President and Managing Director of Business Development, Doug Korey; and our Vice President, Marketing and Investor Relations, Mandi Hogan. \u2047 This initiative comes from LTC's desire to assist operators in upgrading their buildings for state-of-the-art infection control protocols. \u2047 While some of the biggest operators in the country may have the resources to take on such projects on their own, smaller regional operators often don't have the same bandwidth. \u2047 With that in mind, we are partnering with Avenue Development to assist our operators with turnkey and customized retrofitting options. \u2047 Some features of Smart Design include air filtration, including bipolar ionization, UV sanitation devices, custom dividers and touchless equipment, among others. \u2047 Avenue will be responsible for the retrofitting, while LTC will work with our partners to finance implementation of the program into current leases or providing a line of credit with attractive rates and flexible terms. \u2047 While COVID was the catalyst for the program, we believe the benefits will serve us well over the long term by helping ensure our portfolio includes safer, more updated assets. \u2047 Mark is going to spend his time talking about government initiatives and relief for our industry. \u2047 So I'll comment just briefly. \u2047 After a considerable lobbying effort, private pay operators are now receiving government aid. \u2047 They, along with skilled nursing operators, also received point-of-care testing equipment from the government. \u2047 Most recently, the government released Phase three of its CARES Act, which includes an additional $20 billion in funds earmarked to help cover lost revenue to healthcare providers. \u2047 Government support has been and will continue to be vital for our industry. \u2047 Mark will provide more insight in greater detail. \u2047 Moving now to more LTC-specific discussions. \u2047 While the quarter did not include significant new investments, our focus on structured finance opportunities resulted in us committing nearly $20 million in preferred equity, some of which has already been funded, and the remainder of which is expected to be funded in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Pam and Clint will provide additional details. \u2047 Although restrictions regarding visits to care facilities are starting to loosen in some parts of the country, we are cognizant of the fact that the fall and winter could bring surges of the virus and with that, restored or additional constraints. \u2047 We look forward to ramping up our engagement with potential acquisition targets when safe and as restrictions are lifted. \u2047 The market remains challenging, but I firmly believe that LTC has built a strong reputation as a creative financing partner in the seniors housing and care space by thinking outside of the REIT box to create solutions that provide our operating partners with the financing they need to help grow their business. \u2047 The reputation serve us well over the long term. \u2047 Moving to rent deferrals and abatements. \u2047 We collected 94% of third quarter rent. \u2047 Excluding Senior Lifestyle, which I'll discuss in a moment, third quarter rent collected was 97%. \u2047 The rent deferrals and abatements were granted to private pay operators. \u2047 I believe I have mentioned my dislike of the GAAP requirement to recognize straight-line rent. \u2047 Subsequent to our reporting second quarter results, Genesis reported that they had a going-concern issue. \u2047 Genesis is current on rents with us, and they have not requested any rent deferrals. \u2047 Still, LTC has had to report a reduction in this quarter's revenue for the straight-line rent write-off related to this lease. \u2047 Another operator, not in our top 10, who has been a go-to operator for challenging properties and has historically performed well, has been adversely impacted by COVID-19 and began short paying rent in the third quarter and requested deferrals. \u2047 Despite receiving government financial support, this operator is reluctant to actually use those funds to pay rent for fear that there may be a government payback provision. \u2047 As a result, we put them on the cash basis and wrote off their straight-line balance. \u2047 Additionally, in support of this operator, we agreed to close an assisted living facility in Florida that had drawn the attention of certain plaintiffs' attorneys and was damaged by one of the recent Florida storms. \u2047 This closure required us to record a realization reserve of $941,000. \u2047 We have not released the operator of the obligation to pay contractual rents going forward, and I believe we will eventually recover our deferred rents and contractual rents that Pam tells me my belief is not GAAP. \u2047 I'll now provide a quick update on our Senior Lifestyle portfolio. \u2047 As I mentioned last quarter, we placed the portfolio on a cash basis due to a shortfall in May and June rent payments. \u2047 Since that time, while recent rent payments are trending up, Senior Lifestyle remains in arrears. \u2047 For the 2020 third quarter, we received rent payments of approximately $3.3 million against their quarterly contractual rent obligation to LTC of approximately $4.6 million. \u2047 At September 30, Senior Lifestyle owed us $3.8 million for second and third quarter rents, $2.5 million of which is recorded in our financial statements and is covered by an undrawn letter of credit, which we hold. \u2047 In October, we received rent of approximately $1.3 million against Senior Lifestyle's contractual rent obligation for the month of approximately $1.6 million. \u2047 In cooperation with Senior Lifestyle, we are actively working to make changes to the 23-property portfolio, which may include bringing in new operators, pursuing sales of some of the buildings or retaining Senior Lifestyle in a few of the properties. \u2047 We are currently in negotiations with several parties and expect to have resolution for the majority of the portfolio in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 As we discussed previously, transitioning this portfolio provides LTC with the opportunity to build relationships among several different regional operators, some of whom will be new to LTC and others with whom we have an existing relationship. \u2047 As a result, we will further reduce portfolio concentration, one of our key strategic focuses. \u2047 With respect to guidance, we are not providing it at this time due to ongoing COVID-related uncertainties. \u2047 Total revenue decreased $8.9 million compared with last year's third quarter, primarily resulting from the $5.5 million write-off that Wendy discussed, a result of transitioning two leases to cash basis accounting as of September 30, 2020. \u2047 Genesis disclosed in its most recent 10-Q that there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. \u2047 LTC continues to collect all contractual rent due from Genesis. \u2047 However, the level of certainty regarding the collectibility of future rent from Genesis through lease maturity does not meet the threshold required to maintain it on an accrual basis. \u2047 The other operator did not pay its full contractual rent for the third quarter of 2020 due to COVID-19, and we wrote off their straight-line rent balance. \u2047 During the quarter, we provided this operator with rent support in the form of deferrals and abatements totaling $756,000. \u2047 As with Genesis, the level of certainty regarding the collectibility of this operator's future rent through lease maturity does not meet the threshold required to maintain it on an accrual basis. \u2047 Decreased rent from Preferred Care resulting from the sale of that portfolio earlier this year, lower rent from Senior Lifestyle, deferred and abated rent and a reduction in property tax revenue also contributed to the decline in total revenue. \u2047 Offsetting these reductions were contractual rent increases related to acquisitions and completed development projects and higher rent payments from Anthem. \u2047 Interest income from mortgage loans increased $244,000 due to the funding of expansion and renovation projects. \u2047 Interest and other income decreased $535,000 due to the partial paydown of an outstanding mezzanine loan as well as a reduction in miscellaneous income. \u2047 Income from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $704,000 in the third quarter due to the repayment of a mezzanine loan accounted for as a joint venture and the dissolution of our preferred equity investment in a joint venture with an affiliate of Senior Lifestyle, which occurred in the second quarter. \u2047 Interest expense decreased $466,000 due to lower outstanding balances and lower interest rates under our line of credit in 3Q 2020, partially offset by the sale of $100 million of senior unsecured notes in 4Q 2019. \u2047 Property tax expense decreased $919,000 due to Preferred Care property sales and our Senior Lifestyle portfolio, offset by increases related to acquisitions and completed development projects. \u2047 During the third quarter, we recorded a $941,000 impairment charge related to the closed assisted living property in Florida. \u2047 We also received $373,000 in insurance proceeds for roof damage related to a property we sold in the first quarter of this year. \u2047 Net income available to common shareholders for the third quarter of 2020 decreased $15 million primarily due to the straight-line rent write-offs and the decreased rent from Preferred Care and Senior Lifestyle that I discussed earlier. \u2047 Deferred and abated rent, the impairment charge, lower income from unconsolidated joint ventures and a $6.2 million gain on sale in last year's third quarter also contributed to the decline. \u2047 The offsets included increases due to acquisition and completed development projects, contractual rent increases and an increase in Anthem's rent, lower interest expense and the gain from insurance proceeds. \u2047 NAREIT FFO per fully diluted share was $0.58 for the 2020 third quarter compared with $0.77 last year. \u2047 Excluding the nonrecurring items already discussed in the current period, FFO per fully diluted share was $0.71 this quarter compared with $0.77 for last year's third quarter. \u2047 The $0.06 decrease in FFO, excluding nonrecurring items, resulted from lower revenues related to property sales, reduced rent from Senior Lifestyle, deferred and abated rent and lower income from unconsolidated joint ventures, partially offset by lower interest and property tax expense. \u2047 Funds available for distribution, excluding the $373,000 nonrecurring insurance proceeds gain, decreased $2 million due to Senior Lifestyle and deferred and abated rents in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 During the third quarter, we invested $6.3 million of preferred equity to develop and own an assisted living and memory care community. \u2047 This investment earns an initial cash rate of 7%, increasing to 9% in year four until the IRR reaches 8%. \u2047 After achieving an 8% IRR, the cash rate drops to 8% with an IRR ranging between 12% and 14% depending on the timing of redemption. \u2047 The investment is accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture. \u2047 We also entered into a preferred equity agreement to invest $13 million to develop and own an independent and assisted living community. \u2047 We expect to fund this investment after certain conditions are met, the deadline for which is December 1. \u2047 It will earn an initial cash rate of 8% and an IRR of 12%. \u2047 This investment is also accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture. \u2047 Clint will discuss these transactions in greater detail shortly. \u2047 In the third quarter, we also funded $3.9 million in development and capital improvement projects on properties we own, $1.6 million under mortgage loans and paid $22.4 million in common dividends. \u2047 During the quarter, the development of our 90-bed skilled nursing center in Missouri was completed under budget by $1.3 million. \u2047 We anticipate funding the remaining $3.1 million of project costs in the 2020 fourth quarter. \u2047 The initial yield on our investment is 9.25%, escalating annually by 2%. \u2047 We currently have remaining commitments under mortgage loans of $2.3 million related to expansions and renovations on four properties in Michigan. \u2047 We received $2.6 million in the 2020 third quarter related to the partial paydown of an outstanding mezzanine loan. \u2047 At September 30, we had $22.8 million in cash. \u2047 We also had more than $510 million available under our line of credit and $200 million under our ATM program, providing LTC with ample liquidity of approximately $733 million. \u2047 Our long-term debt to maturity profile remains well matched to our projected free cash flow, helping moderate future refinancing risk. \u2047 And we have no significant long-term debt maturities over the next five years. \u2047 At the end of the 2020 third quarter, our credit metrics compared favorably to the healthcare REIT industry average, with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA for real estate of 4.6 times, an annualized adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.7 times and a debt to enterprise value of 32.9%. \u2047 The effect of the economic fallout from COVID-19 on the real estate capital markets has resulted in our debt to enterprise leverage metric being higher than our long-term target of 30%. \u2047 However"], "gold_summary": ["q3 ffo per share $0.58."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 ffo per share $0.58.  \u2047  q3 ffo per share $0.58."]}
