{"article": ["Before I turn things over to Jay, let me quickly go over our disclaimer. \u2047 We encourage you to consider the risk factors contained in our SEC filings for a detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties. \u2047 We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or further events, except as required by law. \u2047 A recording of the call will be available later today. \u2047 Our commentary today will also include non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 And with that, I'll turn things over to Jay Farner to get us started. \u2047 Our platform continues to execute at scale and grow across our businesses. \u2047 Rocket Mortgage is the largest mortgage lender in America with industry-leading profitability. \u2047 Our title and settlement services business, Amrock, is also the largest of its kind in the country. \u2047 Our emerging businesses also set new records in the quarter. \u2047 Rocket Homes reached $2.3 billion in real estate transaction value, and its current annualized run rate placed the company among the top 20 brokerages in the country. \u2047 Rocket Auto also reached a record $530 million in gross merchandise value in the quarter. \u2047 The number of vehicle sales facilitated by Rocket Auto in the last 12 months would put the company in the top 10 of all used car dealers nationwide. \u2047 I'm also excited to touch on the new Mortgage-as-a-Service opportunity we're launching in partnership with Salesforce. \u2047 Last quarter, we had excellent results. \u2047 with closed loan volume and gain on sale margin exceeding the top end of our guidance range. \u2047 Rocket Mortgage delivered $88 billion in closed loan volume, and Rocket Companies generated $3.2 billion in adjusted revenue and $1.6 billion in adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 On an adjusted EBITDA basis, we doubled the size of our business compared to 2019, again, demonstrating the sheer power and scalability of the Rocket platform. \u2047 We hit new records in both purchase and cash out refi volume in Q3. \u2047 We've also just recently announced a major partnership with Salesforce. \u2047 Up to this point in time, we have used Rocket technology to process our own mortgage volume through both our direct-to-consumer and partner network channels. \u2047 The Salesforce partnership will now open our mortgage technology and process to third-party financial institutions through the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud. \u2047 This new Mortgage-as-a-Service model is a game changer for the industry and for Rocket. \u2047 More than simply leveraging our technologies, these banks and credit unions will have Rocket integrated into their centralized workflow, making the process seamless and simple. \u2047 The opportunity is massive. \u2047 In 2020, the approximately 10,000 banks and credit unions originated over $1 trillion in mortgages. \u2047 That represents nearly a third of the total market in the US We believe Mortgage-as-a-Service represents a new model for financial institutions to partner with Rocket, paving the way for an even larger opportunity to provide consumer lending as a service, including mortgages, auto loans and personal loans. \u2047 Expect to hear more about this partnership in the first half of 2022. \u2047 With multiple channels all operating at scale over a broad range of products, we have many levers to drive growth while optimizing gain on sale margins even in shifting markets. \u2047 Our ability to pivot and scale is Rocket's key differentiator. \u2047 In fact, in the third quarter, we saw strong growth in our direct-to-consumer channel, where our purchase initiatives continue to gain traction. \u2047 We will be allocating additional resources to further support this growth. \u2047 More broadly, we've seen strength in products that aren't as interest rate-sensitive. \u2047 In the third quarter, both purchase and cashout refinancing hit new company records, rising approximately 70% year over year. \u2047 This growth is a direct result of Rocket's commitment to providing speed, certainty and choice to our clients, all of which are crucial in the ongoing inventory constrained, highly competitive housing market. \u2047 Not only did we set a record for purchase volume in the third quarter with both our direct-to-consumer and partner channels achieving all-time highs, but by the end of September, we had already originated more purchase volume than any full year prior. \u2047 This rapid growth in the purchase segment puts us well on our way to reaching our goal of becoming the No. \u2047 1 retail purchase lender by 2023. \u2047 Helping drive our continued growth in the purchase category is our seamless end-to-end homebuying ecosystem in partnership with Rocket Homes. \u2047 Through our integrated platform, clients can find their next house on Rocket Homes' 50 state home listing search platform, secure an agent from the company's agent network, get financing through Rocket Mortgage, have Amrock conduct the title work and appraisal for them and then after closing, have their mortgage serviced by Rocket Mortgage, all from one centralized platform. \u2047 Other key drivers helping us win in today's purchase market are industry-leading products like our Overnight Underwrite and a broad range of homebuying and selling services. \u2047 For instance, Rocket Homes offers the choice to sell your home through its on-staff agents, its 50-state network of real estate professionals or through its ForSaleByOwner platform. \u2047 Additionally, we recently rolled out our Breaking Barriers program for our Rocket Pro TPO partners. \u2047 These technology enhancements, paired with programming to better connect real estate professionals and mortgage brokers are designed to give our partners the tools that they need to win today and well into the future. \u2047 As we look ahead to the next year, we expect our Rocket Mortgage business to achieve continued market share growth, exceeding 10% share in a purchase-heavy market. \u2047 This is consistent with our track record of being opportunistic to grow share. \u2047 For instance, in 2019, our company's mortgage originations accounted for roughly 6.5% of the market. \u2047 In 2020, that grew to nearly 8.5%. \u2047 With the fourth quarter guidance released earlier today, which Julie will walk through in more detail, we are well on pace to break 2020's strong origination record of $320 billion and end the year with 9.5% market share. \u2047 As we look toward 2022, we will continue to invest in the rapid growth of our platform. \u2047 delivering a unified client experience across mortgage, real estate, auto, personal loans and solar. \u2047 In our emerging businesses, we expect continued growth from Rocket Auto and Rocket Homes in 2022, on top of the records reached in 2021. \u2047 We will also formally launch our solar program and continue to target new product categories to add to the Rocket platform, either organically or through acquisition. \u2047 Our platform has been built to capitalize on the vast data, proprietary technology, trusted brand and Cloud Force here at Rocket Companies. \u2047 Refined over decades, these pillars of our platform are the foundation of our growth ahead. \u2047 With that, I'll turn things over to Julie to go deeper into the numbers. \u2047 I'm pleased to report another quarter of strong financial results for Rocket Companies as we continue to leverage our flexible platform, grow our business at scale and drive substantial profitability. \u2047 Now, we'll get into the numbers. \u2047 During the third quarter of 2021, Rocket Companies generated $3.2 billion of adjusted revenue, which is a 76% increase from Q3 2019. \u2047 We had $1.6 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, more than doubling the results of Q3 2019, representing a 48% adjusted EBITDA margin. \u2047 We delivered net income of $1.4 billion, up 181% from Q3 2019 and adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, exceeding Q3 of 2019 by more than two times. \u2047 Over that same period, our adjusted net income margin was 36% and adjusted earnings per share was $0.57 for the quarter. \u2047 Rocket Mortgage generated $88 billion of closed loan origination volume during the quarter, up nearly 120% from $40 billion in Q3 2019. \u2047 Focusing on home purchase, our momentum has continued with Q3 purchase volume up more than 70% year over year, marking a new company record set in just the first nine months of the year. \u2047 In fact, both our direct-to-consumer and partner network segment generated all-time highs for purchase volume during the quarter with our higher-margin, direct-to-consumer business having the strongest gain. \u2047 For the quarter, our rate lock-in on sale margin was 305 basis points, which was above the high end of our guidance range and substantially higher than multichannel mortgage originators. \u2047 Gain on sale margins improved quarter over quarter in both our direct-to-consumer and partner network segment. \u2047 Our emerging businesses continued to reach new record. \u2047 At Rocket Homes, we generated record real estate transaction value of $2.3 billion during the quarter, closing more than 9,000 transactions. \u2047 Our rockethomes.com website continues to increase high-intent traffic and was up nearly five times year over year with 2.4 million monthly average users during Q3. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, Rocket Auto's gross merchandise value, or GMV, and has grown nearly two and a half times year over year as momentum for this business continues to grow as we expand inventory partners and with the launch of rocketauto.com. \u2047 We are leveraging our platform and strong base of 2.5 million servicing clients as of the end of October to grow and ramp these emerging businesses. \u2047 The Rocket Companies flywheel is based on leveraging our profitability advantages to constantly reinvest in our business, driving continued growth and strengthening our competitive position. \u2047 We see tremendous potential to drive sustainable and profitable market share gains in our core mortgage business. \u2047 We are also investing to grow beyond mortgage and leverage our platform to scale our newer real estate, auto, personal loans and solar businesses. \u2047 This growth will come from continued investment in the pillars of our platform, particularly technology. \u2047 Fueled by our vast data lake aggregated through millions of client interactions, our technology drives speed and certainty to improve client experience, higher efficiency for our businesses and opens the door to new market opportunities. \u2047 For example, Amrock completed its 1 millionth digital closing in September, cementing its leadership position in the eClosing market. \u2047 Amrock digital experience makes the closing process easier, faster and more accessible translating to a better client experience overall. \u2047 Cumulatively, our technology investments are driving meaningful change in our business. \u2047 We expanded the rollout of Rocket Logic, which can now be used by substantially all of our Rocket Cloud Force. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, our turn times improved by more than 33% this quarter, extending the gap between us and others in the industry. \u2047 This was achieved while generating a similar level of business with a substantially higher mix of purchase transactions, which historically take longer to close. \u2047 We're also leveraging our technology platform beyond our own four walls. \u2047 As Jay mentioned, our recently announced Mortgage-as-a-Service offering with Salesforce opens up a new opportunity for Rocket Mortgage to partner with medium and large-sized financial institutions that make up approximately a third of the mortgage market. \u2047 Mortgage as a Service represents a large incremental opportunity for Rocket Mortgage to continue growing market share in the years ahead. \u2047 Increasing the lifetime value of our clients is another core component to our growth strategy. \u2047 Our business is profitable on the first transaction with the client. \u2047 We then maintain ongoing loan servicing relationships with 2.5 million clients representing over $530 billion in outstanding loan principal as of the end of October. \u2047 Mortgage servicing drives a recurring cash free for Rocket Companies of $1.3 billion on an annual basis, which covers nearly a quarter of our annualized expenses. \u2047 More importantly, with service unpaid principal balance of 30% in the past 12 months and net retention above 90%, we are positioned to continue to drive additional clients to our platform across both our direct-to-consumer and partner network channels. \u2047 In addition to generating our clients organically, we acquired MSRs with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $3.6 billion during the third quarter. \u2047 This is in accordance with our growth strategy as we have found that our industry-leading retention rate positions us to generate attractive returns through select MSR portfolio acquisitions. \u2047 We remain aggressive in pursuing this strategy, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to deploy capital through these types of acquisitions. \u2047 Looking ahead to Q4, the housing market remains active. \u2047 Homeowners are sitting on the highest levels of home equity in history, and the investments we have been making are gaining traction across the platform, especially with the progress we're making in purchase. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, we currently expect closed loan volume in the range of $75 billion to $80 billion, and rate lock volume between $71 billion and $78 billion. \u2047 At the midpoint of our fourth quarter guided range, our full year 2021 closed loan origination volume would exceed $350 billion, exceeding the previous record of $320 billion achieved in 2020 by more than 10%. \u2047 Rocket Mortgage has a long-term track record of consistent market share gains. \u2047 We have grown market share from 1% in 2009 to nearly 8.5% in 2020, 9.5% in 2021 and expect to reach more than 10% in 2022. \u2047 We expect fourth quarter gain on sale margin to be in the range of 265 to 295 basis points. \u2047 Regarding our expenses, we believe the run rate of operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 is a good reference for the fourth quarter. \u2047 Turning to our balance sheet, liquidity and capital allocation. \u2047 We exited the third quarter with $2.2 billion of cash on the balance sheet and an additional $2.9 billion of corporate cash used to self-fund loan originations for total available cash of $5.1 billion. \u2047 Total liquidity stood at $8.6 billion as of September 30, including available cash plus undrawn lines of credit and undrawn MSR line. \u2047 Keep in mind, even with the record level of originations we generated in 2021, we need less than $1 billion of cash on hand to properly operate our business. \u2047 Our business is capital-light and our balance sheet is extremely strong. \u2047 As we've said before, our capital priorities always start with proper capitalization and reinvesting in the business. \u2047 With $5.1 billion of available cash, we have the opportunity to consider acquisitions, repurchase shares and return capital to shareholders via dividends as we've done in the past. \u2047 For acquisitions, we look for bolt-on targets that would be additive to our platform by bringing new clients into our ecosystem, enhancing operational efficiencies or enhancing our product offering. \u2047 During the third quarter, we increased the level at which we have bought back shares. \u2047 Through the end of October, we have deployed $94 million to repurchase approximately 5.7 million shares. \u2047 This is in addition to the special dividend of $1.11 per Class A common share, funded"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly adjusted diluted earnings per share $0.57."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.57.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.57."]}
