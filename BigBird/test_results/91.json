{"article": ["They are based on management's [Technical Issues]. \u2047 We expect to file our 10-Q later today. \u2047 As mentioned, this teleconference is being recorded and will be available on our website following the call. \u2047 News media may also contact me. \u2047 We look forward to see many of you at the American Gas Association Financial Forum in a few weeks. \u2047 Please also contact me if you have any questions about the event or meeting with our management team. \u2047 Well, our year is off to a great start. \u2047 Our financial results are solid, and we continue to make progress on all key objectives. \u2047 We reported net income of $1.94 per share in the first quarter that compares to net income from continuing operations of $1.58 per share for the same period last year. \u2047 New rates in Oregon drove results of the Gas Utility along with continued healthy customer growth and improved results from our interstate storage business. \u2047 I'm pleased with how all of our systems operated over the winter and specifically during the widespread cold snap in February. \u2047 Our extensive resource planning and the value of our gas storage assets were proven once again. \u2047 Our team successfully managed gas supplies to mitigate the impact of the event on customers and additionally through a third-party, we were able to optimize our gas supply portfolio, capturing asset management revenues, which aid results but also offset higher gas cost for our customers. \u2047 While many areas of the country will experience significantly elevated bills, our customers are going to fare quite well. \u2047 Our commitment to safety and reliability served Northwest Natural Water customers well in February also. \u2047 Our water utilities operating in the Pacific Northwest served customers through the February event without disruption. \u2047 In Texas, power outages resulted in freezing and bursting pipes on roughly half of our systems, but we were able to restore water service within 24 to 48 hours to all customers. \u2047 Now a few notes on the economy. \u2047 The COVID vaccine has been rolled out in all states that we operate, economic reports for our region continued to show good recovery and growth in several important areas. \u2047 Oregon's unemployment rate was 6.1% in February, which is comparable to the national rate. \u2047 Single-family housing activity remained strong. \u2047 In the Portland metro region, home sales were up 7.4% from 2020 with price growth of about 12% on average. \u2047 And new single-family permits issued were up 5.7% in Oregon over the last 12 months compared to the prior period. \u2047 We continue to see good customer growth. \u2047 New construction plus conversions translated into connecting over 11,000 meters during the 12 months ended March 31, which equates to a growth rate of 1.4%. \u2047 Our water and wastewater utilities also continue to grow. \u2047 Strong residential housing construction primarily in Idaho, Texas and Washington translated into a strong 3% growth rate. \u2047 We also closed on tuck-in acquisitions this past year, leading to an overall customer growth rate of almost 6% -- actually 5.8% to be exact. \u2047 Frank, over to you. \u2047 I will begin today by discussing the highlights of first quarter 2021 results and conclude with guidance for the year. \u2047 I'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%. \u2047 As a reminder, Northwest Natural's earnings are seasonal with a majority of revenues and earnings generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating months. \u2047 For the quarter, we reported net income of $59.5 million or $1.94 per share compared to net $48.3 million or $1.58 per share of net income from continuing operations for the same period in 2020. \u2047 The Gas Utility posted an increase of $0.19 per share and our other activities contributed an additional $0.17 per share compared to last year. \u2047 Higher earnings at the Gas Utility were primarily related to new rates set in Oregon in November of 2020, offset in part by higher depreciation and general tax expense. \u2047 Utility margin in the Gas Distribution segment increased $13.6 million as a result of the new rates and customer growth, which were partly offset by the $1.8 million greater loss from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism as we purchased higher gas -- priced gas during the February cold weather event than was forecasted for the year. \u2047 Utility O&M increased $2.1 million in the quarter, reflecting higher compensation and non-payroll expenses. \u2047 Depreciation expense and general taxes increased $3.3 million. \u2047 In addition to the impact of the higher pre-tax income, tax expense increased $1.7 million due to the net effect of the Oregon Corporate Activity Tax and the ongoing amortization of tax benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. \u2047 This impact is largely a timing matter, which will correct over the course of the year with no significant expected effect on net income. \u2047 Net income from our other businesses increased $5.3 million due to $4.6 million of higher asset management revenues from the weather event as David mentioned. \u2047 In addition, other businesses benefited from higher earnings at the water and wastewater utilities, from assets we acquired in Washington and Texas last year, as well as lower expenses at our holding company. \u2047 Cash provided by operating activities was $137 million or an increase of $32 million compared to last year. \u2047 We reinvested $64 million into the business, most of which was Gas Utility capital expenditures. \u2047 Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity. \u2047 From an earnings perspective, the ongoing effects of COVID are largely limited to commercial customer disconnects and slightly lower usage from non-decoupled customers, as well as late fee revenues that will be recognized at a future date when we begin recovery. \u2047 And as David noted, commercial customer accounts remained steady during the first quarter, even as we began normal collection practices. \u2047 Furthermore, we have a good -- had a good response to past due notices with a substantial reduction in delinquent balances. \u2047 We will continue to closely monitor usage levels and commercial customer losses and be disciplined in cost management. \u2047 We are pleased to note that 97% of our commercial and industrial customers are current with their bills. \u2047 The company reaffirmed 2021 earnings guidance today for net income in the range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. \u2047 The guidance assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant changes in laws, legislation or regulations. \u2047 While our business model allows us to adapt to unforeseen challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic and the most recent weather event, while also delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders, our decisions are guided by our long-standing core values and those values inform our environmental, social and governance goals and actions. \u2047 So today, I'll walk you through just a few of our priorities and progress. \u2047 It's our greatest responsibility to our customers, our employees and the communities we serve. \u2047 In the 1980s, Northwest Natural proactively created a pipeline replacement program with our public utility commissions. \u2047 And by 2015, we had replaced all of our cast iron and bare steel pipe. \u2047 We are one of the first local distribution companies to completely remove those legacy pipelines and, today, as a result, operate one of the most modern and tightest systems in the nation, but we remain vigilant. \u2047 For example, we performed safety inspections on our transmission system at nearly three times the rate required by federal and state regulations. \u2047 Our long-standing core value of environmental stewardship is also a driving force behind the choices we make every day in our operations in planning for the future. \u2047 We believe climate change requires rapid innovation and collective action, which is why we're committed to reimagining the role of our system and the fuel we deliver. \u2047 In 2016, we established a 30% carbon savings goal to be achieved by 2035 starting from a 2015 baseline. \u2047 This goal is for our own operations and importantly, the use. \u2047 It also includes the use of natural gas by our customers and I want to underscore, this is a very unique and aggressive voluntary goal as compared to others. \u2047 It has been a catalyst for us to lead beyond our walls by building public policy coalitions that support innovation and new thinking. \u2047 One example of that is the groundbreaking Oregon Senate Bill 98, which allows us to procure renewable natural gas, including hydrogen, for our customers here in Oregon. \u2047 This law goes further than any other current law in the U.S. by outlining goals for adding as much as 30% renewables on the system by 2050. \u2047 I'm proud to report that we made good progress on our carbon savings goal and results through 2020 show we are on track to meet or exceed that original target. \u2047 Energy efficiency contributed nearly half of the savings achieved, with our voluntary carbon offset program also providing significant savings. \u2047 And finally our producer emissions screening tool allows us to prioritize purchases from lower and medium producers and also contributed to the goal. \u2047 The benefits we're reaping today are from programs and efforts that we began many years ago. \u2047 It's a good reminder that having a vision and a commitment to pursue it is critical to realizing significant change, which is why we're not stopping there. \u2047 We believe we can leverage renewables in our existing modern system along with other innovations to further decarbonize our system. \u2047 Our vision forward is to be carbon-neutral energy provider by 2050. \u2047 We know the current tools for driving to carbon neutrality, but this year, we are modeling multiple scenarios to better understand the different pathways. \u2047 While we expect this analysis to evolve over time, having a start to specific roadmaps and options will allow us to begin advocating for additional policy support and putting programs and people in place for long-term success. \u2047 We know our customers and communities value finding the right environmental solutions along -- among many other priorities, which is why we monitor customer satisfaction carefully to inform our work. \u2047 And I'm pleased to report this is an area our employees continue to excel. \u2047 Last year, Northwest Natural scored second in the West for large utilities in the J.D. Power Gas Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study and were named a Customer Champion by Escalent after placing second in the nation among electric and gas utilities in their most recent study. \u2047 And finally, just a few weeks ago, Northwest Natural was also named an Environmental Champion among 140 of the largest utilities in a national study by Cogent. \u2047 I am so proud of customers' recognition of our dedication and leadership in this area and extremely proud of our employees. \u2047 Now a few items on our water utilities. \u2047 As part of our focus to build a healthy, growing water business, we regularly invest in infrastructure improvements, such as pipe replacements, new wells and execute on multi-year plans for larger upgrades. \u2047 In 2020, we worked to upgrade technology across our water platform, making it possible to proactively detect and fix issues that caused service interruptions. \u2047 To build a culture of safety, we began implementing consistent safety standards and trainings across all locations. \u2047 All of this preparation came into play with good results. \u2047 In 2020, our water systems experienced no COVID-related service interruptions. \u2047 And as I mentioned, our employees in Texas were able to quickly get systems back up and running during the February 2021 winter event. \u2047 We're also staying focused on supporting our water utilities with a comprehensive analysis and assistance during rate cases. \u2047 In 2020, we filed three rate cases and have already concluded one of those in Idaho. \u2047 At the same time, we continue acquiring water utilities and expanding our water family. \u2047 I continue to remain very excited about the investment potential and the growth opportunities in this business. \u2047 And with that, Nick, I think we're ready to open it up for anybody that has any questions. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $1.94.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $1.94.  \u2047  compname says reaffirmed 2021 earnings guidance in range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $1.94.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $1.94."]}
