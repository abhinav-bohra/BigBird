{"article": ["Now, Connie, will begin with her remarks. \u2047 In 2020, we achieved consolidated net income of $197.8 million and earnings per share of $1.81. \u2047 While down from 2019, our consolidated 2020 earnings include strong utility[Phonetic] results, driven by good regulatory mechanisms and the utilities focus on cost savings, while the bank performed well given pandemic-driven economic challenges. \u2047 Last week, our Board approved our third consecutive annual dividend, raising the quarterly dividend per share from $0.33 to $0.34. \u2047 This reflects our continued financial performance and our confidence in our future prospects. \u2047 I'm proud of the commitment of our employees as we work to support our customers through the challenges of 2020, protect fellow employees and care for our communities, all while continuing to deliver solid consolidated financial results and advance long-term priorities. \u2047 We have viewed our[Indecipherable] source of strength to help our state weather the challenges of COVID. \u2047 This has included extensive actions across our company, including at our utility suspending disconnections, providing payment options to help customers manage their bills and proposing to hold base rates flat on Oahu to help keep rates down. \u2047 In addition, based on the utility's strong financial results, at year-end, HEI provided $2 million for Hawaiian Electric to be the founding sponsor of the Aloha United Way, Hawaii Utility Bill Assistance Program to help families and all island pay utility bills. \u2047 Similarly, our bank offered loan deferrals, temporarily suspended fees and deployed $370 million in Paycheck Protection Program funding to support approximately 4,100 small businesses representing about 40,000 local jobs. \u2047 2020 was a record year for our charitable giving, including the Utility Bill Assistance Fund I just mentioned, our companies and employees together made charitable commitments of $5.5 million, more than double our typical level. \u2047 These actions reflect who we are as a company and our long-standing ESG focus. \u2047 In 2020, we issued our first validated ESG report, which is aligned with SASB guidance. \u2047 Despite the challenges presented by COVID, we remained focused on our strategic priorities, including at Hawaiian Electric, and those are to deliver a cost-effective clean energy portfolio, improve customer experience and offer innovative energy solutions, create a modern grid and technology platform, strengthen stakeholder relationships, work with stakeholders to align regulatory and market models, improve our company culture and ensure that we have the financial strength to deliver on our state's ambitious energy goals. \u2047 We outperformed our 2020 renewable energy portfolio milestone of 30% with 34.5% RPS for the year, while lower demand due to the pandemic contributed to that result, if electricity used had been the same as 2019, we would still have exceeded the milestone at 32%. \u2047 The RPS APM established in the performance base rate making docket incentivizes us to continue to focus on exceeding the statutory milestones, and we will talk about that in a moment. \u2047 We continue to aggressively advance renewable energy and storage procurement, filing nine Stage 2 RFP purchase power agreement. \u2047 Three of those have now been approved by the PUC. \u2047 We also filed applications for our two self-build storage projects and continued moving Stage 1 RFP projects forward. \u2047 Together, Stage 1 and 2 projects, if completed as planned, are expected to add about 650 megawatts of solar and about 3 gigawatt hours of storage to our system by the end of 2023. \u2047 Limited land, especially on Oahu, means that in addition to utility-scale projects, distributed energy resources' community-based projects and grid services are critical to achieving our goals. \u2047 20% of our residential customers and 36% of single-family homes on Oahu have rooftop solar, by far the leading rooftop solar uptake per capita in the nation. \u2047 The pace of new rooftop solar additions also picked up in 2020 with 55% more installed in 2020 than in the prior year. \u2047 Importantly, 78% of new rooftop solar applications also have battery storage. \u2047 This allows daytime excess solar production to be used to reduce fossil-based power at night. \u2047 We've launched our new Quick Connect program to enable customers to interconnect their rooftop solar faster, and we will soon launch our shared solar program, a new phase of community-based renewable energy to extend the benefits of clean energy to a wider range of residents, with priority to those who have been underrepresented in solar adoption, such as renters and customers with low-to-moderate incomes. \u2047 All of these clean energy efforts are contributing to our state's economic recovery and creating local jobs. \u2047 We continue to work together with our communities and stakeholders to find the best ways to achieve a clean energy future that's affordable, resilient and reliable. \u2047 Stakeholder engagement has been central to our integrated grid planning process, which is developing long-range plans to inform investment priorities for resilience, grid and generation resources. \u2047 Our utility focused heavily on cost savings in 2020. \u2047 Building on our One Company initiative, in 2020, we outlined a three-year program to reduce costs and increase efficiency, beginning well before the main management audit report that was part of our 2020 rate case. \u2047 In 2020, we achieved significant savings, including $7 million in O&M savings through better planning, coordination and execution of work; targeted staffing reductions; and continued efforts in strategic sourcing. \u2047 We also achieved the savings we committed to deliver to customers in connection with our Enterprise Resource Planning system, ERP. \u2047 Our cost management focus enabled us to adjust to the flat base rates we proposed for our Oahu rate case and positions the utility well to deliver on its management audit savings commitment, customer dividend and operate under PBR. \u2047 Our utilities' achievements in 2020 support our 2021 to 2025 strategic plan priorities, which include advancing decarbonization and resilience, both in our electric system and more broadly, in our state, driving a sustainable and equitable local economy, strengthening our company culture and demonstrating our commitment to safety and the highest level of performance in all that we do, engaging with our communities to develop solutions that are sustainable, reliable and affordable and ensuring we have the financial strength to invest in this decarbonized and sustainable future for our companies and our communities. \u2047 In December, the PUC issued its Phase 2 decision establishing the landmark PBR framework, capping a 2.5-year process that included extensive involvement by the utility and stakeholders. \u2047 Overall, we view the new framework is providing a balanced approach designed to provide value for customers and opportunities for the utility, as we continue one of the nation's most ambitious energy transformation. \u2047 The PBR framework is designed to balance a number of important interests, including those the PUC identified in its Phase 1 PBR decision last year. \u2047 For example, PBR promotes cost control and affordability through the inflationary adjustment and customer dividend component of the annual revenue adjustment or ARA mechanism, advances customer equity through incentives to collaborate on low-to-moderate income or LMI energy efficiency initiatives, encourages innovation through a new pilot project process, incentivizes accelerated renewable energy additions through the RPS-A performance incentive mechanism or PIM and supports utility financial integrity by eliminating elements of structural regulatory lag, establishing new revenue opportunities through PIM, the new pilot process and the ability to earn on O&M-based as well as capital-based projects through the new EPRM mechanism, providing safeguards against extreme results. \u2047 From an ESG standpoint, we view the PBR framework as providing a greater connection between our achievement of environmental and social goals and our financial performance. \u2047 As Greg will discuss further, 2021 is a transition year for the utility. \u2047 Our 2021 guidance and implied ROE reflect moderated assumptions for earnings and ROE with the initial implementation of PBR midyear this year. \u2047 Moving into 2022, we see strengthening financial opportunities for our company. \u2047 Among the key drivers of this 2021 transition are, first, most PBR elements, including the annual revenue adjustment, become effective June 1. \u2047 So we will see the full effect of PBR for the first time in 2022. \u2047 For example, the RAM lag we had will remain in 2021, but will be eliminated in 2022 and going forward. \u2047 Second, while we anticipate modest renewable energy additions in 2021, we expect that to pick up in 2022 and 2023 with more Stage 1 and Stage 2 RFP projects, which if completed as planned, will contribute to rewards under the new RPS-A PIM. \u2047 Third, with accelerated delivery of our management audit savings commitment to customers in 2021, we are adjusting to a higher level of cost containment this year than originally planned. \u2047 Finally, with our 2020 rate case settlement, a portion of 2019 and 2020 capital investment is not yet covered in rates and we will be working to address that. \u2047 We see increased opportunities for the company in 2022 and beyond as we work through these transition items and gain experience with the new PBR mechanism. \u2047 Turning to the bank, American performed very well in a challenging banking environment. \u2047 While its earnings were impacted by low interest rates and higher provision in light of COVID-driven economic uncertainty, the bank delivered solid profitability. \u2047 American had record mortgage production, gaining market share and new customer relationships. \u2047 The bank also worked to control costs to offset increased expenses related to COVID, while still investing in core priorities. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, the bank is focused on delivering for its customers, including through deferrals, fee waivers and PPP funding. \u2047 American is now working on round two of PPP with new technology in place to streamline the process for both customers and the bank. \u2047 American worked hard for other stakeholders as well, enabling a successful program to deploy CARES Act funds to help both unemployed families and our restaurant industry during the pandemic and continuing to support its teammates with an excellent workplace culture. \u2047 As we look ahead, we expect low interest rates to continue to pressure margins for the bank, although a steepening of the curve could provide some tailwinds. \u2047 In low interest rate environments, cost management becomes all the more important and that will be a central focus for us. \u2047 At the same time, we will be investing in key areas to advance our anytime, anywhere, digital banking transformation. \u2047 We continue to manage credit conservatively. \u2047 While we are optimistic about the economy, there is still some near-term uncertainty, particularly in the first half of the year. \u2047 So we have maintained our strong provisioning to date. \u2047 That said, our loan portfolio remained strong with low net charge-offs and delinquencies. \u2047 The pandemic has altered customer behavior and expectations in profound ways. \u2047 We've seen a dramatic acceleration of customers migrating to our digital and self-service options. \u2047 Non-branch transactions such as online and ATM transactions have increased from 19% prior to COVID to 40% in December. \u2047 And we've been pleased to see very high levels of customer satisfaction with those options. \u2047 We want to continue our focus on making banking easy, be available to customers anytime, anywhere and encourage them to make American their primary bank. \u2047 We've rolled out new ATMs with increased capabilities, launched more online tools, including for mortgage applications in online deposit account opening. \u2047 With increased customer use of our digital channels, we've been able to consolidate eight branches and are introducing digital centers this spring. \u2047 These locations will leverage our digital capabilities, while still providing in-person interaction. \u2047 This refocusing of our branch network will provide savings over time. \u2047 As we enhance our digital offerings, deepening our relationships with our customers remains a cornerstone of our strategy. \u2047 We will also soon be launching additional online financial wellness tools for customers, empowering them with greater financial knowledge and providing increasing avenues engaged with and offer services to them. \u2047 And now, Greg will provide an update on the economy, our financial results and our outlook. \u2047 While 2020 was a challenging year for the Hawaii economy, there are signs of progress and our economy is on a path to recovery. \u2047 Daily visitor arrivals are currently around 8,000 and still well below the roughly 30,000 per day on average in 2019. \u2047 It represents a significant improvement from the 2,000 to 3,000 we were seeing before Hawaii's reopening to tourism in October. \u2047 Our state's pre-travel testing program has succeeded in keeping coronavirus cases low. \u2047 Hawaii's positivity rate is just 1% compared to the national average of 9.1%. \u2047 Arrivals are expected to continue improving with the nationwide roll-out of the vaccine. \u2047 Unemployment has also improved significantly to 9.3% in December of 2020, down markedly from 24% at the nadir of the pandemic. \u2047 Hawaii's housing market has remained resilient with single family home sales up 2.3% in 2020 and Oahu median prices for the full year 2020 rising 5.2% to $830,000. \u2047 Year-over-year sales volume and median prices remained strong in January at 14.7% and 9.8% respectively. \u2047 While GDP is expected to have declined by 10.2% in 2020, it is expected to return to growth beginning in '21 at 0.1% and strengthening to 5.2% in 2022. \u2047 Turning to our financial results. \u2047 In 2020, we achieved solid consolidated financial performance and advanced our longer-term priorities, despite the difficult economy. \u2047 Full-year 2020 earnings were $197.8 million or $1.81 per share compared to $217.9 million or $1.99 per share in 2019. \u2047 Utility earnings grew about 8% to $169.3 million and reflected efficiency improvements helping drive O&M lower. \u2047 ASB's full-year earnings were down $31 million or 35% versus a strong 2019 as financial results were impacted by both net interest margin compression and higher provision expense related to the economic shutdown. \u2047 However, the low interest rate environment helped drive record mortgage originations and sales and strong deposit growth, good expense control enabled management to offset costs related to COVID-19 while still investing in our priorities. \u2047 The holding company and other segment loss was higher than 2019, primarily due to higher charitable contribution expenses to support our community during COVID. \u2047 Our consolidated ROE for the last 12 months was 8.6%, down from 9.8% in 2019. \u2047 Utility ROE for the last 12 months improved 30 basis points despite the settled rate case that resulted in certain capital expenditures not being included in base rates and contributing to a 90 basis points drag unrealized ROE in 2020. \u2047 Bank ROE was down significantly due to the impacts from the mid-pandemic. \u2047 The utility had a solid year, delivering 8% net income growth during the pandemic as Hawaiian Electric executed on its commitment to reduce costs and deliver customer savings from opportunities identified in the PUC's management audit, while also adjusting to a no base rate increase from a 2020 Hawaiian Electric rate case settlement, which also resulted in no incremental rate recovery for certain above baseline capital investments in 2019"], "gold_summary": ["quarterly dividend increase to $0.34 per share."], "pred_summary": ["qtrly earnings per share $1.81."]}
