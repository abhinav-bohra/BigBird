{"article": ["We encourage you to review all of these materials. \u2047 Today, you will hear from our president and chief executive officer, Tom McInerney; followed by Dan Sheehan, our chief financial officer and chief investment officer. \u2047 Following our prepared comments, we will open up the call for a question-and-answer period. \u2047 Our actual results may differ materially from such statements. \u2047 Also, references to statuary results are estimates due to the timing of the filing of the statutory statements. \u2047 We reported a very strong operating performance in the second quarter, continuing the reasonable momentum across our businesses while making progress on our strategic plan to create long-term value. \u2047 mortgage insurance business, now known as Enact, as well as in our long-term care insurance business. \u2047 Enact reported very strong results with adjusted operating income of 135 million compared with 126 million in the prior quarter and an adjusted operating loss of 3 million in the prior-year period. \u2047 Relative to the prior quarter, Enact reported higher new insurance written, lower earned premiums and a 32% decrease in new delinquencies. \u2047 Results reflected a loss ratio of 12%, which compares favorably to the prior quarter due to lower losses from new delinquencies and higher reserve strengthening in the prior quarter. \u2047 U.S. life insurance reported adjusted operating income of 71 million for the quarter compared with 62 million in the prior quarter and an adjusted operating loss of 5 million in the prior year. \u2047 Results were primarily driven by LTC insurance, which reported adjusted operating income of 98 million, reflecting higher earnings from in-force rate actions, including benefit reductions related to a legal settlement and higher net investment income versus both the prior quarter and the prior year. \u2047 We successfully managed capital levels during the second quarter, ending the quarter with a very strong PMIERs ratio of 165% in Enact or nearly 2 billion above published requirements and risk-based capital in our principal life insurance company, GLIC, of approximately 270%. \u2047 Genworth also ended the second quarter with a very strong cash position of 842 million in cash and liquid assets at the holding company level. \u2047 Our strong performance over the past several quarters provide a solid foundation for us to write the next Genworth's chapter. \u2047 As our long-term shareholders know, Genworth's financial stability and flexibility have significantly improved over the past several years. \u2047 We are now on a more stable trajectory as a result of continued strong operating performance particularly at Enact. \u2047 Strategic actions we've taken to reduce debt and excellent progress to further reduce risk associated with our legacy LTC insurance blocks. \u2047 We have adequate liquidity to meet our financial obligations, valuable expertise and capabilities and a focused strategy to drive long-term shareholder value creation. \u2047 Moving forward, our primary strategic focus in the near term is to continue to reduce holding company debt. \u2047 In July, we fully retired our remaining 2021 maturities, reducing parent holding company debt by an additional 513 million to approximately 2 billion, including our previously disclosed liability to AXA of approximately 345 million. \u2047 Our goal is to reduce holding company debt to a sustainable level of approximately 1 billion, creating more financial flexibility for Genworth to return capital to shareholders and make prudent investments in future growth. \u2047 Since 2013, we have reduced wholly company debt by a total of approximately 2.2 billion. \u2047 Related to the obligation to AXA, I mentioned last quarter that AXA has initiated a lawsuit in the U.K. against an insurer seeking to recover payouts it made to policyholders for missed payment protection insurance, a significant portion of which Genworth agreed to reimburse as part of the 2020 settlement. \u2047 AXA's lawsuit against an insurer is an ongoing matter. \u2047 And as with typical litigation, we expect the process to pull out over the next 18 to 24 months. \u2047 As I've said before, Genworth is entitled to certain recoveries AXA may receive from Sendentera. \u2047 While any recoveries will be very positive for Genworth, our plans are not reliant upon those potential reimbursements. \u2047 Beyond that, we can't comment further on this litigation. \u2047 To further accelerate our efforts to reduce debt, and improve it, Enact and Genworth credit ratings, we remain focused on partially monetizing our ownership of Enact through a minority IPO of up to 19.9%. \u2047 As we have considered various options for Enact over the past several years, our objective has been to protect and ultimately unlock its value, enabling us to maximize value for Genworth's shareholders in any potential transaction. \u2047 The board and I continue to believe that a future IPO of Enact is the best option to do just that. \u2047 We maintain our positive long-term outlook for the MI sector based on the strong positive trends in the U.S. housing market and expected tailwinds as the economy continues to recover from COVID-19. \u2047 We continue to monitor the market and will remain prepared to recommence the IPO process, subject to various conditions and approvals when market conditions improve. \u2047 However, as a reminder, we are currently in registration with the SEC. \u2047 And as a result of applicable publicity restrictions, I won't provide any additional details about or discuss the timing of the potential offering. \u2047 We will be very limited in our comments about Enact other than reviewing its quarterly results. \u2047 We expect our majority ownership stake in Enact to generate a significant dividend stream in the future as we work to move our legacy LTC books to breakeven and build a profitable new LTC company. \u2047 We have received approval from the North Carolina Department of Insurance to dividend 200 million of capital from GMICO to Enact Holdings in the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 Subject to market conditions, business performance, other regulatory approvals and compliance with applicable GSE requirements. \u2047 This increases our confidence in Enact, issuing a 200 million dividend in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Following the planned IPO, we intend to maintain our ownership of Enact for the foreseeable future, while preserving the option to distribute the remainder to Genworth's shareholders and a tax-free spin-off with that as an attractive option in the future. \u2047 Next, we are working toward stabilizing our legacy LTC portfolio through our multiyear rate action plan or MYRAP, which will enable us to focus on our long-term LTC growth strategy. \u2047 we have made exceptional progress on this effort with over 15.5 billion in net present value from LTC premium increases and benefit reductions achieved since 2012, including an incremental 49 million in rate actions approved during the second quarter. \u2047 These rate actions provided more options for policyholders, including reduced benefit and stable premium options, which continue to be selected at a higher frequency by our policies. \u2047 We are working to develop even more benefit options for our policyholders to choose from when faced with the rate actions. \u2047 As of June 30, 2021, approximately 59% of Genworth's LTC policyholders have accepted all premium increases in full, 27% have taken a reduced benefit option and 14% have opted for a non-forfeiture option. \u2047 Reducing our legacy LTC liabilities through the MYRAP and other rate action initiatives is critical to achieving breakeven on an economic basis with the legacy LTC business over time. \u2047 Our current long-term cumulative improvement target on a net present value basis is roughly 22.5 billion in rate actions, which is the amount needed to address the current expected shortfall in our legacy LTC books of business. \u2047 Having achieved 15.5 billion against the current target of 22.5 billion means we are approximately two-thirds of the way toward achieving breakeven. \u2047 I would note that we will complete our annual LTC assumptions review later this year, and this target could change over time as our experience evolves. \u2047 Given that state regulators have and will continue to spread LTC premium increases over several years, returning our legacy LTC portfolio to breakeven on an economic basis is likely five to seven years or more away. \u2047 We are proud of our steady progress toward this goal and the MYRAP remains an important strategic initiative for Genworth since achieving breakeven will expand optionality and increase the potential long-term value of our overall company to shareholders. \u2047 With these key initiatives underway, we have begun to focus our growth strategy on the future of LTC insurance and we are advancing our plans through a new insurance company to create a leading profitable LTC insurance business in the U.S As I said before, there is a great need for long-term care solutions in the U.S. with 54 million Americans, aged 65 and older, at the end of 2019, and with that number expected to increase to 95 million by 2060, while at the same time, care costs are rising rapidly. \u2047 COVID-19 has heightened the focus on long-term care among legislators and the general public. \u2047 We believe it also has accelerated the long-term trend of seniors increasingly seeking to receive care in our homes as was evident throughout the pandemic, if not well before, enabling more must be done to protect and empower seniors, enabling them to remain in the setting of their choice and receive the services and support they need to maintain their dignity as they age. \u2047 Unfortunately, many older adults, especially those in the middle class, have limited options to pay for long-term care and the existing funding gap is simply is too large for either the public or private sectors to fill on their own. \u2047 That's why we believe partnership with the public and private sectors is critical. \u2047 We believe the government and private sectors can collaborate successfully to address the long-term care dilemma, and we are encouraged to see an acknowledgment of this necessary alliance and recently introduced legislation including the well-being insurance for seniors to be at home or WISH Act proposed by U.S. rep Tom Suozzi. \u2047 We are especially pleased to see that public education is a vital component of his legislation. \u2047 Focusing greater awareness of the likelihood of requiring long-term care during one's later years, the programs that make cover care needs and the options available to enhance care, we encourage families to have the necessary conversations with our loved ones and take appropriate steps to ensure that resources are available to fund their long-term care needs. \u2047 We expect these recent developments, we will reignite conversations about reforming the long-term tariff system in the U.S. And we are eager to participate and lend our unique expertise in this effort. \u2047 There are only a few players in the LTC insurance market today due to severe financial challenges arising from our legacy LTC business. \u2047 We know the key to success in the future is to learn from the past, to design new insurance products with lower and more predictable risks. \u2047 Through our extensive experience with LTC, we've also identified several opportunities adjacent to insurance, including products and services that help people navigate a complex and fragmented support system to find the best care. \u2047 We believe a successful reinvigoration of the U.S. LTC market will address both financing and services and ultimately will hopefully reduce the likelihood of people needing care and/or lessening the care that they need. \u2047 and are working hard on developing a new and improved go-to-market strategy. \u2047 As we've mentioned previously, we also see compelling long-term opportunities in China, but have decided to focus our efforts on launching a U.S. business in the near term. \u2047 Our plan is to launch this new business sometime in 2022 in partnership with highly rated third parties. \u2047 While Genworth's most significant contribution to any potential partnership would be our intellectual property and expertise, we may also invest a prudent level of capital. \u2047 We look forward to updating shareholders with more details in due course. \u2047 To sum up, we are laser focused on five key priorities. \u2047 One, reduce our holding company debt to approximately 1 billion. \u2047 Two, maximizing the value of an Enact. \u2047 Three, returning capital to shareholders. \u2047 Four, achieving economic breakeven and stabilizing the legacy LTC portfolio. \u2047 And finally, preparing to launch a new LTC joint venture in the U.S I believe the current market value of our shares does not reflect Genworth intrinsic value and that the key to driving significant shareholder value will be our execution on these five priorities in the near term. \u2047 After reaching our 1 billion debt target and realizing the resumption of dividends from Enact to the parent company, we expect to generate reliable and sustainable future cash flows that will enable Genworth to consider returning cash to shareholders through a regular dividend and through share repurchases. \u2047 We know this is an especially important step for our shareholders who've been extremely patient throughout the last several years of uncertainty. \u2047 We will also be in a strong position to continue to prudently invest and new LTC business opportunities where we are uniquely qualified and positioned to win. \u2047 We are extremely proud of the work we've done to put the company on this path. \u2047 Genworth has an engaged board and leadership team, a skilled and dedicated workforce and the unparalleled experience and expertise to create long-term value. \u2047 I'm pleased with the continued progress made during the quarter with strong earnings and capital ratios in our Enact U.S. mortgage insurance segment, strong results from our long-term care insurance business and increased liquidity at the holding company. \u2047 We ended the quarter with more than 842 million in holding company cash. \u2047 Subsequent to quarter end, we retired our remaining September 2021 debt of 513 million, which reduced parent company debt to approximately 2 billion, including the AXA liability. \u2047 We reported net income available to Genworth shareholders for the quarter of 240 million and adjusted operating income of 194 million. \u2047 Included in net income for the quarter was 46 million in non-operating items, mostly consisting of mark-to-market increases on limited partnerships in our investment portfolio. \u2047 Turning to the Enact segment. \u2047 The U.S. mortgage and housing market continues to demonstrate positive momentum characterized by a large origination market, increasing home prices and the continuation of decreasing new delinquencies from their pandemic-driven peak. \u2047 Despite the challenges of low housing inventory and rising home prices, affordability remains favorable, supported by prevailing low interest rates. \u2047 During the quarter, we estimate the originations market accelerated its transition to purchase originations, which is a positive trend for the private mortgage insurance industry as we experienced approximately four times higher penetration in purchase originations versus refinances. \u2047 For the second quarter, Enact reported adjusted operating income of 135 million and a loss ratio of 12% compared to adjusted operating income of 126 million and a loss ratio of 22% in the prior quarter. \u2047 The improvement in results was primarily driven by lower new delinquencies compared to the prior quarter. \u2047 In addition, insurance in force grew approximately 10% versus the prior year, primarily driven by over 100 billion in new insurance written over the last four quarters. \u2047 New insurance written in Enact was 26.7 billion in the quarter, up 7% versus the prior quarter, driven primarily by a larger purchase origination market and"], "gold_summary": ["planned ipo of enact remains a key strategic objective for genworth."],
