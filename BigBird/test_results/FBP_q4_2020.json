{"article": ["Joining you today from First Bancorp are Aurelio Aleman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Orlando Berges, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 We wish you all a healthy 2021. \u2047 Please let's move to Slide 4 to discuss the highlights of the year. \u2047 We're definitely very pleased with our results for the year. \u2047 I'm truly proud of what our team was able to accomplish, overcoming all the many challenges posed by the pandemic in the operating environment. \u2047 It really was a transformational year for our Company with the acquisition that closed on September 1, which has further expanded our market share, solidified our position in Puerto Rico. \u2047 We have now over 30% growth in our customer base, reaching 675,000 customers. \u2047 We're also very pleased with the technological advancements on the year and our data preparedness. \u2047 Our clients' adoption of digital channels continued to improve during 2020, reaching an increase of over 33% in logins and digital transaction increasing over 55% for the year. \u2047 It is a priority to continue investing in technology infrastructure projects on digital. \u2047 And so, we continue driving efficiency as we progressed in parallel with the integration. \u2047 We are definitely very focused on the integration and has been running on schedule and it's planned to be completed by the end of the summer. \u2047 On the economic side, the macro and geopolitical landscape in Puerto Rico seems -- continue to be improving. \u2047 Economic measures stemming from additional stimulus and disaster relief funding will definitely provide additional support to those impacted by the pandemic and the overall environment. \u2047 Lockdowns continue at a different layer, but when we look at December activity, it was actually fairly healthy considering the limitations in operating hours. \u2047 Most impacted sectors, as we know, continued to be hospitality and retail. \u2047 On the other hand, we are entering 2021 on very solid foot and a fortress balance sheet to support that economic recovery. \u2047 We have very strong liquidity, solid research coverage, and very strong capital to begin the year with. \u2047 For the year, we generated $102 million in net income, $0.46 per share, shy to the $167 million that we generated in 2019, definitely impacted by the economic effects on the pandemic and the increased provision driven by CECL and the acquisition. \u2047 Pre-tax preparation was strong, increasing 6% to $300 million, with actually only four months of our combined company. \u2047 And in spite of COVID, actually loan activity -- COVID -- loan activity -- which impacted loan activity. \u2047 We'll cover that later. \u2047 And obviously, in spite of the yield curve that the banks are operating, which definitely impact the topline revenue. \u2047 Loan origination and renewal for the year reached $4.4 billion, and organic core deposit growth, a record growth of $2 billion. \u2047 So, it was really a very positive core year for the Company. \u2047 Now let's move to Slide 6 to cover the highlights of the quarter. \u2047 This compares to $28 million in the past quarter. \u2047 It's important to highlight that this is the first full quarter of operation of the combined franchise. \u2047 PPNR came in very strong with $86 million, up from $77 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 And I think importantly, we are past the moratoriums, and we are very closely monitoring asset quality metrics. \u2047 Asset quality metrics remain stable. \u2047 And obviously, there is focus on those borrowers negatively impacted by the effects of the pandemic. \u2047 We really say it is early to predict final -- final inflows to NPA created by the pandemic, but when we look at initial metrics post-moratorium, delinquency metrics as of year-end still compared better when we look at December '19 pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 As I said, we continue to invest in technology to better share our customer. \u2047 During this quarter, we implemented a new online and mobile platform for credit cards. \u2047 We also continue the rollout of our new branch digital one[Phonetic] platform. \u2047 And then, when we look at capital, CET1 17.3%, definitely post acquisition impact still very strong and among the highest. \u2047 So please let's move to Slide 7. \u2047 I'd like to expand a bit on loans and loan activity and deposits. \u2047 As I say, loan origination activity was robust for the quarter, $1.4 billion. \u2047 This excludes credit card activity. \u2047 Primarily, growth was in the commercial and the auto portfolio. \u2047 I think we all know that commercial activity is seasonal, and yes we have a very solid quarter of deals that got delayed in the year. \u2047 We also have some volumes on the Main Street loan programs and PPP. \u2047 So, if we exclude Main Street and PPP, origination still increased by $278 million to $1.2 billion, so still strong. \u2047 The overall portfolio, now it's at $11.8 billion, declined slightly from prior quarter. \u2047 I will say primarily due to strategic reductions in residential. \u2047 We continue to originate primary conforming loans, which has helped the non-interest income. \u2047 And also we received repayments of about $49 million on the PPP loan forgiveness process. \u2047 For this quarter, we anticipate another approximately $100 million of repayment in PPP. \u2047 Obviously, it depends on the speed that SBA process, the forgiveness. \u2047 And we are now, obviously as you know, working in Round 2 of PPP, which was recently approved. \u2047 Our initial estimates are around $250 million in loans during the first half of 2021 on PPP loans. \u2047 We know that this could replace some of the normal commercial volume over the next months, as it happens in the first round of PPP. \u2047 But definitely, this is a great support to small businesses. \u2047 We expect loans -- this loans to be smaller, more granular and to be more focused on the smaller businesses. \u2047 On the deposit front, there is ample liquidity in the market. \u2047 We continue to see inflow of funds. \u2047 We continue to see deposit growth. \u2047 And we expect the year to continue on that trend. \u2047 So, we really focus on increasing loan generation. \u2047 We have excess liquidity that we need to deploy. \u2047 And when we look at the quarter, core deposits were up another $257 million. \u2047 The pipeline is growing. \u2047 Obviously, consumer and mortgage trends continue very solid and very consistent. \u2047 And as always, commercial is always model-driven. \u2047 So, we're working hard to build that pipeline. \u2047 Now let's please move to Slide 8. \u2047 I think it's important to highlight that the earnings power of our franchise now reach a new high with $86 million of PPNR on the combined operation, again being only the first quarter of this. \u2047 The enhanced funding profile of the combined institution will also contribute to mitigating some of the yield curve impact on the overall yield of the portfolios. \u2047 And obviously, now we have more customers to reach -- more customers to go after for loan generation. \u2047 Looking into 2021, obviously, there is going to be some noise still because of the integration. \u2047 The first half of the year is definitely focused on integration. \u2047 We want to finish that by summer. \u2047 So, there is some expenses that are there to be able to achieve the full benefit of integration. \u2047 So, they will be primarily focused in the first half of the year. \u2047 And then on the second half of the year, it's important to know that as we -- market recovers, everything reopens which is what we expect. \u2047 And as we grow revenue, there is also some variable expense tied to these revenues that could bring some increase. \u2047 We are targeting a long-term efficiency ratio of 55% following the completion of the integration. \u2047 I want to make comment that we really need to realize that -- recognize that it is challenging for banks to achieve mid-50s in the current yield curve environment. \u2047 So, we also expect hopefully some improvement in the curve at some point in time at the end of the year. \u2047 Let's move to Slide 6 to slightly touch on the capital and the balance sheet. \u2047 Again liquidity continued to build in the quarter. \u2047 So we have -- we continued to see excess cash, reserve coverage remain at the similar levels of prior quarter, so very strong reserve coverage at 3.3%. \u2047 And then, capital is again very strong with CET1 at above[Phonetic] 17%, after completing the acquisition. \u2047 As I said in the last call, capital deployment opportunities remain a priority and are the focus of management and Board. \u2047 Last night, we announced the approval to increase the dividend this quarter to $0.07 per share, definitely driven by current and predicted earnings. \u2047 And as I commented in the past earnings call, during this quarter, we're actively working on the data stress test, an updated capital plan to be presented to our Board in order to conclude on potential additional capital actions moving forward. \u2047 Aurelio mentioned we had a strong quarter, $50 million in the quarter, $0.23 a share, which compares with $28 million last quarter, $0.13 a share. \u2047 Again, keep in mind that the quarter does reflect the first full quarter effect of the acquired operations. \u2047 We only had one month of those results in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 The quarter included still some merger and restructuring costs of $12.3 million this quarter compared with $10.4 million last quarter. \u2047 And also keep in mind that last quarter, we had a Day 1 CECL allowance for the corporation[Phonetic] of almost $39 million and we recognized an $8 million reversal -- a partial reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which also reflected on the results. \u2047 Net interest income for the quarter, it's up $29 million. \u2047 A lot has to do with the $1.7 billion higher average loan balance we have in the quarter, which includes the Santander acquisition, obviously the full effect, but also new originations on the commercial and consumer loans for the quarter. \u2047 Those were partially offset by, as Aurelio made reference to also, the fact that we have continued to reduce the mortgage portfolio, which is down about $130 million[Phonetic] as compared to September 30, as well as the $49 million reduction in PPP loans. \u2047 Some loans have been submitted for forgiveness, and they were paid off in the quarter. \u2047 The quarter also -- we recognized $1.1 million of interest income we collected on non-accrual loans, mostly charge-off non-accrual loans that were recovered. \u2047 And the repayment of the PPP loans resulted in the acceleration of $700,000 of commissions on those loans. \u2047 On the quarter, we also had a reduction of over[Phonetic] $800,000 in interest expense. \u2047 This is even though the overall interest bearing liabilities went up $2 billion from the full quarter effect of the transaction and continued increase on deposits. \u2047 So that is significant. \u2047 We saw an 18 basis points reduction on the funding cost during the quarter as compared to last quarter. \u2047 Non-interest income for the quarter is $30 million. \u2047 It is up $5 million. \u2047 If we consider that last quarter had $5 million of gains on loss -- the gain on sales of securities, we didn't have much this quarter. \u2047 So excluding that -- those $5 million, non-interest income went up again $5 million. \u2047 $2.5 million was service charges on deposits, full quarter of Santander acquisition plus increases that we are starting to see on volume of transactions. \u2047 The second and third quarter expenses were lower. \u2047 The variable component of the expenses were lower in transaction related fees -- transaction related volume, therefore fees were also down. \u2047 We continue to see strong originations, lot of refinancings. \u2047 Significant part of it, it's a conforming paper that we end up selling. \u2047 So we had $500,000 increases in those gains on sales of some of those mortgage loans. \u2047 Also during in the quarter, we recognized $1.4 million on fees on Main Street loans we originated during the quarter. \u2047 $184 million of loans were originated under the Main Street Lending Program. \u2047 And we sold the 95% participation through the government as tabulated in the program. \u2047 Expenses for the quarter were $134 million, almost $135 million, which is up from $107 million; again full quarter effect. \u2047 Those expenses again include the $12 million in merger and restructuring costs for the quarter. \u2047 So far from the start of the process, we have incurred approximately $36 million in merger and restructuring costs. \u2047 It's part of the transaction. \u2047 And we expect that there will be an additional somewhere between $26 million and $30 million happening mostly on the first half of 2021, as we complete integrations, conversions and a number of other things that are ongoing in the integration process. \u2047 Pandemic expenses, again, cleaning cost, additional security and things like that was -- were $1.1 million, basically similar to the $1 million we had in the third quarter. \u2047 If we exclude all these items, expenses went up $25 million, mostly again from having the full quarter of the acquired operations, but also the higher transaction volumes on debit, credit card and some other components increase cost, plus some additional items and some $900,000 in incentive compensation increases. \u2047 We had $2.3 million in technology fees. \u2047 The increased amortization of the intangibles associated with the transaction was about $1.5 million higher for the quarter. \u2047 On the other hand, if we look at credit-related expenses that were slightly down were $1.8 million compared to $2.2 million last quarter. \u2047 There is one item that has been affected by -- obviously by the moratorium programs and the delays on foreclosures and some other legal processes in the market. \u2047 Over the next couple of quarters, we expect some increases in these categories as foreclosures and other legal processes come back to normal levels. \u2047 Allowance for credit losses at December was $401 million, slightly down from about $402.6 million we had at September. \u2047 However, the allowance for credit losses on loans was $385 million, $386 million almost, which is $1.2 million higher than September. \u2047 The ratio of the loans allowance was 3.28% as compared to 3.25% in September. \u2047 The provision for the quarter, as you saw on the release, was $7.7 million, which compares to almost $47 million in the quarter. \u2047 But again, third quarter included the $38.9 million provision, Day 1 provision we put in to comply with CECL requirements for non-PCD loans on the acquired operations. \u2047 For this quarter, the projected macroeconomic scenarios used for calculations of"], "gold_summary": ["compname announces increase in quarterly cash dividend to $0.07 per share."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share $0.46.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $0.46."]}
