{"article": ["These risks include those set forth in the Risk Factor section of Hess's annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. \u2047 Also, on today's conference call we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 A reconciliation of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the supplemental information provided on our website. \u2047 We hope you and your families are all well. \u2047 Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. \u2047 Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations. \u2047 And John Rielly will then review our financial performance. \u2047 Let's begin with our strategy, which has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth. \u2047 By investing only in high return low cost opportunities, we've built a differentiated portfolio that is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets. \u2047 With Guyana as our growth engine and The Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as our cash engines. \u2047 Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low cost oil development come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 a barrel by the middle of the decade. \u2047 As our portfolio generates increase in free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. \u2047 Even as we have seen oil prices recover since the beginning of this year, our priorities continue to be to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and preserve the long term value of our assets. \u2047 In terms to preserving cash, at the end of March, we had [Technical Issues] billion cash on the balance sheet, a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which is undrawn and was recently extend by one year to 2024 and no debt maturities until 2023. \u2047 We've mainted a disciplined capital on exploatory budget for 2021 of $1.9 billon. \u2047 More than 80% of this year's capital spend is allocated to Guyana, where our three sanctioned oil developments have breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. \u2047 And to The Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI. \u2047 To manage downside risk, in 2021 we have hedged a 120,000 barrels of oil per day with $55 per barrel WTI put options and 30,000 barrels of oil per day with $60 per barrel Brent put options. \u2047 To further optimize our portfolio and strengthen our cash and liquidity position, we recenly announced two asset sales. \u2047 In March, we entered into an agreement to sell our oil and gas interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million effective January 1, 2021. \u2047 This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. \u2047 On April 8, we announced the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in The Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million effective March 1, 2021. \u2047 This acreage is located in the Southern most portion of Hess' Bakken position. \u2047 And [technical issues] is connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure. \u2047 The sale of this acreage, most of which we are not planning to drill before 2026, brings material value forward. \u2047 This transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks. \u2047 During the quarter, we also received $70 million in net proceeds from the public offering of a small portion of our Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP. \u2047 The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio. \u2047 In February, as WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig, which will allow us to sustain production and strong cash flow generation from our largest operated asset. \u2047 In terms of preserving the long term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry leading financial returns remains a top priority. \u2047 On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest, and ExxonMobil is the operator, we've made 18 significant discoveries to date, with gross discovered recoverable resources of approximately nine billion barrels of oil equvialent. \u2047 And we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. \u2047 We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block. \u2047 Yesterday, we announced the discovery of the Uaru-2 Well with encouraging results that further define the large aerial extent of this accumulation, underpinning a potential future oil development. \u2047 In addition, drilling activites are under way, for appraisal at the Longtail-3 Well and for exploration at the Koeb-1 prospect. \u2047 Production from phase 1 ran at its full capacity at 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day during the first quarter. \u2047 In mid April, production was curtailed for several days after a minor leak was detected in a flash gas compressor discharge silencer. \u2047 Production has since ramped back up and is expected to remain in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 gross barrels of oil per day until repairs to the discharge silencer are completed in approximately three months. \u2047 Following this repair, production is expected to return to or above Liza Destiny's nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. \u2047 The Liza Phase-II development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. \u2047 Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block, at the Payara field, is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. \u2047 And we're nearing work for Yellowtail, a fourth development on the Stabroek Block is under way with anticipated start-up in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. \u2047 We continue to see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs, on the block by 2027 and longer term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. \u2047 As we execute our company's strategy. \u2047 We will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and are proud to be an industry leader in this area. \u2047 We support the aim of the Paris agreement and also a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. \u2047 As part of our sustainability commitment, our Board and our senior leadership have set aggressive targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. \u2047 In 2020 we significantly surpassed our five-year emission reduction targets, reducing the operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 40% and flaring intensity by approximately 60% compared to 2014 levels. \u2047 We recently announced our new five-year emission reduction targets for 2025 which are to reduce operated Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 levels. \u2047 In addition, we are investing in technological and scientific advances designed to reduce, capture and store carbon emissions, including groundbreaking work being conducted by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems, that according to the Salk Institute are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. \u2047 In summary, our company is executing our strategy that will deliver increasing financial returns, visible and low risk production growth, and accelerating cash flow growth well into this decade. \u2047 As we generate increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction. \u2047 And then the return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. \u2047 Overall, in the first quarter, we demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our portfolio. \u2047 Company wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance. \u2047 The Bakken experienced extreme weather conditions and higher NGL prices during the quarter, both of which led to lower volumes. \u2047 However, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher net income and cash flows. \u2047 Bakken net production in the first quarter averaged 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. \u2047 Of this shortfall, approximately 8,000 barrels per day was due to the significant increase in NGL prices in the quarter. \u2047 Much of our third-party gas processing from our operated production is done under percent of proceeds or POP contracts where we charge a fixed fee for processing wet gas but take NGL barrels as payment instead of cash. \u2047 POP volumes from these contracts get reported as Hess net production. \u2047 When NGL prices increase, as they did in the first quarter, it takes fewer barrels to cover our gas processing fees, hence, our reported NGL production was reduced. \u2047 But again, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher earnings and cash flow. \u2047 The other fact that effected Bakken production in the quarter was related to winter storm Yuri, which brought power outages and average wind chill temperatures of minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit for two weeks in February. \u2047 These extreme temperatures were below safe operating conditions for our crews and led to higher non-productive time on our drilling rigs, significantly higher workover backlogs and lower non-operated production. \u2047 As discussed in our January earnings call, we added a second rig in the Bakken in February. \u2047 In the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought four new wells online. \u2047 In the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and bring approximately 10 new wells online. \u2047 And for the full year 2021, we expect to drill approximately 55 wells and to bring approximately 45 new wells online. \u2047 For the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. \u2047 And for the full year 2021, between 155,000 barrels and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. \u2047 This forecast reflects the residual weather impacts, higher NGL strip prices, the sale of our non-strategic Bakken acreage, and the planned turnaround at the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter. \u2047 We expect net production to build in the second half of the year and forecast 2021 exit rate of between 170,000 barrels and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. \u2047 Moving to the offshore. \u2047 In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, first quarter net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operations following hurricane recovery in late 2020. \u2047 In the second quarter, we forecast that Gulf of Mexico net production will average approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. \u2047 For the full year 2021, we maintain our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime and natural field declines. \u2047 In the Gulf of Thailand, net production in the first quarter was 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as natural gas nominations continue to increase due to strong economic growth. \u2047 Second quarter and full year 2021 net production are forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. \u2047 Now turning to Guyana. \u2047 Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block are world-class in every respect and with Brent breakeven oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel represent some of the lowest project breakeven oil prices in the industry. \u2047 Production from Liza Phase-1 averaged 121,000 gross barrels of oil per day or 31,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess in the first quarter. \u2047 As John mentioned, production at the Liza Destiny was curtailed for several days following the detection of a minor gas leak in the flash gas compressors discharge silencer on April 11. \u2047 Production is currently averaging between 110,000 and 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day, and is expected to stay in that range while repairs are made to the silencer. \u2047 Upon reinstallation and restart of the flash gas compression system, expected in approximately three months, poduction is expected to return to or above nameplate -- nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. \u2047 For the second quarter, we now forecast net production to average between 20,000 barrels and 25,000 barrels of oil per day. \u2047 And our full-year 2021 net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day. \u2047 SBM Offshore has placed an order for an upgraded flash gas compressor system, which is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 Production optimization work is now planned in the fourth quarter, which will further increase the Liza Destiny progression capacity. \u2047 I think it's important to note that the overall performance of the subsurface in Liza-1 has been outstanding. \u2047 We have seen very strong reservoir and well performance that has met or exceeded our expectations. \u2047 Once the flash gas compressor is replaced, we are confident that we will see a significant improvement in uptime reliability. \u2047 At Liza Phase II, the project is progressing to plan with about 90% of the overall work completed and first oil remains on track for early 2022. \u2047 The Liza Unity FPSO with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day is preparing to sale from the Keppel yard in Singapore to Guyana mid year. \u2047 Our third development, Payara, is also progressing to plan with about 38% of the overall work completed. \u2047 The project will utilize the Liza Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. \u2047 The FPSO Hull is complete and topsides construction activities had commenced in Singapore. \u2047 First oil remains on track for 2024. \u2047 Front-end engineering and design work continues for the fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail. \u2047 The operator expects to submit a plan of development to the Government of Guyana in the second half of this year. \u2047 Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project is expected to achieve first oil in 2025. \u2047 The Stabroek Block exploration program for the remainder of the year, will focus on both Campanian Liza-type reservoirs and on the deeper Santonian reservoirs. \u2047 In addition, key appraisal activities will be targeted in the southeast portion of the Stabroek Block to inform future developments. \u2047 In terms of drilling activity, as announced yesterday, the Uaru-2 well successfully appraised the Uaru well discovery and also made an incremental discovery in deeper intervals[Phonetic]. \u2047 The well encountered approximately 120ft of high quality oil bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled 6.8 miles from the discovery well, implying a potentially large areal extent. \u2047 The Stena DrillMax is currently appraising the Longtail discovery and additional appraisal is planned at Mako and in the Turbot area, which will help define our fifth and sixth developments on the block. \u2047 The Stena Carron has commenced exploration drilling at the Koeb-1 well and an exploration"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly net production from bakken was 158,000 boepd compared with 190,000 boepd in
