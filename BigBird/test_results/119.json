{"article": ["And up front here, I'm going to be covering Pages four to six. \u2047 If you take a step back, what a difference a year makes. \u2047 We reported our second quarter 2020 numbers, we were in the throes of a pandemic with no clear end in sight. \u2047 Although COVID-19 cases in some geographies are rising again, we are in a much more stable environment and have much better visibility with respect to our operations than a year ago. \u2047 We remain focused on our employee safety as we continue to work in this environment. \u2047 We had a very strong operating quarter with revenues of $2.44 billion, operating income of $133 million and earnings per diluted share of $1.78. \u2047 We maintained strong operating income margins of 5.5% and had revenue growth of 21% overall with 18% organic revenue growth. \u2047 It is important to remember that in second quarter 2020, we had several of our key geographic markets either shut down or partially shut down. \u2047 This revenue growth resulted in a sizable investment in working capital this quarter, leading to a more typical cash flow pattern for us than the prior year, during which we were liquidating our balance sheet due to COVID-19-imposed lockdowns and customer site restrictions. \u2047 Regardless of the unusual factors impacting our comparison against last year, we had a very strong quarter. \u2047 Our business trends are strong. \u2047 This RPO growth was broad-based across market sectors and geographies. \u2047 For the quarter, we continue to see excellent operational execution in both our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments. \u2047 We had revenue growth in our Electrical Construction segment of 19.3% and in our Mechanical segment, up 21.3%, which I believe reflects more than just the resumption of normal demand from the COVID-impacted results of the second quarter last year. \u2047 With Mechanical Construction operating income margins of 8.3% and Electrical Construction operating income margins of 8.7%, we are executing with discipline and precision as we grow our business. \u2047 We had broad-based growth across our trade offerings end market sectors and across our geographic footprint. \u2047 We had especially strong growth within the commercial, and that's really across commercial but data centers and logistical infrastructure drove that and healthcare market sectors. \u2047 Our large project work and small quick term project work are both strong from a revenue and booking perspective. \u2047 We continue to work very hard to bid and schedule our work amid the uncertainty around material pricing and availability. \u2047 Our team is experienced with this issue. \u2047 And so far, we have weathered this challenge, but it requires attention to detail, communication with our supply chain partners and customers, thoughtful planning and careful contract negotiations. \u2047 The supply chain pressures are likely to be with us for most of the balance of the year. \u2047 Again, I sound redundant, but we are blessed with an execution-oriented culture across EMCOR. \u2047 Our Electrical and Mechanical Construction teams are some of the best operators in the business. \u2047 We leave the quarter with very strong RPO growth across these segments of almost 8% from the year ago period and nearly 10% for the end of 2020, and this is despite very strong revenue growth. \u2047 Our U.S. Building Services segment had a very strong quarter with revenue growth of 30.4% and operating income growth of 13.9%. \u2047 Operating income margins were strong at 4.9%. \u2047 RPOs additionally increased 37.8% versus the year ago period and organically, RPOs are up 21.2%. \u2047 We see accelerating demand for HVAC retrofit projects with a special emphasis on energy retrofit and IAQ or indoor air quality. \u2047 We are also performing very well in our commercial site-based business with strong bookings year-to-date and several important customer wins. \u2047 We are not only executing for our current customers, but are winning new work and have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities in this business. \u2047 We expect to continue to see strong demand for our mechanical services as well as our commercial site-based business services as customers seek to improve their facilities as they emerge from the pandemic. \u2047 Our Building Services team has done an exceptional job of anticipating our customers' needs post-pandemic, and we are a key partner in making these facilities more energy efficient and safer with improved air quality and movement. \u2047 In our Industrial Services segment, we had a near breakeven performance on an operating income basis despite taking a $4 million charge for a receivable from a customer who recently entered into bankruptcy protection. \u2047 We had positive EBITDA, and I believe we will start seeing better revenue comparisons as we move through the second half of 2021. \u2047 We do expect our forward view to improve as customer inquiries and scheduling are at very robust levels for late 2021 and early 2022. \u2047 Crack spreads remained strong, and utilization continues to improve. \u2047 Our U.K. Building Services segment had another strong quarter with operating income growth of 31.7%. \u2047 We continue to execute well for our customers in the U.K. and have strong retrofit project growth and also for our full facilities management offering. \u2047 Overall, a very strong quarter, and we remain poised to deliver for our customers and shareholders for the remainder of 2021. \u2047 With that, I will turn the discussion over to Mark. \u2047 Over the next several slides, I will supplement Tony's opening commentary on EMCOR's second quarter performance as well as provide a brief update on our year-to-date results through June 30. \u2047 So let's revisit and expand our review of EMCOR's second quarter performance. \u2047 Consolidated revenues of $2.44 billion are up $423.6 million or 21% over quarter two 2020. \u2047 Our second quarter results included $53.8 million of revenues attributable to businesses acquired, pertaining to the time that such businesses were not owned by EMCOR in last year's second quarter. \u2047 Acquisition revenues positively impacted both our United States Electrical Construction and United States Building Services segments. \u2047 Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, second quarter revenues increased to nearly $370 million or 18.4% when compared to the second quarter of 2020, which was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding containment and mitigation measures mandated by certain of our customers as well as numerous governmental authorities. \u2047 Despite the less-than-difficult compare between quarterly periods due to the challenging environment in 2020, EMCOR's quarter two 2021 revenues represent an all-time quarterly revenue record for the company. \u2047 The specifics to each of our reportable segments are as follows: United States Electrical Construction segment revenues of $489.5 million increased $79.1 million or 19.3% from 2020 Second quarter. \u2047 Excluding acquisition revenues of $8.6 million, this segment's revenues increased 17.2% quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Significant increases in revenue contribution from projects within the commercial, institutional and healthcare market sectors, were the primary drivers of the period-over-period improvement. \u2047 We continue to see strength in the telecommunications submarket sector as we experience sustained customer demand for data center projects driving the growth in commercial market sector activity within this segment. \u2047 United States Mechanical Construction segment revenues of $958.7 million increased $168.2 million or 21.3% from quarter two last year. \u2047 Revenue growth was primarily attributable to an increase in commercial and healthcare market sector activities. \u2047 With respect to the commercial market sector, consistent with the growth experienced by our Electrical Construction segment, this segment also continues to see strong demand for data center project work, given growth in data storage and cloud computing across the country. \u2047 In addition, the continued build out of our customers' e-commerce supply chains has resulted in an increase in the number of fire protection project opportunities for this segment within various warehousing and distribution facilities. \u2047 With regard to the healthcare market sector, consistent with the trends we experienced during the first quarter of this year, we are engaged in a number of projects ranging for mechanical system retrofits to complete installations in both new and existing healthcare facilities. \u2047 Second quarter revenues for EMCOR's combined United States Construction business of $1.45 billion increased $247.3 million or 20.6%. \u2047 This revenue performance represents an all-time high for our combined construction segments. \u2047 Despite this record revenue performance, we increased remaining performance obligations, which Tony briefly covered, within each of these segments as a result of strong project bookings. \u2047 United States Building Services quarterly revenues of $624.4 million increased to $145.5 million or 30.4%. \u2047 Excluding acquisition revenues in this segment of $45.2 million, this segment's revenues increased almost 21% organically. \u2047 This performance also represents a time quarterly record for this segment's revenues. \u2047 Revenue gains within each of the divisions due to the resumption of maintenance and project activity as compared to 2020's COVID-impacted quarter augmented by incremental projects aimed at improving customers indoor air quality as well as increased building automation and controls activity were the primary drivers of this quarter's strong revenue performance. \u2047 EMCOR's Industrial Services segment revenues of $235.2 million decreased to $5.9 million or 2.5% as this segment has yet to return to pre-pandemic revenue levels due to prolonged adverse market conditions within the oil and gas and related industries. \u2047 Although still below the prior year, this 2.5% quarter-over-quarter revenue reduction is significantly less then the more abrupt quarterly revenue declines experienced in other quarters post quarter one of 2020. \u2047 As Tony previously indicated, we are beginning to see positive signs of demand returning as we look forward toward our turnaround planning for early 2022. \u2047 Let's hope that we do not see any additional macro economic headwinds impacting in this industry. \u2047 United Kingdom Building Services revenues of $129.9 million increased $36.7 million or 39.5% from last year's quarter. \u2047 Resumption of maintenance contract activity that began during quarter one of this year strengthened in quarter two as project work that was deferred in 2020 has recommenced. \u2047 Additionally, revenues of this segment benefited from $14.5 million of favorable exchange rate movement during the period. \u2047 Selling, general and administrative expenses of $242.9 million represent 10% of revenues and reflect an increase of $37.7 million from quarter two 2020. \u2047 Adjusting for incremental expenses attributable to companies acquired, inclusive of intangible asset amortization, EMCOR's organic SG&A increase was $33.4 million. \u2047 As a reminder, the prior year period benefited from substantial cost reductions resulting from actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 A significant percentage of such actions pertain to employment costs including furloughs, headcount reductions and temporary salary reductions. \u2047 Additionally, 2020 Second quarter included reduced levels of incentive compensation expense as a result of the downward recalibration of our internal forecasts driven by the uncertainty created by the pandemic. \u2047 In contrast, the results for the second quarter of 2021 include significant included a significant growth in revenues as well as profitability forecasts, which equips EMCORE's previous earnings performance records across numerous of our operating companies. \u2047 These factors have necessitated headcount additions to support such growth as well as increased levels of quarterly incentive compensation accruals. \u2047 Just so that there is no misunderstanding, at this time last year, we were either reversing the previous quarter's incentive accruals or accruing at significantly reduced rates. \u2047 While at this point in 2021, based on our performance for the first six months of the year and our projections for the remainder of the year, our incentive compensation levels are tracking more linear with our current year earnings expectations. \u2047 In addition to these increases in employment costs, our results for the second quarter of 2021 included a $4.1 million provision for credit losses due to the bankruptcy filing of a customer within our U.S. Industrial Services segment which negatively impacted our quarterly consolidated SG&A margin by 20 basis points. \u2047 Reported operating income for the quarter of $133.4 million compares to an operating loss of $122.6 million in 2020 Second quarter due to the $232.8 million noncash impairment charge recorded in the prior year. \u2047 Excluding 2020's impairment charge, operating income for the current period represents a $23.2 million or 21.1% improvement over last year's adjusted non-GAAP second quarter operating income of $110.1 million. \u2047 For the second quarter of 2021, operating margin represents 5.5% of revenues and is consistent with our adjusted non-GAAP operating margin in last year's quarter. \u2047 Consistent with our quarterly revenue performance, the operating income of each of our reportable segments, other than U.S. Industrial Services, has increased by double-digit percentages. \u2047 Specific quarterly operating performance by reporting segment is as follows: operating income of our U.S. Electrical Construction Services segment of $42.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2021, increased by $11.1 million from the comparable 2020 period. \u2047 Reported operating margin of 8.7% represents a 100 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter due to an improvement in gross profit margin given a more favorable revenue mix and continued strong project execution. \u2047 Second quarter operating income of our U.S. Mechanical Construction Services segment of $79.3 million increased $12.3 million from the comparable 2020 period. \u2047 Reported operating margin of 8.3% represents a slight reduction from last year's quarter. \u2047 Our over 20% increase in quarterly revenues was the major driver of our period-over-period operating income improvement, while the slight reduction in operating margin resulted from a modest decrease in gross profit due to the composition of work performed during each period. \u2047 Each of our Electrical and Mechanical Construction segments established new second quarter records in terms of operating income dollars. \u2047 Our total U.S. construction business is reporting $122 million of operating income and an 8.4% operating margin. \u2047 This performance has improved by $23.4 million and 20 basis points from last year's second quarter. \u2047 Operating income for U.S. Building Services is $30.3 million or 4.9% of revenues. \u2047 This represents a $3.7 million improvement quarter-over-quarter and like most of our other reporting segments represents a new second quarter record for operating income dollars. \u2047 Increased gross profit from the mechanical services and commercial site-based services divisions due to a strong resumption in demand as compared to 2020's challenging second quarter was the primary reason for the period-over-period increase in operating income. \u2047 The 70 basis point reduction in quarterly operating margin is due to revenue mix, which included a larger percentage of fixed-price capital projects that traditionally have a lower gross profit margin profile than the segment's call-out service work. \u2047 Our U.S. Industrial Services segment operating loss of approximately $200,000 represents a decrease of $3.5 million from last year's second"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share of $1.78.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $1.78.  \u2047  q2 revenue $2.44 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $2.25
