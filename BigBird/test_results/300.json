{"article": ["The second quarter was a busy and productive one for ARI, resulting in strong earnings and a continued well-covered dividend. \u2047 The company originated five first mortgage loans totaling $825 million, bringing year-to-date total originations to $1.4 billion. \u2047 More importantly, the commercial real estate transaction market remains robust, with Real Capital Analytics reporting 167% increase in second quarter volume versus last year. \u2047 For ARI, we continue to see a high volume of interesting opportunities as our pipeline continues to build. \u2047 The diversity of the transactions closed to-date once again demonstrates the depth and talent of our origination team and highlights the benefits Apollo's platform brings to ARI. \u2047 Notably, the transaction secured by the German portfolio of properties and the U.S. portfolio of parking facilities were, one, due to our team's ability to speak for the entire loans and to be thoughtful, flexible and efficient in underwriting and structuring. \u2047 Our European lending platform continues to fire on all cylinders, winning many transactions that would otherwise historically have gone to banks. \u2047 Year-to-date, approximately 70% of our transactions completed were loans secured by properties throughout Europe. \u2047 As our platform in Europe grows and continues to expand its market presence, we have established a reputation as a reliable, innovative capital provider. \u2047 Our ability to provide borrowers with a one-stop shop for large financings, as well as our responsiveness and creativity around structuring has allowed us to compete very effectively in Europe. \u2047 With respect to loan repayments, ARI continued to benefit from improving real estate fundamentals and the robust level of liquidity in the real estate capital markets. \u2047 three loans totaling approximately $260 million repaid during the quarter, including one hospitality loan and two subordinate residential for-sale loans, one of which was a large New York City project, and the other was for a condominium development in Los Angeles. \u2047 Subsequent to the quarter, an additional $287 million of loans repaid as repayment activity in general is becoming more consistent with pre-pandemic expectations. \u2047 Turning to the balance sheet. \u2047 ARI completed an eight year $500 million debut offering of senior secured notes priced at 4.5/8%. \u2047 There was significant investor interest in the transaction, which enabled ARI to both upsize the deal and tighten pricing. \u2047 Consistent with our prior commentary on corporate finance strategy, we felt it was prudent to continue to term out some of our financing, access additional non asset-specific leverage and increase our pool of unencumbered assets, which were north of $2 billion at quarter-end. \u2047 Credit quality generally remains stable, and we continue to make progress with our focused loans. \u2047 Demolition is moving forward at the property on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, which will be developed into an approximately 50 story, 600 unit multifamily tower. \u2047 Given the pace of development and the strength of the Brooklyn submarket, we reduced the original reserve against this asset by $20 million. \u2047 We also continue to see positive activity at our asset in the Miami Design District. \u2047 As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we signed a large lease with Restoration Hardware for a significant portion of the existing property. \u2047 With the positive momentum in the submarket, we believe the appropriate path toward maximum economic recovery will be through additional short term leases, while we focus on working through zoning and planning to read the property for redevelopment as expeditiously impossible. \u2047 Lastly, in Europe, the sales process on the asset underlying our Oxford Street loan is fully underway. \u2047 In the second round of bidding, there were multiple credible offers in excess of ARI's loan basis, and we anticipate the sale of the asset and a full repayment to ARI before the end of the year. \u2047 I also wanted to provide an update on 111 West 57th Street. \u2047 The property is moving toward completion despite construction delays. \u2047 We continue to see interest from potential buyers as evidenced by recent increases in foot traffic. \u2047 As I have previously stated, getting the project built to spec is the first order of business for ARI, and we are confident the building is on track to be completed. \u2047 Once built, the price level and pacing of sales will be the next area of focus. \u2047 But the increasing level of interest in this property, along with the recent activity in the broader New York ultra luxury market is encouraging. \u2047 As we disclosed in the 10-K filed yesterday, subsequent to quarter-end, there were some changes to the property's capital structure. \u2047 A vehicle managed by an affiliate of Apollo transferred their junior mezzanine position to ARI and in connection with this transfer, one of the properties' subordinate capital providers paid the affiliate a price representing the original principal balance and agreed to forgo the accrued interest on the loan. \u2047 In conjunction with this transaction, ARI and the subordinate capital provider have agreed to a waterfall sharing arrangement pursuant to which rather than the company receiving interest it would otherwise have been entitled to after July 1, 2021 on the junior mezzanine loan. \u2047 Proceeds received from the sale or refinance of the underlying collateral after repayment to priority lenders under the waterfall will be shared between ARI and the subordinate capital provider at an agreed upon allocation. \u2047 We will continue to provide updates on the project as construction completes and sales progress. \u2047 For the second quarter, we reported strong financial results, with distributable earnings prior to realized loss and impairments of $59 million or $0.41 per share. \u2047 GAAP net income available to common stockholders was $64 million or $0.42 per share. \u2047 As of June 30, our General CECL Reserve remained relatively unchanged quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 With respect to the specific CECL reserve, we reversed $20 million against our Fulton Street loan, as we continue to make progress in readying the site for a multifamily tower development, as well as improvements in the Brooklyn multifamily market. \u2047 We also foreclosed on a hotel asset in Washington, D.C. and recorded an additional $10 million loss, bringing our total loss against that asset to $20 million. \u2047 This is now reflected as a realized loss in our financial statements. \u2047 GAAP book value per share prior to depreciation and General CECL Reserve increased to $15.48 as compared to $15.35 at the end of the first quarter. \u2047 The loan portfolio at quarter end was $7.5 billion, a 16% increase since the end of 2020. \u2047 The portfolio had a weighted average unlevered yield of 5.5% and the remaining fully extended term of just under three years. \u2047 Approximately 89% of our floating rates U.S. loans have LIBOR floors that are in the money today, with a weighted average floor of 1.32%. \u2047 In addition to the five loans originated this quarter, we made $246 million of add-on funding for previously closed loans. \u2047 With respect to our borrowings, we are in compliance with all covenants and continue to maintain strong liquidity. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $227 million of total liquidity. \u2047 Our debt-to-equity ratio at quarter end increased to 2.3 times as our portfolio migrated toward first mortgages. \u2047 And lastly, as noted in our -- in the eight-K we filed last week, subsequent to quarter end, we exchanged our $169 million, 8% Series B preferred stock, a 7.1/4% Series B1 preferred stock in the same amount. \u2047 This reduces our cost by 75 basis points per annum, and the preferred stock continues to be held by a single institutional investor. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share of $0.42.  \u2047  q2
