{"article": ["Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released fourth quarter 2020 financial results. \u2047 These statements include, but aren't limited to financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters, and foreign currency fluctuations. \u2047 Finally, a quick reminder that when using the terms underlying and adjusted, Management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures, otherwise they are referring to GAAP results. \u2047 Before we discuss fourth quarter's results and our expectations for 2021 and beyond, I want to spend a minute reflecting on 2020. \u2047 Structural heart patients were severely impacted beginning in March, experiencing significant difficulties entering the system, which also had a profound impact on second quarter procedures and even though healthcare systems adapted to the challenge, the resurgence of COVID that began late in the year continues to impact structural heart patients, who need care. \u2047 Despite unprecedented challenges throughout the year, I'm proud of our team's steadfast dedication to our patient-focused strategy. \u2047 We continue to invest in developing solutions that extend lives, improve the quality of life and offer greater value for the healthcare system. \u2047 Along those lines, we celebrated some exciting milestones in 2020 that directly impacted patients. \u2047 In TAVR, despite headwinds, more than 100,000 patients benefited from treatment with SAPIEN valves worldwide. \u2047 In Surgical Structural Heart, we launched our KONECT aortic valved conduit and Inspiris became the leading aortic surgical valve worldwide. \u2047 We've seen early positive clinical evidence across the TMTT platform, physician feedback is encouraging and patient outcomes have been distinguished. \u2047 And in Critical Care, we met the increased demand for core pressure monitoring products due to the pandemic, and we're proud that we were able to help over 1 million patients globally with our monitoring technology. \u2047 To support our innovation and growth, we continued to invest in our people and our infrastructure. \u2047 During the year when job losses impacted many families across the globe, Edwards prioritized protecting our employees and we grew our team to 15,000 worldwide. \u2047 We continue to make strategic R&D investments that enabled us to fuel progress and despite this unique environment and extraordinary prior year growth, underlying sales grew 1% in 2020 to $4.4 billion, which is a reflection of the life-threatening needs of the patients that Edwards serves. \u2047 Looking into 2021, while we expect the pandemic to continue to impact the global healthcare system, we remain optimistic about the year ahead. \u2047 As we indicated at our investor conference, we expect full year sales between $4.9 billion and $5.3 billion representing mid-teens underlying growth on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Based on our year-to-date experience, we expect Q1 sales to be slightly down sequentially, although in line with the first quarter of last year, which was largely unaffected by COVID. \u2047 Our 2021 guidance continues to assume COVID will stress the global healthcare system, it leads through the winter months with procedures ramping later in the year. \u2047 This expectation assumes that vaccines are effective and widely administered by mid-year 2021 and hospitals continue to improve their ability to treat non-COVID patients, who need care for conditions such as aortic stenosis and even though we expect the COVID impact on sales at the start of the year, we are continuing to invest now in our innovations that have the tremendous opportunity to enhance patients' lives and bring significant value to the healthcare system. \u2047 We recognize the uncertain impact and timeframe for recovery from this unique global challenge, but we remain confident that our patient-focused strategy of continued investment positions us well and even stronger when the world emerges from the pandemic. \u2047 Now turning to our quarterly results, consistent with our guidance at our investor conference last month, fourth quarter sales of $1.2 billion were in line with the year ago period when Edwards' grew nearly 20% on an underlying basis, reflecting the strength, even during the ongoing pandemic. \u2047 Full-year 2020 global sales -- global TAVR sales of 2.9 billion increased 4% on an underlying basis over the prior year. \u2047 2020 growth reflected increased sales in every region lifted by greater awareness of the benefits of TAVR therapy and increased adoption of our leading technologies. \u2047 Based on the strength of the SAPIEN platform, we retained our strong leadership position while also maintaining our disciplined price strategy. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, global TAVR sales were $776 million, up slightly from the year ago period. \u2047 We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with our growth and globally, average selling prices were stable. \u2047 Although the rollout was somewhat impacted, SAPIEN 3 Ultra now represents more than two-thirds of our global TAVR sales and physician feedback on ease of use and improved paravalvular leak performance remains outstanding. \u2047 In the U.S., our Q4 TAVR sales were approximately level with the third quarter and declined in the mid-single digit range versus last year. \u2047 We estimate overall Q4 U.S. procedures declined at a comparable rate. \u2047 Recall that our U.S. TAVR sales in the year ago period increased nearly 40% driven by the strong PARTNER 3 evidence that led to a third quarter 2019 indication expansion and improved patient access under an updated TAVR NCD. \u2047 We expect these factors to resume lifting treatment rates, as the pandemic subsides. \u2047 Growth at smaller TAVR centers, which are providing local access to aortic stenosis patients was more than offset by declines in larger accounts, where referrals have been disrupted by the resurgence of COVID. \u2047 Outside the U.S., in the fourth quarter, we estimated total TAVR procedures grew in the high single digits on a year-over-year basis and Edwards growth was comparable. \u2047 Edwards' underlying TAVR growth in Europe versus the prior year was in the mid-single digit range. \u2047 Growth was driven by continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was more pronounced in countries that were more severely impacted by the first wave of COVID in 2020. \u2047 Outside of the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see very good TAVR adoption in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Sales growth in Japan, Australia, and Korea were strong, where therapy adoption is still low. \u2047 In Japan, we continue to anticipate providing SAPIEN 3 for low-risk patients prior to the end of this year. \u2047 In China, which was a minor contributor to Q4 sales, we remain focused on growing our dedicated clinical support team to assist leading hospitals, as they build their TAVR programs. \u2047 In addition to geographic expansion of our TAVR therapies, we remain focused on indication expansion. \u2047 We talked at our recent Investor Conference about our early TAVR trial, which is focused on the treatment of asymptomatic patients. \u2047 Enrollment is now two-thirds complete and we remain optimistic that the trial will be fully enrolled in 2021. \u2047 Separately, we continue to plan to initiate an important pivotal trial for moderate aortic stenosis to determine the optimal time to treat patients, who have this progressive disease. \u2047 We believe that some patients may benefit from earlier treatment, when they have moderate AS rather than risking irreversible damage as the disease progresses. \u2047 We're optimistic about the potential of this trial and we anticipate FDA approval to begin enrollment this year. \u2047 In November 2020, we are pleased that the American Heart Association announced the launch of an initiative, called Target Aortic Stenosis, a quality improvement program aimed to develop optimal standards of care. \u2047 The program features a learning collaborative comprised of experts and volunteers from pilot hospital locations around the nation. \u2047 AHA noticed that if left untreated, the condition worsens and patients with severe aortic stenosis have a survival rate as low as 50% at two years. \u2047 Aortic stenosis is also a risk factor for heart failure, a costly disease projected the cost the US Healthcare System $70 billion in 2030. \u2047 In summary, we continue to anticipate 2021 underlying TAVR sales growth in the 15% to 20% range, as we shared at our Investor Conference. \u2047 We expect continuing COVID related challenges early in 2021, turning to a more normalized growth environment in the second half of the year. \u2047 We remain confident in this large global opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, which implies a compounded annual growth rate in the low double-digit range. \u2047 Turning to Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies or TMTT, we've made meaningful progress moving from early stage development to clinical use across all of our platforms with over 3,000 patients treated to-date. \u2047 To transform treatment and unlock the significant long-term growth opportunity, we remain focused on three key value drivers, a portfolio of differentiated therapies, positive pivotal trial results to support approvals and adoption and favorable real-world clinical outcomes. \u2047 In Europe, PASCAL leaflet repair continues to deliver excellent results. \u2047 In Q4, we continued the introduction of PASCAL Ace for mitral and tricuspid patients and we're pleased with the early real world results and positive physician feedback regarding its differentiated features and narrower profile. \u2047 We plan to make both PASCAL Ace and PASCAL available on a single next generation platform called the PASCAL Precision System. \u2047 This new system is designed to elevate the user experience with enhanced maneuverability, navigation, and stability enabling improved procedural precision. \u2047 From a clinical perspective, in this challenging near-term environment, we are experiencing a negative impact to clinical trial enrollment. \u2047 However, our team and research partners are highly motivated to build on the differentiated data presented in 2020 and expand our body of clinical evidence in this exciting field. \u2047 We will look forward to presenting meaningful follow-up data across our portfolio at medical meetings later this year. \u2047 We progressed in the enrollment of our three CLASP pivotal studies. \u2047 We also received approval for use of the Edwards PASCAL Precision System in these pivotal studies. \u2047 The company is still expects U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. \u2047 We continue to enrolling SAPIEN M3 pivotal study and Circle designed to demonstrate strong safety and efficacy for transcatheter mitral replacement and we're on track to initiate our first clinical experience with our next generation EVOQUE Mitral Replacement System. \u2047 The EVOQUE tricuspid replacement study, TRISCEND continue to enroll in Q4 and we're on track to initiate the TRISCEND II randomized pivotal study based on FDA's Breakthrough pathway designation. \u2047 We look forward to bringing this important treatment option to more patients that are in significant need. \u2047 Turning to recent news, we commenced CMS for ensuring mitral valve disease patients have improved access to therapy options through the updated NCD. \u2047 This update, which includes coverage with Evidence Development achieves the balance of patient access with high quality outcomes. \u2047 Fourth quarter global sales were $13 million, representing sequential improvement versus Q3. \u2047 Full year 2020 sales were $42 million. \u2047 We expect continuing COVID related challenges early in 2021, but we anticipate a ramp up through the rest of the year. \u2047 We maintain our beliefs that the total TMTT sales will approximately double in 2021. \u2047 We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to reach $3 billion by 2025 with significant growth beyond. \u2047 We remain committed to transforming the treatment of these patients and believe our portfolio strategy positions us well for ultimate leadership. \u2047 In Surgical Structural Heart, full-year 2020 global sales of $762 million decreased 10% on an underlying basis over the prior year, in line of our guidance, with our guidance of 5% to 15% decline. \u2047 Fourth quarter sales of $204 million held steady with Q3 and declined 2% year-over-year on an underlying basis, which was below our previous expectation for positive growth. \u2047 Over the course of the quarter, hospitals experience an influx of COVID patients limiting surgical procedures. \u2047 Despite this impact, we are encouraged that the U.S. achieve positive growth in Q4, driven by adoption of our newest premium technologies. \u2047 We remain very encouraged by the steady global adoption of Edwards Premium RESILIA tissue valves, including the Inspiris aortic surgical valve and the recently launched KONECT aortic valved conduit. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, Inspiris valve utilization grew in all regions, and we continue to add new centers. \u2047 Sales in the U.S. are ramping for KONECT, the first preassembled ready to implant aortic tissue valve conduit for patients, who require replacement of the aortic valve, root, and the ascending aorta, which is a critical unmet patient need. \u2047 We continue to focus on comprehensive physician training and robust data collection for the HARPOON Beating Heart Mitral Valve Repair System. \u2047 We are seeing favorable patient outcomes with faster surgery and recovery times with this minimally invasive therapy. \u2047 The U.S. pivotal trial is now under way and the first patient was treated in December. \u2047 In summary, we expect full-year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for surgical structural heart driven by market adoption of our newest technologies. \u2047 After a challenging start, we expect improving year-over-year comparisons, as we progress through the year. \u2047 We are excited by our ability to provide innovative surgical treatment options for more patients and to extend our global leadership in premium Surgical Structural Heart technologies. \u2047 We believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structural Heart opportunity will grow mid single digits through 2026. \u2047 In Critical Care, full year 2020 global sales of $725 million decreased 3% on an underlying basis versus the prior year, in line with our guidance of flat to down 5%. \u2047 Fourth quarter Critical Care sales of $198 million decreased 2% on an underlying basis, driven by the decline in HemoSphere orders in the U.S., as hospitals limited their capital spending. \u2047 Sales of our TruWave disposable pressure monitoring devices used in the ICU were lifted by the increased COVID hospitalizations late in the fourth quarter in both the U.S. and Europe. \u2047 Demand for our products used in more intense surgeries remains strong, but were more than offset by the impact of delayed elective procedures. \u2047 In summary, we expect full-year 2021 underlying sales growth in the high single-digit range for critical care. \u2047 We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations, as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. \u2047 Now, I'll ask Scott to provide some more detail on the company's financial results. \u2047 Today, I'll provide a wrap-up of 2020 including detailed results from the fourth quarter as well as provide an update on guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2021. \u2047 Despite the wave of COVID that began during the fourth quarter, we are pleased that we were able to achieve our sales guidance
