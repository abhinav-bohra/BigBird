{"article": ["I will start by going through some of the highlights of the quarter, and Jack will go through the second quarter results and guidance for the third quarter. \u2047 I will then share some concluding thoughts before we start our Q&A session. \u2047 But before we proceed, Jack will now cover the safe harbor language. \u2047 These statements are based on management's current expectations or beliefs. \u2047 Halfway through 2021, I am increasingly optimistic about the strength of the global recovery. \u2047 As vaccine rollouts gain momentum and lockdown restrictions ease, we're seeing dramatic increases in hiring optimism. \u2047 The pace of the recovery is strong, with the hiring intent picking up much faster than after the previous economic downturn. \u2047 And although the recent infection increases are concerning, we do not believe they will materially impact the positive recovery trajectory. \u2047 I spent a considerable amount of time during the second quarter in Europe with our market leaders, teams and clients. \u2047 This included time with our French team at Viva Tech, one of the world's largest technology conferences in Paris, which I will talk about later as part of our innovation update. \u2047 And together with other global leaders, I also spent time with President Macron and his government at the Choose France event. \u2047 I believe that the future for France looks bright as the government continues on its path to make France more competitive, and our business is very well positioned to benefit as their economy grows. \u2047 It is clear from my discussions with clients that demand is coming back very strongly for our services across all of our brands. \u2047 This is evidenced in temporary and permanent placement activity as well as demand for workforce solutions. \u2047 Companies increasingly need our help in finding and reskilling talent to enable them to leverage the fast-improving economic recovery and accelerate the digital transformation to emerge stronger post-pandemic. \u2047 Turning to our financial results. \u2047 In the second quarter, revenue was $5.3 billion, up 31% year-over-year in constant currency. \u2047 We grew revenue significantly in our key markets, and this resulted in better-than-expected financial performance. \u2047 Our operating profit for the quarter was $170 million, Operating profit was up significantly as we anniversary the depth of the pandemic's financial impact. \u2047 Operating profit margin was 3.2%. \u2047 And after excluding special charges in the prior year, operating profit margin increased 260 basis points. \u2047 Earnings per diluted share was $2.02. \u2047 Our most recent talent shortage survey of 42,000 employers in 43 countries found that 69% of employers globally, a 15-year high, are reporting difficulties hiring skilled workers across many industries. \u2047 Although vaccinations are more widespread, workers are still dealing with issues created by the pandemic, such as healthcare and child care concerns. \u2047 Unemployment benefits and related programs are also having a lingering effect on worker supply. \u2047 We expect the pandemic-related talent shortages to ease over the coming quarters. \u2047 But over the medium- to- long-term, the impact of digitization and other structured labor market changes are here to stay. \u2047 This means hiring of skilled talent and supporting people to reskill and upskill for growth roles will be a driver of demand into the foreseeable future. \u2047 It is a workers market right now. \u2047 And as a result, we're also beginning to see employers respond to what workers want: wage increases in places, more flexibility, skills development and a clear commitment to ESG, especially clarity around an organization, social and climate impact. \u2047 Revenues in the second quarter came in at the high end of our constant currency guidance range. \u2047 Gross profit margin came in well above our guidance range. \u2047 Operating profit was $170 million, representing a significant increase from the prior year period, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic. \u2047 Operating profit margin was 3.2%, which was 80 basis points above the midpoint of our guidance. \u2047 Breaking our revenue trend down into a bit more detail, after adjusting for the positive impact of currency of about 10%, our constant currency revenue increased 31%. \u2047 As the impact of net dispositions and slightly more billing days was very minor, the organic days-adjusted revenue increase was also 31%. \u2047 Comparing to pre-pandemic revenues, our second quarter revenues were below 2019 levels by 4% on an organic days-adjusted constant currency basis, representing a 1.5% improvement from the first quarter trend on the same basis. \u2047 Turning to earnings per share bridge on Slide 4. \u2047 Earnings per share was $2.02, which significantly exceeded our guidance range. \u2047 Marking from our guidance midpoint, our results included improved operational performance of $0.55, slightly higher than expected foreign currency exchange rates, which had a positive impact of $0.03, and slightly better than expected effective tax rate that added $0.02, and favorable other expenses which added $0.02. \u2047 Looking at our gross profit margin in detail. \u2047 Our gross margin came in at 16.3%. \u2047 Staffing margin contributed 60 basis point increase, which included 20 basis points related to direct cost accrual adjustments in France, representing a 40 basis points underlying improvement in staffing margin. \u2047 Permanent recruitment contributed 50 basis point GP margin improvement as hiring activity was strong across our largest markets. \u2047 Our Experis Managed Services business in Europe contributed 10 basis point margin improvement. \u2047 These increases were partially offset by other business mix factors, primarily involving a lower mix of Right Management career transition business. \u2047 Next, let's review our gross profit by business line. \u2047 During the quarter, the Manpower brand comprised 64% of gross profit. \u2047 Our Experis Professional business comprised 21% and Talent Solutions comprised 15%. \u2047 During the quarter, our Manpower brand reported an organic constant currency gross profit year-over-year growth of 51%. \u2047 Our Manpower business experienced the biggest decline a year ago, and as a result, experienced the biggest increase this period in the recovery. \u2047 Compared to pre-pandemic levels, this represented a decrease of 4% from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 Gross profit in our Experis brand increased 23% year-over-year during the quarter on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 This represented a decrease of 1% from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 Talent Solutions includes our global market-leading RPO, MSP and Right Management offerings. \u2047 Organic gross profit increased 27% in constant currency year-over-year. \u2047 This represented an increase of 12% from the second quarter of 2019 on an organic constant currency basis. \u2047 Our RPO business posted double-digit GP growth during the quarter on significant growth and hiring activity. \u2047 Our MSP business, which has performed well for several quarters, continued to experience double-digit growth in gross profit in the quarter. \u2047 Our Right Management business continues to see a runoff in outplacement activity as the recovery strengthens and experienced a reduction in gross profit of about 9% year-over-year. \u2047 Our SG&A expense in the quarter was $690 million and represented a 10% increase on a reported basis from the prior year. \u2047 Excluding goodwill and other impairment charges in the prior year, SG&A was 17% higher on a constant currency basis. \u2047 This compares to an increase in gross profit of 40% in constant currency and reflects balanced investment, allowing for strong gross profit flow-through during the quarter. \u2047 Operational costs increased by $96 million and net dispositions represented $1 million reduction. \u2047 Currency changes reflected an increase of $42 million. \u2047 SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue represented 13.1% in the second quarter, representing ongoing improvement in our efficiency as revenue recovers. \u2047 The Americas segment comprised 20% of consolidated revenue. \u2047 Revenue in the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of 23% in constant currency. \u2047 OUP was $56 million. \u2047 Excluding impairment costs in the prior year, OUP increased 116% in constant currency and OUP margin increased 230 basis points to 5.4%. \u2047 The U.S. is the largest country in the Americas segment, comprising 60% of segment revenues. \u2047 Revenue in the U.S. was $629 million, representing 22% increase compared to the prior year. \u2047 Adjusting for franchise acquisition in days, this represented a 21% increase. \u2047 Excluding impairment charges in the prior year, OUP for our U.S. business increased 149% year-over-year to $38 million in the quarter. \u2047 OUP margin was 6%. \u2047 Within the U.S., the Manpower brand comprised 35% of gross profit during the quarter. \u2047 Revenue for the Manpower brand in the U.S. increased 36% during the quarter. \u2047 While the U.S. Manpower business continues to recover, we have noted softness in candidate supply during the second quarter and expect this to continue during the summer months. \u2047 The Experis brand in the U.S. comprised 32% of gross profit in the quarter. \u2047 Within Experis in the U.S., IT skills comprise approximately 80% of revenues. \u2047 Experis U.S. revenues grew 5% during the quarter. \u2047 We are encouraged by the current trends in our U.S. Experis business and anticipate continued improvement into the third quarter. \u2047 Talent Solutions in the U.S. contributed 33% of gross profit and experienced revenue growth of 14% in the quarter. \u2047 This was driven by RPO, which experienced dramatic revenue growth as hiring programs continued to strengthen. \u2047 MSP business continued to perform well and experienced double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. \u2047 In the third quarter, we expect ongoing underlying improvement in revenue growth for the U.S. in the range of 11% to 15% year-over-year. \u2047 Comparing estimated third quarter revenues to precrisis levels in constant currency, this represented a 2% decline compared to 2019 levels in the third quarter using the midpoint of our guidance. \u2047 Our Mexico operation experienced revenue growth of 6% in constant currency in the quarter. \u2047 On April 23, the Mexican government passed labor legislation that will prohibit certain types of temporary staffing not considered specialized services beginning on July 23. \u2047 As such, companies operating in Mexico will be prohibited from using temporary staffing for functions that are already deemed to be in-house core competencies of their workforce. \u2047 We have been working with our clients as the market absorbs this legislation and anticipate that we will have a reduction in revenues in our Mexico business beginning in the third quarter as clients navigate through the legislation and shift their workforce strategies accordingly. \u2047 Although this will result in revenue reductions over the next few quarters, we believe the mix shift toward more specialized staffing will improve the margin profile of our Mexican business. \u2047 We also believe there may be additional revenue opportunities over time as clients adjust their workforce strategies. \u2047 Although it is difficult to forecast based on how quickly the legislation is being enacted, we are currently estimating a revenue decrease for the Mexican business in the third quarter in the range of minus 28% to minus 32% in constant currency. \u2047 Mexico represented 2.8% of our 2020 revenues. \u2047 Revenue in Canada increased 22% in days-adjusted constant currency during the quarter. \u2047 Revenue in the other countries within Americas increased 40% in constant currency. \u2047 This was driven by significant constant currency revenue growth in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile. \u2047 Southern Europe revenue comprised 46% of consolidated revenue in the quarter. \u2047 Revenue in Southern Europe came in at $2.4 billion, growing 51% in constant currency. \u2047 This reflects ongoing improvement driven by France and Italy. \u2047 OUP equaled $115 million and OUP margin was 4.8%. \u2047 France revenue comprised 56% of the Southern Europe segment in the quarter and increased 67% in days-adjusted constant currency. \u2047 Compared to the same period in 2019, France revenues were down 12%. \u2047 Although restrictions had an impact on the rate of revenue improvement during the quarter, the French business continued to perform well in a challenging environment, and we expect ongoing improvement now that the majority of the restrictions have been lifted. \u2047 OUP was $66 million in the quarter and OUP margin was 4.9%. \u2047 As previously referenced, direct cost accrual adjustments, representing approximately $10 million, benefited France's results. \u2047 As we begin the third quarter, we are estimating a year-over-year constant currency increase in revenues for France in the range of 12% to 16%. \u2047 Comparing estimated third quarter revenues to precrisis levels in constant currency, this represents a 5% decline compared to 2019 levels in the third quarter using the midpoint of our guidance. \u2047 Revenue in Italy equaled $469 million in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 57% in days-adjusted constant currency. \u2047 Through the second quarter, revenues in Italy continued to exceed 2019 levels. \u2047 OUP equaled $32 million and OUP margin was 6.8%. \u2047 We estimate that Italy will continue to perform very well in the third quarter with year-over-year constant currency revenue growth in the range of 20% to 24%. \u2047 Revenue in Spain increased 12% in days-adjusted constant currency from the prior year, and revenue in Switzerland increased 33% in days-adjusted constant currency. \u2047 Our Northern Europe segment comprised 22% of consolidated revenue in the quarter. \u2047 Revenue increased 23% in constant currency to $1.2 billion, driven by all major markets. \u2047 OUP represented $18 million and OUP margin was 1.5%. \u2047 Our largest market in the Northern Europe segment is the U.K., which represented 37% of segment revenues in the quarter. \u2047 During the quarter, U.K. revenues grew 30% in days-adjusted constant currency, which included significant new business. \u2047 The U.K. continued to perform above 2019 levels in the second quarter. \u2047 We expect continued strong growth in the 34% to 38% constant currency range year-over-year in the third quarter. \u2047 In Germany, revenues increased 9% in days-adjusted constant currency in the second quarter. \u2047 Although Germany continues to be a difficult market for our industry, we expect to see ongoing revenue improvement in Germany in the third quarter. \u2047 In the Nordics, revenues grew 17% in days-adjusted constant currency. \u2047 Revenue in the Netherlands increased 9% in days-adjusted constant currency. \u2047 Belgium experienced days-adjusted revenue growth of 24% in constant currency during the quarter. \u2047 Revenue in other markets in Northern Europe grew 41% in constant currency in the quarter. \u2047 This was driven by strong revenue growth in Poland, Russia and Ireland. \u2047 The Asia Pacific Middle East segment comprises 12% of total company revenue. \u2047 In the quarter, revenue grew 6% in constant currency to $620 million. \u2047 OUP was $22 million and OUP margin was 3.6%. \u2047 Revenue in Japan
