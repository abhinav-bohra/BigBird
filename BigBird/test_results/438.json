{"article": ["So the first quarter results were very good, looking at it from both year-ago comparisons and then to go back to two years ago comparison, pre-COVID. \u2047 Revenues were up 39% and versus two years ago, they were up 9%, so the pre-COVID timeframe. \u2047 EBITDA grew 119% versus year ago this quarter -- this year and then up 62% versus two years ago, so both give us a strong start for fiscal 2022. \u2047 In fact, it gives us confidence to firm up our full year guidance and increase it modestly even after considering the impact of some of these micro -- macro headwinds that we're looking at right now such as labor, raw material increases and supply chain challenges. \u2047 So Craig and Eddie will take you through those details in the next few minutes, but here are four trends that we're seeing coming out of the first quarter. \u2047 The first one is the diversity of our geographic portfolio, it is a strong positive for us, so this quarter, Brazil and Asia had a very strong Q1. \u2047 North America came in right above what we forecasted, but they could have done better. \u2047 The labor shortages in the U.S. kept us from producing to demand, and we expect that that headwinds probably going to persist through quarter two. \u2047 And then in the second half of the year, we expect to see some improvement in that trend. \u2047 Then, I think you can expect North America to start contributing more to our growth. \u2047 The second trend coming out of the first quarter was REPREVE sales growth continues to build. \u2047 So you look at REPREVE sales versus year ago first quarter was up 39% and then from two years ago, pre-COVID, it was up 27%. \u2047 I think, customers right now are continuing to step up their commitment to recycled materials in apparel and footwear and auto and we've had numerous positive customer wins over the last quarter. \u2047 The third trend is productivity and the investment in EvoCooler technology and our operation will provide strong long-term productivity and we will begin seeing a little bit of that in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. \u2047 The production on the current small scale that we rolled out is meeting our expectations in terms of efficiency and output. \u2047 And the fourth trend is labor and labor in the U.S. is a challenge right now. \u2047 Our manufacturing and HR teams have been working on the obvious fixes such as labor rate and benefits to make sure that we remain competitive in the marketplace. \u2047 However, they have discussed -- they discovered several longer term solutions by conducting front line employee round tables in our plants. \u2047 We've asked our employees what can we do to make their jobs more fulfilling and to keep them with us for a longer time and they've come up with several very interesting improvements that are pragmatic and they're being implemented, everything from the quality of training and the amount of training to changing the way that the work gets done. \u2047 We sometimes forget, I think that the employees that are closest to the action can solve problems probably better than anyone else in the company. \u2047 So, we'll share more of this with you in the upcoming quarters. \u2047 So all-in-all, a good start to the fiscal year. \u2047 There is still a great deal of work to do, but we're optimistic about the outlook. \u2047 As Al mentioned, our first quarter fiscal 2022 results surpassed our initial expectations and the strong results reflect the flexibility of our global business model, our strong presence in each region and the hard work and dedication of each and every one of our employees who as we like to say at Unifi are working today for the good of tomorrow. \u2047 We continue to be grateful for the daily contributions our employees make to our company and to our customers. \u2047 Their commitment to Unifi has allowed us to continue operating a strong business, while navigating the recovery. \u2047 On Slide 3, we provide an overview of the quarter and as Al said, we are executing very well, driving growth and proving out how resilient our business model has become. \u2047 Q1 revenues were up 6% sequentially, slightly ahead of our expectations and up 39% on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Alongside our focus on meeting customers' expectations, the growing demand for our core products and product lines in each region contributed to the increased revenues, which of course naturally translated into significant year-over-year profit growth. \u2047 Despite Q1 exceeding our initial expectations, we had to navigate several cost headwinds and input constraints. \u2047 Hiccups in the supply chain from global logistics stoppages and domestic labor shortages placed even more pressure on each business segments. \u2047 Despite of these difficulties, our teams' quick actions ensured no meaningful disruptions to our lines of business. \u2047 I'll break down our execution as well as some of the challenges we faced during Q1 by region. \u2047 In Brazil, the volatility remains post the regional shutdowns that impacted our business in April and May period. \u2047 In fiscal Q1, the volatility in the market was driven by the rising freight costs from China, the uncertainty in the exchange rate and the rising cost of textured yarn and Asia, all of which has increased the local market price for textured yarn. \u2047 The situation has been compounded by inflation concerns, which are increasing at a pace not seen in several years. \u2047 Early indications are this may have some impact on demand. \u2047 However, this may actually result in customers consuming more locally produced yarns, which would help us gain market share. \u2047 This is something that will remain on our radar as we move through the rest of the fiscal year and we will keep you updated on this. \u2047 Despite all of this, as you can see we had another excellent quarter in Brazil. \u2047 In the U.S. and Central America during the quarter, we continue the process of catching up with raw material and other cost increases through proactive selling price adjustments. \u2047 We have additional work to do in this area as we can already see that polyester and nylon raw material prices are rising as a result of the recent increase in crude oil prices. \u2047 While this is a very painful process, it is something our customers are facing too and like us, they are having to pass on their input cost increases to their customers. \u2047 In the U.S. specifically, like many other businesses also faced labor challenges. \u2047 We see this as an opportunity to become a better employer and are allocating more resources into training and retention. \u2047 Fortunately, the elimination of the federal subsidy at the beginning of September has once again brought more people into the workforce, and we are taking advantage of that. \u2047 It should be noted that the impacts of COVID are still being felt primarily in our manufacturing plants, resulting in us having to quarantine a number of employees. \u2047 Unfortunately, we have also lost a few of our employees to the virus, and our thoughts go out to their families and friends. \u2047 Lastly, we have experienced a few delays in the supply -- extended the lead times of certain products, but nothing that is truly disruptive to business. \u2047 And in Asia, we experienced a very positive start to the quarter with continued sales increases in our REPREVE brand and other value-added products. \u2047 As you are aware, there are some concerns at the Chinese central government label around the energy consumption and air pollution levels and this placed some pressure on the business at the very end of the quarter. \u2047 We are seeing minor caution from customers and suppliers who are battling COVID lockdowns and energy cuts. \u2047 This situation remains volatile and introduces some uncertainty for the short term. \u2047 We do expect to overcome these challenges in the next few months as the demand is usually strong leading up to the Lunar New Year, which this year is at the very beginning of February. \u2047 Ascending back to the consolidated business. \u2047 It's great to see the progress we have made toward our fiscal 2022 and longer term goals in the face of these multiple headwinds. \u2047 We remain committed to maintaining a solid financial position and our current balance sheet provides a strong backbone for us to execute on growth-focused capital allocation priorities. \u2047 Beyond the financials, we continue to observe a growing number of customers shifting their commitments to making products using recycled material. \u2047 During the first quarter, we shipped more than 23 million hang tags to brand customers. \u2047 You will note that on Slide 4, products made with REPREVE fiber comprised 37% net sales, consolidated net sales increasing from 36% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. \u2047 This growth is regional and is primarily in our Asia, U.S. and Central American revenues. \u2047 Our REPREVE momentum into new textile sectors and multiple brand adoptions across Europe has been very strong. \u2047 Last month TenCate protective fabrics, a traditional workwear and industrial textiles company from the Netherlands began marketing, it's Tecapro line of workwear using inhibits taking -- REPREVE inhibit taking REPREVE further beyond traditional fashion textiles and into protective wear. \u2047 This is the first time our multi-functional REPREVE inhibit value-added combination is being used in flame retardant workwear to add in a sustainable twist to a highly durable products. \u2047 TenCate chose REPREVE inhibit for quality, reliability, reputation, traceability and transparency and we've been excited to help them tell the sustainable and flame retardant story through a variety of co-marketing mediums. \u2047 REPREVE's strength in the Turkish market continues, with a new line of denim by Mavi jeans. \u2047 Mavi jeans launched a nationwide TV commercial that showcases their adoption of recycled polyester in the new line of jeans. \u2047 Other recent adoptions by European brands include French brands Jules and the German brands Marc O'Polo, Duke and Street One owned by CBR Fashion Group. \u2047 One of Inditex' brands Massimo Dutti has continue to roll out products using REPREVE RO. \u2047 In the U.S., we continued to see strong co-marketing in the menswear segment. \u2047 Haggar has launched a new line of suit separates in a variety of fits under the name Smart Wash REPREVE suits. \u2047 And I know from talking to employees and having direct conversations with them, it's a proud moment when they walk into are Kohl's or JCPenneys or go online and see this iconic U.S. brand shout out their sustainability story, which is based on REPREVE. \u2047 Going outside of the apparel market, our placements in the global homes good sector continues, with a new launch of several CD mattresses in Canada that feature REPREVE. \u2047 Now turning to our operating segment performance during the first quarter. \u2047 I'll provide some high level comments before Craig walks you through more specific details. \u2047 Strength in our polyester and nylon segments persisted in the first quarter and benefited from strong sales momentum with robust customer demand. \u2047 Our commercial and manufacturing teams have done a tremendous job navigating the headwinds I mentioned previously and we remain optimistic about the sales mix and pricing dynamics going forward for this segment. \u2047 The Asia segment demonstrated another strong quarter and volumes increased due to pull through on new and existing customer programs. \u2047 Shutdowns and uncertainty in Vietnam and Southeast Asia have not impacted us perhaps as much as other companies since it's a smaller part of that business. \u2047 While we do anticipate some soft spots in China based on new temporary shutdown mandates related to managing energy level there, businesses are still running and the demand for sustainable yarns has never been higher. \u2047 I'm confident that the teams' continued focus on meeting the ever-increasing sustainability and value-added demands of their customers will help us weather these challenges. \u2047 As mentioned by the financial performance, the Brazilian team has continued to do an exceptional job. \u2047 During the first quarter, the strong price mix performance increased sales over 50% from the year ago quarter, driving more than 100% increase in gross profit dollars. \u2047 Looking forward, we continue to anticipate a degree of moderation in profit from this region with the full year gross margin settling just below 20%. \u2047 Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its final determinations that imports of polyester textured yarn from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are being unfairly sold below their fair value in the U.S. The financing dumping duty deposit rates range from 2% to 56% and are currently in effect. \u2047 The next step in these trade cases will be the U.S. International Trade Commission's final determination, which is scheduled for November 30th. \u2047 With that, I would call the -- call over to Craig. \u2047 The remainder of our financial statement metrics were generally consistent with our expectations as it relates to overall SG&A spending, our effective tax rate and the amount outlaid for capital expenditures and working capital associated with our investments in the business and our strong sales performance. \u2047 Consolidated net sales increased 38.5% from $141.5 million to $196 million, primarily due to business recovery we have seen over the last five quarters of sequential sales growth. \u2047 For the Polyester segment, the single-digit volume change was muted partially by the labor pool challenges Al and Eddie mentioned earlier. \u2047 The price and mix change demonstrates the selling price adjustments that have been made over the last several months in response to rising input costs although we have not fully normalized the portfolio for today's cost levels. \u2047 In Asia, the sales volume growth again demonstrates new and existing customer programs that continue to be successful on the REPREVE platform, while higher pricing associated with raw material costs was offset by a greater mix of lower priced products. \u2047 In Brazil, momentum surrounding higher pricing and market share continued to benefit revenues, as pricing was up over 50%, driving a significant change in quarterly revenues for that segment. \u2047 And nylon exhibited stability with much higher sales and production volumes to start off fiscal 2022. \u2047 Turning to Slide 6. \u2047 Polyester demonstrated significant gross profit and margin improvement, despite labor inefficiency challenges in the current environment and some pricing lags. \u2047 The gross margin increase of 260 basis points is very commendable under today's circumstances. \u2047 The Asia segment's volume growth led to a $2.4 million improvement in gross profit as that segment continues its strong year-over-year growth trajectory and remains a significant component of the global commercial model. \u2047 In Brazil, our agility against competition and commitment to deliver high value to the market allowed us to maintain strong pricing levels and market share, double gross profit and driving margin improvement of 910 basis points. \u2047 Lastly from a segment performance perspective on slide 7 and 8, we've included a two-year GAAP comparison for enhanced understanding of this just completed quarter's performance. \u2047 Slide 7 shows the consolidated sales increase of 8.9% from the same quarter two years prior lifted by a healthy combination of volume, pricing and mix across our segments. \u2047 Slide 8 provides a gross profit overview for the two-year comparison. \u2047 Shown here, the Polyester segment exhibited strength against the"], "gold_summary": ["q1 sales $196 million.  \u2047  sees q2 sales $185 million to $190
