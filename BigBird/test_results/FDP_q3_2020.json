this conference call on the Investor page of our website as well. \u2047 For additional information, we ask that you refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \u2047 Information regarding these non-GAAP measures as well as a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial information is available on our website. \u2047 With that let me turn things over to AAM's Chairman and CEO, David Dauch. \u2047 Joining me on the call today are Mike Simonte, AAM's President and Chris May, AAM's Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 To begin my comments today, I'll review the highlights of our first quarter 2021 results. \u2047 Next, I'll touch on some exciting recent business announcements with Ford and REE and lastly, we will discuss the challenges within the supply chain and our financial outlook. \u2047 After Chris covers the details of our financial results, we will then open up the call for any questions that you may have. \u2047 In the first quarter 2021, AAM delivered solid operating performance and strong cash flow generation. \u2047 Although the industry is facing continuity of supply issues, we continue to navigate through these challenges while delivering very strong results. \u2047 AAM sales for the first quarter 2021 were $1.43 billion, up approximately 6% compared to $1.34 billion in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 The increase in our revenues on a year-over-year basis primarily reflects the recovery from COVID-19 related industry shutdowns that we experienced last year. \u2047 Although North American industry production was down 4% according to the third party estimates, light truck production was up 5% year-over-year and volumes on our core platforms increased 9% year-over-year. \u2047 Furthermore, light truck inventory and a number of the key platforms that we support remained extremely low. \u2047 Consumer demand for light trucks remained strong and our customers are building them as much and as fast as possible. \u2047 We believe the demand environment for these products will continue for an extended period of time. \u2047 AAM's adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2021 was $262.9 million or 18.4% of sales. \u2047 This margin performance is a first quarter record for AAM. \u2047 This compares to $213.3 million last year or 15.9% of sales. \u2047 In addition to benefiting from higher production level, our intense focus on optimizing the business and flexing our cost structure to align with the global market demand contributed greatly to our performance in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 AAM's adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter 2021 was $0.57 per share compared to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter. \u2047 Our operating performance and commitment to reducing capital spending drove this high level of free cash flow. \u2047 Furthermore, we prepaid over $100 million of our term loan in the quarter. \u2047 As we have previously stated, we are committed to reducing our debt and strengthen our balance sheet throughout 2021. \u2047 On the business front, we are happy to announce that we are providing both air cooled and liquid cooled power transfer units, which are part of our EcoTrac product family, for the all-new Ford Bronco Sport. \u2047 This is a great new product offering from Ford that has been very well received in the marketplace. \u2047 And as for electrification, we are excited to announce today that AAM and REE Automotive have agreed to jointly develop an exciting new electric propulsion system for e-mobility. \u2047 As we shared in our last call, REE Automotive is a leading provider of e-mobility solutions. \u2047 The company's core innovation includes integrating traditional vehicle components into the wheel allowing for a flat and modular platform. \u2047 AAM's partnership with REE intends to incorporate our lightweight highly efficient next-generation electric drive units which feature fully integrated high speed motors and inverters into REE's highly modular technology that enables a fully flat EV chassis for multiple commercial vehicle applications. \u2047 The electric drive units will be developed at AAM's advanced technology and development center here in Detroit. \u2047 We are very excited to partner with REE Automotive to bring new e-Mobility technologies to the market. \u2047 This is an important step in growing AAM's electric propulsion business and expanding our addressable market. \u2047 In addition, our electrification data with multiple OEMs continues to intensify and our technology, engineering, and new product offerings are attracting strong global interest. \u2047 2021 will be an exciting year for us in this face. \u2047 Our engineering teams in collaboration with our technical partnerships with Inovance and offer engineering are quickly achieving technology advancements for our next generation of products. \u2047 On a separate but related matter, we are also pleased to announce today that AAM will receive a grant from the US Department of Energy in support of the development of our three-in-one electric drive unit. \u2047 This award further recognizes AAM' technology and innovation to support new energy vehicles. \u2047 As for our current generation of electric vehicle products, we are presently in the process of launching multiple new programs globally including components, sub-assemblies, and electric drive units. \u2047 These innovations and advancements are allowing AAM to compete to win business with our traditional customer base while also position AAM to win business with new OEM entrants in the space. \u2047 We're also very pleased to announce that we recently published our 2020 Sustainability Report. \u2047 I'm very proud to say we exceeded our initial sustainability goals this year-this past year and now are in the process of setting even higher goals. \u2047 AAM's sustainability program is set by our cultural values and strategic principles as a company that stress teamwork, diversity and inclusion, community involvement, and respect for the environment. \u2047 Our sustainability program has become more transparent in consideration of the interest of our shareholders, customers, suppliers, associates, and other stakeholders. \u2047 We are deeply committed to profitably growing our business in a way that is sustainable and socially responsible. \u2047 Before I transition to Chris, I want to talk about our current operating environment and our financial guidance. \u2047 In my 35-year career in the industry, I've never seen such stress on the value chain stemming from shortages in semiconductors, labor, steel, containers, and port delays and the rising commodity prices that we're experiencing. \u2047 We believe the second quarter 2021 will be the trough of the semiconductor shortage issue with improvement in the second half of the year. \u2047 However, we expect this issue will carry into 2022. \u2047 For AAM, we will continue to work with our customers and our extended supply base to protect continuity of supply. \u2047 Although there are significant high uncertainty, especially with the availability of semiconductors, we continue to maintain our current financial guidance. \u2047 In fact, based on what we know today and assuming our customers continue to prioritize full-size truck production with minimal disruption, we can see a path to the high end of our ranges. \u2047 Our current guidance remains as follows: From a revenue standpoint, $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion and an adjusted EBITDA basis, $850 million to $925 million and adjusted free cash flow of $300 million to $400 million. \u2047 Operation in our business is running extremely well. \u2047 We continue to manage our expenses to improve our operational efficiency and tightly control capital expenditures. \u2047 Even with all the pressures we face, we believe 2021 can be an outstanding year for AAM and this has AAM team both very motivated and excited. \u2047 I will cover the financial details of our first quarter results with you today. \u2047 I will also refer to the earnings slide deck as part of my prepared comments. \u2047 So let's begin with sales. \u2047 In the first quarter of 2021, AAM sales were $1.43 billion compared to $1.34 billion in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Slide 8 shows a walk of first quarter 2020 sales to first quarter 2021 sales. \u2047 First, we add back the impact of COVID-19 of approximately $169, then we account for the unfavorable impact of the semiconductor shortage which we estimate to be approximately $64 million inside the quarter. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, we are impacted by GM's transition from a rear beam axle to a new lightweight and highly efficient independent rear drive axle for GM's new full-size SUV which impacted sales by about $38 million. \u2047 The first quarter of 2021 is the last quarter of this year-over-year impact to occur. \u2047 Other volume and mix were negative by $26 million. \u2047 Pricing had an unfavorable impact of $4 million on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Metals and FX accounted for an increase in sales of $44 million. \u2047 During the last six months, we have continued to see an increase in the primary index related inputs to the metal based materials that we purchase. \u2047 You may recall, we hedged this risk by passing with our customers bypassing through the majority of index related changes. \u2047 The metal portion of this column reflects these elevated pass-throughs on a year-over-year comparison. \u2047 Now, let's move on to profitability. \u2047 Gross profit was $227.1 million or 15.9% of sales in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $195.3 million or 14.5% sales in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $262.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 or 18.4% of sales. \u2047 This compares to $213.3 million in the first quarter of 2020 or 15, 9% of sales. \u2047 As David mentioned, this was AAM's highest first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin in our company's history. \u2047 You can see a year-over-year walk down of adjusted EBITDA on Slide 9. \u2047 We benefited from the contribution margin on the increase in net sales from last year, but most importantly, we continued our strong cost reduction actions reflecting a year-over-year benefit of $28 million. \u2047 Let me now cover SG&A. \u2047 SG&A expense including R&D in the first quarter of 2021 was $90 million or 6.3% of sales. \u2047 This compares to a similar amount in the first quarter of 2020% or 6.7% of sales. \u2047 AAM's R&D spending in the first quarter of 2021 was $32 million compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 AAM has been able to capture an increase in sales with no net increase in SG&A expense. \u2047 We will not only continue to focus on controlling our SG&A costs, but also further our investments in key technologies and innovations with an emphasis on electrification. \u2047 This emphasis includes an appropriate level of funding to be successful to meet our objectives. \u2047 But it also includes shifting resources from traditional product support to new technology development in a very cost effective manner. \u2047 Let's move on to interest and taxes. \u2047 Net interest expense was $48.2 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $48.7 million in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 We expect this favorable trend to continue as we benefit from continued debt reduction. \u2047 In the first quarter of 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $8.8 million compared to $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 As we continue into 2021, we expect our book effective tax rate to be approximately 20%. \u2047 We would expect cash taxes to be in the $30 million to $40 million range for 2021. \u2047 Taking all these sales and cost drivers into account, our GAAP net income was $38.6 million or $0.33 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a loss of $501.3 million or $4.45 per share in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.57 per share compared to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Let us now move on to cash flow and the balance sheet. \u2047 Net cash provided by operating activities for the first quarter of 2021 was $179 million compared to $139 million last year. \u2047 Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment for the first quarter was $40 million. \u2047 Cash payments for restructuring and acquisition-related activity for the first quarter of 2021 were $23 million. \u2047 The cash outflows related to the recovery from the Malvern fire we experienced in September 2020 net of insurance proceeds were $11 million in the quarter. \u2047 However, we anticipate the Malvern fire to heavy neutral cash impact for the full year as timing of cash expenditures and cash insurance proceeds align over time. \u2047 In total, we would expect $50 million to $65 million in restructuring and acquisition costs in 2021. \u2047 This is no change from prior guidance. \u2047 Reflecting the impact of this activity, AAM generated adjusted free cash flow of $174.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 From a debt leverage perspective, we ended the quarter with net debt of %2.8 billion and LTM adjusted EBITDA of $769 million calculating a net leverage ratio of 3.6 times at March 31st. \u2047 This continues the trend of a declining leverage ratio and keeps us on track delivering at least internal leverage reduction this year. \u2047 Based on AAM's strong free cash in the first quarter of 2021, we prepaid over $100 million on our term loans. \u2047 We continue to expect to strengthen AAM's balance sheet by reducing our gross debt and lowering future interest payments. \u2047 In fact, subsequent to the end of the first quarter, AAM paid an additional $89 million on our term loans. \u2047 Before we move to the Q&A portion of the call, let me close my comments with some thoughts on our 2021 financial outlook. \u2047 We are reiterating our targets that we provided on February 12 of this year. \u2047 Our outlook encapsulants the best information we currently have regarding customer production schedules, their prioritization of building full-size pickups and SUVs, and the uncertain backdrop related to semiconductors. \u2047 As David indicated, based on these inputs and assumptions, we can see a trend to the high end of the guidance ranges we provided. \u2047 The strong free cash flow number as a result of focused restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, year-over-year margin growth, working capital optimization, and reduced capital spending. \u2047 Our EBITDA in free cash flow generation, we used to fund our R&D programs, support our future growth and reduce leverage is we are very focused on improving our financial profile. \u2047 While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I would expect the second quarter impact related to semiconductors to be greater than the first quarter based on recent"], "gold_summary": ["q1 adjusted earnings per share $0.57.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $0.33.  \u2047  q1 sales $1.43 billion.
