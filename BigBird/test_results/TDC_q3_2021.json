{"article": ["Steve McMillan, Teradata's President and Chief Executive Officer, will lead our call today; followed by Claire Bramley, Teradata's Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our financial results and our outlook. \u2047 We will also discuss other non-GAAP items, such as free cash flow and constant currency revenue comparisons. \u2047 A replay of this conference call will be available later today on our website. \u2047 At our Investor Day, we provided some fresh insights into our strategic direction, differentiated product and value proposition and our financial model. \u2047 We have continued our transformation journey, executing on our strategy as a cloud-first profitable growth company. \u2047 In Q3, we met expectations for revenue once again. \u2047 Importantly, our recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased approximately five percentage points versus last year and is now approaching 80%. \u2047 This is meaningful because recurring revenue provides for predictable and durable streams of cash flow. \u2047 In addition, both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share were above expectations. \u2047 Claire will address our financial metrics and outlook in more detail. \u2047 In the third quarter, our public cloud ARR was $148 million. \u2047 This was a substantial 83% growth rate over Q3 of 2020. \u2047 We had a handful of large deals slip out of the last day of Q3 into the fourth quarter related to customer timing. \u2047 We have already completed transactions that more than cover the $7 million that we expected in Q3, and we have closed most and are confident, we will close all of these transactions in the fourth quarter. \u2047 We continue to build upon our execution engine, which delivered more cloud deals in Q3 than in any other quarter. \u2047 Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, our pipeline is robust, and we are working on bigger cloud deals. \u2047 Looking at Q3 in more depth, we had numerous proof points that our strategy is solid. \u2047 We are executing and are making progress within our target market of leading enterprise accounts. \u2047 Q3 was our highest quarter yet for new cloud customers. \u2047 We added tens of new large enterprise accounts across all of our regions. \u2047 We are determined to keep up the pace in winning new logos in the cloud and on-prem. \u2047 Our dedicated new logo sales teams are coming on board, ramping up and are already starting to win. \u2047 We are gating the world's largest companies, often with extreme scale and complexity in their data environment to smoothly migrate to the cloud. \u2047 These global enterprises depend on their mission-critical Teradata platform every single day to help them extract the greatest value from their enterprise analytics. \u2047 As many of our large enterprise customers are transitioning to the cloud for the first time, managing through these types of transactions can take some time, requiring planning and coordination with multiple stakeholders across numerous functions and migrating to the cloud requires careful consideration of the interconnectivity of all aspects of the customer's on-prem analytic ecosystem. \u2047 Customers are recognizing that Teradata with our connected multi-cloud data platform for enterprise analytics is the best solution to overcome these challenges, and they are increasingly migrating to the cloud with Teradata Vantage. \u2047 In the quarter, healthcare, transportation and government led the pack in terms of our target verticals. \u2047 Just one recent example of a seamless migration to the cloud is American Airlines, a Teradata on-prem customer for more than 14 years. \u2047 American just migrated its massive Teradata EDW to Teradata on Azure Our collective team of employees from Teradata and American Airlines executed very efficiently for a highly successful migration. \u2047 The airline's Teradata platform provides virtually every department access to analytics and reporting capability and supports thousands of users for many business initiatives, including revenue management, network planning, technical operations, cargo and marketing. \u2047 The migration is part of the airline strategy to provide greater agility, speed to market and frictionless scalability to its business community. \u2047 We have been told that its business users are extremely pleased with the speed and performance of the Vantage platform and Azure. \u2047 Cloud growth remains front and center for us. \u2047 The move to cloud is a clear direction and often a mandate for many organizations. \u2047 It's an issue of when, not if. \u2047 We are pleased that each of our regions saw growth in cloud customers in the quarter. \u2047 Additionally, we are seeing that once customers start in the cloud, they grow with Teradata. \u2047 Our quarterly trend of healthy net expansion rates in the cloud continues to be greater than 130%, as customers add more use cases, more data and workloads and more users to their Teradata multi-cloud portfolio platform. \u2047 Here's a handful of examples where we are competing and winning in the market. \u2047 The ANZ Banking Group is migrating its Teradata enterprise data platform to Vantage on Google Cloud. \u2047 This multinational financial services company has been a Teradata customer for more than two decades. \u2047 Its Teradata platform is core to its critical business applications, supporting more than 2,000 users for many different business initiatives, including regulatory reporting, customer analytics, product profitability and responsible lending. \u2047 The migration is part of the bank's broader cloud mandate. \u2047 Here, we are partnering with a leading global SI on the customers' migration to the cloud. \u2047 A leading global oilfield services company is deploying Vantage on Azure to support center data management and advanced analytics. \u2047 This new Teradata customer is committed to continual innovation using technology to improve safety, productivity and quality of life in the oil and gas industry. \u2047 This transaction is one of the large deals from Q3 that fell just over the line and closed on day one of Q4. \u2047 BNSF, one of the largest freight transportation companies in North America is migrating its Teradata data platform to Vantage on Azure Cloud as part of a long-term plan to have the majority of its analytic ecosystem in the cloud. \u2047 Here, we won against cloud native competition, and Teradata will provide analytics and reporting for finance, operations and marketing. \u2047 Teradata Consulting will be leading the migration effort with support from our partner, Microsoft. \u2047 As part of this effort, Teradata will be integrated into a hybrid-analytic environment with both IBM Mainframe and Microsoft Azure components. \u2047 Another airline, one of the world's largest and most admired, is migrating its long-standing Teradata environment to Vantage on AWS-as-a-Service. \u2047 The company's modernization efforts include increasing analytics for HR, finance, loyalty and customer care and will leverage both Teradata and AWS services as well as solutions from advanced analytics vendors. \u2047 The ability to leverage[Indecipherable] capabilities to utilize AWS three data and make it available for richer analytics was an important factor in migrating Vantage to the AWS cloud. \u2047 The customer considered cloud-native competition before selecting Vantage on AWS, Accenture was a supportive partner during their evaluation and leading the migration process. \u2047 [Indecipherable], a leading tech equipment manufacturer based in[Indecipherable] as a new cloud customer, choosing Vantage on Azure as its cloud data and analytics platform. \u2047 The Vantage on Azure environment will be used for development work, POCs with customers, demos and applications testing. \u2047 Our purpose, transforming how businesses work and people live through the power of data has never been more relevant, and we are successfully supporting customers in building and driving meaningful business value in their analytic environments, whether multi-cloud, cloud-only, on-prem or a hybrid combination of any or all. \u2047 To keep Teradata's differentiated market-leading position, we continuously develop and evolve our technology and Q3 was no different. \u2047 In the quarter, we advanced our innovations on multiple fronts. \u2047 We released a significant enhancement to Vantage, adding 30 new end database functions that enable customers to use partner tools of their choice to leverage the power of end database analytics, delivering performance at enterprise scale. \u2047 We introduced Vantage Streams in the cloud providing near real-time data, leveraging native object stores, AWS3, Azure Blob and Google Cloud Storage to help accelerate new business outcomes. \u2047 Customers can now stream IoT data, stock data, weather or website click-stream data to deliver new analytic use cases. \u2047 This is exactly what is needed by our target market and a recent research study by independent research firm, Vanson Bourne, 87% of IT decision makers felt that they must leverage these emerging technologies to remain competitive. \u2047 We also delivered an update to our bring-your-own model capabilities that allows customers to bring their own analytic models, built with third-party tools and languages into Vantage to run enterprise analytics at scale. \u2047 And in keeping with our focus on customer and market drivers, we brought enhancements to our communications data model with full support of 5G network activity, including intelligent network optimization. \u2047 We are furthering the transformation and our go-to-market organization to execute with greater agility and help us accelerate the move to the cloud and build an increasingly strong partner ecosystem as well. \u2047 These actions are designed to drive results for Teradata and an exceptional customer experience. \u2047 We know that when our customers succeed, we succeed. \u2047 We're investing to drive faster cloud execution to help our customers maximize the value of the data and get optimal results from the Teradata environment in the cloud. \u2047 We are deploying senior cloud specialist sellers and cloud specialist architect teams in each region to progress and execute more quickly to close cloud deals. \u2047 We are doubling down on building mutually beneficial partnerships to drive scale and strengthen capabilities and have added senior cloud expertise to our global partner organization. \u2047 Strong partnerships create a flywheel effect and accelerating successes in the cloud and in data analytics. \u2047 Here's a few new partnerships that will help propel us forward. \u2047 Today, we announced a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS. \u2047 We are both committed to increase product integrations and development with AWS Cloud services and launch joint programs to help customers migrate, modernize and derisk the cloud adoption journey with Vantage on AWS. \u2047 With this exciting announcement, we are working together to make it simple to use Vantage on AWS across the broad array of AWS services at enterprise scale. \u2047 We are very excited about the strategic collaboration that will make it even easier for customers to get the most value from their enterprise analytics at scale in the cloud, helping us both accelerate growth. \u2047 In important and growing AI arena, we recently announced a strategic partnership with H2O. \u2047 ai and the integration of H2O. \u2047 ai's hybrid cloud platform with Vantage. \u2047 This integration enables our joint customers to quickly and easily build and deploy AI solutions that inform new insights from machine learning and drive more meaningful business outcomes. \u2047 We're also pleased to be deepening our partnership with Accenture. \u2047 Together, we are building a global Vantage cloud data migration factory to enable joint customers to easily migrate to Teradata Vantage in the cloud. \u2047 The powerful combination of Accenture's recognized global capabilities and our unparalleled ability to harness data at scale will help drive smooth transitions to the cloud for our joint customers. \u2047 I'm seeing the team operate with a stronger sense of urgency, accountability and enthusiasm, and I'm pleased that we are progressing in our go-to-market organization and across the company. \u2047 We are resolute in executing our growth strategy. \u2047 Looking ahead, Q4 is traditionally our largest quarter for ARR growth. \u2047 We have a robust pipeline for the quarter, and we are seeing trends of more cloud deals and larger cloud deals, some in the seven and eight digit range. \u2047 Given these dynamics, you can be certain that the entire team will be focused and dedicated to closely managing the business, especially with the planning and coordination associated with closing some of these large transactions. \u2047 We believe our cloud business will be approximately $200 million by the end of the year. \u2047 We have a path to grow more than 100% year-on-year. \u2047 However, given the timing we experienced in Q3, we believe it is prudent to lower our cloud ARR growth outlook from 100% year-over-year to approximately 90% year-over-year. \u2047 We remain pleased with this very strong annualized growth rate in our cloud business, a substantial cloud business that is based on a competitive product and differentiated position in a large and growing market. \u2047 At our Investor Day in September, I stated that Teradata is a profitable growth company in a large and growing market with the right technology, the right strategy and the right people. \u2047 That remains true today. \u2047 And we remain incredibly dedicated to adding customers, growing and expanding existing ones and providing an outstanding customer experience with our connected multi-cloud data platform for enterprise analytics. \u2047 Our focus is clearly on executing to keep winning and delivering shareholder value. \u2047 This confidence is reflected in the new $1 billion repurchase authorization that we announced today and our strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders via share repurchase. \u2047 Now I'll pass the call over to Claire for additional insights. \u2047 In the third fiscal quarter, Teradata delivered revenue and profit in line or better than expectations. \u2047 Quarterly highlights include recurring revenue of $352 million or growth of 7% year-over-year as reported. \u2047 Gross profit margin of 61.3%, up 30 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 Operating margin of 15.4%, up 60 basis points year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43 in line with prior year and $0.11 above the midpoint of our previous outlook. \u2047 I am pleased that these results keep us on track to achieve or beat our fiscal 2021 outlook on many of our key financial metrics. \u2047 Some of our year-to-date highlights include total ARR growth of 7% versus the prior year, which is in line with our 2021 full year outlook range of mid- to high single-digit growth. \u2047 Year-to-date, recurring revenue growth of 14% versus the prior year compared to our full year outlook range of high single to low double-digit growth. \u2047 Earnings per share of $1.86 against our previous full year outlook range of $1.92 to $1.96 and year-to-date free cash flow of $347 million compared to our full year outlook of at least $400 million. \u2047 Despite the many highlights, it is unfortunate that a handful of our transactions slipped into Q4, which impacted our cloud ARR in the third quarter by $7 million. \u2047 As Steve noted, we have already covered this amount in the early days of Q4. \u2047 We have a robust Q4 pipeline, the strongest we have ever seen, and we continue to successfully close deals with good economics. \u2047 We therefore remain confident that our customers want and value our products. \u2047 Over the last 18 months, as we have undertaken our transformation journey, Teradata has had a renewed focus on driving greater, rigor, discipline and accountability in the business. \u2047 We are focused on driving improved intra-quarter linearity, increased investment in our cloud go-to-market activities globally, and we are"], "gold_summary": ["q3 non-gaap earnings per share $0.43.  \u2047  q3 revenue rose 1
