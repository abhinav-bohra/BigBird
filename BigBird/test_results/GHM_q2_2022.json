{"article": ["We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in Graham Corporation. \u2047 Joining me on the call are Dan Thoren, our President and CEO' and Jeff Glajch, our chief financial officer. \u2047 If not you can access the release as well as the slides that will accompanying your conversation today at our website, www. \u2047 These documents can be found on our website or@sec.gov. \u2047 During today's call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 We have provided reconciliation of non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today's release in the slide for your information. \u2047 The addition of Barber-Nichols contributed $16.5 million in the quarter. \u2047 Our legacy Graham manufacturing business offset part of the game. \u2047 There are two reasons; first, in the comparable quarter last year we had non-repeatable material only order. \u2047 In addition, we had a significant level of Chinese sub-contracting in the second quarter last year. \u2047 These two items made up approximately $10 million in lower revenue compared with last year. \u2047 We are pleased with our strategic expansion into the defense business evidence that with 58% of our quarterly revenue coming from this key market, while we await a recovery in the energy and petrochemical markets. \u2047 As we look to the second half of the year, we continue to expect strong performance from Barber-Nichols. \u2047 For the Batavia facility, we expect to see a significant shift toward higher profit defense jobs. \u2047 In our commercial markets, we expect to have a large increase in subcontract to production plans for both the United States and India which will measurably improve revenue and gross profit in the second half of the year. \u2047 I would caution however, that this large increase in the amount of outsourcing while set up very nicely right now is dependent on our subcontracting partners and can occasion take longer -- can allocation take longer than planned. \u2047 So there is a risk a portion of this could shift out of the fiscal year into fiscal -- into Q1 of fiscal 2023. \u2047 Orders increased to $31.4 million up from $20.9 million in Q1, orders were split evenly between the Graham manufacturing business and Barber-Nichols. \u2047 Our $233 million backlog is strong with 78% of its coming from the defense market. \u2047 In the quarter gross margins and profitability were impacted by two Batavia based defense orders which utilize a significant amount of labor but had a very low revenue per labor hour. \u2047 One project was a first article order which had been one competitively The other was a fabrication order which has a significant portion of its profit recognized in previous years when the material portion of the project was executed out of separate order. \u2047 Both of these projects will make up a significantly lower portion of the expected revenue in the second half of the year. \u2047 In addition, we expect both of these projects to be nearly complete by the end of the fiscal year. \u2047 We did have a strong quarter in Barber-Nichols. \u2047 I continue to be pleased with their performance through four months their business is at $20 million of revenue and $3 million of EBITDA. \u2047 Our expectation for the full year remain at 45 to $48 million of revenue and at an 11% EBITDA margin or $5.2 million. \u2047 So they are ahead of pace to hit the fiscal year expectations for the 10 months of the business that will be part of Graham in this fiscal year. \u2047 I do caution extrapolating in the form of numbers but I am encouraged about their performance and the integration within Graham. \u2047 In the second quarter, we have to one-time items, we had a pre-tax gain of $1.9 million related to the earned out of the Barber-Nichols acquisition. \u2047 I will discuss this in a minute. \u2047 We also had a charge an offsetting charge of $798,000 related to the termination of our prior CEO. \u2047 The net of these two items $1.1 million, or approximately $882,000 after taxes are included in the reported results. \u2047 Regarding the earn-outs adjustment for Barber-Nichols, we have made a change which we believe will further strengthen the long term incentives of the business. \u2047 The acquisition are now which was for $7 million to $14 million payout based on fiscal 2024 results -- fiscal 2024 EBITDA results has been cancelled. \u2047 This had represented a 10% to 20% addition to the original $70.1 million acquisition price. \u2047 This earn-out have been valued using a Monte Carlo accounting purchase, Monte Carlo purchase price accounting analysis at $1.9 million. \u2047 Therefore, with the cancellation of this earn-out the economic value of that earn-out is now zero and the gain had to be recognized through the income statement in the quarter. \u2047 So we have initiated a new incremental bonus pool for a broader portion of the Barber-Nichols employees. \u2047 This pool will be an annual cash bonus pool -- an incremental annual cash bonus pool based on fiscal year results 2024, 2025 and 2026. \u2047 For each year, the pool will allow for a range of at the low end $2 million, once the EBITDA threshold is met at a maximum of $4 million if the maximum EBITDA is achieved within the year. \u2047 Therefor across the three years, the maximum opportunity is $12 million. \u2047 In those years, this will be reported as a period cost. \u2047 We believe this bonus pool will be an excellent retention tool and will be in place for the third, fourth and fifth years following the acquisition of Barber-Nichols. \u2047 We can move on to Slide 4. \u2047 Much of Slide 4 and 5 I have already discussed. \u2047 I will note that Q2 last year essentially including all the profit of the full fiscal year, obviously this quarter in the current year was challenged and however the challenges were completely within the Batavia operation. \u2047 In addition, those challenges are short term and many of them are behind us or mostly behind us. \u2047 We expect the next two quarters to see a noticeable improvement in profitability. \u2047 You will note, the GAAP and adjusted earnings per share are similar for Q2 along with the $1.1 million of one-time items that I mentioned earlier. \u2047 We also have adjusted out the purchase accounting amortization of $784,000 as well as $124,000 of acquisition related costs. \u2047 The full year reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings per share are in the appendix of this deck. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 5. \u2047 For the year-to-date results, the $9.6 million revenue gain came from $20 million of additional Barber-Nichols offset by the same items noted for the quarter earlier, namely last year having the benefit of a one-time material order and higher Chinese sub-contracting in the first half of the year. \u2047 As with the quarter results, the year-to-date GAAP and adjusted earnings per share are similar for the same reasons noted for the second quarter. \u2047 Again, this is reconciled in the appendix of the deck. \u2047 You may recall last year we had a big impact from COVID in the first quarter while we were shut down for approximately for three weeks and we were running at half capacity throughout the quarter. \u2047 While this year's first quarter were impacted by the same lower margin defense orders that were noted for the second quarter. \u2047 Moving on to Slide 6. \u2047 As many of you know, I was very pleased that we invested our formerly high cash balance by buying Barber-Nichols. \u2047 I'm very pleased about their performance to-date and after seeing even more of their team in action, the future at Barber-Nichols is extremely exciting. \u2047 They are executing very well and the early returns which can often be a risk for an acquisition have been stellar. \u2047 Our balance sheet with the term loan that was taken as part of the acquisition provides us flexibility for future investments. \u2047 We will continue to be willing to use our strong balance sheet for future internal and external growth opportunities. \u2047 Dan will talk further about our backlog, our strategy and our guidance for the full year. \u2047 I'm starting on Slide 7. \u2047 We had a nice mix of orders in the second quarter, $12.5 million came from our defense customers almost $19 million from our commercial customers. \u2047 Defense orders were for both new and existing programs and new and overhaul equipment, giving us full lifecycle exposure. \u2047 Space related orders were around $2 million and advanced energy orders were close to $2 million. \u2047 Our commercial balance orders or spares are trending upwards. \u2047 The big change in backlog from fiscal year '21 to fiscal year '22 was mostly from the acquisition of Barber-Nichols. \u2047 Of the $233 million backlog 78% or $182 million is in defense. \u2047 From a backlog perspective, Graham has certainly made the transition from an energy and chemical business with some defense work to a defense company with an important contribution from energy and chemical. \u2047 About one half the backlog is expected to convert to revenue in the next 12 months. \u2047 The remaining 12-month order graph does not include BN orders prior to the acquisition on June 1 to 2021. \u2047 Moving to Slide 8; Graham's strategy started many years ago, has been realized through both organic and inorganic means. \u2047 The organic defense business supplying vacuum and heat transfer equipment on Navy carriers and submarines has been very successful. \u2047 The acquisition of Barber-Nichols has added more defense business that helps to offset the cyclicality in the heritage energy and chemical business. \u2047 Our second quarter revenue in defense was $20 million, up $12.7 million from the first quarter where BNI contributed for one month. \u2047 The really nice thing about defense business is the visibility. \u2047 Ships and submarines take a long time to build. \u2047 So budgeting and plans are in place long before orders come. \u2047 In some cases, the Navy will place orders for multiple strategic assets at one time, giving us a large backlog that converts over several years. \u2047 These long-term orders provide good value for our customer and allows us to continually improve margins as the projects repeat in our shops. \u2047 Revenue remains unchanged in the $130 million to $140 million range. \u2047 As discussed by Jeff, we started slow in the first half with $54 million of revenue and we are ramping up each quarter. \u2047 BN is expected to contribute $45 million to $48 million for the year. \u2047 Our gross margin will be 17% to 18%, reflecting lower margin maybe work at Batavia with SG&A around 15% or 16% of revenue. \u2047 We have tightened adjusted EBITDA from $7 million to $9 million to $7 million to $8 million. \u2047 Capital expenditures remain unchanged at $3.5 million to $4 million. \u2047 Certainly, we continue to track supply chain and COVID-19 related disruptions. \u2047 The biggest potential impact to our projections that we are tracking now is the executive order on ensuring adequate COVID safety protocols for federal contractors. \u2047 This requirement would be flowed down contractually to Graham manufacturing in Barber-Nichols. \u2047 And would require that all of our employees that do not have exemptions, be vaccinated against COVID-19 effective December 8, 2021. \u2047 Slide 10 summarizes how we are driving value for our shareholders. \u2047 The defense strategy has been successful and we see additional growth available. \u2047 In the energy market that refining and petrochem, we are seeing leading indicators of an upcycled expansion. \u2047 We are preparing our company and our supply base for the increase in business there. \u2047 We have several initiatives to enhance our market positions and brand recognition. \u2047 These range from marketing, so there's a one of the things we're doing is an upside -- website upgrade and also resuming our successful academics training program. \u2047 We're also taking different approaches to our markets. \u2047 We're leveraging our installed base, we're redeveloping our relationships with license or as customers and EPCs that has been strained through this COVID environment that we've been in. \u2047 We have made excellent progress with balance sheet efficiency over the last six months as Jeff has discussed. \u2047 Finally, we're developing a multi-year strategic plan that will generate cash to enable more growth. \u2047 I shared our first strategic plan iteration with our board yesterday and had some great feedback. \u2047 They are encouraged with what we're planning. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["qtrly orders increased to $31.4 million, up 50% sequentially."], "pred_summary": ["compname
