{"article": ["I'm Laura Adams, chief accounting officer and interim head of investor relations. \u2047 And with me to talk about our business and financial results are Horacio Rozanski, our president and chief executive officer; and Lloyd Howell, executive vice president, chief financial officer, and treasurer. \u2047 During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. \u2047 We are now on Slide 4. \u2047 Today, Lloyd and I will share our third quarter results in the context of our fiscal year 2022 guidance and our multi-year investment thesis. \u2047 We will also describe the underlying dynamics of our business and the progress we are making on our VoLT strategy. \u2047 To set the context, let's go back to our October Investor Day, where we outlined our VoLT strategy and associated financial goals. \u2047 As a reminder, VoLT stands for velocity, leadership, and technology. \u2047 It is a strategic program Booz Allen has launched to capitalize on our first mover advantage in helping the federal government transform core missions through the use of new technologies. \u2047 Over the next few years, we look to grow faster by building scaled positions in critical areas such as national cyber and digital battlespace. \u2047 We are in the early stages of this journey, but are already making strides and seeing strong progress. \u2047 As part of VoLT, we have set new multi-year financial goals that deliver both strong profit growth and continued investment in our business. \u2047 Our investment thesis centers on growing adjusted EBITDA dollars from $840 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2025. \u2047 That's approximately a 50% increase. \u2047 We expect this increase to be accomplished through 5% to 8% annual organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid-10s, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in total capital deployment that prioritizes strategic acquisitions. \u2047 Our expectations for fiscal year 2022 were consistent with these goals. \u2047 Gross revenue growth in the 7% to 10% range and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.10 to $4.30. \u2047 We also said this fiscal year growth pattern would look different from recent years, with slower revenue growth in the first half and significant acceleration in the second half. \u2047 Our revenue growth in the third quarter was lighter than we expected. \u2047 And while we forecast strong fourth quarter revenue growth, we're lowering our full fiscal year 2022 revenue outlook to account for a slower pace. \u2047 Lloyd will take you through the quarter results and our updated guidance in greater depth. \u2047 There were several factors that contributed to the revenue dynamics for the quarter. \u2047 On the positive side, we continue to win the right kind of work and hire the right people, as reflected in our backlog growth and headcount increases over the last 12 months. \u2047 Conversely, the translation of those positives into revenue growth was slower than historical standards, driven by a number of factors, including a protracted continuing resolution; a higher dollar value of awards under protest; delayed awards and slower ramp-up on sold contracts; lower staff productivity due in large part to the omicron variant surging during the quarter; and lower-than-anticipated billable expenses. \u2047 These dynamics impacted our entire portfolio and some pockets of our defense business were especially hard hit due in part to the number of large awards delayed and a greater proportion of billable expenses in their revenue base. \u2047 Looking ahead, we see some of these challenging dynamics continuing into the coming months. \u2047 As a result, we are taking a three-pronged approach to proactively manage through this environment. \u2047 First, we are addressing those business areas where we see the greatest funding uncertainty. \u2047 Second, we are continuing to control costs in order to deliver on our commitments to both grow adjusted EBITDA and invest in our business. \u2047 And third, we are doubling down on areas of significant growth opportunity shifting resources across the portfolio by leveraging our unique operating model and single P&L. \u2047 In short, we continue to lean into growth while managing tightly in the face of greater market volatility. \u2047 Before turning the call over to Lloyd, let me return to the longer-term outlook and the progress we have made in our business so far. \u2047 As we look ahead, we remain on track to deliver strong growth in adjusted EBITDA through fiscal year 2025, supported by continued revenue growth, stable adjusted EBITDA margins, and strategic deployment of capital. \u2047 Our confidence in the future is predicated in our belief that we have the right strategy and the proven ability to execute in both good times and challenging ones. \u2047 And several accomplishments from the last few months underscore these points. \u2047 First, we continue to win the right kind of work at the center of national priorities where innovation can help the government transform the way the mission is executed. \u2047 Our clients from the Department of Veterans Affairs to the Air Force are looking to Booz Allen for expertise in areas such as DevSecOps, AI, and the commercialization of new technologies to advance their missions. \u2047 Second, we are making key investments that differentiate our service to clients. \u2047 For example, last December, as part of our ramp-up on national cyber, we announced the opening of our carrier-grade 5G lab in Central Maryland. \u2047 The lab offers a state-of-the-art testing environment for secure, cyber-resilient 5G solutions. \u2047 Similarly, as we advance our work on digital battlespace, we are significantly expanding our footprint in Honolulu. \u2047 This investment deploys into the INDOPACOM region some of our most advanced capabilities to expand our support of several high-priority client missions. \u2047 Third, we are successfully using acquisitions as strategic accelerators. \u2047 Liberty and Tracepoint continue to deliver the strategic and financial value we expected. \u2047 Integration is going well, and we are extremely pleased with the upside these acquisitions create. \u2047 And in addition, we continue to build our acquisition pipeline. \u2047 And fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we continue to strengthen our team and ensure we have the focus and resiliency to support our clients as they too manage through a volatile environment. \u2047 I am extremely proud of our workforce for achieving complete compliance with our COVID vaccination requirement. \u2047 Our purpose and values are at the core of everything we do, so we believe that prioritizing the health and safety of all our employees is the right thing to do for our institution, our clients, and our communities. \u2047 Furthermore, a fully vaccinated workforce allows us to better serve our clients, supports safer in-person collaboration, and is critical to entering a post-pandemic phase. \u2047 Together, always together, the people of Booz Allen are forging ahead with relentless focus on our clients' missions and our growth strategy. \u2047 This is what delivers the consistent results that create long-term shareholder value. \u2047 And with that, I'll give the floor to Lloyd for more details on the third quarter, the fiscal year and our investment thesis. \u2047 Lloyd, over to you. \u2047 As we near the end of fiscal year 2022, a year marked by many twists and turns, we have continued to build on our underlying fundamentals, which have supported our expectations for second half performance outpacing first half. \u2047 And while top line growth and cash did not deliver at the levels we anticipated, we are delivering the bottom line results we need to invest in our business and our people to achieve our long-term growth initiatives. \u2047 With three quarters now completed and greater visibility into the fourth quarter, we are seeing some transitory changes at the macro level that are impacting overall market performance. \u2047 Expanding on what Horacio said, just as we believe that we were turning the corner on the pandemic's impacts and reverting to more predictable business patterns, we were hit by omicron, which led to another spike in PTO, resulting in staff utilization rates not normalizing as we had anticipated. \u2047 This, coupled with an overhang effect from the continuing resolution, has impacted our ability to convert strong demand into top line growth. \u2047 We factored some of this uncertainty into our 2022 fiscal year guidance, but we did not fully anticipate the impact of the second wave on utilization, nor did we foresee the delays in translating wins into revenue generation. \u2047 I will get into more detail shortly when I give updated guidance. \u2047 At the top line, revenue increased 6.6% year over year to $2 billion, which includes approximately $117 million from inorganic contributions. \u2047 Revenue, excluding billable expenses, grew 6.2% year over year to $1.4 billion. \u2047 Revenue growth was slower this quarter for the following three reasons: first, funding delays resulting in slower ramp on new work and existing work; second, lower staff utilization resulting from an uptick in PTO taken over the holiday period, due in part to a rise in COVID cases and the inclusion of the New Year's Eve holiday in this quarter's results. \u2047 And third, billable expenses continued to be pressured by slower travel patterns and the timing of material purchases getting pushed to the right. \u2047 Taken together, these factors are largely timing issues that we believe will dissipate as we return to more normal business rhythms. \u2047 Now let me walk through the market level performance. \u2047 Revenue declined by 2.2% year over year and has been trending down quarter over quarter. \u2047 Since defense is roughly 50% of our business portfolio and largely comprised of cost reimbursable work, the macro factors and subsequent top line impacts I noted were especially impactful in this market. \u2047 More specifically, to expand on what Horacio said, our Army account was hit the hardest by some of these dynamics, where our performance was impacted by budgetary challenges, slowness, and ramp-ups, and some losses. \u2047 Going forward, our defense leadership is doubling down on addressing these issues by growing headcount, managing utilization, and aggressively deploying talent to capture the highest value opportunities, including hyper growth initiatives such as our digital battlespace platform. \u2047 In civil, revenue grew by 25.3% year over year, of which 5.1% was organic, marking our second consecutive quarter of strong double-digit growth. \u2047 Our results reflect solid performance across the portfolio, particularly in health, where we see strong alignment with the administration's priorities, which are yielding important wins. \u2047 Additionally, Liberty continues to strengthen our unique market position as we prepare to leverage integrated capabilities in the areas of cloud, DevSecOps, and API development to pursue additional market share across our broader portfolio. \u2047 In Intelligence, we recorded our second consecutive quarter of growth at 0.8% year over year. \u2047 This continued improvement in performance reflects our ability to hire ahead of growing demand and capitalize on our mission expertise and advanced technological offerings to secure key recompetes and new work opportunities. \u2047 This positions us for multiyear growth in key areas, including digital modernization, artificial intelligence and high-end data analytics. \u2047 Lastly, global commercial revenue grew 26.7% compared to the prior-year period. \u2047 commercial cyber business and contributions from Tracepoint, where we are seeing strong cross-selling momentum and early synergies. \u2047 We are now on Slide 6. \u2047 Net bookings for the third quarter were approximately $797 million, up 29% over the prior-year period, translating to a quarterly book-to-bill of 0.39 times and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of 1.28 times. \u2047 Total backlog grew approximately 19.2% year over year to $27.8 billion. \u2047 Funded backlog grew 11.7% to $4 billion. \u2047 Unfunded backlog grew 57.7% to $9.4 billion. \u2047 And price options grew 4.4% to $14.3 billion. \u2047 These results underscore continued demand and strong alignment to our clients' core missions in the areas of artificial intelligence, cyber and digital modernization, to name a few and further, our position as a trusted partner and market leader. \u2047 Looking ahead, as we continue to pursue larger and more technically complex bids, we anticipate that ongoing protests will become part of the normal business cycle, which we are increasingly factoring into our operating plan. \u2047 As of December 31, we had approximately 29,500 employees, an increase of approximately 1,900 year over year or 6.8%. \u2047 The labor market for tech and tech-adjacent talent remains highly competitive, but we are pleased that we continue to successfully execute on our hiring and retention strategies, a reflection of our appeal as an employer of choice. \u2047 This resulted in a third consecutive quarter of mid-single-digit headcount growth, consistent with our expectations. \u2047 Moving to the bottom line. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $222 million, up 8% from the prior-year period. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin on revenue was 10.9% compared to 10.8% in the prior-year period. \u2047 The increase in adjusted EBITDA margin was driven by three factors: first, profitable contract level performance and mix, which includes inorganic contributions; second, prudent cost management; and third, a return to billing for fee within Intel, which had a $2 million negative impact on the prior-year period under the CARES Act, a tailwind that will taper off after this quarter. \u2047 Third quarter net income decreased 10.8% year over year to $129 million. \u2047 Adjusted net income was $137 million, down 5.5% year over year. \u2047 Diluted earnings per share decreased 7.8% to $0.95 from $1.03 the prior-year period. \u2047 And adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 1.9% to $1.02 from $1.04. \u2047 Both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics were impacted by a higher effective tax rate following the release of an income tax reserve of $10.2 million in the prior-year period related to the Aquilent acquisition, as well as higher interest expense partially offset by a lower share count due to our share repurchase program. \u2047 Our non-GAAP metrics exclude certain acquisition costs and the noncash gain of $7.1 million from the spin-off of SnapAttack during the quarter. \u2047 Cash from operations was $21 million in the third quarter, down from $233 million in the prior year comparable period. \u2047 Operating cash performance is volatile quarter-to-quarter, and the decline in this period was more pronounced due to some of the factors impacting top line growth, coupled with higher disbursements. \u2047 As we have done before, we are focused on our working cash management and cash collection efforts to continue improving our operating cash performance and reinforce our strong balance sheet. \u2047 Year to date, we have generated $481 million in operating cash flow and $430 million in free cash flow for a free cash flow conversion rate nearing 100% and supporting our strong balance sheet positioning and
