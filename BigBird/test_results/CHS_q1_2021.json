{"article": ["Before we get started, I'll draw your attention to Slide 2 and a brief cautionary statement. \u2047 We appreciate you joining us for our third quarter investor update. \u2047 Moving to Slide 3 and the agenda for today's call. \u2047 I'll also share some current initiatives underway to advance PPL's clean energy strategy and provide a brief operational and regulatory update. \u2047 Joe will then provide a financial update, including a detailed review of third quarter financial results. \u2047 Turning to Slide 4. \u2047 We continue to make excellent progress on our key initiatives to strategically reposition PPL for long-term growth and success. \u2047 In September, we received FERC approval for our planned acquisition of Narragansett Electric. \u2047 With FERC's approval, we now have four of the five approvals necessary to close on the transaction. \u2047 We continue to make progress on securing the final approval from the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. \u2047 In its procedural schedule, the division has established February 25 as the target date for a decision. \u2047 This would put PPL and National Grid on a path to close on the transaction by March of next year as originally expected. \u2047 As we pursue the final regulatory approval, we continue working closely with National Grid on planning to ensure a smooth transition for Rhode Island customers and Narragansett employees upon closing. \u2047 Together, we've collaborated through 30 functional integration teams to plan and execute a safe, effective and minimally disruptive transition of the Rhode Island operations. \u2047 These teams have built robust Day 1 integration plans to execute on identified business requirements; extracted transition service agreements that will be key to providing a stable, seamless transition for customers; redesigned critical business processes to enable the TSAs to effectively operate; designed a new Rhode Island operating model and organization from the ground up, with over 1,100 National Grid employees accepting employment offers pending the close of the transaction. \u2047 We've initiated an integrated change management and communication strategy to engage our future employees, customers and Rhode Island stakeholders to begin to build relationships for the long term. \u2047 And all three labor unions have ratified their new contracts that will be effective under PPL's ownership. \u2047 As we work to secure final approval, we look forward to partnering with the talented team in Rhode Island to deliver safe, reliable, affordable and sustainable energy. \u2047 And we are very excited about the opportunity the acquisition presents to build one of the nation's most advanced clean energy-enabling grids in support of Rhode Island's ambitious decarbonization goals. \u2047 Finally, on this slide, I'm excited to highlight a new valuable addition to PPL's Board of Directors, Heather Redman. \u2047 Heather is the co-founder and managing partner of Flying Fish Partners, a venture capital firm that invests in early stage artificial intelligence and machine learning start-ups, including energy-related applications. \u2047 She brings expertise in disruptive technology, industry transformation, energy development and energy technology at a time when PPL is squarely focused on driving innovation and positioning our company for growth in the clean energy transition. \u2047 I am confident that Heather will be a fantastic addition to our diverse and experienced board. \u2047 With Heather's addition, our board now has 10 directors, 60% of whom are diverse, and 30% of whom are women. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5. \u2047 In advancing our strategic repositioning, we also continue to make progress in deploying proceeds from the sale of our U.K. assets to maximize shareowner value. \u2047 And while we recognize cash is fungible, we are showing the major buckets for the use of proceeds on this slide. \u2047 And today, we've announced two updates. \u2047 First, as we continue to develop our business plan, we've identified at least $1 billion in incremental capital investments in Pennsylvania and Kentucky through 2025 to support grid resilience and modernization in advance of sustainable energy future for our customers. \u2047 We identified capex opportunities, predominantly in the T&D areas, include continued application of smart grid technologies, which improve overall system reliability and reduce O&M costs at the same time. \u2047 It also includes further hardening of the system to support reliability and resilience in the face of more frequent and stronger storms. \u2047 We'll look to make these same types of investments in Rhode Island once we close the transaction and work with Rhode Island stakeholders on the pace of change to the clean energy economy in the state, keeping in mind the cost impacts for customers. \u2047 In addition to our updates on capex opportunities, we've also revised our expectations for share repurchases and have allocated an additional $500 million to buybacks. \u2047 We now expect to repurchase a total of approximately $1 billion of PPL common stock by year-end, effectively doubling the amount previously announced on our Q2 call. \u2047 We've already completed $550 million in share repurchases through October 31. \u2047 We're pleased about the progress we've made in evaluating our capital plans and look forward to sharing additional details at an analyst day following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition. \u2047 In the meantime, we'll continue to review our business plans for additional opportunities that will drive value for both customers and shareowners. \u2047 We are also providing an update on the timing of an expected change to PPL's dividend and reiterate the planned dividend policy following the closing of the Narragansett acquisition. \u2047 The dividend has and will remain an important part of PPL's total shareowner return proposition. \u2047 Given the procedural schedule in place for the required regulatory approval in Rhode Island, we expect to maintain the current quarterly dividend rate through the January 3, 2022, payment. \u2047 After that date, we plan to realign the dividend, targeting a payout ratio of 60% to 65% of the repositioned PPL earnings as previously communicated. \u2047 The final decision regarding the dividend will be made by the board of directors after the Narragansett closing. \u2047 Moving to Slide 6. \u2047 We continue to advance our clean energy strategy as we pursue our goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. \u2047 In October, our Kentucky Utilities filed renewable power purchase agreements with the Kentucky Public Service Commission to provide a combined 125 megawatts of solar power to five major customers. \u2047 Under the 20-year agreements, which will support customer participation in LG&E and KU's green tariff, LG&E and KU will procure 100% of the power from a new solar facility that will be built in Western Kentucky. \u2047 The agreements reflect our continued efforts to support the growth of renewable energy and economic development in the state. \u2047 utilities committed to supporting the growth of electric vehicles as we seek additional opportunities to enable third-party decarbonization. \u2047 The Electric Highway Coalition will focus on development of a seamless network of rapid electric vehicle charging stations, connecting major highway systems from the Northeast to the Midwest down to Texas. \u2047 The goal is to create convenient options for long-distance EV travel to reduce range anxiety for consumers. \u2047 We also continue to expand investments in R&D needed to achieve net zero. \u2047 Our Kentucky Utilities recently announced a partnership to study the capture of carbon dioxide emissions. \u2047 The partnership with the University of Kentucky Center for Applied Energy Research, or CAER, will seek to develop cost-effective, scalable technology to capture carbon dioxide from a natural gas combined cycle plant. \u2047 We'll be working with CAER and using the carbon capture infrastructure we've already built at our Brown coal facility in 2014 to simulate emissions from a natural gas plant. \u2047 The project will also support a study aimed at direct air capture of CO2, potentially creating a negative emissions power plant. \u2047 In addition to capturing CO2, the system aims to produce two value-added streams, hydrogen and oxygen, that can be sold to offset the cost of capturing and storing the CO2. \u2047 Additional partners in this R&D initiative include Vanderbilt University and EPRI and GTI through their low carbon resources initiative. \u2047 The carbon capture unit we've built at the Brown plant is one of only a few carbon capture systems in operation today at power plants in the United States. \u2047 Furthering our R&D-related efforts, PPL recently acquired an ownership interest in the SOO Green project, a 350-mile underground transmission project that seeks to connect the MISO and PJM power markets and support growing demand for clean energy. \u2047 We recognize that expanding the nation's transmission grid will be critical to connecting more wind and solar power and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \u2047 Breaking through siting, permitting and other barriers to build this transmission quickly and cost effectively will be key. \u2047 SOO Green seeks to tackle these challenges by developing high-voltage transmission lines underground along major rail corridors. \u2047 PPL's investment in the SOO Green project will enable us to gain valuable insight into this innovative approach. \u2047 We look forward to lending our capabilities and transmission expertise to support this project's success. \u2047 Turning to Slide 7. \u2047 On October 19, LG&E and KU submitted their triennial joint Integrated Resource Plan to the Kentucky Public Service Commission. \u2047 The IRP provides the commission with information regarding our potential generation sources over the next 15 years to meet forecasted energy demand in a least cost manner. \u2047 The IRP is submitted for informational purposes and represents a moment-in-time look at ongoing resource planning, using current business assumptions and long-term forecasts. \u2047 LG&E and KU's 2021 IRP projects a significant reduction in coal's contribution to our generation mix, declining from over 80% of the expected electricity produced in 2021 to about half of the total power produced in 2036. \u2047 In our base case scenario for load and fuel prices, we show the retirement of nearly 2,000 megawatts of coal capacity as we economically advance a clean energy transition. \u2047 These projected retirements are consistent with the depreciation study filed in our last rate case, as well as the estimates used in developing our net zero goal announced last quarter. \u2047 The IRP base demand and base fuel price scenario envision solar power playing a growing role in meeting our customers' demand for energy over the next 15 years, accounting for nearly 20% of all the power we supply to our Kentucky customers by 2036. \u2047 This scenario shows an additional 2,100 megawatts of solar combined with 200 megawatts of battery storage, along with simple cycle gas units needed for reliability purposes by the end of the planning period to replace that 2,000 megawatts of expected coal plant retirements. \u2047 We've also added a high-case scenario to this slide, which reflects the implications of higher demand and higher fuel prices due to several factors. \u2047 Under the high-case scenario, we would expect there to be significantly more energy needed by 2036, requiring additional capacity. \u2047 Based on our assumptions, that would primarily be met with an additional 5,500 megawatts of incremental renewable and storage resources above the base case scenario through that time period. \u2047 Further, that would result in more than twice as much output from renewable resources by 2036, reflecting approximately 40% of generation output primarily replacing natural gas from the base case scenario. \u2047 We expect the next IRP, which will be filed in 2024, to be an extremely important plan based on the current timing of our next coal plant retirements, which are expected to begin again in 2024. \u2047 Moving to Slide 8. \u2047 On August 20, PPL Electric Utilities announced a constructive settlement with an alliance of industrial and municipal customers that had challenged the company's FERC-approved base transmission return on equity. \u2047 The settlement, which must be approved by FERC, would change PPL Electric's base ROE from 11.18% to 9.9% from May 2020 to May 2022 with the rate stepping up to 10% by June 2023. \u2047 The settlement also updates the equity component of PPL Electric's capital structure to be the lower of its actual equity component calculated in accordance with the formula rate template or 56%. \u2047 The settlement also allows PPL Electric to modify the current formula rate, which is based on a historic test year and move the company to a projected rate year. \u2047 Further, PPL's formula rate could also be modified to be based on the calendar year moving forward rather than the current rate year that begins June 1. \u2047 We expect these changes to help reduce regulatory lag as we continue to make additional investments in transmission infrastructure. \u2047 Overall, the settlement is expected to reduce net income by approximately $25 million to $30 million per year. \u2047 In other operational developments, our utilities continue to be recognized for our award-winning customer service and innovation. \u2047 PPL Electric Utilities and Kentucky Utilities were once again listed as two of the most trusted utility brands in the United States based on a recent study performed by human behavior firm Escalent. \u2047 The results of the study show that communications played a vital role in building brand trust between utilities and our customers in 2020 during the pandemic. \u2047 It was the third consecutive year PPL Electric received this recognition and the second consecutive year for Kentucky Utilities. \u2047 Also, the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies selected PPL Electric Utilities as a winner of one of their 2021 achievement awards for revolutionary work in vegetation management. \u2047 Trees are a common cause of outages. \u2047 Within PPL Electric Utility service territory, it's estimated that about a third of distribution outages over the past five years were caused by trees contacting overhead wires. \u2047 By using a new approach that leverages data analytics and other new technologies, PPL Electric Utilities found ways to trim and remove the right trees at the right times across 28,000 miles of overhead lines to help prevent outages. \u2047 This has led to improved reliability despite an increase in more severe weather without increasing overall vegetation management costs. \u2047 By using smart sensors that collect real-time information like wind speed and line temperature, operators can relieve transmission congestion and increase the electricity sent over those lines. \u2047 PPL Electric Utilities has been recognized for its leading-edge approach to integrating DLR into core operations and using data from the sensors to make prudent investment decisions. \u2047 And finally, we continue our efforts to support economic development in the regions we serve. \u2047 One recent major development in this area is Ford's announcement of plans to construct a $6 billion electric battery complex within our LG&E and KU service territory. \u2047 It is one of, if not the largest economic development announcement in Kentucky's history and will have far-reaching positive impacts on communities around the commonwealth. \u2047 In fact, 2021 has been a record year for Kentucky in terms of economic development growth with over $10 billion in new investments being announced within the state. \u2047 Other recent developments in addition to Ford's announcement include a $460 million investment by Toyota and a $450 million investment by GE at its Appliance Park in Louisville. \u2047 These decisions exemplify the strengths that Kentucky has to offer large industrial customers. \u2047 Specifically, we are known for exceptional reliability to deliver energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \u2047 Further, we have some of the lowest retail rates in the country, an important characteristic for large industrial customers and something we remain keenly focused on maintaining. \u2047 Kentucky also has the third lowest business cost"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly earnings per share $0.27.  \u2047  qtrly earnings
