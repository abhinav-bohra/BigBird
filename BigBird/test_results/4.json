{"article": ["Additionally, during this conference call, you will hear management make references to the estimated positive or negative impacts as a result of COVID-19 during the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 You'll also hear management make statements regarding intra-quarter business performance during the month of October. \u2047 Management is providing this commentary to provide the investment community with additional insights concerning trends, and these disclosures may not occur in subsequent quarters. \u2047 It's a pleasure to speak with you today, and I hope you're all keeping safe and well. \u2047 Overall, considering the environment we are operating in, we are pleased with our third quarter performance as it reflected the expected improvement in trends across many of our global product categories, led by a faster-than-expected recovery within our Interventional Urology business, and continued strength within our vascular access product sales. \u2047 While from a regional perspective, we saw particular strength within the Americas as the pace of recovery in the United States during the third quarter was encouraging. \u2047 Quarter three revenues was $628.3 million, which was down 4.1% as compared to the prior year period on a constant currency basis but far better than the 12% decline we experienced during the second quarter of the year. \u2047 The decline in year-over-year revenue is due to the impact of COVID-19, which we estimate caused a net negative impact of approximately $78 million, or approximately 12%. \u2047 If we were to normalize for the negative COVID impact, we estimate that our underlying business grew by approximately 8% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our quarter two revenue performance. \u2047 We also saw a significant sequential improvement within our adjusted gross and operating margins from the levels achieved during the second quarter. \u2047 With our adjusted earnings per share of $2.77 in the quarter meaningfully exceeded our internal expectations. \u2047 This reflects the continued recovery we saw as we moved through the quarter, coupled with prudent operating expense management. \u2047 Before I go into more detail on our quarterly financial performance, I am happy to announce that during the month of October, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Z-Medica, a market leader in hemostatic products. \u2047 We are pleased to be able to deploy capital for a differentiated product portfolio that leverages existing Teleflex call points and is immediately accretive to our revenue growth rates, adjusted growth and operating margin profile and to our adjusted earnings per share. \u2047 Turning to a more detailed review of our third quarter results. \u2047 As I just mentioned, quarter three revenue declined 4.1% on a constant currency basis and 3.1% on an as-reported basis. \u2047 The decline in revenue was due to COVID-19, which we estimate had a negative impact of approximately $81 million across several global product categories. \u2047 This was somewhat offset by approximately $3 million of additional revenue within our vascular access and other product categories, which experienced modestly higher-than-expected demand as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 From a margin perspective, we generated adjusted gross and operating margins of 57.2% and 25.1%, respectively. \u2047 This translated into a year-over-year decline of 140 basis points at the gross margin line and 190 basis points at the operating margin line. \u2047 That said, we saw a sequential improvement of 330 basis points on both the adjusted gross and operating margin lines as compared to the levels we achieved in the second quarter. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, reduced sales volumes due to COVID was a headwind. \u2047 However, it was partially offset by our cost containment efforts as we continue to tighten our belts where we deem appropriate in the current environment, balanced against continued investment to sustain our long-term growth aspirations. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $2.77, down 6.7% year-over-year but ahead of our internal expectations as the business continued to recover during the quarter. \u2047 When excluding the negative impact of COVID-19 had on our third quarter results, we estimate that our adjusted earnings per share would have grown approximately 13% as compared to the prior year period. \u2047 Overall, I am very pleased with our financial performance as it demonstrates the resiliency of our diversified global product portfolio. \u2047 Let's turn to a discussion on our quarterly revenue trends, which will be on a constant currency basis. \u2047 The Americas delivered revenues of $375 million in the third quarter, which represents an increase of 0.4%. \u2047 Growth within the Americas was driven by vascular access and respiratory products, which both saw elevated demand driven by COVID. \u2047 In addition, Interventional Urology was a strong contributor as UroLift continues to be one of the fastest recovering procedures. \u2047 However, there were offsets with declines in other product categories. \u2047 We estimate that the Americas would have grown approximately 9%, excluding the impact that COVID-19 had on the region. \u2047 EMEA reported revenues of $135.7 million in the third quarter, representing a decline of 7%. \u2047 During the quarter, declines occurred across most product categories as increasing COVID infection rates negatively impacted procedures and results. \u2047 Adjusting for COVID, we estimate an approximately 3% underlying decline for the region. \u2047 Revenues totaled $68.2 million in the third quarter, which represents a decline of 14.2%. \u2047 However, we estimate that we would have had positive constant currency revenue growth in the high single digits, if not for the impact of COVID-19. \u2047 Additionally, during the third quarter, we began transitioning a distributor in Japan. \u2047 When normalizing for both COVID and the distributor change, growth in the region would have been closer to the low double-digit range, consistent with our longer-term outlook. \u2047 And lastly, our OEM business reported revenues of $49.4 million in the third quarter, which was down 11.8% on a constant currency basis. \u2047 As we anticipated, during the third quarter, our OEM business saw a lagged impact related to COVID relative to our other businesses. \u2047 Investors familiar with Teleflex will be aware that our OEM business supplies medical companies with complex catheters and surgical sutures, and the quarter three impact reflects reduced orders from these customers, whose business is tied to non-emergent procedures. \u2047 Excluding the estimated COVID-19 impact, the business grew roughly 28%, which includes a benefit of approximately 11% from the acquisition of HPC. \u2047 As it relates to HPC, I am pleased to report that we remain on track with our integration efforts. \u2047 Let's now move to a discussion of our revenue by global product category. \u2047 Starting with vascular access. \u2047 Due to growth within both our PICC and EZ-IO products, third quarter revenue increased 6.8% to $160 million. \u2047 We estimate that COVID-19 positively impacted the growth rates of our vascular products during the third quarter by approximately 1%. \u2047 Moving to interventional access. \u2047 Third quarter revenue was $93.2 million, or down 13.5% as compared to the prior year period. \u2047 The decrease was largely due to the delay in the recovery of certain non-emerging procedures because of COVID-19, along with the negative impact stemming from a catheter recall that occurred during the quarter. \u2047 We estimate that the recall impacted our business negatively by approximately $4 million. \u2047 The impact on the recall will continue to linger for the next several quarters as we do not expect to be back on the market with this product until September of 2021. \u2047 When normalizing for the impact that COVID had on these product lines, we estimate that underlying growth was in the low single digits. \u2047 Revenue was $75.7 million, which is lower than the prior year by 14.4%. \u2047 The revenue decline was the result of lower sales of laryngeal masks, regional anesthesia and airway management products. \u2047 We estimate that COVID had an approximately 10% negative impact in the quarter, implying mid-single-digit declines for the business on an underlying basis. \u2047 Revenue declined by 12.3% to $82.2 million, driven by lower sales of our ligation and instrument product lines. \u2047 We estimate a 13% headwind from COVID during quarter three, indicating recovery as compared to the estimated 30% COVID headwind in quarter two. \u2047 Moving to Interventional Urology. \u2047 Quarter three revenue increased by 11% to $81.8 million. \u2047 We estimate an approximate 29% COVID-19-related headwind during quarter three. \u2047 Notwithstanding the significant headwind on our growth in quarter three, we are pleased with the path of recovery for this business unit and are also happy with the early impact of our national DTC campaign, which is exceeding our expectations. \u2047 Additionally, we are encouraged that we trained 120 new urologists in quarter three, moving to a cadence that is consistent with our expectations prior to COVID. \u2047 And finally, our other category, which consists of our respiratory and urology care products, grew 0.5%, totaling $86 million. \u2047 In large part, we estimate that growth during the quarter was due to increased demand for certain humidification and breathing products resulting from COVID-19. \u2047 From a monthly perspective, we note that September outperformed July and August when normalizing for the distributor termination and the product recall within our interventional business. \u2047 Furthermore, as we have progressed through the first few weeks of October, we continue to see additional modest improvements as compared to last October. \u2047 That said, due to the significant resurgence of COVID cases globally, and when normalizing for selling days, we expect to see a modest improvement in the constant currency revenue performance during quarter four as compared to the decline of 4% we achieved in quarter three. \u2047 Tom will provide more details later. \u2047 That completes my comments on quarter three revenue performance. \u2047 Turning to some recent clinical and commercial updates. \u2047 The response to our national DTC campaign is exceeding our expectations. \u2047 The strategic role of DTC is important as about half of the 12 million men being treated for BPH believe prescription medications are their only solution. \u2047 Thus far, we are tracking well against the target to generate six times the number of impressions from the regional campaigns in the year ago period. \u2047 Web traffic has increased over 150% since the launch and another encouraging metric is that multiple urologists are now motivated to get trained on UroLift as a result of patient requests due to the campaign. \u2047 In addition, while there was likely a nominal impact on quarter three results, we expect the momentum for the campaign to continue building into quarter four and early next year as we turn down the advertising full strength starting in early September. \u2047 Turning to UroLift two. \u2047 Since the FDA clearance on July 31, we have begun a market acceptance test and received positive preliminary feedback, including the streamlining of the delivery device triggering mechanism and the reduction of waste. \u2047 We are also increasing manufacturing levels for the product ahead of the full commercial launch slated for early in 2021. \u2047 Lastly, regarding the UroLift ATC. \u2047 We know that the market acceptance test is well under way, and we have received very positive feedback, which indicates that the device is delivering on the intended benefit of enhanced tissue controls when treating challenging anatomies such as obstructive median lobe. \u2047 Taken together, we see these efforts as helping to build momentum as we seek to further expand our leadership position in BPH. \u2047 Turning to the next slide on key commercial updates. \u2047 We recently received an expanded indication for EZ-IO as the device can now be used for up to 48 hours when our alternate intravenous access is not available in both adults and pediatric patients, 12 years and older. \u2047 While we do not expect a material sales uplift from this label expansion, we are always looking to improve our portfolio based on clinician feedback, and this is a prime example of those efforts. \u2047 Lastly, I'd like to provide the investment community with a few more details of the Z-Medica acquisition we announced last night. \u2047 In mid-October, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Z-Medica, an industry-leading manufacturer of hemostatic products. \u2047 Under the terms of the agreement, Teleflex will acquire Z-Medica, for an upfront payments totaling $500 million and up to an additional $25 million upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones. \u2047 As part of the transaction, Teleflex will also be acquiring certain tax attributes that are expected to result in future tax benefits. \u2047 We value these tax attributes at approximately $40 million, which we considered when arriving at our purchase price. \u2047 Z-Medica's hemostatic technologies are helping reinvent hemorrhagic control with cost-effective efficient bleeding control solutions being adopted by markets worldwide. \u2047 The company offers three main brands: QuikClot, Combat Gauze and QuikClot Control+, which utilize the proprietary technology consisting of gauss impregnated with calin. \u2047 The technology activates and accelerates the body's natural clotting ability. \u2047 Z-Medica's products currently focus on the trauma surgery, EMS, military, emergency departments and interventional segments with opportunities to expand into additional indications over time. \u2047 Teleflex's strategy is to invest in innovative products and technologies that can meaningfully enhance clinical efficacy, patient safety and comfort, reduce complications and lower the overall cost of care. \u2047 The acquisition of Z-Medica enables Teleflex to leverage strength in the hospital, EMS and military call points with the differentiated products that complement our EZ-IO and EZPlas product portfolio. \u2047 We are excited to announce this acquisition given its above company average revenue growth capabilities as well as its above company average gross and operating margin profile. \u2047 Pending the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of this year. \u2047 As we look forward, the transaction is expected to contribute between $60 million and $70 million of revenue and between $0.07 and $0.15 of adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2021. \u2047 Beyond 2021, we expect the acquisition to deliver a high single-digit revenue growth profile and further accretion to adjusted earnings per share. \u2047 After our recent meetings with the FDA, we determined to proceed with the BLA submission rather than an EUA. \u2047 We continue to work closely with the agency in determining the timing of that submission. \u2047 Overall, we continue to invest organically in clinical and commercial catalysts that will help to sustain our revenue growth aspirations in a normalized environment. \u2047 We will also look to augment those internal efforts through the deployment of capital for inorganic growth opportunities, such as Z-Medica. \u2047 Given the previous discussion of the company's revenue performance, I'll begin at the gross profit line. \u2047 For the quarter, adjusted gross profit was $359.6 million versus $380 million in the prior year quarter or a decrease of approximately 5%. \u2047 Adjusted gross margin totaled"],
