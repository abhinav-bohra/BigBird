{"article": ["We're pleased to be here today to provide an update on our progress after the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Hopefully, everyone has had a chance to review the news release we issued earlier today. \u2047 These risks include those related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken by governmental or regulatory authorities to combat the pandemic on our business and our operations as well as the business and operations of the consumer, our customers, suppliers, business partners and labor force. \u2047 These risks also include those detailed in our various filings with the SEC, which may be found on our website as well as in our news releases. \u2047 Given the short-term volatility of comparisons due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused our comparisons to 2019. \u2047 Please note that unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are to 2019 results that have been rebased to reflect the move of our European innerwear business to discontinued operations as well as the exited C9 program at mass and the DKNY intimate apparel license. \u2047 With me on the call today are Steve Bratspies, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Dastugue, our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 I can't express enough how grateful and proud I am of their dedication, their focus on safety and commitment to serving our consumers and customers under extremely challenging circumstances. \u2047 Our associates are our greatest strength, and I want to make sure they're recognized for all their hard work. \u2047 To that end, over the past month, I've finally been able to get out, see parts of the business and interact with some of our amazing associates. \u2047 I'm inspired by their commitment and talent. \u2047 There is a lot of excitement around our Full Potential plan and our associates are fully engaged. \u2047 I visited some of our retail stores and came away impressed by the knowledge of our associates and their energy around serving consumers. \u2047 And let me tell you, consumers are out shopping. \u2047 It was exciting to see high levels of traffic in our stores. \u2047 I also had the chance to tour our New York Design Center, spent time with that incredible team and see a wide range of innovative new products in our pipeline for both innerwear and activewear. \u2047 It's hard to believe it's been a year since my first day at HanesBrands. \u2047 Reflecting back, it's clear this is truly an amazing global company with a number of competitive advantages, iconic brands, distribution scale, owned manufacturing, a deep commitment to sustainability, a strong balance sheet and 61,000 passionate associates across more than 47 countries. \u2047 We've accomplished a lot in a relatively short period of time. \u2047 We refreshed the leadership team, which is setting a new pace and driving change. \u2047 We underwent a deep assessment of the business that not only highlighted competitive advantages I just mentioned, but also underscore the opportunities ahead of us and the changes we need to make. \u2047 We developed our Full Potential plan to unlock growth, which we shared with you in May, and we've taken action to simplify the portfolio, streamline decision-making and organize the business to optimize future growth. \u2047 We're still early in our journey. \u2047 However, I am encouraged by the progress we've made, and I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we execute our Full Potential plan to generate higher, more consistent levels of revenue and profit growth. \u2047 Today, I'll focus my remarks on two key topics. \u2047 First, our strong second quarter performance and our increased outlook for the remainder of the year; and second, a brief update on our Full Potential plan. \u2047 Looking at the second quarter, we delivered strong results despite the increasingly challenged global environment and higher levels of inflation. \u2047 Revenue, operating profit, operating margin and earnings per share all exceeded the high end of our guidance range. \u2047 We delivered strong operating cash flow performance in the quarter, and we further strengthened our balance sheet. \u2047 With the volatility from the pandemic impacting short-term comparability, like many of you, we are anchoring our comparisons to 2019. \u2047 For the quarter, sales and operating profit increased 15% and 14%, respectively, compared to the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 Revenue momentum continued to build across both our innerwear and activewear businesses globally. \u2047 In U.S. innerwear, sales were 19% higher than second quarter 2019. \u2047 Over this time period, we gained 160 basis points of market share with gains in each product category across basics and intimates. \u2047 In addition to the strong underlying performance of our brands, the category experienced above-average growth due to certain transitory items such as retailer inventory restocking, government stimulus and pent-up consumer demand. \u2047 In U.S. activewear, sales increased 15%, driven by growth in Champion. \u2047 We were pleased to see continued growth in Champion brand with global sales up 21% from 2019 levels. \u2047 And In International, sales were 11% higher than 2019 with double-digit growth in Champion and high single-digit growth in innerwear in spite of COVID headwinds around the world. \u2047 With respect to our outlook, we raised our second half and full year expectations for sales, operating profit and earnings per share to reflect stronger-than-expected momentum in our business as well as benefits from the Child Tax Credit Payments in the U.S. What's most encouraging to me about our second half outlook, despite higher-than-expected inflation, we're well positioned to generate higher operating profit dollars while continuing to execute against our brand investment strategy. \u2047 Investing in our brands is critical to the long-term success and health of our business, and we remain committed to it. \u2047 Now turning to the second topic, our Full Potential plan. \u2047 They were only in the early stages, we made progress in the quarter, and we're encouraged at how the plan is unfolding. \u2047 Without going through every initiative that we spoke to in May, let me provide a couple of updates. \u2047 With respect to our Champion growth initiative, in May, we told you we were going to do three things to grow the brand, grow our core sweats business, expand our women's and kids product offering and expand into adjacent categories. \u2047 In the U.S., we're introducing several new products in our core fleece category. \u2047 We've added a number of new performance and lifestyle products in our women's line. \u2047 And in footwear, in the first half, we've more than doubled our points of distribution and the number of pairs sold as compared to 2019. \u2047 We believe the initial momentum in our footwear business underscores the consumers' affinity for the Champion brand, and their brand interest across product categories. \u2047 We feel good about the momentum we're seeing in Champion and there's a lot to be about around the globe. \u2047 We remain confident in our Full Potential plan to grow this brand to $3 billion. \u2047 Looking at our U.S. innerwear initiative, we're encouraged by the underlying momentum and market share gains we've seen in both basics and intimates. \u2047 Our latest Boxer brief innovation, total support pouch, continues to perform well, with a dedicated marketing effort that targets consumers differently than we have in the past. \u2047 Total Support Pouch is attracting a younger consumer to the Hanes franchise. \u2047 We've significantly outpaced our initial sales projections. \u2047 And as we highlighted in May, we increased our second half marketing investment behind Total Support Pouch to build on our momentum. \u2047 In terms of our direct-to-consumer initiative, agile teams are deployed and driving improved site experience, conversion and speed as we continue the journey to know our consumers better. \u2047 We've increased our digital marketing investment at the top and bottom of the funnel with consistently better returns. \u2047 As a result, we're encouraged to see trends improving in certain digital metrics. \u2047 As compared to last year and 2019, conversion and average order value are both up. \u2047 The number and value of repeat consumers continues to increase across all of our brands. \u2047 Repeat consumers not only spend more they're an important indicator of consumer engagement. \u2047 While it's very early in our journey, we remain confident in the significant growth opportunity ahead. \u2047 Lastly, we're making progress on our cost savings initiatives. \u2047 As we mentioned in May, while we don't expect the savings and investments to match dollar for dollar in every period, we're confident that we can fully offset our investments over the course of our Full Potential plan. \u2047 We've identified a number of opportunities in SG&A and cost of goods. \u2047 For example, as we work through our SKU reduction initiative, one of the benefits is greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies as we produce fewer, more profitable SKUs. \u2047 We're also working on a number of multi-global initiatives or big ideas that can generate large year-over-year savings, things such as global vendor consolidation and raw material platform. \u2047 We feel good about the opportunities we are finding, and we'll continue to update you along the way. \u2047 Then I'll return with some closing comments. \u2047 I'm excited to be finishing up my first three months here at HanesBrands. \u2047 As I evaluated this opportunity, there were three things that really attracted me to HanesBrands, the people, the brands, and the Full Potential plan to capture future growth opportunities, all are exceeding my initial expectations. \u2047 It's great to be able to speak to such strong results on my first earnings call. \u2047 We exceeded the high end of our expectations across all of our key metrics, driven by continued top line momentum in both global innerwear and activewear businesses. \u2047 In my remarks today, I'll be comparing our results to the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 For the quarter as compared to 2019, sales increased 15% with double-digit growth in each of the segments. \u2047 Operating profit increased 14%, cash flow from operations increased 43% to $195 million, and our leverage improved to 2.9 times. \u2047 With that summary, let's turn to the details of the quarter's results. \u2047 Sales increased $233 million to $1.75 billion. \u2047 The impact from foreign exchange rates contributed approximately $26 million or 175 basis points to the quarter's growth. \u2047 Adjusted gross profit increased $102 million or 18% compared to 2019, while adjusted gross margin increased approximately 75 basis points to 39%. \u2047 The margin expansion was driven by leverage from higher sales, the benefit from product mix and the impact from foreign exchange rates. \u2047 These items more than offset the higher expedite cost and sourcing premiums we experienced to meet the stronger-than-expected demand in the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted operating profit increased $29 million or 14% to $236 million. \u2047 Adjusted operating margin of 13.5% was approximately 15 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 Higher investments in brand marketing essentially offset the fixed cost leverage from the higher sales. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 24% to $0.47, while GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $0.42. \u2047 Now let me take you through our segment performance. \u2047 U.S. innerwear sales increased 19% or $123 million over 2019 with comparable double-digit growth in both basics and intimates. \u2047 The growth was driven by two factors: first, the strong underlying performance of our brands, which resulted in market share gains across our basics and intimates product portfolios. \u2047 And second, the benefit of certain transitory items such as stimulus, restocking and pent-up consumer demand that drove category growth rates above historical levels. \u2047 For the quarter, innerwear operating margin of 23.8% was 150 basis points above 2019. \u2047 The margin improvement was driven by volume leverage and sales mix, which more than offset higher expedite cost and increased investments in brand marketing. \u2047 Turning to U.S. activewear. \u2047 Revenue increased 15% or $53 million driven by growth across the online, wholesale and distributor channels. \u2047 Our sports and college licensing business increased significantly from last year. \u2047 However, it remains below 2019 levels as on-campus attendance in the spring was still below pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Looking at Champion brand within the activewear segment, Champion increased 20% as compared to 2019. \u2047 Activewear's operating margin of 10.2% declined 290 basis points compared to 2019 as the leverage from higher sales was more than offset by higher expedite and distribution costs to meet the higher-than-expected demand as well as increased investments in brand marketing. \u2047 Switching to our International segment. \u2047 Revenue increased 11% compared to 2019. \u2047 On a constant currency basis, sales increased 5% or $22 million. \u2047 We experienced growth in Australia behind our Bonds brand. \u2047 We also saw growth in Europe and the Americas, while sales in Asia Pacific declined driven by ongoing COVID headwinds in Japan. \u2047 For the quarter, the International segment's operating margin of 12.9% was 250 basis points below 2019 levels, driven by increased investments in brand marketing as well as deleveraging Asia Pacific from lower sales. \u2047 Touching briefly on Champion in the quarter. \u2047 Global Champion sales increased 21% over 2019 on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis. \u2047 Champion sales in the U.S. which include all Champion brand sales in our activewear, innerwear and other segments increased 25%. \u2047 Champion sales in our International segment increased 15% on a reported basis and 9% in constant currency as compared to the second quarter 2019. \u2047 Turning to cash flow. \u2047 We generated $195 million of operating cash flow in the quarter driven by strong operating results and focused working capital management. \u2047 Looking at the balance sheet, inventory is coming down, our turns are improving, and we're on track with our SKU reduction initiative. \u2047 And our leverage at the end of the quarter improved to 2.9 times on a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA basis as compared to 3.7 times a year ago. \u2047 And now turning to guidance. \u2047 However, I'd like to share a few thoughts to frame our outlook. \u2047 Similar to our prior remarks, my guidance comparisons will be to 2019. \u2047 At a high level, we increased our second half guidance for sales, operating profit and earnings per share by $375 million, $35 million and $0.08, respectively, compared to our prior outlook. \u2047 And we have factored the following puts and takes of the current environment into our guidance. \u2047 First, we're staying committed to our strategy that we rolled out in May. \u2047 Long term, we believe it's the right thing to do for our business and our brands. \u2047 We're going to continue to increase the investment behind our brands, and we're excited about the consumer reaction that we're getting. \u2047 Second, we see stronger-than-expected demand in both our innerwear and activewear businesses, which is being further fueled by the benefits from the recent Child Tax Credit Payments in the U.S. And third,"], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.47 from continuing
