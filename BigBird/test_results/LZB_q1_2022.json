{"article": ["Melinda will open and close the call, and Bob will speak to segment performance and the financials midway through. \u2047 We'll then open the call to questions. \u2047 Although we believe these statements to be reasonable, our actual results could differ materially. \u2047 The most significant risk factors that could affect our future results are described in our annual report on 10-K -- on Form 10-K. \u2047 We encourage you to review those risk factors as well as other key information detailed in our SEC filings. \u2047 With that, I'll now turn over the call to Melinda Whittington, La-Z-Boy's President and Chief Executive Officer. \u2047 Across the La-Z-Boy enterprise, we delivered all-time record high sales of $525 million, making and selling more furniture in the quarter than we ever have in modern history, even with production running only 12 weeks in the quarter, due to our annual one week maintenance shutdown in July, versus 13 weeks in most quarters. \u2047 Demand across all businesses also remained high and backlog remains at record levels. \u2047 Written same-store sales for the La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries network increased 10% versus the prior year quarter, and has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 13% across the last two years since pre-pandemic, demonstrating the continued strength of demand for our La-Z-Boy branded products. \u2047 Written same-store sales for our Company-owned Retail segment increased 22% versus the prior year period, and at a compounded annual growth rate of 16% over the last two years. \u2047 And Joybird continued on its strong growth journey writing 31% more business than in last year's first quarter and growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 35% across the last two years. \u2047 On the manufacturing front, we continued to increase capability to build and deliver more furniture to better service continued strong demand, and are in the process of increasing our cell count across the La-Z-Boy branded business. \u2047 And also during the quarter, we continued to return value to shareholders with a dividend payment and $36 million of share repurchases, and we've recently expanded our repurchase authorization. \u2047 At the same time, we are experiencing challenges in our wholesale business. \u2047 We continue to have inefficiencies at the plant level, as we open additional upholstery capacity and hire, train and work to retain what is currently about one-third more workers versus pre-pandemic. \u2047 And we are continuing to invest to increase flexible capacities due the remainder of this fiscal year in order to work through our backlog. \u2047 Also, as expected, we experienced significant short term margin compression on the wholesale business, primarily due to higher raw material and freight costs, which have risen at unprecedented rates and speed over an extended period. \u2047 As we've talked previously, we made the decision to not take action on the backlog with our first four rounds of price increases since the pandemic began. \u2047 With wait times extending up to seven months for the La-Z-Boy branded business, that has resulted in delayed recognition of those price increases until they work their way through to our delivered sales. \u2047 But looking to the future, during the quarter, we also made several strategic decisions to take us through this unprecedented period and ensure we emerge stronger, post pandemic. \u2047 Recognizing the commodity prices are expected to remain at the highest levels in recent history, in July, we took our fifth price increase since the pandemic began, but this time also took a surcharge on our backlog. \u2047 Given the unparalleled nature of rising material costs, we are asking our business partners to share in the financial impact during a period where we are all experiencing record demand. \u2047 Since our first price increase last October, cumulative price increases and surcharges, now add up to the high-teens versus pre-pandemic. \u2047 Second, on the practical side, our procurement team has significantly increased inventory for key component parts to minimize future supply disruptions and ensure a steady stream of furniture is manufactured and delivered. \u2047 Third, we launched Project Century[Phonetic], our long-term strategic path for strong growth and profitability as we head toward our centennial anniversary in 2027. \u2047 At a high level, key components include a focus on growing market share for our strong consumer brands, specifically La-Z-Boy and Joybird. \u2047 In an extremely fragmented industry, the iconic La-Z-Boy brand enjoys an unparalleled identity for comforting quality, while being a leader in motion. \u2047 We believe we can fully leverage these attributes to grow our business, and will invest to expand our reach to a broad range of consumers including younger consumers through consumer insights, product innovation, new experiences and messaging. \u2047 At the same time, we will continue to expand and strengthen our omnichannel presence. \u2047 We will offer a state-of-the-art e-commerce experience and a strong brick and mortar footprint to ensure we easily reach consumers wherever they prefer to shop. \u2047 And now that we have a sustainably profitable direct to consumer model with Joybird, we'll increase investment to expand consumer awareness and accelerate profitable growth. \u2047 At the same time, we'll enhance Joybird's omnichannel offering by opening additional small footprint brick and mortar stores in high traffic urban areas. \u2047 Our first three stores in Brooklyn, Chicago and Washington DC have met with great success, and there is exciting potential for additional stores, including one in Los Angeles planned to open in the fall. \u2047 As the final pillar of Project Century, we'll enhance our corporate capabilities and leverage the balance of the enterprise portfolio to efficiently support these initiatives and over time enable the potential for tack-on acquisitions that can benefit from our supply chain expertise and accelerate the La-Z-Boy Incorporated growth story. \u2047 With these initiatives in place, over time, we envision sales growth outpacing industry averages while delivering industry-leading margins as we complete our first century in 2027. \u2047 As a reminder, we present our results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, fiscal '22 first quarter sales increased 84% to a record $525 million, reflecting strong demand, capacity increases, and a comparison to the fiscal '21 first quarter when we restarted our plants at reduced capacity after a month-long shutdown and most retailers were closed for a portion of the quarter due to COVID-19. \u2047 Sequentially, from fiscal '21 Q4, first quarter sales increased even with our annual one week maintenance shutdown in July. \u2047 Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 first quarter, sales increased 27% for a compounded annual growth rate of about 13%. \u2047 Consolidated GAAP operating income increased to $34 million and non-GAAP operating income increased to $35 million. \u2047 Consolidated GAAP operating margin was 6.5% and non-GAAP operating margin was 6.6% reflecting expected significant short-term pressure on wholesale margins as the realization of previously announced pricing actions trailed escalating input costs, and we continue to invest in capacity expansion. \u2047 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54 for the fiscal 2022 first quarter versus $0.10 in the prior quarter. \u2047 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.55 in the current year quarter versus $0.18 in last year's first quarter. \u2047 My comments from here will focus on our non-GAAP reporting unless specifically stated otherwise. \u2047 I will now turn to a result -- to a review of our results by segment. \u2047 Demand for product across all businesses remains robust. \u2047 Starting with our wholesale segment, delivered sales for the quarter grew 76% to $393 million compared with the prior year period, compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 first quarter, sales were 23% higher for a compounded annual growth rate of 11%. \u2047 Non-GAAP operating margin for the wholesale segment was 4.7%, reflecting expected gross margin pressure as raw material and freight cost increases outpaced the realization of previously announced pricing actions and we continue to invest in bringing online new capacity. \u2047 Now let me turn to the retail segment, which produced excellent results. \u2047 For the quarter, delivered sales doubled, increasing 100% to our first quarter record of $182 million and delivered same-store sales increased 92% versus the year ago quarter, which was impacted by COVID. \u2047 Compared with the pre-pandemic fiscal '20, first quarter, sales increased 27% for a compounded annual growth rate of 13%, reflecting strong execution at the store level. \u2047 Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 11.2%, another first quarter record, driven primarily by fixed cost leverage on the higher delivered sales volume. \u2047 Last year's first quarter margin was negative 6.8% with the period marked by a significant reduction in delivered sales due to delays in product deliveries and COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns in April as well as retail closures, with some stores closures extending into June. \u2047 As Melinda noted, we are continuing to invest in the La-Z-Boy Furniture Gallery store system with new stores, remodels and relocations. \u2047 We have approximately 25 project scheduled this fiscal year for the Company-owned stores, out of a total of approximately 35 projects across the network. \u2047 Additionally, we are pleased to announce that earlier this week, we closed on the acquisition of three stores on Long Island, New York and look forward to expanding and strengthening the business there. \u2047 Sales for Joybird which was reported in corporate and other, increased 188% to $39 million, almost tripling from the prior year first quarter. \u2047 From the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 first quarter, delivered sales increased 125% for a compounded annual growth rate of about 50%, reflecting Joybird's strong positioning in the direct-to-consumer marketplace as well as excellent end-to-end execution by the team. \u2047 For the period, Joybird increased its gross margin primarily from higher sales volume, product pricing actions, and increase in average ticket, and synergies due to its integration into our broader supply chain. \u2047 It also experienced increased conversion on the website and a significant increase in retail store traffic. \u2047 We have achieved sustained, structural profitability at Joybird, and will continue to increase our marketing spend to expand awareness, improve customer acquisition and accelerate growth. \u2047 Pulling all this together, consolidated non-GAAP gross margin for the fiscal '22 first quarter decreased 270 basis points versus the prior year quarter, primarily driven by significant increases in commodity and freight costs, in addition to start-up costs associated with the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and labor challenges on our wholesale businesses. \u2047 These items were partially offset by changes in our consolidated sales mix driven by the faster growth of retail and Joybird which carry a higher gross margin than our wholesale businesses, and from an improved gross margin performance at Joybird. \u2047 Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of sales for the quarter decreased 620 basis points, primarily reflecting fixed cost leverage on the higher sales volume, mainly in our retail segment. \u2047 Our effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the fiscal '22 first quarter was 25.9% versus 19.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. \u2047 The increase in our effective tax rate for this year's first quarter versus last year's first quarter was primarily due to additional tax benefits from stock compensation in fiscal 2021 which did not occur in fiscal 2022. \u2047 Absent discrete adjustments, our effective tax rate would have been 25.3% and 26.1% in the first quarters of fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively. \u2047 We expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal 2022 year to be between 25.5% and 26.5%. \u2047 Turning to cash, we generated $6 million in cash from operating activities in the quarter. \u2047 We invested $39 million in higher inventory levels to protect against supply chain disruptions and support increased production in delivered sales. \u2047 Additionally, during the quarter, we made seasonal incentive compensation payments related to the last fiscal year. \u2047 We also spent $19 million in capital, primarily related to improvements to our retail stores, upgrades at our manufacturing and distribution facilities, new upholstery manufacturing capacity in Mexico, and technology upgrades. \u2047 We ended the period with $336 million in cash and no debt compared with $337 million in cash at the end of fiscal 2021 first quarter, which included $50 million in cash proactively drawn on our credit facility. \u2047 In addition, we held $33 million in investments to enhance returns on cash, compared with $16 million last year. \u2047 Regarding cash returned to shareholders, during the quarter we continued to aggressively buy back shares, spending $36 million repurchasing more than 900,000 shares of stock in the open market under our existing, authorized share repurchase program. \u2047 Over the past two quarters, we have returned $79 million to shareholders via share repurchase. \u2047 We also paid $7 million in dividends to shareholders in the last quarter. \u2047 Earlier this week, demonstrating its confidence in the Company's ability to grow profitably and continue to generate strong cash flow from operations, the Board of Directors approved an increase of 6.5 million shares to the Company's existing share repurchase authorization, with a 2.5 million shares available for repurchase under the program as of the end of the fiscal 2022 first quarter. \u2047 This increase brings the total share repurchase authorization to $9 million, representing approximately -- I'm sorry, 9 million shares, representing approximately 20% of shares outstanding. \u2047 This equates to approximately $320 million at Monday's closing stock price. \u2047 The Company expects to execute the repurchase program over a three year to four year period, subject to market conditions, operational performance, cash flow from operations, cash balances, potential M&A activity and other business investments. \u2047 Additionally, the Board approved a dividend of $0.15 per share to shareholders of record as of September 2nd, 2021. \u2047 As we look to the future, from a capital allocation perspective, over the long term, we will target to invest approximately half of operating cash flow back into the business primarily via capex and M&A, and return the remainder to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. \u2047 Before turning the call back to Melinda, let me highlight several important items for the remainder of fiscal 2022. \u2047 As noted, demand trends remained strong across the business and remain significantly higher than pre-COVID levels. \u2047 With robust written order trends, our backlog remains at a record level setting us up for a strong year of shipments as we continue to increase production capacity sequentially each quarter. \u2047 We improved product mix capability and worked through our wholesale and retail backlogs. \u2047 While raw material and freight cost prices remain high and global supply chain disruptions continue, pricing actions taken to date including the recent surcharge on our backlog will begin to flow through our numbers in Q2. \u2047 As a result, we expect to finish the fiscal year with a consolidated full year non-GAAP operating margin at or near double digits, more consistent with our performance in the fiscal"],
