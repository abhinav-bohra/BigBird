{"article": ["Today we'll discuss the financial performance of KAR Global for the quarter ended June 30 2021. \u2047 And after concluding our commentary we'll take questions from participants. \u2047 Let me also mention that throughout this conference call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 I will also go into some detailed vehicle supply dynamics in our industry and what we can expect to see over the rest of this year and into 2022. \u2047 And I will also provide updates on the continued growth of our dealer-to-dealer platforms BacklotCars and TradeRev the solid performance of our finance business AFC and our continued diligence and management of a KAR's overall cost structure. \u2047 So I'll start with the second quarter. \u2047 I was pleased with our second quarter performance particularly given the supply headwinds in our industry. \u2047 Despite operating in an environment of very constrained vehicle supply especially from commercial sellers we achieved the following results. \u2047 For KAR overall we generated $585 million in revenue an increase of 40% from Q2 of last year. \u2047 We generated total gross profit of $252 million which represents 51.7% of revenue excluding purchased vehicles. \u2047 We generated $116.5 million of adjusted EBITDA which was a 46% increase compared to Q2 of last year. \u2047 We had another strong quarter of cash generation. \u2047 Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $131 million. \u2047 Within the ADESA segment we facilitated the sale of 711000 vehicles representing for $11 billion in gross auction proceeds. \u2047 53% of our Q2 sales were from off-premise locations. \u2047 That was similar to our experience during Q1. \u2047 We sold 119000 vehicles on the TradeRev and BacklotCars platforms on a combined basis. \u2047 This represents our strongest performance to date in our digital dealer-to-dealer marketplace. \u2047 It represents a growth of 65% compared to Q2 of last year and sequential growth of 19% versus Q1. \u2047 I continue to be encouraged by our performance as part of the business. \u2047 We generated $277 in gross profit per vehicle sold in the ADESA segment. \u2047 That represented an increase from the $264 in Q1. \u2047 SG&A for KAR overall was $140 million for the quarter. \u2047 SG&A for the ADESA segment was $131 million which was down $9 million from Q1 resulting in SG&A of $185 per vehicle sold. \u2047 So I'd now like to speak about the supply dynamics of used vehicles within our marketplaces the headwinds that we faced in Q2 and why I believe the medium and longer-term outlook is much more encouraging. \u2047 In our last earnings call I mentioned that KAR was operating in an environment of constrained vehicle supply across the wholesale used vehicle market particularly in regard to volumes being offered by commercial sellers. \u2047 I said that the root causes varied but they all originated with the COVID pandemic. \u2047 Those supply constraints worsened during Q2 and they represented a significant headwind to our performance during the quarter. \u2047 That's why I'm encouraged by our performance in spite of those headwinds. \u2047 I also believe there's increasing evidence that we're now at the bottom of the cycle and that we should expect to see some recovery in those commercial volumes. \u2047 And when that happens it should be a very positive thing for KAR. \u2047 To help explain all of this I'd like to look back to Q2 of 2019 and to what a more normal supply dynamic looks like for our company and our industry pre-COVID. \u2047 So in Q2 of 2019 KAR facilitated a sale of 994000 vehicles. \u2047 Over 70% of those approximately 700000 vehicles were sold by commercial sellers. \u2047 The remainder which was approximately 275000 vehicles were sold by dealer sellers. \u2047 So from that statistic alone we can see that historically commercial sellers have represented the majority of KAR's used vehicle supply over 70%. \u2047 This is more so than our industry overall which is more like 50-50. \u2047 One challenge that KAR has faced over the past few quarters is that those commercial seller volumes have been under much greater pressure than the dealer volumes for reasons I will discuss here in a moment. \u2047 I believe that pressure is cyclical in nature and I believe that we are now at the bottom of that cycle. \u2047 During Q2 of this year the volume sold on behalf of commercial sellers was approximately 420000 vehicles a decline of over 40% versus Q2 of 2019. \u2047 So that's a significant and painful decline. \u2047 However a key question is how does that compare to the market overall? \u2047 A good basis for comparison is to look at the total volume of vehicles sold by commercial sellers at all U.S. auctions that is at ADESA and its competitors. \u2047 This data is published by Auctionet. \u2047 In Q2 of 2021 the volume of vehicles sold by commercial sellers at all U.S. auctions was down by 48% versus Q2 of 2019 in our industry according to Auctionet. \u2047 Based on that statistic KAR's decline in total commercial volume across all channels was less than the industrywide decline in commercial vehicles at U.S. auctions. \u2047 So that tells me that we did not lose share with these commercial sellers. \u2047 Our performance in Q2 should be judged against what I would consider to be historically low industry volumes of vehicle supply from commercial sellers. \u2047 And viewed through that lens I am pleased with the performance. \u2047 I also mentioned that there is evidence that we're currently at the bottom of the cycle. \u2047 The dynamics relating to off-lease vehicles repossessed vehicles and rental vehicles all point to an improving commercial supply picture over time. \u2047 I believe that when this happens it will be very positive for KAR given our digital shift our streamlined operations and our resulting lower cost structure. \u2047 And I'd like to go through that in a little bit more detail. \u2047 I'm going to start with off-lease vehicles. \u2047 KAR sells significant volumes of off-lease vehicles through OPENLANE and also at ADESA. \u2047 The volume of off-lease vehicles flowing through both of these marketplaces has been severely impacted by the disruption to new car production brought on by the shortage in semiconductors. \u2047 In the face of this supply shortage of new vehicles market values for used off-lease vehicles have increased by as much as 40% versus one year ago. \u2047 This means that consumers now have considerably more equity in their off-lease vehicles than at any point in history. \u2047 Based on our internal analysis the average equity in an off-lease vehicle increased to an all-time high of close to $8000 per vehicle in Q2 and that was up from an average of less than zero two years ago. \u2047 This makes lessees much less likely to return the vehicle from the lease sense. \u2047 And if the lessee does return the vehicle it makes it much more likely that the grounding dealer will purchase the vehicle since many grounding dealers have a contractual option to purchase the vehicle at residual value. \u2047 We saw both of these trends in Q2. \u2047 The positive equity situation for lessees resulted in a reduction of over 50% in off-lease vehicles being returned versus what we would normally expect. \u2047 For those vehicles that were returned we saw upstream conversion reach an all-time high of approximately 80% in Q2. \u2047 So while we enjoy nearly 80% market share in the upstream off-lease segment in North America a record number of vehicles were kept up by consumers where we received no fees or by the grounding dealers where we generate lower revenue. \u2047 The results of both of these changes was that considerably fewer vehicles flow deeper into the marketing process where they would have generated stronger economics. \u2047 So as we look ahead we believe that the semiconductor production issues are now being addressed and we expect production of new vehicles to start to improve starting in the second half of this year. \u2047 While we believe it will take time ultimately this increased production will drive a normalization in supply and demand and a moderation in used vehicle values. \u2047 This should in turn result in increased volumes of off-lease vehicles being returned and processed through our private label platforms and flowing into our higher-margin channels like adesa.com and our on-premise sales. \u2047 But clearly this will take time. \u2047 In the meantime we also know that lease originations continue to be strong meaning that off-lease vehicles will continue to be a strong source of supply for our industry well into the future. \u2047 The second category of vehicles is repossessed vehicles. \u2047 We sell a significant of repossessed vehicles at ADESA given the large number of banks and lenders in our commercial seller portfolio. \u2047 In just about every prior economic dislocation event our industry has experienced an increase in repossession volume. \u2047 However this did not happen during the COVID pandemic and I believe that the unprecedented level of government stimulus served to avert it. \u2047 Government stimulus coupled with other consumer protections has meant that consumers could continue to make their monthly payments and avoid repossession. \u2047 In Q2 based on our data repossession volume across our industry continued to be about 35% below what we would consider to be normal levels. \u2047 Looking ahead after the current wave of government stimulus ends I think it's reasonable to expect that repossession volumes will trend back toward normal levels over time and that our volumes in that segment should correspondingly improve. \u2047 And finally there are rental vehicles. \u2047 We have less exposure to this category but we still have a meaningful customer base in the segment and this segment offers us an opportunity for volume and profit when the rental market strengthens. \u2047 Rental supply within our wholesale marketplaces was very close to zero during Q2. \u2047 In fact a number of rental companies were actively buying used vehicles within our marketplaces because they were unable to source new vehicles from motor manufacturers owing to the semiconductor shortage. \u2047 The post-COVID increase in travel has caused rental car companies to start rebuilding their fleets. \u2047 I take this as a positive signal for our industry and our company. \u2047 since it points to return toward normal at some point in the future. \u2047 So as we look to all of these three segments off-lease repo and rental I believe that the fundamentals lead us to conclude that compared to our Q2 experience we should expect to see considerably increased volumes over time. \u2047 The key question is when will this happen and to what extent? \u2047 My best assessment is that it will take time but there are some key factors that we're watching that may be predicted. \u2047 The most significant factor in my mind is new vehicle production. \u2047 We're also monitoring used vehicle values and seeing the unprecedented high prices starting to moderate and even decline a little. \u2047 Lower used vehicle prices will help drive more off-lease supply into our marketplaces. \u2047 Finally we are monitoring for any further government stimulus and its impact on the repossession market. \u2047 So now I'd like to provide an update on our progress in the dealer vehicle category. \u2047 We sold 292000 dealer vehicles in Q2 of this year. \u2047 That was an increase of 6% versus the 276000 dealer-owned vehicles that we sold in Q2 of 2019. \u2047 Even if we were to include backlog cars in the 2019 number our total dealer volumes have increased versus Q2 of that year. \u2047 So our total dealer volumes have now recovered back to what we would consider normal and I'm pleased that we're showing modest growth. \u2047 If we look at the digital dealer category only Q2 represented our strongest performance yet with 119000 vehicles sold representing year-over-year growth of 65%. \u2047 And by the way that includes BacklotCars volumes in the prior year number. \u2047 I was pleased with this performance. \u2047 Q2 represented our first full quarter in the U.S. where we had migrated to the BacklotCars platform. \u2047 We saw record numbers of participating sellers and buyers and increased volumes of vehicles posted for sale. \u2047 Although these higher volumes of vehicles posted were offset by a slightly weakening conversion as the quarter progressed due to the high used vehicle value trends that I talked about earlier. \u2047 In Canada our TradeRev business performed very well in Q2. \u2047 It delivered strong volumes and strong profitability. \u2047 The fact that TradeRev has delivered profitability in Canada which is a more mature digital dealer-to-dealer market makes me encouraged for our prospects in the U.S. market and at an even greater scale. \u2047 Our own analysis of the trends in both the U.S. and Canadian markets also demonstrates that our offerings are helping us address a segment of vehicles that was not coming to our auctions in the past. \u2047 We are attracting new sellers and new buyers on a daily basis and this reinforces our belief that the digital solution expands the total addressable market available to our business. \u2047 I'd like to spend a few moments talking about our cost structure. \u2047 Over the last several calls we have discussed our strategic focus on reducing our cost structure to reflect our transition to a digital marketplace company. \u2047 The lower volumes in Q2 coupled with the high percentage of offsite sales continue to reinforce the need for KAR to be very focused on its operating model and its cost structure. \u2047 So delivering that level of performance in that environment reflects our focus on operations and costs. \u2047 I believe that this focus is reflected in our strong gross profit performance in the quarter both as a percentage of net revenue and also in terms of the gross profit per vehicle sold. \u2047 Our cost focus has also been reflected in the close management of our SG&A. \u2047 This management of costs has enabled the business to deliver a stronger operating performance off of lower volumes. \u2047 Over the course of the quarter we've also identified further savings opportunities principally relating to SG&A. \u2047 These have now been acted on or are in the process of being addressed. \u2047 I also believe that as we look to the future there will be opportunities to further refine our processes increasing our efficiency improving the customer experience and reducing our costs going forward and this will continue to be a focus. \u2047 I want to stress however that these reductions have not come and will not come at the cost of strategic investments or of our customer commitments. \u2047 We continue to invest in the technology the people and infrastructure necessary to extend our lead in the digital transformation and position our company for long-term growth. \u2047 Finally I'd like to provide some updates relating to our finance business AFC. \u2047 I've been pleased with AFC's performance in the present quarter but also over the past 18 months since the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 AFC continues to have healthy margins with gross profit for the quarter right at 80% and with SG&A of under 13% of revenue. \u2047 In terms of its key metrics AFC had 356000 loan transactions in the quarter. \u2047 This was in line with the levels that we had expected. \u2047 Revenue per loan transaction was strong at $193 for the quarter. \u2047 Key drivers of this were higher vehicle values and lower risk levels. \u2047 And finally speaking of risk we continue to experience lower-than-expected risks driven by current market conditions combined with strong operating processes at"], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted operating earnings per share $0.15."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 adjusted
