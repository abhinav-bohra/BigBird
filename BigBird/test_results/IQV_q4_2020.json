{"article": ["Mark will review our second quarter results, provide our outlook for the remainder of 2021 and discuss our diamides business. \u2047 Andrew will provide an overview of select financial items. \u2047 Information presented represents our best judgment based on today's understanding. \u2047 Actual results may vary based upon these risks and uncertainties. \u2047 Today's discussion and the supporting materials will include references to adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cash from operations, free cash flow and organic revenue growth, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Please note that as used in today's discussion, earnings means adjusted earnings and EBITDA means adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 A reconciliation and definition of these terms as well as other non-GAAP financial terms to which we may refer during today's conference call are provided on our website. \u2047 Our second quarter results, revenue up 8%, EBITDA up 2% and earnings per share up 5% year-over-year were slightly ahead of our guidance. \u2047 These results were fundamentally driven by volume, reflecting robust demand for FMC products around the world. \u2047 Innovation continues to be a catalyst for growth. \u2047 New products introduced in the last 12 months contributed $30 million in sales growth in the quarter and our plant health products, including biologicals, posted Q2 sales growth in the high teens. \u2047 We continue to expect a very strong second half of 2021, driven by robust volume growth. \u2047 We have lowered our full year earnings guidance due to the continued acceleration of raw material, packaging and logistics costs. \u2047 We will go into this in more details later. \u2047 I'd like to take a moment to provide a COVID-19 update on our business. \u2047 All our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed. \u2047 Our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic. \u2047 We are resuming in-office operations work permitted by local authorities. \u2047 And in June, we introduced flexible work arrangements to facilitate the return of all our staff to our headquarters in Philadelphia as well as some other locations in adherence with local guidelines. \u2047 Turning to our Q2 results on slide three. \u2047 We reported $1.2 billion in second quarter revenue, which reflects an 8% increase on a reported basis and a 4% increase organically. \u2047 Asia and Latin America posted the largest growth of 20% and 15%, respectively. \u2047 Our fungicides grew over 50% in the quarter, driven by the Xyway launch in the U.S., and fungicides represented 8% of total sales in Q2 versus 5% of our sales in the prior year period. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $347 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period and $2 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. \u2047 EBITDA margins were 28%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of continued and accelerating cost headwinds. \u2047 Adjusted earnings were $1.81 per diluted share in the quarter, an increase of 5% versus Q2 2020 and also $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. \u2047 The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the increases in EBITDA and lower interest expense. \u2047 Moving now to slide four. \u2047 Despite the unfavorable weather conditions in several regions, Q2 revenue increased by 8% versus the prior year, driven by a 4% volume increase and a 4% tailwind from foreign currencies. \u2047 Pricing was essentially flat year-over-year. \u2047 Sales in Asia increased 20% year-over-year and 13% organically, driven by double-digit growth in India, Australia, Indonesia and Pakistan. \u2047 Insecticides contributed the greatest growth, including Altacor for cotton, and herbicide sales were also very strong, driven by share gains in India for soybean and sugarcane applications as well as robust sales in Australia. \u2047 In Latin America, sales increased 15% year-over-year and 12% organically. \u2047 Mexico and Colombia each posted double-digit growth, driven by strength of our products on specialty crops. \u2047 We also had a shift of diamide partner sales to Latin America from North America, similar to what occurred in Q1, which boosted the year-over-year growth rate. \u2047 EMEA sales increased 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% organically as FX was a significant tailwind in the period. \u2047 Diamides grew well, and we saw strong sales of herbicides for cereals and sugar beets. \u2047 However, this wasn't enough to offset the late start of the spring, which resulted in lost applications for the FMC portfolio that will not be regained during the season. \u2047 In North America, sales decreased 7% year-over-year and 8% organically. \u2047 Similar to Q1, the year-over-year sales decline in Q2 was due to the shift of diamide partner sales from North America to other regions. \u2047 Excluding revenue from our global diamide partnerships, our U.S. and Canada crop business grew greater than 20%, driven by an approximate $25 million contribution from two new products, Xyway fungicide and Vantacor insect control for specialty crops. \u2047 Turning now to the second quarter EBITDA bridge on slide five. \u2047 EBITDA in the quarter was up 2% year-over-year due to the volume contribution of $42 million, largely offset by a $35 million cost headwind. \u2047 The cost headwind continues to be driven by increases in raw material, packaging and logistic costs and the very modest reversal of some of the temporary cost savings from 2020. \u2047 Pricing was essentially flat versus prior year. \u2047 Turning to our view of the overall market conditions for 2021. \u2047 We now expect the global crop protection market will be up mid-single digits on a U.S. dollar basis, which is slightly higher than our prior forecast and the most bullish we've been on the overall market for the past few years. \u2047 The reason for the change is our view that the Latin American market will now grow in the high single digits versus low single digits before. \u2047 Basic crop fundamentals remain strong, especially in that region. \u2047 We continue to anticipate mid-single-digit growth in the EMEA market, low to mid-single-digit growth in the Asian market and low single-digit growth in the North American market. \u2047 Turning to slide six and the review of FMC's full year 2021 and Q3, Q4 earnings outlook. \u2047 FMC full year 2021 earnings are now expected to be in the range of $6.54 to $6.94 per diluted share, a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. \u2047 This is down $0.31 at the midpoint versus our prior forecast. \u2047 Consistent with past practice, we do not factor in any benefit from future potential share repurchases in our earnings per share guidance. \u2047 Our 2021 revenue forecast remains in the range of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% at the midpoint versus 2020. \u2047 EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.35 billion, representing a 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. \u2047 This is a $50 million reduction at the midpoint compared to our prior forecast due to continued acceleration costs for raw materials, packaging and logistics. \u2047 This includes spending more to procure certain raw materials and intermediates from alternate sources where there is limited availability at our preferred suppliers. \u2047 Despite dry and cold conditions in certain parts of Brazil during Q2, we are bullish for the second half in Latin America, especially for soybeans and cotton. \u2047 In Brazil, our channel inventories are at more normal levels for this point in the season following the actions we took in Q1 this year. \u2047 And we already have received nearly 70% of the orders needed to deliver our full year forecast in Brazil. \u2047 Guidance for Q3 implies year-over-year sales growth of 8% at the midpoint on a reported basis and 7% organically. \u2047 We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 5% at the midpoint versus Q3 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 7% year-over-year. \u2047 Guidance for Q4 implies year-over-year sales growth of 20% at the midpoint on a reported basis with no FX impact anticipated. \u2047 We are forecasting EBITDA growth of 35% at the midpoint versus Q4 2020, and earnings per share is forecasted to be up 46% year-over-year. \u2047 It is worth noting that about half of this growth is going to be driven by the return of business we missed in Q4 2020 due to supply chain issues in North America and weather impact in Latin America. \u2047 Turning to slide seven and full year EBITDA and revenue drivers. \u2047 Revenue is expected to benefit from 6% volume growth, a 1% contribution from higher prices and a 1% benefit from FX. \u2047 We continue to expect broad growth across all regions except EMEA and a very strong second half of 2021. \u2047 We have raised our forecast for 2021 revenue contribution from products launched in the last 12 months to $130 million from $100 million before. \u2047 This includes launches of Overwatch herbicide, Xyway fungicide as well as Vantacor and Elevest insect controls. \u2047 Our EBITDA bridge shows an increase of about $50 million in the expected impact from costs versus our May forecast. \u2047 We continue our cost control actions to limit the net cost headwind. \u2047 As we stated throughout the year, the R&D spending in our forecast is what is needed to keep our projects on a critical path to commercialization. \u2047 But this year-over-year increase will be closer to $20 million rather than the $30 million to $40 million we had previously indicated as we limit overall cost increases. \u2047 Relative to our prior guidance bridge in May, we raised the anticipated volume contribution and lowered our benefit from pricing to reflect our decision to take volume with our high-margin portfolio. \u2047 Moving to slide eight, where you see the Q3 and Q4 drivers. \u2047 On the revenue line for the third quarter, we are expecting a 6% contribution from volume, 1% contribution from price and 1% benefit from FX. \u2047 We had a very strong revenue outlook for Q4, driven by five main elements. \u2047 First, we forecast a strong recovery for our U.S. and Brazil businesses following the weak Q4 2020 in those countries. \u2047 This contributes about half of the total growth in the quarter. \u2047 Second, new products will be a major factor. \u2047 Xyway fungicide, new diamide formulations Elevest and Vantacor, Fluindapyr fungicide for noncrop applications in the U.S., Overwatch herbicide in Australia and Authority NXT herbicide in India. \u2047 Third, strong crop fundamentals. \u2047 We expect a strong Q4 in North America and Latin America, driven by good fundamentals for a variety of crops. \u2047 In Brazil, this includes cotton, as growers have indicated a 15% increase in hectares for the upcoming season. \u2047 Fourth, improved market access and expansion into new geographies and crops. \u2047 This is having a significant impact in India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Eastern Europe and Russia. \u2047 And finally, fifth, price increases will help offset the FX headwind from last year and the higher costs from raw materials this year. \u2047 We are already holding orders for Brazil and U.S. that are at higher year-over-year prices. \u2047 Much of our forecasted Q4 EBITDA growth will come directly from the volume and pricing growth I just described. \u2047 Although we are seeing a large increase in cost in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, we are taking actions to reduce SG&A and R&D to offset a portion of the raw material and supply chain cost headwinds we are facing. \u2047 FX was a stronger-than-expected tailwind to revenue growth in the quarter at 4% versus our expectations of a 1% tailwind as the U.S. dollar weakened against all major currencies relevant to FMC. \u2047 Interest expense for the quarter was $32.6 million, down $8.1 million from the prior year period driven by the benefit of lower LIBOR rates and lower foreign debt balances. \u2047 With continued low interest rates, we now expect interest expense to be between $130 million and $135 million for the full year. \u2047 Our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the second quarter was 13.5% as anticipated and in line with our continued expectation for the full year tax rate. \u2047 Moving next to the balance sheet and liquidity. \u2047 Gross debt at quarter end was $3.8 billion, up roughly $200 million from the prior quarter. \u2047 Gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was 3.2 times at the end of the second quarter, while net debt to EBITDA was 2.6 times. \u2047 The difference between gross debt and net debt metric is much larger than usual this quarter as we had significant cash that we were not able to return to the United States prior to quarter end. \u2047 We are exploring repatriation alternatives for this cash in the third quarter. \u2047 Both levered metrics were above our targeted full year average leverage levels due to seasonality of working capital and will improve through the remainder of the year. \u2047 Moving on to slide nine and cash flow and cash deployment. \u2047 Free cash flow for the second quarter was $204 million, essentially flat to the prior year period. \u2047 Adjusted cash from operations was lower than the prior year period, in large part due to timing changes of certain tax payments. \u2047 Inventory was higher, reflecting the accelerating cost of raw materials as well as increased inventory levels, particularly of diamide, as we prepare for a very strong second half. \u2047 However, the growth in inventory was offset by increased payables. \u2047 Capital additions were somewhat higher as we continue to ramp up spending following deferral of projects last year due to COVID. \u2047 Legacy and transformation spending was down substantially with the benefit of the completion of our SAP program. \u2047 With the reduction in our outlook for full year EBITDA, we are similarly adjusting downward our expectations for free cash flow to a range of $480 million to $570 million, with the vast majority of this cash flow coming in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our outlook for adjusted cash from operations has weakened further the EBITDA, driven by somewhat higher-than-expected working capital due to shifts in timing of sales to the latter part of the second half of the year, which will shift some collections into the following year, as well as higher inventory driven partially by elevated raw material costs. \u2047 Our outlook for capital additions as"], "gold_summary": ["fmc corp sees q3 revenue up 8%.  \u2047  sees fy adjusted earnings per share $6.54 to $6.94.  \u2047  sees q3 revenue up 8
