{"article": ["This is Viki Blinderman, the Chief Accounting Officer. \u2047 Today, we'll be discussing the company's third quarter results for 2020. \u2047 This audio conference is being recorded and an archive will be made available on our website later today through November 2. \u2047 On the call today from management are: Mel Payne, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ben Brink, Chief Financial Officer; Peggy Schappaugh, Vice President of Operations & Acquisitions Analysis; and Steve Metzger, General Counsel. \u2047 Today's call will begin with formal remarks from management followed by a question-and-answer period. \u2047 Today, I won't say a whole lot. \u2047 It's all about our company. \u2047 And I wanted to simply state that we do a lot of communications beneath the covers of what is reported to the public. \u2047 So this went out to every managing partner, every sales manager, every field support leader, directors of support, and every employee and leader in our Houston Support Center. \u2047 This went out about 5:24 p.m. yesterday with our quarterly nine month release. \u2047 \"I have never in my life been more honored and inspired by anyone or any group of people than I have been by the amazing leadership and performance of our managing partners and sales managers and our funeral and cemetery portfolio of businesses over the last nine months and especially the last six months after the coronavirus pandemic shocked our country with both a continuing health and economic crisis. \u2047 The same is true for all the support leadership and teams, who enabled all of our frontline coronavirus battle warriors and their courageous teams of employees to remain in the battle of serving their client families and communities when it counting most. \u2047 Now when this goes out, it generates a lot of attention. \u2047 We do a lot of communication and recognition in the company. \u2047 So I know I'm speaking to them as they hear this. \u2047 And now they're hearing it, not just reading it. \u2047 And I often get many responses to these kinds of communications. \u2047 But I'll just read you one. \u2047 We have been working hard and keep pushing for revenue enhancement while serving the families with higher flexibility and awareness to each need related to the pandemic. \u2047 It has been wonderful to have the support of all members within Carriage Services. \u2047 We truly are united. \u2047 I am looking forward to the call\". \u2047 Loren is the daughter of Frank Forastiere. \u2047 I'm sure they're on the call. \u2047 The Forastiere family business is the business in Springfield, Massachusetts. \u2047 They joined Carriage and came our partners in October of '98. \u2047 Frank was one of the original standards council members and he had to rotate off a couple of years ago when he passed the leadership managing partner role to his daughter, Loren. \u2047 Every Thursday, Loren, we hear about what you and your team is doing, not always on a Thursday. \u2047 How much of this is COVID only? \u2047 And how much of it is market share? \u2047 And I will tell you, Loren and Frank, we know who you're growing the business, how you're growing the business. \u2047 And even when the outbreak slowed, you didn't. \u2047 We know where the business is coming from. \u2047 And I'm not going to mention their name, it's a big business, but it's getting smaller by the month. \u2047 Because this is the exact example of what's going on broadly across Carriage. \u2047 Our extraordinary third quarter performance is a reflection of a company that is completely aligned at all levels to our 2020 theme of transformative high performance. \u2047 And the continued momentum we see in all areas of the company is the Carriage high-performance flywheel in full effect. \u2047 These results also demonstrate the strength of our decentralized entrepreneurial standards operating model, the quality of our managing partners and their teams and our ability to rapidly innovate and adapt in the face of unprecedented challenges brought on by the coronavirus crisis. \u2047 We are excited to share these results with you today. \u2047 For the third quarter and year-to-date results, all of our reported operating and financial performance metrics were records. \u2047 As I review our results, it is important to recognize the full impact of the operating and financial and value creation leverage dynamics that allowed Carriage to leverage organic revenue growth into higher growth rates in total Field EBITDA, adjusted consolidated EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share. \u2047 For the third quarter, we earned $84.4 million of total revenue, an increase of 27.6%; $37.3 million of total Field EBITDA, an increase of 45% with total Field EBITDA margins improving 530 basis points to 44.2%. \u2047 Adjusted consolidated EBITDA improved $10.4 million or 60.1% to $27.7 million. \u2047 And our industry-leading adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin improved 670 basis points to 32.8%. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased an impressive 82.1% to $0.51 in the quarter. \u2047 Year-to-date, total revenue has increased 17.9% to $239.4 million. \u2047 Total Field EBITDA has increased 24% to $100.6 million. \u2047 Total Field EBITDA margin increased 200 basis points to 42%. \u2047 Adjusted consolidated EBITDA increased 32.3% to $75.9 million. \u2047 Adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin increased 340 basis points to 31.7%. \u2047 And our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 34% to $1.30 for the first nine months of the year. \u2047 It is truly an honor and a privilege to have the opportunity to share the insight on the hard work, creativity and pure grit of our managing partners, sales managers and their teams. \u2047 When COVID started to hit our country, we wanted to, first and foremost, ensure the safety of our people and give them peace of mind so that they were still able to provide outstanding service to our families. \u2047 Shawn Phillips, regional partner, led the charge and centrally gathered an abundance of PPE here in Houston to disperse to our funeral homes and cemeteries across the country. \u2047 This gave our managing partners and their teams one less thing to be concerned about and more time to focus on serving every family while still maintaining CDC guidelines. \u2047 Because our managing partners are true owners of their businesses, they remain focused on high performance as it pertains to not only revenue growth but also EBITDA margin. \u2047 In 2019, some adjustments were made to our Being The Best incentives as it relates to margins, further motivating our managing partners to produce higher margins. \u2047 So when the uncertainty of COVID hit, there was immediately an acceleration of expense management from our intuitive managing partners. \u2047 Funeral Home same-store net revenue was up 3.3% September year-to-date while same-store Field EBITDA was up 9.6%, propelling the September year-to-date Funeral Home same-store margin from 38.4% to 40.7%, an increase of 230 basis points. \u2047 Our managing partners and sales managers also made great strides in quarter three on Cemetery sales. \u2047 After finishing quarter two behind $1.9 million in Cemetery same-store operating net revenue, largely due to the cancellation of our annual Ching Ming event, we were able to closed the gap in quarter three to within 250,000 operating net revenue and bring our same-store margins from being behind $1.6 million in quarter two to being flat on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 In quarter three, we continue to see an increase in sales at our three new Cemetery acquisitions, increasing operating net revenue 28.7% from quarter two, improving margin of 35.4% in quarter two to 44.7% in quarter three, bringing the year-to-date margin to 38.1%. \u2047 We continue to see accelerated integration of our four large acquisitions that were made at the end of 2019 and in January of 2020, even among the pandemic, which has proved to make our partnership with these businesses even stronger. \u2047 The improving results, since the first quarter, reflects the great work that is being done by the managing partners and their teams at each of these businesses with the continued support from our operational leadership team. \u2047 This is just the beginning of the higher performance at these four large strategic acquisitions, which will continue to grow and translate into even higher margins into next year and many years to come. \u2047 And the most important thing to note is the power of our decentralized model, which gives our managing partners the ability and freedom to make decisions locally as it relates to each of their markets. \u2047 So as guidelines and restrictions were put in place, they were able to quickly adapt and make the necessary adjustments to serve our families in safe and creative ways. \u2047 At the beginning of 2019, we rebooted our standards and added two key components: an intense focus on compounded net revenue growth and we introduced a new standard, the service guest experience. \u2047 The service guest experience standard was something new to everyone. \u2047 But the goal was to truly differentiate ourselves and create even more value and personalization for each of our families. \u2047 The creative juices began in 2019. \u2047 But the level of creativity that has been stimulated during this pandemic with the CDC guidelines and restrictions in place has been simply remarkable and amazing to witness. \u2047 Our people have found more unique ways to give families what they need, a service to honor the lives of their love one, and the important time to agree with their family and friends, even if that meant doing visitations in small groups or having people RSVP for a service or conducting drive-through visitation or holding services outdoors. \u2047 In addition, we increased our number of funeral homes that offer live streaming from only 30 to now 125 in an effort to overcome restrictions and give our families, that don't feel safe attending a service in person, an opportunity to participate in the service virtually. \u2047 We believe that these creative ideas won't go away but have become the new way we show value to our families. \u2047 We knew that our managing partners were true entrepreneurs. \u2047 But that spirit has really shined through during this pandemic. \u2047 They continue to grow market share above the lift we have seen from COVID cases. \u2047 A vast majority of our same-store funeral homes had market share growth on a year-to-date basis and approximately 75% of those businesses had market share growth beyond COVID. \u2047 Due to early local restrictions on gatherings, we did see a dip in our Funeral Home averages, starting at the end of March, the lowest point being in April. \u2047 But with the inspiring and innovative ideas at our businesses, both our burial and cremation averages have been picking up ever since. \u2047 On a same-store basis, we saw an increase in our burial average of 3% in the third quarter versus the second quarter and an increase in cremation average of 6.4%. \u2047 We believe this upward trend in average will continue the rest of this year and into next year. \u2047 And when talking about cremation average specifically, we saw an increase in our cremation calls with the reboot of standards in 2019, which put more emphasis on net revenue growth. \u2047 At the end of '19, we put more focus on converting those cremations into a cremation with some type of service. \u2047 We remain dedicated on taking time with each of our families to educate them on what is possible when choosing cremation as a disposition. \u2047 And cremation is just that, it's a type of disposition. \u2047 It does not mean there is no service or celebration of life. \u2047 We have heard so many great stories of how our funeral directors take the time to connect with each family and simply listen as the family share stories and interest about their loved ones. \u2047 This allows us to provide unique and creative ways to honor them and share that with everyone that attends the service, transforming a stat occasion into a lasting memory. \u2047 I would like to share just a few examples of how our people incorporate unique touches to every service. \u2047 One of our businesses organized a parade for someone down Main Street because they always wanted to have a parade in their honor. \u2047 We had another business create replicate tickets of their favorite sports teams to hand out at the service. \u2047 And another business that made laminated miniature vinyl cards for a former music producer for all who knew him to have a reminder of the life he was so proud of. \u2047 And another business that had the unique idea to give a grieving husband the opportunity to apply the insignia of their family brand on a wooden casket that would be the final resting place for the love of his life. \u2047 These things may seem small to someone looking in, but they are a touching moment for the family that has just lost someone very close to them. \u2047 This is how our people make such an impact and touch not only the family that is grieving but anyone attending the service, leaving a lasting memory so that when they are in the unfortunate position of losing someone close to them, they know who they can rely on to create that customized memorable service. \u2047 The third quarter marked the first period of time where the full effect of the successful execution of our trust fund portfolio repositioning strategy was reflected in our reported financial revenue and EBITDA. \u2047 The recurring annual income generated from our trust fund portfolio is currently $15.7 million, up from approximately $9.4 million prior to the execution of our strategy. \u2047 Initially, this 67% increase in recurring annual income will primarily benefit our recognized revenue through our cemetery perpetual care trust, while increasing the value of preneed funeral and cemetery trust contracts to be recognized over the long term. \u2047 For the third quarter, financial revenue increased 44.5% to $5.6 million, driven by a 111% increase in cemetery trust earnings. \u2047 Financial EBITDA increased 51.6% to $5.2 million and financial EBITDA margin increased 440 basis points to 93.8% compared to the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Next year, we expect financial revenue to be between $22 million and $23 million and financial EBITDA of approximately $21.5 million, an almost 50% increase from our financial EBITDA prior to the execution of our repositioning strategy. \u2047 Going forward, this higher level of recurring financial revenue and EBITDA will be significantly accretive to our adjusted consolidated EBITDA and adjusted consolidated -- adjusted free cash flow margins that are reflected in our updated three year milestone scenario. \u2047 Overhead increased $1.1 million while overhead as a percentage of revenue, the measure of our ability to leverage our overhead and support platform, fell to 11.8% in the third quarter. \u2047 All of the increase in our overhead for the quarter was due to an increase in the incentive compensation accruals, primarily for our Funeral Home and Cemetery Being The Best annual incentive awards. \u2047 We are now fully accrued for a higher field incentive compensation at the end of the quarter. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.51.  \u2047  q3 revenue rose 27.6 percent to $84.4 million.  \u2047  sees q4 adjusted free cash flow of $56 million - $60
