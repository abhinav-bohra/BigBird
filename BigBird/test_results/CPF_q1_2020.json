{"article": ["As always, we appreciate your interest in Central Pacific Financial Corporation. \u2047 The COVID-19 pandemic is top of mind for all of us. \u2047 Overall, the state of Hawaii is doing a good job at managing and containing the pandemic. \u2047 Hawaii was early to put in place stay-at-home orders and mandatory curfew then quarantine. \u2047 Our residents in general are abiding by government orders, as well as hygiene recommendations. \u2047 Due to our geographic isolation, Hawaii was able to effectively lock down and protect the state from outside visitors with potential COVID-19 infections. \u2047 We believe these measures will slow and contain the spread of COVID-19 in the state and result in a faster recovery. \u2047 However, with a complete tourism shut down in Hawaii, we are seeing a dramatic impact on the state's economy. \u2047 We are hopeful that we will start to see visitors returning to the island in the late summer to early fall of this year, particularly from Asia as they are closer to recovery from the pandemic. \u2047 Central Pacific Financial is committed to supporting our employees, customers and community during this time of crisis. \u2047 Our first focus is on our employees. \u2047 And therefore we have temporarily closed 13 of our smaller branches to allow for adequate social distancing and our larger remaining branches. \u2047 The staff from the temporarily closed branches have been redeployed to work at the remaining branches, assist other areas of the bank or make customer telephone calls. \u2047 The majority of our support staff, even at the executive level, have started working remotely on a full-time or rotating basis. \u2047 We believe the actions we have taken to date will allow us to meet the needs of our customers and community while ensuring the safety of all employees. \u2047 We want to assure you that we are prepared to handle this crisis. \u2047 I personally led companies through prior crisis, including the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, tsunami and radiation after-effects while I was in Tokyo leading IBM, Japan and the SARs outbreak in 2002 to 2004 while I was leading BEARINGPOINT ASIA PACIFIC. \u2047 Additionally, many of our key team members that helped us through the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis remain with the company and are applying the valuable lessons learned. \u2047 Despite COVID-19, our RISE2020 initiatives are continuing. \u2047 The revitalization of our building headquarters is proceeding as we continue to support the local construction industry. \u2047 We are also pushing ahead with our digital initiatives, including the development of our new online and mobile banking platforms and the replacement of our ATMs. Digital technology is even more critical to our business during crises like this and will remain a high priority strategy for our future. \u2047 As a result, we have not had any disruption in our business. \u2047 As Paul noted, our remote workforce plan has been rolled out with an overall smooth transition. \u2047 We already have virtual private network, VPN technology capability over the last quarter. \u2047 And we've expanded VPN access to over 70% of our employees. \u2047 In addition to VPN, we are well set up with the latest technologies and enable our operations to continue efficiently. \u2047 Our teams are using collaboration tools, including Microsoft Team and several other cloud-based software program. \u2047 For our customers, we continue to offer our current online and mobile banking tools and we are making good progress on our new digital offerings as part of our RISE2020 initiatives. \u2047 Banking is deemed an essential service and I've been so proud of how our CPB employees have risen to deliver exceptional service in these challenging times. \u2047 I'd like to reiterate that our employee and customer safety is of the utmost priority. \u2047 We are monitoring our employees' health and well-being very closely. \u2047 We are providing personal protective equipment for our frontline staff and have implemented precautionary measures to ensure social distancing in our branches and all work areas. \u2047 During the first quarter, our teams remained focused on generating revenue even as the pandemic situation began to escalate. \u2047 The Bank grew total loans by $63 million or 1.4% sequential quarter. \u2047 The loan growth primarily came from our residential and commercial mortgage loan categories. \u2047 We were also able to grow core deposits by $45 million or 1.1% sequential quarter. \u2047 Additionally, we were successful in reducing the average cost of total deposits by 5 basis points to 36 basis points. \u2047 Going forward, we believe, there are still opportunities for loan and deposit growth as our teams collaborate together to support our consumer and business customers through this unprecedented time. \u2047 We have also moved quickly to put in place a number of COVID-19 relief programs for our consumer and business customers. \u2047 For our customers, we are offering an employment disruption loan, as well as, consumer and residential mortgage loan payment deferral programs. \u2047 For our business customers, we are an SBA approved lender and are participating in the paycheck protection program for PPP, which is part of the Federal CARES Act. \u2047 We've seen tremendous demand for the paycheck protection program and have made over 4200 loans totaling nearly $490 million approved by the SBA. \u2047 As a result of the PPP loan demand, it was necessary to redeploy employees to handle and assist with the loan processing, including augmenting the loan process by engaging outside resources to assist. \u2047 Our PPP team is focused right now to fund the loans that were approved by the SBA, as well as, to prioritize remaining applications that did not get processed in time under the initial funding and of course to submit the applications to SBA when the lender portal reopens. \u2047 We are staying in close contact with our customers through increased outreach efforts. \u2047 Our bankers are having calls with their key customers as frequently as daily. \u2047 W are monitoring our customers' financial health during this challenging time and are providing guidance and the resources they need to help them weather the storm. \u2047 Furthermore, we are prudently making loan modifications for certain commercial customers to allow for deferral of loan principal and/or interest for short-term period. \u2047 As of April 16, we have made loan payment deferrals on approximately $300 million in total balances which represent less than 7% of our total loan portfolio. \u2047 Central Pacific Financial has had a prudent credit risk management philosophy, which we believe will help us weather through this pandemic. \u2047 Following our recovery from the Great Recession, we implemented a disciplined approach to credit that included tighter underwriting standards with a focus on making quality loans and maintaining a diversified portfolio. \u2047 Our loan portfolio today is well diversified by product and by industry. \u2047 While, certain industries we lend to will be impacted by the pandemic, there are other industries and portfolios that we expect to have limited impacts. \u2047 The primary industries that will likely experience impacts from the pandemics are summarized on Slide 9 and include accommodation and foodservice, retail trade, wholesale trade, manufacturing and healthcare. \u2047 This comprises approximately $378 million or 8% of our total loan portfolio. \u2047 A large portion of these balances are to well-established businesses that have weathered through the last downturn. \u2047 Secondary industries that may also experience impacts include real estate management and other leasing, transportation, professional and administrative and other industries and services that total approximately $487 million or 11% of our total loan portfolio. \u2047 These industries have thus far experienced little impact from COVID-19. \u2047 Additional details on our primary and secondary industries can be found on Slide 10. \u2047 We also anticipate impacts on our consumer portfolio, which is approximately $560 million or 13% of our total loan portfolio. \u2047 We are actively granting 90-day payment deferrals to the borrowers. \u2047 Additional details on our consumer portfolio are shown on Slide 11. \u2047 We anticipate limited impact on our residential, home equity and investor commercial real estate loans. \u2047 The weighted average loan-to-value in these portfolio are 60%, 58% and 53% respectively. \u2047 These loans comprise of approximately $3.1 billion or 68% of our total loan portfolio. \u2047 Additional details on these portfolios can be found on Slides 12 and 13. \u2047 In the final week of March, we aggressively reviewed our commercial loan portfolio and reached out to our customers to determine the initial impacts, if any, of COVID-19 on their businesses. \u2047 Through this process, we identified borrowers that were likely to experience financial difficulty and proactively downgraded approximately $65 million in loans from past and special mention. \u2047 These loans are primarily accounted for as part of the outstanding loan balance of the primary industries previously mentioned. \u2047 It is important to note that all of these loans were performing prior to COVID-19. \u2047 As part of our assessment for the downgrade, we reviewed management-end actions taken such as closing businesses and reducing expenses, monthly cash burn and access to cash liquidity and capital and the overall ability to weather through the pandemic in the near term. \u2047 We further note that it is still early to reach any firm conclusions and that these loans that were downgraded do not include the expected positive impact from the federal subsidy program. \u2047 We are proactively working with our customers and many have already applied and have been approved for the paycheck protection program. \u2047 Furthermore, we have also provided assistance with short term payment deferrals as necessary. \u2047 Additional details and breakdown by industry can be found on Slide 14. \u2047 Overall, our asset quality continues to remain strong. \u2047 On the finance side, we have implemented several steps to effectively manage through the current environment. \u2047 We will ensure our capital and liquidity positions remain strong. \u2047 Through our past experience, we have developed robust capital and liquidity stress tests and comprehensive capital and liquidity contingency plans. \u2047 We also decided to temporarily suspend our share repurchase program. \u2047 To manage our expenses, as well as protect our employees, we have implemented internal policies to temporarily suspend all business travel, large group meetings, meals and entertainment. \u2047 We have also reevaluated or postponed certain consulting projects. \u2047 And finally, hiring of new employees is on an exception basis and we are evaluating our compensation plans. \u2047 I'd like to now briefly cover the company's financial results for the first quarter of 2020 which is summarized on Slide 15. \u2047 Net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $8.3 million or $0.29 per diluted share. \u2047 Return on average assets in the first quarter was 0.55% and return on average equity was 6.21%. \u2047 Our earnings were impacted by a total provision for credit losses of $11.1 million recognized in the first quarter which related to a new CECL methodology and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic forecasts. \u2047 We also recorded a CECL day one impact of $3.6 million, which was an adjustment to our opening shareholders equity. \u2047 Our pre-tax pre-provision earnings for the first quarter was $21 million. \u2047 Net charge-offs in the first quarter totaled $1.2 million compared to net charge-offs of $2.3 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 The charge-offs primarily came from the Hawaii consumer loan portfolio. \u2047 At March 31, our allowance for credit losses was $59.6 million or 1.32% of outstanding loans. \u2047 Net interest income for the first quarter was $47.8 million, which was relatively flat on a sequential basis and the net interest margin remained stable at 3.43%. \u2047 First quarter other operating income totaled $8.9 million compared to $9.8 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 The decrease was primarily due to lower mortgage banking income and BOLI income, driven by market volatility during the quarter. \u2047 This was partially offset by additional fee income of $1.3 million related to an interest rate swap for a commercial real estate client. \u2047 Other operating expense for the first quarter was $36.2 million, which was flat to the prior quarter. \u2047 Included in the total, there was lower deferred compensation expense due to market volatility, which was offset by higher provision on off-balance sheet credit exposures under CECL. \u2047 The efficiency ratio increased to 63.9% in the first quarter compared to 62.8% in the prior quarter. \u2047 The increase was primarily due to the decrease in other operating income. \u2047 The effective tax rate was 25.3% in the first quarter. \u2047 Going forward, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range. \u2047 The global COVID-19 pandemic is an extremely challenging situation faced by all during this time. \u2047 We want to assure you that Central Pacific is prepared and ready to handle the situation. \u2047 We have a solid financial, credit, liquidity and capital position to enable us to weather the storm. \u2047 We remain committed to our employees, customers and the community and will continue to provide support to all of these areas. \u2047 Earlier this month, we ran a highly successful community campaign sponsored by our CPB foundation called KeepHawaiiCooking. \u2047 Through this program, our foundation subsidized the cost of 10,000 take-out meals to local families struggling during this time. \u2047 The purchase of these meals also provided a much needed support to our local restaurants. \u2047 We are further looking at other potential initiatives to help our local economy, one of which is the campaign to continue communication and engagement with visitors, particularly from Japan to keep Hawaii top of mind and encourage their return to Hawaii once the pandemic ends and recovery occurs. \u2047 To conclude, we are very focused on flattening the curve with the COVID-19 situation and we are pulling together the company and communities to beat this. \u2047 At this time, we'll be happy to address any questions you may have. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $0.29.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $0.29.  \u2047  net
