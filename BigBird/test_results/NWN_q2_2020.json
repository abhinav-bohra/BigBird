{"article": ["They are based on management's assumptions, which may or may not occur. \u2047 In addition, some of our comments today reference non-GAAP adjusted measures. \u2047 We expect to file our 10-Q later today. \u2047 [Operator Instructions] and will be available on our website following the call. \u2047 Please note these calls are designed for the financial community. \u2047 I hope you, your families, your work colleagues are safe and well. \u2047 Like all of you, we continue to navigate these unusual times. \u2047 Cities within our service territory began reopening in the second quarter. \u2047 And like many parts of our country, we began seeing an increase in COVID cases in late July. \u2047 But it has appeared to plateau lightly. \u2047 Now more than ever, we are tapping into our core value of caring for each other and the communities we serve. \u2047 From a business perspective, we continue to focus on providing safe and reliable service while ensuring the health and safety of our employees. \u2047 We continue to benefit from a conservative business model with stable utility margins. \u2047 A majority of our revenues have recovery mechanisms in place to weather normalize and to decouple margins. \u2047 We also remain focused on efficient operations. \u2047 That, combined with the decline in natural gas prices, has led to natural gas bills that are about 40% lower today than they were 15 years ago, which is very good news for our customers. \u2047 The third leg to our strategy is to look for growth that fits our conservative risk profile. \u2047 Most recently, this has been a new contractual revenue stream from the North Mist gas storage expansion and, of course, our water and wastewater businesses. \u2047 Our solid business strategy allows us to adapt to unforeseen challenges, such as the coronavirus. \u2047 And our core values of integrity, safety, caring, service ethic and environmental stewardship are the foundation and guiding principles for all we do. \u2047 Safety continues to be a value at the forefront of our minds, and we remain vigilant during this pandemic regarding the safety of our 1,200 employees and, of course, the 2.5 million people that we serve. \u2047 Our natural gas and water utilities are critical infrastructure. \u2047 We've continued all essential options to provide reliable service while following relevant health and safety guidelines, including guidance from OSHA and the CDC. \u2047 We've created a specialized field team that takes extra precautions when responding to calls where there's a known or suspected case of COVID. \u2047 In the vein of caring and customer assistance, we temporarily stopped disconnecting customers and charging late fees on past-due bills. \u2047 We are also providing financial assistance through a variety of programs, including our corporate philanthropy fund, easy for me to say, our gas assistance program, several state and federal programs and, of course, a special employee giving campaign. \u2047 In June, we issued a $17 million bill credit to Oregon customers, which is a record amount under this sharing mechanism. \u2047 At the same time, we continue to see strong customer growth. \u2047 New construction plus conversions translated into connecting over 13,000 new customers during the last 12 months, which equated to a growth rate of 1.7%. \u2047 While we can't predict the full economic effects of the pandemic, we continue to see mitigating factors for our business with our resilient business model, the timing of the onset of the pandemic and our conservative and efficient business operations. \u2047 Not only do we care for customers, we also care deeply about our employees, and I am proud of how quickly our employees have adapted adopted rather, new safety procedures and embraced working remotely, all the while they have maintained the highest service and productivity levels. \u2047 During this excuse me, we're also reminded of the importance of social justice in our workplace. \u2047 As a company, we have publicly stated that racism in any shape or form is not tolerated at Northwest Natural. \u2047 And for years, we have actively progressed in the anti-racism and equity agenda, not only internally with our employees, but also founding and supporting wider community diversity initiatives and meeting aggressive goals to provide business opportunities to minority and female-owned businesses. \u2047 Today, our culture is one of accountability, creativity and collaboration that is inclusive and supports opportunities for all employees. \u2047 This work is not easy, and there are no shortcuts. \u2047 We are focused on continuous improvement and we'll keep fostering such an environment, building diverse workforce across all levels in our organization, providing equity in pay and development opportunities and ensuring inclusion so all voices are heard and respected. \u2047 Now turning to the progress we've made related to environmental stewardship. \u2047 I'm pleased to share that in July, we've reached an important milestone here in Oregon. \u2047 Rulemaking was completed on groundbreaking renewable natural gas legislation, what we call Senate Bill 98, which enables us to put renewable natural gas, or RNG, on our system and take the next step in our state's energy transition. \u2047 RNG is a zero-carbon resource produced from organic materials like food, agriculture and forestry waste, wastewater or landfills that can be added into the existing natural gas system. \u2047 All forms of RNG are supported in the law, including renewable hydrogen. \u2047 The law enables us to acquire RNG on behalf of Oregon customers and goes further than any other law by outlining goals for adding as much as 30% RNG into the state's pipeline system by 2050. \u2047 It allows up to 5% of a utility's revenue requirement to be used to cover the incremental costs of RNG. \u2047 Currently, that equates to about $30 million annually for Northwest Natural. \u2047 Gas utilities are also allowed to rate base interconnections with the gas system and could include RNG facilities and rate base, if that is the lowest-cost option for customers. \u2047 We're pleased to take this significant step forward with the support of the legislator legislature, governor and regulators. \u2047 Last week, Northwest Natural and all parties in the Oregon general rate case filed a comprehensive stipulation with the Public Utility Commission of Oregon. \u2047 The filing includes a $45.8 million increase in revenue requirement compared to a requested $71.4 million amount. \u2047 This stipulation is based on the previously settled capital components, including a capital structure of 50-50 debt and equity and a return on Equity of 9.4% and a cost of capital of just under 7%. \u2047 In addition, the stipulation reflects average rate base of approximately $1.45 billion. \u2047 Northwest Natural's filing is subject to OPUC approval. \u2047 And if approved, new rates are expected to take effect on November one this year. \u2047 This is also the time that our revised purchased gas adjustment, or PGA, takes effect. \u2047 This year's PGA forecasts a reduction to customers' bills, which offset the majority of this base rate increase we just settled on. \u2047 We commend the commissioners and parties for their ability to continue working virtually under less-than-ideal conditions. \u2047 I'll begin with a summary of our second quarter and year-to-date financials, and then discuss the key metrics and financial implications of COVID-19 on our business and guidance for 2020. \u2047 I'll describe earnings drivers on an after-tax basis using the statutory tax rate of 26.5%. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% as a result of the return of excess deferred income taxes to our Oregon customers. \u2047 Also note that earnings per share comparisons were impacted by the issuance of 1.4 million shares in June of 2019 as we raised equity to fund investments in our gas utility. \u2047 For the quarter, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of $5.1 million or $0.17 per share compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.07 per share for the same period in 2019. \u2047 The decline in earnings for the quarter reflects two key drivers. \u2047 First, the second quarter results reflect the financial impacts of COVID-19 on margin, O&M and interest expense. \u2047 We estimate the total impact of COVID-19 to be in about approximate to be approximately $4 million or $0.12 per share, most of which hit in the second quarter. \u2047 We have recorded a deferral for a portion of these costs with an offsetting reserve until we have more clarity with regulators as to the recoverability of these costs. \u2047 Second, last year's second quarter results benefited from the reversal of an earnings test reserved for environmental remediation expenses that we booked in the first quarter equal to $0.11 per share. \u2047 Looking at the gas distribution segment. \u2047 Utility margin decreased $1 million. \u2047 Higher customer rates in Washington, customer growth and revenues from the North Mist expansion project contributed $2.9 million, which was more than offset by a $3.2 million increase in environmental remediation expense due to the reserve release in the prior year. \u2047 COVID impacts on margin are estimated to be $1.5 million, including a $700,000 decline in revenues from lower late charges and disconnection fees as we temporarily and voluntarily suspended these charges in March. \u2047 In addition, we experienced slightly lower usage from industrial and commercial use customers that were not decoupled. \u2047 Utility O&M increased $2.8 million in the quarter as we incurred higher contractor service costs related to pipeline and meter safety as well as moving expenses as we transition to a new headquarters and operations center. \u2047 In addition, compensation costs increased related to additional IT staff and higher wages under the new five-year union contract. \u2047 Finally, O&M increased $200,000 due to the higher reserve for bad debt related to COVID. \u2047 Depreciation expense and general taxes increased $2 million related to our continued investment in our system, including the North Mist gas storage facility, which was placed into rates in May of 2019. \u2047 Interest expense increased $1.1 million related to several financings undertaken in March to increase cash on hand as a precautionary measure during a significant market period of significant market volatility amid the early stages of the pandemic. \u2047 For the first six months of 2020, we reported net income from continuing operations of $43.1 million or $1.41 per share compared to net income of $45.5 million or $1.56 per share for the same period in 2019. \u2047 Last year's results included a regulatory disallowance of $0.23 per share related to an Oregon Commission order. \u2047 Excluding that disallowance, on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.79 for 2019. \u2047 The $0.38 per share decline is largely due to year-over-year growth in expenses and the effects of COVID-19. \u2047 In the gas distribution segment, utility margin increased $100,000. \u2047 Higher customer rates in Washington, customer growth and revenues from the North Mist expansion project contributed an additional $10.1 million. \u2047 This was partially offset by lower entitlement and curtailment fees related to pipeline constraints in 2019 and warmer weather in 2020 compared to 2019, which collectively reduced margin by $4.9 million. \u2047 The remaining $5.2 million decline in utility margin is a result of the March 2019 Oregon order related to tax reform and pension expense. \u2047 With the exception of the first quarter pension disallowance, this order has no impact on net income as offsetting adjustments were recognized through expenses and income taxes, as I'll describe in a moment. \u2047 Utility O&M and other expenses declined $6.9 million during the first six months of 2020. \u2047 This decrease is the result of accounting entries associated with the 2019 Oregon order, which resulted in $14 million of additional expense in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed previously. \u2047 This was offset by a $5.8 million increase in underlying O&M related to the cost drivers I described in the quarterly results. \u2047 Over the last several years, we have invested in our gas system at historically high levels, and we placed the North Mist gas facility into service. \u2047 As a result, depreciation expense increased $4.9 million. \u2047 Finally, 2019 utility segment tax expense included a $5.9 million benefit related to implementing the March order with no significant resulting effect on net income. \u2047 Net income from our other businesses declined $1.5 million from lower asset management revenues due to less favorable market conditions. \u2047 Now regarding the financial effects of COVID-19. \u2047 While our business model is resilient and the initial timing of the event occurred after Northwest Natural's peak heating season, we are experiencing some financial impacts related to the pandemic. \u2047 Through June 30, we have an estimated $4 million of combined incremental costs and lower revenues. \u2047 Based on our experience to date and expectations for the future, we'll closely monitor the following items. \u2047 First, we continue to track commercial customer losses as a result of businesses closing their doors and today have not seen a significant change or near-term implications on customer growth, but it is still very early in the economic contraction. \u2047 Second, we are also monitoring the loss of late fee revenue and potential bad debt expense. \u2047 We have doubled our reserve for bad debts from $800,000 in June 2019 to $1.6 million at June of 2020. \u2047 Third, we have experienced some decline in industrial and large commercial customer usage, but have not seen a substantial reduction to date. \u2047 As discussed, we took several steps to improve our liquidity position by increasing cash on hand. \u2047 As a result, we had over $470 million of cash at the end of the first quarter. \u2047 As market conditions have improved, we reduced that to $137 million. \u2047 While there is an incremental interest costs associated with these financings, we believe it is relatively inexpensive insurance given the volatility in the market. \u2047 We've applied for regulatory deferrals to recover certain of these costs and are working closely with our regulators to reach agreement on the type and amount of costs that will be eligible for recovery. \u2047 In addition, we are taking actions to ensure we are operating effectively and efficiently, and these savings also moderate the impact of COVID. \u2047 In summary, second quarter results are coming in about where we expected them to be, and we continue to monitor this evolving situation as we approach the next heating season. \u2047 Today, we reaffirm guidance for the continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share and guide toward the lower end of the range due to the potential implications of COVID-19. \u2047 Guidance also assumes continued customer growth, average weather conditions and no significant changes in prevailing regulatory policies, mechanisms or outcomes or significant laws, legislation or regulations. \u2047 Finally, this guidance excludes any gain related to the sale of Gill Ranch and associated operating results. \u2047 These items are reported in discontinued operations. \u2047 We continue to monitor the impact of the pandemic on our capital programs. \u2047 At this time, we do not expect a material change in our capital expenditure range of $240 million to $"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 loss per share $0.17 from continuing operations.  \u2047  q2 loss per share $0.17 from continuing operations.  \u2047  northwest natural - reaffirmed 2020
