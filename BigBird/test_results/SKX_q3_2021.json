{"article": ["I will now read the Safe Harbor statement. \u2047 At this time, there are significant uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 I hope you, your colleagues and loved ones are all doing well. \u2047 As the pandemic remains a challenge in our business and personal lives, we are focused on the safety of our teams around the world. \u2047 We are appreciative of the resiliency of the entire Skechers organization. \u2047 Without them we wouldn't have achieved our strong results and do what we do best; design, deliver, and market what we believe is the most comfortable and innovative footwear available today. \u2047 Before we share details of our record third quarter sales, it is important to note that the pandemic continues to impact our business globally. \u2047 While many markets, including the United States and Europe eased restrictions, others particularly the Asia Pacific region experienced extended and even renewed lockdown measures. \u2047 Further, the global supply chain disruptions, including the congestion at ports around the world, especially in the United States and the COVID-19 related closures of factories in South Vietnam where we manufacture a limited amount of our product have delayed our ability to ship goods. \u2047 Transit times doubled from what they were in the pre-pandemic period. \u2047 This is a global phenomenon that we believe will continue to impact our business into the first half of 2022. \u2047 However, we are seeing positive signs that conditions are improving. \u2047 Factory production in South Vietnam has restarted, albeit at a reduced capacity in some areas and the congestion at some global ports has improved. \u2047 We are optimistic given our strong start to the fourth quarter. \u2047 Skechers third quarter revenue of $1.55 billion was a new record for the period and a remarkable achievement given the ongoing global supply chain disruptions just discussed. \u2047 For the nine months period we also achieved a sales record of over $4.6 billion. \u2047 Quarterly gross margin remained strong at 49.6% primarily driven by higher average selling prices and fewer promotions in our direct-to-consumer business, partially offset by increases in freight costs. \u2047 The third quarter sales gain of 19% was the result of a 20% increase in our domestic business and a 19% increase in our international business, which represented 58% of our total sales for the period. \u2047 We achieved double-digit increases across all our reportable segments, driven by the continued global demand for our Comfort Technology footwear. \u2047 Skechers direct-to-consumer business achieved the highest quarterly sales gains, increasing 44%, driven by a 61% increase in our international business and a 35% increase in our domestic business. \u2047 Worldwide comparable same-store sales increased 31% including 34% domestically and 25% internationally. \u2047 Importantly, unit volume improved 17% with an average selling price per unit increase of 23%, reflective of our less promotional stance, the success of our Comfort Technology product and a return to a more normal lifestyle and shopping behavior. \u2047 The increase in our domestic direct-to-consumer business was driven by a 43% gain in our brick-and-mortar stores where we saw higher traffic and normalized operating hours. \u2047 Our domestic e-commerce channel increased 3% year-over-year, but 180% over the same period in 2019. \u2047 Our domestic e-commerce business was particularly impacted by limited product availability in the quarter. \u2047 The increase in our international direct-to-consumer business was primarily driven by a rebounding demand and easing of COVID restrictions. \u2047 This growth came from triple-digit increases in Chile and Korea and double-digit increases in the United Kingdom and Mexico, as well as strong growth in Canada, Peru and India. \u2047 We continue to invest in our e-commerce infrastructure and launched new sites on our new platform in Ireland in September and the United Kingdom this month, with more markets planned for the fourth quarter and into 2022. \u2047 In the third quarter we opened 10 company-owned Skechers stores, including two in Columbia and one each in Peru, India, Germany and France. \u2047 We also opened a store in downtown Los Angeles in a renovated historic building, marking our first street location in this evolving urban center. \u2047 We closed one location in the quarter. \u2047 To date in the fourth quarter, we've opened three stores, including one in Naples, Italy and we plan to open an additional 15 to 20 locations by year end. \u2047 An additional net 119 third-party Skechers stores opened in the third quarter across 28 countries, including a net new 67 in China, 9 in India, 6 in Australia, and 4 in New Zealand. \u2047 In total, at quarter end, there were 4170 Skechers stores around the world. \u2047 Our international wholesale business grew 11% year-over-year. \u2047 The quarterly sales growth was primarily driven by an increase of 62% in our distributor business and a 10% increase in China. \u2047 Our distributor business performed well, reflecting a more normal selling environment, particularly with our largest partner base in the Middle East and Africa. \u2047 Our joint venture business increased 5% for the quarter due to a 10% increase in China, as well as strong sales in Mexico and Israel. \u2047 These improvements were partially offset by declines in several markets in Asia due to continuing COVID related restrictions. \u2047 Subsidiary sales increased 6%, primarily driven by improvements in India, as well as Colombia and Canada. \u2047 This growth was partially offset by a 11% decrease in Europe, primarily due to supply chain issues. \u2047 We are currently seeing progress in European ports with improvements in the flow of goods resulting in a strong October. \u2047 Sales in our domestic wholesale business improved 10% in the third quarter. \u2047 The growth came primarily from women's GO WALK, men's sport, work, all[Phonetic] from Skechers, as well as our performance in casual running style for men and women. \u2047 Central to our global success is our Comfort Technology footwear. \u2047 Comfort, innovation, style and quality are the Skechers product tenets. \u2047 In the third quarter and over the last 18 months, consumers have been increasingly loyal to Skechers Comfort as we elevated our products with more fit offerings, as well as lightweight cushioning options and added durability to many styles. \u2047 We also have focused our efforts on an expanding collection at futures recycled materials. \u2047 Our ongoing goal is to meet consumers' needs with comfortable footwear at a reasonable price. \u2047 We drove awareness of our available collections through our multiplatform approach to marketing that included television, outdoor, digital, influencers and more. \u2047 This approach resulted in influencers from Tokyo, London, and Los Angeles, all wearing Skechers times, Kansai Yamamoto limited edition collection and localized campaigns featuring key opinion leaders in key global markets. \u2047 Given Skechers global growth, we are strategically investing in both our distribution and corporate infrastructure. \u2047 Our UK and China distribution centers became fully operational in the third quarter and we narrowed down locations for a new DC in India. \u2047 We completed the first phase of our corporate headquarters expansion at Manhattan Beach and we are working on the expansion of our North American distribution center that will bring our facility in Southern California to 2.6 million square feet in 2022. \u2047 Both of these expansions will be LEED certified gold. \u2047 We believe our record results in the third quarter reflect our powerful global brand. \u2047 With factory production in South Vietnam restarted and transit times and port constraints improving, we are optimistic about the holiday season. \u2047 Our results this quarter demonstrate the strength of our brand as the Comfort Technology leader, as well as our immense opportunities for global expansion. \u2047 What makes us even more impressive is that we delivered this growth despite severe and ongoing supply chain challenges that significantly restricted product availability across the globe. \u2047 Let me elaborate on that topic first. \u2047 There has been a lot of discussion about the factory closures in Vietnam over the summer. \u2047 This certainly impacted production at Skechers, though to a more limited degree than others as the majority of our Vietnam production is not in the South of the country. \u2047 The more disruptive issues have been widespread shipping container shortages, port congestion and last mile transportation delays. \u2047 The combination of these factors negatively impacted Skechers sales in the third quarter. \u2047 This is evident in our quarter end inventory balance which includes an incremental 218 million in-transit inventory, a year-over-year increase of over 140%. \u2047 Under normal conditions we believe a meaningful portion of that inventory would have been delivered to customers in the third quarter. \u2047 At Skechers our main objective remains delivering great comfort infused products to our dedicated consumers and once product availability is normalized, we fully expect to deliver even better results than the remarkable growth of this quarter. \u2047 Now let's turn to our third quarter results, where we will provide comparisons to both prior year and where appropriate 2019. \u2047 Sales in the quarter achieved a new third quarter record totaling $1.55 billion, an increase of $250.1 million or 19% from the prior year, and a 15% increase over the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 On a constant currency basis, sales increased $222 million or 17% from the prior year. \u2047 Direct-to-consumer sales increased 44% year-over-year supported by growth in domestic and international markets of 35% and 61% respectively. \u2047 Both markets delivered meaningful improvements in gross margins and strong year-over-year average selling price growth. \u2047 As compared with the third quarter of 2019, direct-to-consumer sales increased 20% the result of a 14% increase domestically and a 30% increase internationally. \u2047 International wholesale sales increased 11% year-over-year and grew 10% compared to the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Our distributor business grew 62% year-over-year, but still remained about 9% below 2019 levels. \u2047 This channel continues to make good strides toward recovery, particularly in critical markets like the Middle East and Russia. \u2047 Particularly sales increased 6% year-over-year and as compared to the third quarter of 2019 grew 8%. \u2047 The improvement was primarily the result of higher average selling prices and a strong recovery in India, as well as increases in Latin America and Canada. \u2047 Our joint ventures grew 5% year-over-year led by 10% growth in China, driven by strong e-commerce demand, somewhat tempered by slower traffic patterns in retail stores, as well as temporary pandemic related store closures. \u2047 Continuing weakness in several adjacent markets also weighed on joint venture growth in Asia. \u2047 Domestic wholesale sales grew 10% year-over-year and as compared to the third quarter of 2019 increased 17%. \u2047 We continue to see very positive underlying trends with the majority of our domestic wholesale partners, including healthy sell-through rates and steady and average selling prices. \u2047 Gross profit was $769.4 million, up 23% or $144.3 million compared to the prior year. \u2047 Gross margin for the quarter was 49.6%, an increase of 150 basis points. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, gross margins improved as a result of higher average selling prices, partially offset by a higher unit cost across all segments and the impact of product mix in our wholesale business. \u2047 Total operating expenses increased by $94.5 million or 18% to $630.7 million in the quarter versus the prior year, but decreased 50 basis point as a percentage of sales from 41.2% to 40.7%. \u2047 Selling expenses in the quarter increased year-over-year by $33.8 million or 39% to $119.8 million. \u2047 The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher demand creation spending as markets reopened globally. \u2047 General and administrative expenses in the quarter increased year-over-year by $60.7 million or 13% to $510.9 million. \u2047 However, as a percentage of sales, this represented a year-over-year decrease of 170 basis points. \u2047 The dollar increase was due to a combination of factors, including increased retail store labor, incentive costs, rent expense related to new store openings and distribution center expansions, as well as volume-driven warehouse and distribution expenses. \u2047 This is partially offset by the $18.2 million corporate compensation expense last year related to the one-time cancellation of restricted share grants. \u2047 Earnings from operations were $146.2 million versus prior year earnings of $92.1 million, an increase of $54.1 million or 59%. \u2047 Operating margin improved 230 basis points to 9.4% as compared with 7.1% in the prior year. \u2047 Net earnings were $103.1 million or $0.66 per diluted share on $157.1 million diluted shares outstanding. \u2047 This compares to prior year net earnings of $64.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share on $155 million diluted shares outstanding. \u2047 Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 15.6% versus 15.4% in the prior year. \u2047 And now turning to our balance sheet. \u2047 Our cash and liquidity position remained extremely healthy. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $1.18 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. \u2047 This reflects a decrease of $318 million or 21% from September 30, 2020. \u2047 But as a reminder, we fully repaid our revolving credit facility in the second quarter of which approximately $450 million was outstanding last year. \u2047 Trade accounts receivable at quarter end were $758.7 million an increase of $49.8 million from September 30, 2020, predominantly the result of higher wholesale sales. \u2047 Total inventory was $1.23 billion, an increase of 17% or $177 million from September 30, 2020. \u2047 However, as previously noted, this balance reflects a significant increase in in-transit inventory of $218 million on an inventory, that is inventory available to deliver to customers and our retail stores was lower by approximately 5% overall and in critical markets like the United States and Europe on-hand inventory was lower by over 20%. \u2047 Total debt including both current and long-term portions was $327 million at September 30, 2021 compared to $812 million at September 30, 2020 reflecting the repayment of our revolving credit facility last quarter. \u2047 Capital expenditure in the quarter were $89.4 million of which 38 million related to investments in our new corporate offices and other real estate, $16.2 million related to the expansion of our joint venture owned domestic distribution center, $15.3 million related to investments in our direct-to-consumer technologies and retail stores, and $10 million related to our new, now fully operational distribution centers in China and the United Kingdom. \u2047 Our capital investments remain focused on supporting our strategic priorities, growing our direct-to-consumer business, as well as expanding the presence of our brand internationally. \u2047 For the remainder of 2021, we expect total capital expenditures to be between $80 million and $110 million. \u2047 Now I will turn to guidance. \u2047 Given the severe supply chain constraints we experienced throughout the third quarter, which we believe will continue for the remainder of the year and into the"], "gold_summary": ["skechers q3 earnings per share $0.66.
