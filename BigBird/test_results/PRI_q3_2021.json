{"article": ["Joining our call today are our Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Williams; and our Chief Financial Officer, Alison Rand. \u2047 We will also reference certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe will provide additional insight in the company's operations. \u2047 Our strong results continue to reflect our ability to adapt to the changing business environment. \u2047 Since the emergence of COVID-19, Primerica has been educating and assisting clients in choosing the right protection products to meet their family's insurance needs. \u2047 As a reaction to the pandemic phase, we are helping guide clients' investment decisions and assisting families as they prepare for a more financially secure future. \u2047 These last 18 months are a perfect example of the balance and resilience of our business model. \u2047 I'm proud how quickly our sales force is adapted to a combination of virtual and in-person client interactions to continue serving middle-income families when they need us most. \u2047 Over the same 18 months, we've delivered on our strategic goal of expanding our product offerings. \u2047 We moved from pilot to full rollout of the new mortgage business, which continues to grow as we gain experience. \u2047 We also launched our senior health referral program during the third quarter, further rounding out a balanced product platform to help clients through every financial step of their life journey. \u2047 Looking at the third quarter, we continue to set new records with Investment and Savings sales up more than 50% year-over-year. \u2047 At $8.7 billion, total sales during the first 9 months of 2021 have already eclipsed full year 2020 levels, and we're on pace to break $10 billion in annual sales for the first time in our history. \u2047 As anticipated, sales in our Term Life segment have started to normalize versus their COVID peak. \u2047 And while sales are down versus the record levels, we forecast full year sales to be about 10% above pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 We also expect to surpass $900 billion of face amount in force by the end of the year, another milestone in our corporate history. \u2047 Starting on Slide 3, adjusted operating revenues of $692 million increased 22% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and diluted adjusted operating income per share of $2.98 increased 7%. \u2047 These results include an adjusted net operating loss of $4.6 million or $0.12 per diluted adjusted operating earnings per share for our newly acquired interest in e-TeleQuote. \u2047 ROAE at 24.1% during the quarter remained strong. \u2047 Turning to Slide 4. \u2047 We added nearly 92,000 new recruits during the quarter, down from the third quarter of last year when focus and urgency driven by the pandemic created tailwind. \u2047 It's worth noting that recruiting remains strong compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 We believe our success and proven track record continue to make our business opportunity attractive to aspiring entrepreneurs. \u2047 Disruption and discontent in the job market create more people looking for alternatives to their current career paths, and these individuals may be interested in joining our business. \u2047 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the process for licensing new recruits has been impaired. \u2047 Early on, the impact was overshadowed by states implementing short-term accommodations. \u2047 Now that these programs have ended, current licensing numbers reflect the difficulties. \u2047 Key among the issues is the difficulty in getting new recruits to complete training class. \u2047 In-person classroom training provides the greatest completion rates. \u2047 However, distractions associated with the reopening of the economy and a degree of hesitancy by some to congregating classrooms is impeding progress. \u2047 Online training alternatives offer ease of access, but often do not have high completion rates due to their lack of disciplined and accountability. \u2047 We continue to adapt in order to overcome this dilemma by offering more classroom options that appeal to a variety of schedules, increasing our messaging and incentives and better equipping our field leaders to overcome resistance. \u2047 A total of 9,381 individuals obtained a new life license during the quarter, which is below our historical pull-through rate. \u2047 We believe this is a reflection of the current COVID environment rather than an underlying challenge in our ability to get new recruits licensed. \u2047 A key part of our messaging to the field leadership includes the importance of keeping new recruits engaged and moving toward a permanent license. \u2047 We ended September with approximately 130,000 Life licensed representatives included in the total of about 800 individuals with either a co-contemporary license or a license with an extended renewal date. \u2047 As we noted last quarter, we now expect the majority of these licenses to age out, placing the normalized size of the sales force around 129,200. \u2047 Normalizing all periods to provide an apples-to-apples comparison, we ended June 2021 with 129,600 life licenses and December 2020 with 130,700 life licenses. \u2047 At this time, we expect to end 2021 with a sales force size roughly equal to the prior year end's normalized number, which would be a significant achievement given the numerous challenges we've navigated. \u2047 Turning to the next slide to review our Life Insurance segment. \u2047 While a pullback from COVID heightened sales levels was expected, we also believe that clients continue to place a higher value on financial protection for their families as sales remained above their pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 During the third quarter, we issued nearly 76,000 new life insurance policies with productivity at 0.19 policies per life license representative per month well within our historical range. \u2047 Total face amount of $894 billion in force rose 6% year-over-year. \u2047 We project fourth quarter sales to decline between 13% and 15% year-over-year. \u2047 While full year results would be down approximately 8% versus 2020's elevated levels, it will still represent more than a 10% increase over pre-COVID 2019 full year results. \u2047 Highlights from our Investment and Savings Products segment are presented on Slide 6. \u2047 Sales of $2.8 billion were up 52% year-over-year. \u2047 The strength of equity markets continues to support investors' confidence to invest for the future. \u2047 Solid demand persisted across all our investment products, including mutual funds, annuities and managed accounts. \u2047 Net inflows of $1 billion during the quarter remained well above historical levels. \u2047 Despite these robust inflows, significant equity market volatility during the quarter kept ending asset levels largely unchanged versus June levels. \u2047 Barring an unexpected change in market sentiment, we expect the fourth quarter investment sales to grow between 20% and 25% year-over-year and more than 40% full year 2021 versus 2020. \u2047 As I noted earlier, we've made significant strides in expanding our product offering over the last 2 years. \u2047 In our new mortgage business, we continue to make steady progress and are now actively doing business in 17 states through more than 1,200 license representatives. \u2047 We have closed nearly $1 billion in U.S. mortgage volume through the third quarter of this year, eclipsing the $442.5 million closed in the entire 12 months of 2020. \u2047 During the third quarter, we started to roll out the senior health referral program to Primerica representatives. \u2047 We've had broad acceptance of the launch from field leaders and Primerica reps are excited about how well the program serves their clients' needs. \u2047 We're seeing encouraging lead generation results since the Medicare annual election period began in mid-October. \u2047 After our first quarter of ownership, we were excited by the opportunities and are gaining experience in leading our senior health business. \u2047 Current headwinds caused by labor market issues have caused e-TeleQuote to experience recruiting and retention issues with the Senior Health sales center employees. \u2047 Given the lower staffing levels coming into AEP, we expect fourth quarter approved policy levels to be around 36,000 to 40,000 or approximately double third quarter levels. \u2047 We believe this labor market imbalance is temporary and expect the return to more favorable conditions, which will improve our ability to attract quality agents that are essential to scaling the e-TeleQuote business. \u2047 We're investing in technology and talent consistent with our pre-acquisition plans. \u2047 We believe in the long-term attractiveness of both e-TeleQuote and the senior health industry, and we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of this growing market. \u2047 As we look forward to 2022, we have confidence that we will continue to thrive in any business environment and be better positioned for ongoing success. \u2047 Our plans for the new year include a powerful live senior field leader event in early January to set an energetic tone for the year. \u2047 In June, we returned to the Mercedes-Benz Stadium for our biannual convention and the opportunity to cast our vision for the future, introduce product improvements and recognize our success. \u2047 Today, I will take you through third quarter results, including those for our new Senior Health segment, and highlight key additions to our financial metrics and disclosures introduced as part of the acquisition of 80% of e-TeleQuote on July 1. \u2047 Starting on Slide 7 with our Term Life segment, Topline growth remained strong with operating revenues up 12% to $401 million, driven by 13% growth in adjusted direct premiums. \u2047 The compounding impact of 18 months strong sales and policy persistency continues to drive adjusted direct premium growth and added $12 million pre-tax income during the quarter. \u2047 This compares to $5 million added in the prior year period. \u2047 Third quarter net COVID-related death claims were $14 million, up from $8 million in the prior year period. \u2047 This was above our prior estimate as the Delta wave led to higher COVID-related population deaths in the U.S. and Canada. \u2047 The rate of COVID mortality in our insured population also increased from around 11 million to 14 million per 100,000 deaths. \u2047 The increased rate was largely driven by deaths impacting younger individuals who are more heavily represented in our insured population and higher volume of claims in states where vaccination rates have been low. \u2047 COVID claims continue to be linked to older policies with less than 1% of claims coming from policies issued since the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 We incurred about $2 million of excess death claims in the quarter, not specifically identified as COVID, but that we believe are indirectly tied to the pandemic, either through delayed medical care, societal issues such as crime or the behavioral health crisis. \u2047 We continue to monitor our experience for any emerging long-term trends. \u2047 From a P&L perspective, this excess mortality was fully offset by a reduction in the reserves held for policy riders that provide for premiums to be waived if an individual becomes disabled. \u2047 Main drivers of the reductions were higher death claims in the waived population, along with expanding our third-party disability claims management to include Canada. \u2047 During the third quarter, lapses remained around 25% to 30% lower in pre-COVID levels for all durations except duration one, which was about 15% lower. \u2047 Compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, DAC amortization was favorable by $11 million, offset by $6 million in higher benefit reserves due to strong persistency for a net favorable impact of $5 million to pre-tax income. \u2047 The third quarter of 2020 experienced record persistency with lapses around 35% lower than pre-COVID across all durations, including Duration one for a net contribution to pre-tax income of $14 million. \u2047 Last year, we highlighted that these levels were unsustainable and as such, expected lapses to normalize over time. \u2047 Year-over-year DAC amortization was higher by $11 million and benefit reserves were lower by $2 million due to persistency changes with the increase in DAC amortization largely driven by duration one. \u2047 Given the higher COVID-related death claims and lower net contribution provided by persistency, pre-tax income growth was compressed to 2% year-over-year with margins remaining around 20%. \u2047 Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted direct premiums to grow by approximately 12% year-over-year and future growth rates to taper as we layer our new business and transact the pre-pandemic activity levels. \u2047 COVID-related deaths are estimated at $14 million based on 100,000 projected population deaths in the U.S. and Canada. \u2047 We expect strong persistency to continue lapses that are 20% to 25% lower than pre-pandemic levels across all durations except duration 1, where we expect lapses to be around 15% lower. \u2047 This translates to a similar persistency-related impact as seen this quarter. \u2047 We do not expect the new business assumption review performed annually in the fourth quarter to have a notable impact on earnings. \u2047 Overall, we anticipate Term Life margins in the range of 19% to 20% for the fourth quarter. \u2047 Turning next to the results of the ISP segment on Slide 8. \u2047 Operating revenues of $233 million increased $57 million or 32% year-over-year. \u2047 Our pre-tax income of $69 million increased 35%. \u2047 Third quarter results continue to reflect the combined benefit of strong sales volumes across all products and the positive impact of equity market appreciation. \u2047 Sales-based revenues increased 45%, slightly slowed the growth in revenue-generating sales due to a higher proportion of sales volumes in large dollar trades, which have a lower commission rate. \u2047 Asset-based revenues increased 31%, reflecting a similar increase in average client asset value. \u2047 Both sales and asset-based commission expenses increased in line with the associated revenue. \u2047 As Glenn mentioned, we expect fourth quarter ISP sales to grow between 20% and 25% year-over-year. \u2047 Based on the current sales mix, this would increase sales-based net revenue by approximately $4 million over the prior year period. \u2047 Assuming no significant market movement during the quarter, average assets under management would be approximately 20% higher year-over-year and asset-based net revenues would increase $7 million. \u2047 Turning to Slide 9. \u2047 This quarter, we are introducing our Senior Health segment as a result of the acquisition of 80% of e-TeleQuote. \u2047 The acquisition is being counted for as a business combination in accordance with GAAP, which generally requires the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired to be recorded as goodwill. \u2047 The table on Slide 9 shows the preliminary purchase price allocation, which is subject to change at fair values of the net assets acquired or finalized. \u2047 The most significant assets acquired were renewal commissions receivable for policies sold by e-TeleQuote prior to the acquisition date and identified intangible assets. \u2047 The key identified intangible asset is relationships with health insurance carriers of $159 million, which will be amortized over its estimated useful life of 15 years. \u2047 In the current period, we had intangible amortization expense of $2.9 million related to acquired intangible assets recognized in the operating results of our Senior Health segment. \u2047 The e-TeleQuote purchase agreement provides for the payment of contingent consideration in the form of earn-out payments"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted operating earnings per share $2.98.  \u2047  q3 revenue rose 22 percent to $693.2 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3 adjusted earnings per share $2.98.  \u2047  q3 adjusted
