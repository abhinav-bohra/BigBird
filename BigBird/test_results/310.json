{"article": ["Please go to slide two. \u2047 Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. \u2047 As we do each quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes upfront on our focused sustainability strategy, the engine that enables us to deliver differentiated shareholder returns over time. \u2047 Long-term sustainability megatrends continue to intensify, and our innovation leadership is transforming the climate industry as the world decarbonizes. \u2047 Our aggressive goals and bold actions can dramatically reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the world's progress. \u2047 This is more critical every day as the clock is ticking on climate change. \u2047 That's why we are calling for businesses and governments to take stronger action at COP26 and why we continue to set aggressive science-based emission reduction targets to push our innovation further and faster. \u2047 That innovation also extends to emerging trends as we see heightened focus on indoor air quality and strong momentum in aging infrastructure in our schools. \u2047 We continue to make a difference consistently, relentlessly and over the long term. \u2047 This unyielding approach drives market outgrowth over the long term, which in turn helps us drive strong margins and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. \u2047 The end result is more value across the board for our customers, for our team, for our shareholders and for the planet. \u2047 Moving to slide number four. \u2047 Our global team delivered solid execution in the third quarter, and we continue to target top quartile earnings per share growth for 2021. \u2047 Bookings were once again exceptional in Q3, building on strong growth in both Q1 and Q2 and bringing our year-to-date organic bookings growth to over 25% for the enterprise. \u2047 Underlying demand for our innovative products and services have never been stronger, and our Q3 ending backlog reflects this strength. \u2047 In fact, Q3 ending backlog for the enterprise is up more than 70% or approximately $2 billion from year-end 2020 with all three of our business segments at record levels. \u2047 Americas and EMEA have backlog that are up over 90% and 65%, respectively, from year-end 2020. \u2047 We're well positioned to close out 2021 on a strong note and to enter 2022 with unprecedented levels of backlog as well. \u2047 As we highlighted on our second quarter earnings call and in subsequent forums, global supply chains, logistics systems and labor markets remain tight, and inflation is persistent. \u2047 Our global teams are focused on meeting the unique needs of our wide-ranging customer base and helping them solve complex challenges on a daily basis as we navigate a challenging yet positive demand and supply environment. \u2047 Temporary supply chain delays on key materials impacted portions of our product portfolio, shifting the timing of approximately $150 million or 4% of our revenue out of the third quarter and into future periods. \u2047 Working closely with our key suppliers and with our customers, we anticipate that between $50 million and $75 million or roughly 2% of the Q3 impact will shift into the fourth quarter, leaving our 2021 revenue guidance unchanged. \u2047 We expect the remaining balance to shift into 2022. \u2047 We also highlighted on our second quarter earnings call that persistent inflation would require us to execute an incremental $150 million in pricing actions in the second half of the year in order to neutralize the impact. \u2047 Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to keep pace with the inflationary curve. \u2047 In the third quarter, we realized approximately $150 million or 4.3% incremental price, offsetting approximately $150 million of inflation. \u2047 Leverage was negligible as you would expect on flat volume. \u2047 While adjusted operating income was modestly higher in the quarter, primarily reflecting nominal pull-through on M&A and FX growth, consistent with our expectations and our guidance. \u2047 We continue to execute the business transformation projects we discussed in detail at our Investor Day in December and are on track to deliver approximately $90 million of incremental savings in 2021. \u2047 These savings support leading innovation across our end markets through relentless high levels of business reinvestment. \u2047 They also enable us to stay on track to deliver incremental margins of approximately 30% organic for fiscal 2021 despite persistent inflation, tight logistics systems and supply chain challenges. \u2047 We're also on track to deliver powerful free cash flow of equal to or greater than 100% of net earnings. \u2047 This provides us with strong optionality to deploy significant cash to opportunities now and in the future, including M&A and share repurchases. \u2047 Lastly, we never lose sight of our long-term, purpose-driven strategy and the tremendous leadership role we can play in bending the curve on climate change. \u2047 By changing the industry, we can change the world. \u2047 Executing our purpose-driven strategy is how we will continue to deliver top-tier financial performance for our shareholders. \u2047 While we're still in the midst of our planning process for 2022 and anticipate providing guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings call, we thought it might be constructive to spend a few minutes discussing our initial thoughts on 2022 and some of the key dynamics we believe will be in play. \u2047 While this is not a comprehensive list, it will highlight some of the key reasons why we're so excited about what the future holds for Trane Technologies as well as some of the key challenges we see on the road ahead. \u2047 First, we expect to have strong fundamentals entering the year. \u2047 Exiting Q3, backlog in our Americas and EMEA segments are both at unprecedented levels, up over 90% and up over 65% versus December of 2020, respectively. \u2047 Asia also has record backlog, up nearly 20%. \u2047 If we very conservatively plot out bookings through the balance of 2021, we anticipate entering 2022 with at least 70% more backlog in the Americas and EMEA than we entered 2020. \u2047 I've been in this business a long time, and I've never entered any year with a stronger backlog position, which bodes well for us in 2022. \u2047 Another fundamental strength entering 2022 is the foundation of our business operating system. \u2047 Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to stay ahead of the persistent inflation through 2021 and position us well to manage additional inflationary pressures and deliver strong price realization again in 2022. \u2047 And we'll continue to drive transformation savings in 2022 that will support high levels of business reinvestment and continued innovation. \u2047 These savings will also support healthy incremental margins in what we expect to be another year of tight conditions for supply chain, labor markets and logistics systems. \u2047 Looking out to 2022, we also expect to see continued acceleration of the strong secular sustainability megatrends that are so tightly aligned with our purpose-driven business strategy. \u2047 Decarbonization of the built environment is accelerating. \u2047 U.S. education stimulus dollars are being put to good use, upgrading our aging infrastructure. \u2047 And momentum around indoor air quality upgrades, retrofits and new projects continues. \u2047 Additionally, the global economy is expected to continue to recover in 2022 with solid underlying GDP and other economic indicators driving broader expansion in the nonresidential markets. \u2047 Lastly, we're excited about the future of transport refrigeration markets where ACT and IHS are plotting a steady growth path forward in both 2022 and 2023. \u2047 All in, we're exceptionally well positioned for strong performance in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Customer demand for our innovative climate control products and services continues to grow. \u2047 We delivered another quarter of robust organic bookings growth, up 20% with growth across all segments and business units. \u2047 Customer demand has been high all year, with organic bookings up over 25% year-to-date, driving record backlog in each segment. \u2047 Organic revenues were also up 4%, driven by continued strong price execution. \u2047 Our Americas commercial HVAC business delivered robust bookings growth in the quarter with orders up over 30%. \u2047 Strength was broad-based with applied and unitary bookings both up more than 50% and service bookings up high teens. \u2047 Demand for system-focused indoor air quality solutions remain strong and contributed to our mid-single-digit revenue growth in commercial HVAC Americas. \u2047 The residential HVAC markets continue to be strong, and our residential team delivered low single-digit bookings growth, building on nearly 40% growth in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Revenues were flat in the quarter as demand outpaced supply. \u2047 And we entered the fourth quarter with record backlog, up more than 150% year-over-year and up from prior record backlog at the end of the second quarter. \u2047 With year-to-date organic bookings up over 80% and year-to-date organic revenue up over 30%, our Americas transport refrigeration business is significantly outperforming the North America transport markets. \u2047 During the third quarter, with most of 2021 orders already in the backlog, we opened up our 2022 order book solely for the first quarter of 2022, which drove bookings growth of more than 20%. \u2047 We are methodically managing our 2022 order book in order to mitigate inflationary risks. \u2047 Organic revenues were also strong, up low to mid-teens. \u2047 We continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. \u2047 Our EMEA teams delivered 25% organic bookings growth in the quarter with strong growth in both commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. \u2047 Revenues were also strong, up 8%, led by high-teens organic revenue growth in transport refrigeration. \u2047 Our Asia Pacific team delivered bookings growth of 11%. \u2047 Revenue grew 1% in the quarter. \u2047 Though we saw growth in China during the quarter, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be challenging in the region with low vaccination rates in some countries. \u2047 Organic revenue growth in the quarter was driven by continued strong price execution, yielding 4.3% incremental price in the quarter. \u2047 Price over material inflation was positive in the quarter and combined with mix offset the net impact of productivity over other inflation and increased investment spending to support leading innovation. \u2047 Organic volume and, therefore, pull-through leverage was largely flat for the enterprise in the quarter. \u2047 At a high level, positive leverage was primarily the result of mix and a modest flow-through of M&A and FX, consistent with our guidance. \u2047 Net adjusted EBITDA and operating margins declined by 70 and 60 basis points, respectively. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share grew 5%, driven primarily by higher adjusted operating income. \u2047 We discussed the key revenue and margin dynamics for the enterprise on the prior page. \u2047 The dynamics impacting revenue and margins were similar across each of our business segments, as we've highlighted here, with strong price realization, productivity inflation and higher investments in innovation as consistent drivers. \u2047 In EMEA, solid price realization was accompanied by strong volume growth, delivering good leverage and margin expansion in the quarter. \u2047 Both the Americas and Asia Pacific segments delivered higher revenues on modest volume declines impacting leverage. \u2047 Asia Pacific also experienced price versus cost headwinds in the quarter, further impacting margins. \u2047 We continue to expect Asia Pacific to deliver solid margin expansion for the full year and are pleased with our overall performance in the region. \u2047 Commercial HVAC Americas has significantly outperformed the broader markets over a number of years through strong focus, agility and execution combined with relentless innovation for our customers. \u2047 These defining characteristics compounded by the strength in the underlying market conditions power the business forward today, yielding bookings growth of over 30% in the quarter, an exceptional backlog entering Q4. \u2047 Bookings strength was universal across nearly every vertical market and major product category. \u2047 End markets continue to improve. \u2047 Vaccination rates are improving. \u2047 And end market indicators are generally strong, with ABI over 50 since February and a healthy GDP. \u2047 Data centers and warehouse demand remain strong. \u2047 Education and healthcare end market demand is also growing. \u2047 We're benefiting from increased demand across our K-12 customers with federal stimulus funds supporting both current and more importantly, future growth. \u2047 We see this as a multiyear tailwind for our business given our strong position in the education market and our direct sales force with deep relationships in this vertical. \u2047 Our residential end markets remain strong. \u2047 As I mentioned previously, we delivered low single-digit bookings growth in the quarter, compounding on nearly 40% growth in the prior year. \u2047 And we are entering the fourth quarter with unprecedented backlog. \u2047 I'm proud of our residential team that has continued to meet customer demand while ramping capacity after our February weather event in our Texas facility. \u2047 The team delivered historically high revenues in Q3 and is on track for capacity expansion in advance of next year's cooling season. \u2047 Turning to Americas transport. \u2047 We're significantly outgrowing strong end markets in 2021. \u2047 ACT market forecasts are projecting strong growth in 2022 and 2023 as well. \u2047 I'll talk more about the transport outlook in our topics of interest section. \u2047 Economic conditions are improving across the region. \u2047 We expect continued improvement for the remainder of the year with increased vaccination rates supporting the opening of an increased number and variety of venues. \u2047 Transport markets have been strengthening throughout the year, and we're on track to outperform end markets in 2021 as evidenced by our year-to-date performance. \u2047 We expect growth in China in 2021, supported by increased vaccination rates and strength in data centers, electronics, pharmaceutical and healthcare. \u2047 Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with vaccination and economic recovery rates still low in some countries. \u2047 Given all the puts and takes we've discussed today, our guidance for 2021 is unchanged. \u2047 Importantly, we continue to see our 2021 adjusted earnings per share growth guidance of more than 30% as top quartile among peers in the broader industrials. \u2047 We've discussed the shift in revenues from Q3 into Q4 and 2022 throughout the call. \u2047 Our fourth quarter revenues are supported by record backlog, and that backlog is firm. \u2047 Supply chain, labor and logistics systems will continue to be challenging and are the limiting factor to potential upside, not demand or backlog. \u2047 We also continue to expect free cash flow to remain strong and equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. \u2047 Please go to slide number 11. \u2047 As we outlined during our investor event in December, we're on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings by 2023, including $90 million in 2021. \u2047 Importantly, we continue to invest these cost savings to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. \u2047 This consistent investment strengthens our high-performance flywheel, which has a reinforcing and compounding effect over time. \u2047 Please go to slide number 12. \u2047 We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy that is focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. \u2047 First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. \u2047 Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly reported
