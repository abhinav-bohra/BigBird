{"article": ["As always, we appreciate your interest in Central Pacific Financial Corp. \u2047 The start of 2021 is a very exciting time for Central Pacific. \u2047 We are pleased to announce that we have successfully completed our RISE2020 initiative, which positions us extremely well in the current environment and for the future. \u2047 We also completed our RISE2020 milestone on digital banking with the new online and mobile banking platforms that launched in the third quarter and the completion of our full ATM network upgrade in the fourth quarter. \u2047 This is part of an exciting new brand design that we just launched. \u2047 The new brand reflects both the Company's unique history and our bright future ahead. \u2047 We had strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020. \u2047 While net income was impacted by one-time expenses and higher provisions for credit losses, our core pre-tax pre-provision earnings were solid. \u2047 We continue to thoroughly review and regularly monitor our loan portfolio to appropriately manage the credit risk in the pandemic environment. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, our total balance of loans on payment deferrals decreased significantly and was down to 3% of total loans, excluding PPP loans at year-end. \u2047 Finally, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share and approved a new share repurchase authorization. \u2047 The State of Hawaii continues to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We are vaccinating our residents as quickly as possible and have worked through the first tier of first responders and frontline medical workers. \u2047 We have recently opened two mass vaccination sites in Honolulu, as we move to the next tier, which includes the elderly population. \u2047 Our COVID infection rate in the State of Hawaii is currently the second-lowest in the nation on a per capita basis. \u2047 The tourism economies remained open with the requirement for a negative COVID test to avoid quarantine. \u2047 The daily visitor arrival counts have recently been in the 5,000 to 8,000 range per day, but is still significantly down compared to a year ago. \u2047 We are optimistic that with the mass vaccination initiative we will start to see a Hawaii economic recovery in 2021. \u2047 At Central Pacific, we continue to operate with the highest standards of health, safety and social distancing. \u2047 We've successfully consolidated four branches into neighboring branches in 2020, three of which were in-store branches that had too small of a footprint for adequate social distancing. \u2047 We expect to retain customers and deposits from these closed branches as we continue to provide exceptional service at our other branches and through our digital channels. \u2047 Much of our back office teams continue to work flexible remote schedules and all employees are required to complete a daily online health questionnaire prior to starting work each day. \u2047 We believe the actions we've taken will continue to enable us to provide a safe environment for both our employees and customers. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, excluding PPP loan pay-offs of $112 million, the bank grew its loan portfolio by $46 million, driven by growth in commercial, construction, residential mortgages, HELOC and commercial mortgages. \u2047 Our residential lending team continues to outperform with record levels of production, resulting in $5.4 million in mortgage banking income for the quarter. \u2047 For the 2020-year, mortgage banking income was $13.7 million, which was more than double the income from the previous year, augmented by over $1 billion in loan production. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we received and processed a significant amount of PPP forgiveness applications, which resulted in the recognition of $5.4 million in fee income. \u2047 We continue to process PPP forgiveness applications and recently started accepting new PPP loan applications for both first draw and second draw loans from our business customers. \u2047 Additionally, our team continues to engage and remain steadfast in our support of our customers and for the broader business community impacted by COVID-19. \u2047 Core deposits during the fourth quarter increased by $132 million, which is consistent with year-end seasonal inflows augmented by our front-line business development efforts. \u2047 For the 2020 year, core deposits increased by $787 million. \u2047 Additionally, our cost of total deposits declined by 4 basis points from the prior quarter and is now down to 9 basis points. \u2047 Providing best-in-class digital technology for our customers remain the key priority for us. \u2047 In 2020, we launched our new consumer mobile and online platforms and completed the rollout of our new ATM fleet. \u2047 We are seeing strong adoption and utilization of these new digital tools by our customers. \u2047 And just yesterday, we launched a new platform that will allow our customers and other consumers to open a new personal checking or savings account online or apply for a consumer loan online. \u2047 Our team is laser-focused on adding additional digital products and services this year and we look forward to updating you in the coming quarters. \u2047 At year-end, the loan portfolio totaled $4.96 billion with 55% consumer and 45% commercial. \u2047 During the quarter, we continued to monitor the loan portfolio and provided support to our customers as they continue to navigate through the ongoing changes in the marketplace. \u2047 We assisted our customers by providing additional loan payment deferrals as needed and we were pleased to see a significant number of borrowers resume making their monthly loan payments. \u2047 At quarter-end, the total balance of loans on payment deferrals declined to $120 million or 3% of the total loan portfolio, excluding PPP balances. \u2047 Our redeferral rate was 15% and was primarily driven by residential loans where payment deferrals were extended to nine months. \u2047 During the quarter, we saw a significant decline in consumer loans on deferral as customers returned to making loan payments. \u2047 Of the approximately 4,200 consumer loans that returned to payments, only 7% are granted a short-term loan modifications with 93% resuming payment at contractual terms. \u2047 In the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios, the total balance of loans on payments deferrals declined to $47 million or 1% of the total loan portfolio, excluding PPP balances. \u2047 The highest exposure by industry continues to be Real Estate and Rental & Leasing totaling $33 million, a decline of $14 million sequential quarter. \u2047 The loans in the Real Estate and Rental & Leasing industry are supported by low loan-to-value ratios. \u2047 The majority of these borrowers are expected to resume making loan payments at the end of their six month loan payment deferrals. \u2047 Loan payment deferrals for our high-risk industries totaled $12 million or 0.3% of the total loan portfolio, excluding PPP balances. \u2047 As of January 20th, our total balance of loans on payment deferrals decreased further to $101 million or 3% of total loans, excluding PPP balances. \u2047 Additional details on our loan payment deferrals can be found on Slides 20 and 21. \u2047 During the quarter, criticized loans declined by $4.5 million sequential quarter to $192 million or 4.2% of the total loan portfolio, excluding PPP balances. \u2047 Special mention loans declined by $6.3 million to $142 million or 3.1% of the total loan portfolio, excluding PPP balances and classified loans increased by $1.7 million to $50 million or 1.1% of the total loan portfolios, excluding PPP balances. \u2047 We sold a classified and non-accrual commercial real estate loan at par of $4.2 million and settled a payoff of another classified and non-accruals commercial real estate and commercial loan at 92[Phonetic] or $2.9 million. \u2047 Approximately 32% of special mention balances and 10% of classified balances also received PPP loans. \u2047 Additional details on loans rated special mention and classified can be found on Slides 22 and 23. \u2047 Overall, we continue to believe our proactive approach to working with our customers and our disciplined credit management and diversified loan portfolio has allowed us to remain strong and our asset quality to remain stable through these unprecedented time. \u2047 This will continue to serve us well into the future. \u2047 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $12.2 million or $0.43 per diluted share. \u2047 Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 74 basis points and return on average equity was 8.87%. \u2047 For the full 2020 year, net income was $37.3 million or $1.32 per diluted share. \u2047 Return on average assets was 0.58% and return on average equity was 6.85%. \u2047 Pre-tax pre-provision earnings for 2020 was $88.2 million compared to $84.2 million in 2019. \u2047 2020 pre-tax pre-provision earnings were the highest CPF has generated since the Great Recession. \u2047 Our 2020 earnings were impacted by higher provision for credit loss expense due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Additionally, in the fourth quarter, there were several one-time expenses which totaled $5.9 million. \u2047 Net interest income for the fourth quarter was $51.5 million, which increased from the prior quarter due to accelerated recognition of PPP's fee income as PPP loans were forgiven by the SBA. \u2047 Net interest income included $6.3 million in PPP net interest income and net loan fees compared to $3.4 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 The net interest margin increased to 3.32% in the fourth quarter compared to 3.19% in the prior quarter. \u2047 The increase was due to the aforementioned PPP fee income recognition. \u2047 The NIM normalized for PPP was 3.17 in the fourth quarter compared to 3.26 in the prior quarter. \u2047 The decrease is due to lower loan and investment yields and the new subordinated debt interest expense. \u2047 Fourth quarter other operating income totaled $14.1 million compared $11.6 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 The increase was primarily due to higher mortgage banking income of $1.1 million sequential quarter. \u2047 Additionally, in the current quarter, we realized a gain on sale of securities of $0.2 million compared to a loss on sale of securities of $0.4 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 Other operating expense for the fourth quarter was $45.1 million, which was an increase of $8.1 million compared to the prior quarter. \u2047 The increase was largely driven by one-time expenses totaling $5.9 million which related to employee incentives and benefits, branch consolidation costs, litigation settlement, debt prepayment fees, and other one-time expense accruals. \u2047 Additionally, in the current quarter, there was higher deferred compensation expense related to equity-market volatility and higher computer software expense related to our technology initiative. \u2047 The efficiency ratio increased to 68.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 60.9% in the previous quarter, primarily due to the one-time expenses. \u2047 Excluding one-time expenses of $5.9 million, the fourth quarter efficiency ratio would have been 59.8%. \u2047 Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter totalled $1.8 million compared to net charge-offs of $1.3 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 At December 31st, our allowance for credit losses was $83.3 million or 1.83% of outstanding loans, excluding PPP loans. \u2047 This compares to 1.79% coverage as of the prior quarter-end. \u2047 The buildup of credit reserves was largely driven by the economic forecast utilized in our CECL methodology. \u2047 The effective tax rate was 23.7% in the fourth quarter. \u2047 And going forward, we expect the ETR to continue to be in the 24% to 26% range. \u2047 Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong and we continue to perform robust stress testing. \u2047 With the $55 million subordinated note offering we completed in the fourth quarter, our CPF total risk-based capital ratio increased to 15.2% as of December 31st. \u2047 In summary, Central Pacific continues to make positive forward progress on our strategy, while at the same time managed well through the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We have a solid financial, credit, liquidity and capital position. \u2047 As the economic recovery gradually begins, we remain committed to supporting our employees, customers and the community. \u2047 At this time, we'll be happy to address any questions you may have. \u2047
