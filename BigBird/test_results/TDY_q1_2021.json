{"article": ["This is Jason VanWees, Executive Vice President. \u2047 We began 2021 with the best first quarter sales, earnings, operating margin and cash flow in the Company's history. \u2047 Furthermore, we achieved these GAAP results despite incurring $39 million or $0.79 per share of expenses related to the pending acquisition of FLIR. \u2047 Excluding these non-recurring charges, earnings increased 39.2% compared to last year. \u2047 Operating margin increased 426 basis points and free cash flow nearly doubled. \u2047 In addition, I'm very pleased with the breadth of our financial performance across Teledyne. \u2047 Year-over-year sales increased in nearly every major business category except commercial aerospace, which is now only 4% of our total sales. \u2047 The recovery in our short cycle commercial business is unfolding nicely and our government businesses are also growing and performing well, in both cases, strongest within our Digital Imaging segment. \u2047 Also in the first quarter, we received all time record orders with a book to bill of 1.15x resulting in quarter-end backlog of approximately $1.8 billion. \u2047 Given our strong first quarter, we now think a reasonable outlook for the total company organic sales growth in 2021 is approximately 6% led by forecasted growth of about 10% in Digital Imaging excluding FLIR. \u2047 And now with respect to the fair acquisition over the last few months while transaction certainty progressively increased, Teledyne performed in-person visits covering 90% of all FLIR on-site several on multiple occasion. \u2047 Most importantly, we were also granted access to the operating management in all key functional areas. \u2047 To summarize, FLIR's people, products, technology and manufacturing are outstanding. \u2047 I am now even more excited about the prospect for FLIR as part of the Teledyne family. \u2047 We remain confident of immediate pre-tax annual synergies greater than $40 million having continue to expect, earnings per share accretion even on a GAAP basis in 2022 with earnings per share accretion, excluding amortization being substantially greater. \u2047 Al will now comment on the performance of our four business segments. \u2047 In our Instrumentation segment, overall, first quarter sales increased 0.5% versus last year. \u2047 Sales of environmental instruments increased 5% from last year. \u2047 Sales of most product categories increased with the strongest year-over-year organic growth resulting from the gas and flame detection products acquired in 2019. \u2047 Sales of our electronic, test and measurement systems increased 4.8% year-over-year. \u2047 Sales of marine instrumentation decreased 6.7% in the quarter. \u2047 However operating profit increased due to aggressive cost management and business simplification and standardization initiatives. \u2047 Overall, instrument segment operating margin increased 291 basis points to 20.7%. \u2047 Turning to Digital Imaging segment. \u2047 First quarter sales increased 6.7%. \u2047 GAAP segment operating margin was 19.7%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 Now turning to the Aerospace and Defense Electronics segment, first quarter sales declined 3.3% as greater defense sales were more than offset by a 28.5% decline in sales of commercial aerospace products. \u2047 GAAP segment operating margin increased over 1,000 basis points to 18.7% versus 8.6% in 2020. \u2047 In the Engineered Systems segment, first quarter revenue increased 8% primarily due to greater sales from defense and other manufacturing programs as well as electronic manufacturing services products. \u2047 Segment operating margin increased 242 basis points when compared with last year. \u2047 I will first discuss some additional financials for the quarter not covered by Robert and Al, and then I will discuss our second quarter and full year 2021 outlook. \u2047 In the first quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $124.9 million compared with cash flow of $76.4 million for the same period of 2020. \u2047 Record first quarter free cash flow, that is cash from operating activities less capital expenditures was $107.3 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with $56.2 million in 2020. \u2047 Excluding after-tax cash payments related to the FLIR transaction first quarter free cash flow was $110.1 million. \u2047 Capital expenditures were $17.6 million in the first quarter compared to $20.2 million for the same period of 2020. \u2047 Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.3 million for both the first quarters of 2021 and 2020. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $9.1 million of net debt that is approximately $3.24 billion of debt less cash of approximately $3.23 billion. \u2047 The higher cash and debt balances at April 4, 2021, including the proceeds of debt incurred to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the FLIR test acquisition. \u2047 Stock option compensation expense was $4.2 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $7.4 million for the same period of 2020. \u2047 Turning to our outlook, management currently believes that earnings per share in the second quarter of 2021 will be in the range of $2.85 to $2.95 per share and for the full year 2021, our earnings per share outlook is $12 to $12.20. \u2047 In each case, these do not reflect the pending acquisition of FLIR and related acquisition and financing costs. \u2047 The 2021 full year estimated tax rate, excluding discrete items is expected to be 22.6%. \u2047 In addition, we currently expect less discrete tax items in 2021 compared with 2020. \u2047 I will now pass the call back to Robert. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["sees q2
