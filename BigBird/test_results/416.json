{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Gene Lee, Darden's Chairman and CEO; Rick Cardinas, President and COO; and Raj Vennam, CFO. \u2047 Any reference to pre-COVID when discussing second quarter performance is a comparison to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. \u2047 This is because last year's results are not meaningful due to the pandemic's impact on the business and the limited capacity environment that we operated in during the second quarter quarter of fiscal '21. \u2047 We plan to release fiscal 2022 third quarter earnings on Thursday, March 24 before the market opens followed by a conference call. \u2047 Gene will share some brief remarks, Rick will give an update on our operating performance and Raj will provide more detail on our financial results and an update to our fiscal 2022 financial outlook. \u2047 Sales trends remained strong throughout the quarter, as all our brands stayed laser focused on creating memorable guest experiences. \u2047 Despite the toughest inflationary environment we've seen in years, we achieved strong profitable sales growth. \u2047 Our ongoing success navigating the pandemic is a testament to the power of our strategy, driven by our back to basics operating philosophy and the strength of our four competitive advantages. \u2047 Our disciplined commitment to our strategies allow us to manage this environment well, while returning significant cash to our shareholders. \u2047 People and product will continue to be our focus and Rick will share more details about that in a minute. \u2047 Additionally, our teams have done a great job managing inflation effectively and Raj will provide more color on that during his remarks. \u2047 Holidays are the busiest time of year for our restaurant teams as they delight our guest and help create lasting holiday memories. \u2047 This time of year is also a great reminder that being of service is at the heart of our business, which is why we're committed to serving our guests, our team members and our communities. \u2047 One of the ways we serve our communities is by helping fight hunger, this fiscal year, through our foundation, Darden provided $2.5 million to help our partners at Feeding America add refrigerated trucks for 15 food banks to support mobile pantry programs and distribution in communities facing high rates of food insecurity. \u2047 We are uniquely positioned to help and by leveraging our scale and relationships with partners like Penske Truck Leasing and Lineage Logistics, we're proud to do our part to help get food into the hands of people who need it. \u2047 Finally, earlier today, we announced that effective May 30th, Rick will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer and will join Darden's Board of Directors. \u2047 This is the right time for this transition and I look forward to continuing to serve as Darden's Chairman. \u2047 Our company is in a clear position of strength and this is also the right time for me and my family, I'm excited for Rick, who has been a tremendous partner over the last seven years and is one of the best strategic thinkers I've worked alongside. \u2047 Our brands have tremendous opportunity ahead of them and Rick is the perfect person to lead Darden into the next chapter. \u2047 It is an honor to be appointed Darden's next Chief Executive Officer and I'm grateful to Gene and the Board for their confidence in me. \u2047 It is humbling to lead 170,000 outstanding team members, who nourish and delight everyone we serve. \u2047 I was incredibly fortunate to work with each of Darden's CEOs. \u2047 So, I have a strong appreciation for the legacy of leadership I'm inheriting. \u2047 By upholding our commitments to operational excellence and maximizing the power of the Darden platform, we will continue to execute our strategy to drive growth and shareholder value. \u2047 Turning to the quarter. \u2047 Our restaurants continue to execute at a high level. \u2047 Our focus on simplifying operations to drive execution remains our top priority, which is why we once again paused any new initiatives during the quarter in order to eliminate distractions and allow our operators to focus on running great shifts. \u2047 This pause also ensures they can zero-in on people and product as we navigate through the current staffing and supply chain challenges. \u2047 From a people perspective, we feel good about the progress we've made on the staffing front. \u2047 Across our brands manager staffing levels are above historical norms and team member staffing levels continue to improve. \u2047 Our new hiring system has made it easier to source talent, giving our management teams more time to focus on successfully onboarding and training new team members. \u2047 We also continue to invest in our team members further strengthening our industry leading employment proposition. \u2047 Earlier this year, we committed to increasing the minimum hourly earnings for our restaurant team members to $12, which includes income earned through gratuities by January 2023. \u2047 However, given the strength of our performance, we are accelerating that timing to January 2022. \u2047 This primarily impacts entry level roles, such as hosts, busters[Phonetic] and dishwashers. \u2047 And with this change, we expect our restaurant team members will earn on average approximately $20 per hour. \u2047 Our people are the key to our performance. \u2047 We work hard to be the employer of choice in our industry and we're proud that our retention rates for managers and team members are both in the top quartile. \u2047 And we will continue to invest in them to retain and attract the best talent in the industry. \u2047 On the product side, our supply chain team continues to do a great job making sure our restaurants have the products they need to serve our guests. \u2047 Our inventory levels are strong and the team's ability to meet the needs of the business can be seen in the fact that we shipped more cases in the last two quarters than at any time during Darden's history. \u2047 The ability to maintain supply continuity for our restaurants minimizes distractions and allows our operators to focus on executing at the highest level, whether our guests or in our dining rooms or enjoying the convenience of to-go. \u2047 During the quarter to-go sales continued to benefit from the strength of our digital platform. \u2047 This platform not only makes it easier for our teams to execute, it makes it more convenient for our guests to visit, order, pay and pick up. \u2047 Off-premise sales accounted for 28% of total sales at Olive Garden and 15% of total sales at LongHorn Steakhouse. \u2047 Digital transactions accounted for 60% of all off-premise sales during this quarter and 11% of Darden's total sales. \u2047 Finally, we successfully opened 12 new restaurants during the quarter, including a flagship Yard House in Time Square with minimal staffing challenges. \u2047 The time to build a new restaurant is longer today than it has been historically and we are also beginning to see longer lead times for kitchen equipment and technology hardware. \u2047 Regardless, we remain on track to open approximately 35 to 40 new restaurants this fiscal year. \u2047 I also want to recognize our team members in our restaurants and our support center for your tireless efforts in creating exceptional experiences for our guests. \u2047 I wish you all a safe and happy holiday season. \u2047 Total sales for the second quarter were $2.3 billion, 37% higher than last year, driven by 34.4% same restaurant sales growth and the addition of 34 net new restaurants. \u2047 Average weekly sales grew by more than 7% compared to pre-COVID. \u2047 Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.48. \u2047 Total EBITDA was $335 million, resulting in EBITDA margin of 14.7%. \u2047 The significant business model improvements we made over the past year and half combined with strong sales resulted in margin growth of 270 basis points compared to pre-COVID. \u2047 We expect this to be the highest quarterly EBITDA margin growth this fiscal year as this quarter has the most opportunity given its low seasonality. \u2047 We continue to return significant cash to shareholders paying $143 million in dividends and repurchasing $266 million in shares, totaling over $400 million of cash returned to investors in the quarter. \u2047 And while we're happy with our performance, cost pressures continue to exceed our expectations on both commodities and labor with total inflations of 6% this quarter. \u2047 Our teams continue to demonstrate agility in managing through this environment. \u2047 This quarter we implemented several mitigating actions to preserve the strength of our business model, while balancing the impact of our guests and team members. \u2047 One of these actions was taking additional pricing. \u2047 For the second quarter, total pricing was 2% and we expect back half pricing to approach 4%, resulting in total pricing of just under 3% for the full fiscal year. \u2047 We continue to execute our strategy of pricing significantly below our overall inflation to strengthen our value leadership position by leveraging our scale. \u2047 This level of pricing covers most of what we consider to be the structural and long lasting impacts of the current inflationary environment and absorbing what we consider to be more short-term fluctuations, while providing future flexibility should there be a need. \u2047 For the rest of the fiscal year, we expect commodity and labor inflation to peak in our third quarter and then start to slow down as we enter the fourth quarter and lap commodities inflation of 4.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. \u2047 Now turning to our P&L and segment performance for the second quarter. \u2047 We're comparing against pre-COVID results in the second quarter of 2020 which we believe are more comparable to normal business operations and with how we've been framing our margin expansion opportunity. \u2047 For the second quarter, food and beverage expenses were 220 basis points higher, driven by elevated commodity inflation of 9%, as well as investments in food quality, portion size and pricing significantly below inflation. \u2047 Restaurant labor was 90 basis points favorable, driven by sales leverage and efficiencies gained from operational simplifications and was partially offset by elevated wage pressures. \u2047 Hourly wage inflation during the quarter was almost 9%. \u2047 Restaurant expenses were 130 basis points lower due to sales leverage, which more than offset higher utilities costs. \u2047 Marketing spend was $44 million lower, resulting in 230 basis points of favorability. \u2047 As a result, restaurant level EBITDA margin for Darden was 18.8%, 230 basis points better than pre-COVID levels. \u2047 G&A expense was 40 basis points lower, driven by savings from the corporate restructuring in fiscal 2021, a decrease in mark-to-market expense and sales leverage. \u2047 Turning to our segment performance. \u2047 Second quarter sales at Olive Garden increased 5% versus pre-COVID, strong performance, especially as we were wrapping against nine weeks of never-ending possible. \u2047 This sales growth combined with the business model improvements at Olive Garden helped drive a segment profit margin increase of 320 basis points even while offsetting elevated inflation. \u2047 LongHorn continued its strong sales growth with an increase of 22% versus pre-COVID. \u2047 However, inflationary pressures including double digits for commodities were at their highest level in the second quarter, resulting in reduction of segment profit margin by 80 basis points. \u2047 Sales at our Fine Dining segment increased 22% versus pre-COVID as this segment continues to see a strong rebound in performance. \u2047 Segment profit margin grew by 140 basis points, driven by strong sales leverage and operational efficiencies, which more than offset double-digit commodities inflation. \u2047 Our other segment grew sales by 7% versus pre-COVID and segment profit margin by 250 basis points. \u2047 This segment continues to perform well and we're pleased to see the business model transformation persist. \u2047 Finally, turning to our financial outlook for fiscal 2022, we updated our outlook for the full year to reflect our performance year-to-date and our expected performance for the remainder of the year. \u2047 We now expect total sales of $9.55 billion to $9.7 billion, representing growth of 9% to 11% from pre-COVID levels, same restaurant sales growth of 29% to 31% and 35 to 40 new restaurants. \u2047 Capital spending of approximately $425 million, total inflation of approximately 5.5% with commodities inflation between 7% and 8%, total restaurant labor inflation between 6% and 6.5% which includes hourly wage inflation approaching 9%. \u2047 EBITDA of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion and annual effective tax rate of approximately 14% and approximately 130 million diluted average shares outstanding for the year. \u2047 All resulting in diluted net earnings per share between $7.35 and $7.60. \u2047 This outlook implies EBITDA margin growth versus pre-COVID similar to our previous outlook of 200 to 250 basis points with flow-through from pricing and higher sales helping offset elevated inflation. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["darden restaurants q2 earnings per share $1.48 from continuing operations.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share
