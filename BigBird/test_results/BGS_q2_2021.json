{"article": ["These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and therefore, undue reliance should not be placed upon them. \u2047 We refer you to B&G Foods' most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent SEC filings for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact our company's future operating results and financial condition. \u2047 Bruce, will then discuss our financial results for the second quarter as well as expectations for 2021. \u2047 We are pleased with the company's performance in the second quarter and our prospects for the remainder of the year. \u2047 As we expected, the second quarter was the most challenging to lap from a comparative perspective, given that Q2 2020 occurred at the height of pantry loading and stocking during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 However, performance remained elevated relative to 2019. \u2047 As many of you know, this is my first earnings call at B&G Foods. \u2047 I've now been in the role as CEO for about six weeks. \u2047 So for the folks on the line that I haven't met yet, it is a pleasure to meet you today over the phone. \u2047 I'm certainly looking forward to meeting many of you in person over the coming months as we get back into the cadence of in-person investor conferences, industry events and trade shows. \u2047 While I am mostly in listen mode for now, I will be happy to share some of my observations so far, and then come back over the coming quarters with a more detailed discussion around strategy, the portfolio as well as our opportunities and challenges at B&G Foods. \u2047 Obviously, one of the biggest drivers of industry performance over the past 1.5 years has been the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 In many cases, this is a matter of portfolio DNA, what are the brands, what are the categories, coupled with management's effectiveness in keeping employees safe, mitigating business risk, maintaining supply and maximizing opportunity. \u2047 Here at B&G Foods, we have done a pretty good job. \u2047 At the height of the pandemic in Q2 last year, we generated some of the largest growth numbers in the packaged food industry. \u2047 Today, COVID continues to be a concern in everyday life across the country and around the world. \u2047 But with the passage of time and the increasing proportion of the population that has been vaccinated, we expect gradual, if uneven, recovery in normal economic activity. \u2047 We do have opportunities coming out of the pandemic though. \u2047 When I look at the consumer trends that accelerated during the pandemic, e-commerce, comfort brands, baking, cooking, enhancers, flavorings and seasonings. \u2047 There are lots of opportunities for the B&G portfolios at the center of these trends. \u2047 We clearly aren't going to match 2020's net sales on our base business, but we are a larger business than we were in 2019, driven by continued growth and interest in cooking, baking and eating at home. \u2047 B&G's base business is up 7% on a two year stack from 2019. \u2047 Within the portfolio, our spices & seasonings baking and meals brands are up 20% versus Q2 2019. \u2047 And specifically on spices & seasonings which is about 20% of our total company portfolio and aggregates to be the number two spices and seasonings business in the United States, net sales are up more than 20% from Q2 2019 and remains well positioned coming out of the pandemic as more consumers continue to cook more often at home. \u2047 Also, the spices and seasonings portfolio is about 15% to 20% foodservice, so we are also benefiting as restaurants and eating establishments reopen, and more Americans are dining out again. \u2047 Our baking portfolio is also seeing positive trends in the post-pandemic world. \u2047 Recent studies show that even in spring 2021, approximately 65% of consumers were baking at home at least once per week, lifting the prospects of our growing list of baking brands that includes B&G Foods stalwarts such as Brer Rabbit and Grandma's Molasses as well as more recent additions such as Clabber Girl and Crisco. \u2047 We will spend more time talking about Crisco, but so far after eight months of ownership, we are very encouraged by the category trends and the top line performance of this business. \u2047 Another significant impact coming out of the pandemic is inflation and at unprecedented levels. \u2047 We are seeing inflation on key cost inputs across the portfolio, particularly in many tradable commodities, packaging material and freight. \u2047 The impact on our base portfolio is approximately 3% to 4%, but much higher on the Crisco business where soybean oil costs have doubled from last year. \u2047 At B&G Foods, we identified the risks of inflation early and acted to raise prices to recover higher input costs. \u2047 We will see more impact from both inflationary costs and pricing moving into the P&L through Q3 and Q4, with some lag effect on the timing of pricing implementation with customers. \u2047 Finally, I wanted to give you my perspective on B&G Foods overall and some thoughts on how we move forward. \u2047 This company has grown net sales and adjusted EBITDA at a greater than 10% compound annual growth rate over the last 17 years since its IPO in 2004. \u2047 The company was built upon a successful track record of acquisition-related growth. \u2047 We have successfully acquired and integrated more than 50 brands into our company since it was established in 1996. \u2047 For sure, some of the brands are a little old and stodgy, but many of these generate significant cash. \u2047 Many other brands and businesses that we have acquired, including spices, baking and meals, still have incredible opportunities in front of them. \u2047 Our goals are to continue to increase sales, profitability and cash flows through organic growth and disciplined acquisitions of complementary branded businesses. \u2047 Going forward, what you should expect from me is stronger focus within the portfolio on where we will grow, invest, acquire and create value. \u2047 Much more to come on that in future meetings and calls. \u2047 As Casey mentioned, we had a strong financial performance during our second quarter despite some very challenging comparables. \u2047 A year ago at this time, we were still, for the most part, sheltering at home, had little hope of an effective vaccine in the near future and saw the majority of the away-from-home eating industry shutdown, other than a budding recovery of takeout dining that began midsummer last year. \u2047 April, May and June of 2020 were the peak months of COVID-19, and Americans were still eating the majority of their meals at home, creating unprecedented demand for shelf-stable and frozen packaged food products, the types of products that we sell. \u2047 In fact, when we reported our second quarter results last year at this time, we were discussing net sales growth that was up nearly 40% and adjusted EBITDA growth that was up nearly 45% from the prior year. \u2047 Margins were also up significantly. \u2047 This year, as we lap those pandemic-enhanced results, I think it is also important to view the second quarter in the context of its comparisons to Q2 2019. \u2047 While sales were lower than March, April and May months of last year, net sales finished nicely ahead of pre-pandemic levels for the quarter, and we continue to track to the mid-single-digit increases over 2019 levels that we had been talking to for some time. \u2047 We are seeing many of the consumer behaviors that we witnessed last year persist, driving a sustained increase in the numbers of Americans preparing their meals at home and eating at home on a daily basis. \u2047 As Casey said earlier, we are seeing consumers cooking, baking and eating at home more frequently than they had prepandemic. \u2047 Another factor worth mentioning before we get deeper into our results is inflation. \u2047 At the beginning of this year, when we were delivering our Q4 results and outlook for the year, we raised our concerns about inflation as the broader economy restarted, and we began to more fully adapt to the impact of COVID-19. \u2047 I hate to use the word unprecedented too loosely, but we are certainly seeing inflation with little recent precedent. \u2047 While our conversations about inflation may have seemed early at the time, it is now hard to read, watch or listen to the news without hearing about inflation. \u2047 Inflation is here, and it appears that it will likely be here for some time. \u2047 In some cases, that means costs are up marginally. \u2047 And in other cases, particularly for tradable commodities, cost may be up as much as double digits from last year's pandemic-depressed levels. \u2047 At B&G Foods, we acted quickly to take price across large parts of our portfolio to help offset inflation and preserve our margin structure. \u2047 We have now executed list price increases in approximately 80% of the brands in our portfolio. \u2047 While we were covered with many forward purchases in many cases throughout portions of the year, this mitigates the damage, but the cost increases still hurt. \u2047 And while we are taking price, it largely comes with a lag effect setting up a fairly common phenomenon where the margins may be compressed a little bit more than we would like to see them in the short term, but are expected to remain fairly stable in the long term. \u2047 We expect these inflationary pressures to persist and that conversations about inflation and price increases will continue well into 2022. \u2047 And now for the 2021 Q2 highlights. \u2047 We reported net sales of $464.4 million; adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses of $85 million; adjusted EBITDA of $83.8 million; and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.41. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses as a percentage of net sales was 18.3%. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 18%. \u2047 Net sales of $464.4 million were down $48.1 million or 9.4% from the peak of COVID Q2 2020, but up $93.2 million or 25.1% from pre-COVID Q2 2019. \u2047 Crisco, which we acquired in December 2020, generated $58.4 million of net sales in Q2 2021. \u2047 Base business net sales, which primarily exclude Crisco and approximately 1.5 months of Clabber Girl net sales, were up $26.4 million or 7.1% compared to 2019. \u2047 As a reminder, we acquired Clabber Girl in May 2019. \u2047 We continue to believe that we will see a material lift say, mid-single digits in net sales, over the levels that we experienced in 2019. \u2047 Comparisons to 2020 are obviously driven by a decline in volumes, but we are also seeing a benefit from price, which includes list price increases, trade spend optimization and a little bit of mix. \u2047 For the recent quarter, price/mix was a benefit of approximately $6.2 million, bringing us to approximately $12.8 million of benefit for the first two quarters combined. \u2047 We generated adjusted EBITDA before COVID-19 expenses of $85 million in the second quarter of 2021, a decrease of $21.9 million or 20.5%. \u2047 During the second quarter of 2021, we incurred approximately $1.2 million in incremental COVID-19 costs at our manufacturing facilities, which primarily included temporary enhanced compensation for our manufacturing employees, compensation we continue to pay manufacturing employees while in quarantine and expenses related to other precautionary health and safety measures. \u2047 We expect to see continued reduction in these costs, which averaged about $1.5 million per month during the height of the pandemic and have averaged a little less than $0.5 million per month in the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Inclusive of these costs, we reported adjusted EBITDA of $83.8 million, which is a decrease of $18.8 million or 18.3% compared to last year's second quarter. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 18% in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 20% in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales was 19.1% in the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.41 compared to $0.71 in Q2 2020 and $0.38 in Q2 2019. \u2047 Spices & seasonings continues to be one of the key drivers in the portfolio. \u2047 Net sales of our spices & seasonings including our legacy brands such as Ac'cent and Dash, and the brands we acquired in 2016 such as Tone's and Weber were approximately $99.3 million, a little bit more than 21% of our total company net sales for the quarter. \u2047 Net sales of spices & seasonings were up by approximately $0.7 million or 0.7% compared to Q2 2020. \u2047 Net sales of spices & seasonings were up approximately $18.1 million or 22.2% compared to Q2 2019. \u2047 Spices & seasonings sales remain elevated across all of our brands and channels, and we are seeing a real benefit as consumers repeatedly demonstrate their interest in trying new recipes while cooking and eating at home. \u2047 Among our other large brands, Maple Grove Farms, which generated $20.2 million in net sales for the quarter, was up $2.2 million or 11.7% compared to Q2 2020, and up $2.4 million or 13.4% compared to Q2 2019. \u2047 Maple Grove Farms benefited from both strong retail demand as well as a recovery in its food service business. \u2047 Ortega generated net sales of $40.9 million and was down $5.9 million or 12.7% compared to Q2 2020, but was up $6.9 million or 20% from Q2 2019. \u2047 Ortega is a callout brand that is still benefiting from COVID-like demand, but we are selling products as fast as we can make them, particularly taco shells, taco sauce and chili peppers. \u2047 And unfortunately, due to internal and external supply chain constraints, we are still not able to capitalize fully on the demand opportunity. \u2047 Ortega is a brand that we are very much leaning into and our operations team is working hard to expand capacity and maximize this opportunity. \u2047 We have a similar story with Las Palmas. \u2047 Las Palmas generated net sales of $8.8 million, was down $3.4 million or 27.7% compared to Q2 2020, but was up $1.2 million or 15.2% compared to Q2 2019. \u2047 Similar to Ortega, Las Palmas was not able to fully capture the continued demand opportunity with supply constraints of chilis due to crop issues. \u2047 Cream of Wheat which has been one of our largest beneficiaries of the consumer patterns emerging from the pandemic, generated $14.2"], "gold_summary": ["b&g foods q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.41.  \u2047  q2 adjusted earnings per share $0.41.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.38.  \u2047  q2 sales $464.4 million versus
