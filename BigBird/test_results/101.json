specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. \u2047 Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. \u2047 Reconciliation of core results to comparable GAAP value can be found in the investor relations section of our website at corning.com. \u2047 You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst center. \u2047 We encourage you to follow along. \u2047 They're also available on our website for downloading. \u2047 Today, we reported third quarter results demonstrating that the company is strong, financially healthy and well positioned for growth. \u2047 Sales were $3 billion, up 16% sequentially. \u2047 EPS grew 72% sequentially to $0.43, as higher sales and strong manufacturing execution resulted in operating margin expanding to 18.3%, up 710 basis points sequentially and 20 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 We generated $518 million of free cash flow and finished the quarter with $2.5 billion in cash. \u2047 Our financial performance has improved significantly since April, and we expect a strong fourth quarter. \u2047 Nevertheless, we remain vigilant and continue to adapt appropriately to multiple disruptive forces playing out around the world from the pandemic, the civil unrest to recession and geopolitical struggles. \u2047 We've been rising to the challenges since day one, and our priorities remain clear. \u2047 First, we must make our values evident in our actions. \u2047 Our commitment to the health, safety, and well-being of our employees underlines every facet of our operations. \u2047 We're dedicating resources and providing leadership to support our communities around the world. \u2047 We've launched Unity campaigns as well as racial and social equality programs targeting the multitude of hardships people are confronting right now. \u2047 And when it comes to the global health fight, we're all in, mobilizing our capabilities to combat the virus directly. \u2047 We must also safeguard our financial health. \u2047 Our third-quarter results show that our decisive actions are providing clear benefits as we leverage cost savings and increase efficiencies across the company. \u2047 Regardless of the depth or duration of global uncertainty, we're doing everything in our power to keep the company strong, and it's working. \u2047 Now to ensure that we emerge even stronger, we're continuing to invest to create additional revenue streams. \u2047 We're inventing new-to-the-world materials and manufacturing processes as well as co-innovating new solutions in partnership with our customers. \u2047 The relevance of our portfolio puts Corning at the heart of ongoing innovation with industry leaders, and we continue to solve our customers' toughest technology challenges. \u2047 You may have seen Apple's recent promotion of ceramic shield for the iPhone 12. \u2047 Their featuring are new-to-the-world material, which is the world's first, highly transparent color-free glass ceramic with performance that meets the rigorous demands put on smartphone cover materials. \u2047 This latest innovation with Apple exemplifies our ongoing strategy of consistent, long-term value creation by combining our deep expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our unparalleled manufacturing and engineering capabilities. \u2047 Ceramic shield melds the attributes that we love about glass, create optics and retain strength with the attributes we love about ceramics, most notably, it's toughness. \u2047 Ceramics shield consist of ceramic crystals within a glass matrix. \u2047 There were two big inventions here. \u2047 The first was keeping the best damage-resistant attributes of both glass and ceramics. \u2047 The second was ensuring high optical transparency by growing index-matched nanocrystals inside the glass matrix that are one-tenth the wavelength of late. \u2047 As you recall, Apple made two investments in Corning, totaling $450 million, as part of their advanced manufacturing fund and their commitment to foster innovation among American manufacturers. \u2047 We could not be prouder to be a key component in the iPhone 12. \u2047 Now, it's important to note the iPhone 12, and many other flagship phones that we are also proud to be part of, support 5G. \u2047 5G matters to us. \u2047 The density of fiber necessary to deliver its promise is yet another example. \u2047 You've seen us illustrate that up to 100x more fiber is required to deploy 5G in a city than 4G. \u2047 This week, we announced a new product design to help operators dramatically boost the speed and reduce the cost of their outdoor deployments. \u2047 And we're embarking on new work to support Verizon's efforts to extend 5G indoors. \u2047 The relevance of our portfolio and our deep customer relationships, as illustrated by these advancements, keep us at the center of the inexorable shift to optical. \u2047 Stepping back, in all the industries we serve, important market trends offer new challenges. \u2047 The Corning is uniquely qualified to address and new opportunities to integrate more Corning content into products. \u2047 This is an especially powerful value creation lever in times of economic uncertainty, because we aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff. \u2047 We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. \u2047 We are clearly seeing the benefits of this lever in today's results as innovation adoption drove specialty materials sales up 23% year-over-year despite a declining smartphone market. \u2047 This type of outperformance is not unique. \u2047 From 2016 to 2019, we added $500 million in sales, or 42% cumulatively, while smartphone sales actually went down. \u2047 And we're extending that growth streak this year. \u2047 In environmental technologies, we grew sales 16% in 2019, much faster than the underlying unit demand as automakers added gas particulate filters to cars. \u2047 And we, again, saw outperformance this quarter with sequential sales up 68%. \u2047 These are additional examples of the more Corning strategy at work and why the content story is so powerful for us. \u2047 I want to stress one additional point. \u2047 You often hear us say that our core technologies enable life-changing capabilities. \u2047 In these times, we're increasing focus on life-saving innovations. \u2047 Safe widespread vaccine delivery is one of society's top priorities, and glass packaging is critical. \u2047 Our Valor innovation will help enable faster filling line speeds and increased patient safety. \u2047 Right now, we're expanding capacity and supplying glass vials for vaccines as part of operation work speed, all while leveraging our leadership in life sciences to help support COVID diagnostic testing and virus research efforts. \u2047 Additionally, reduced fine particulate pollution, the objective of our filtration products, appears to be helpful for reducing infection rates. \u2047 And we're excited about recent university lab test, showing that our guardian antimicrobial glass particles, kill bacteria and viruses, including SARS-COV2. \u2047 We're also well-positioned to contribute as consumers continue to adapt to a world with social distancing. \u2047 For example, fiber increases the capacity and performance of networks, and glass provides the primary window to information and entertainment. \u2047 We're confident that we can bring further innovations to bear in many vital areas as the world addresses and recovers from these current challenges. \u2047 Overall, we had a very strong quarter on almost every dimension. \u2047 From an innovation perspective, I just reviewed our significant advancements. \u2047 Financially, we grew sales at double-digit rate sequentially and expanded margins to grow profitability even faster. \u2047 Operationally, we performed well, and I'd like to share a few examples. \u2047 In the midst of the pandemic, we deployed expert engineering teams to start-up our Gen 10.5 melting operations in both Wuhan and Guangzhou. \u2047 These facilities are positioning on us well to capture the fast-growing demand for large TVs. \u2047 In mobile consumer electronics, we successfully scaled up a new-to-the-world manufacturing process and product to meet Apple's iPhone launch. \u2047 In automotive, we flexed our operations to adjust to the fast pace ramp-up at OEMs after they significantly reduced production in Quarter 2. \u2047 In optical communications, we successfully adjusted our cost to the current market environment, resulting in significant profitability expansion, despite flattish sales, on a quarter-over-quarter basis. \u2047 We also remain vigilant in our actions to safeguard the company's financial strength. \u2047 We're proud of our execution, especially given the current global uncertainties. \u2047 Clearly, our employees around the world are dedicated to living our values and giving their best every day. \u2047 We had a very strong third quarter. \u2047 As Wendell highlighted, we executed effectively, and we bolstered our healthy balance sheet despite the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. \u2047 Sales growth and cost actions led to strong sequential margin expansion, further demonstrating that our operational adjustments are working. \u2047 We've made significant adjustments to align our cost and operating plan with the lower anticipated sales. \u2047 In total, Corning continues to demonstrate that it has the resources to deliver on our commitments and extend our leadership as we continue to focus on operational excellence, cash flow generation, and prudent capital allocation. \u2047 Before I get into the details of our performance and results, I want to call out the changes at Hemlock during Q3 and cover the differences between GAAP and core results. \u2047 On September 9, Hemlock Semiconductor group redeemed DuPont's 40.25% ownership interest in the company, which transformed Corning's longtime ownership in Hemlock into a majority position. \u2047 In the second transaction, Hemlock purchased certain manufacturing assets from DuPont and gained control of a critical raw material, thereby becoming a leading, low-cost producer of ultra-pure polysilicon to the semiconductor industry. \u2047 Hemlock's leadership position is backed by attractive the long-term take-or-pay customer contracts with upfront payments. \u2047 Now, we're very excited about these transactions. \u2047 They are good for Hemlock, good for Corning, and good for our shareholders. \u2047 We didn't put any money into the transaction, and Hemlock generates a lot of cash so its debt is mostly paid back in one year. \u2047 Corning improves its financials by adding sales and earnings. \u2047 In the third quarter, we recognized $31 million of sales from the newly consolidated Hemlock. \u2047 And Hemlock will add approximately $150 million in annual cash flow. \u2047 Please see our web disclosure for helpful consolidation details. \u2047 Now on to GAAP. \u2047 The largest differences between our third-quarter GAAP and core results are a noncash gain associated with the Hemlock transaction, ongoing restructuring charges, which are primarily noncash, and a mark-to-market adjustment for our currency hedge contracts. \u2047 Now with respect to the mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. \u2047 For us, this reduced GAAP earnings in Q3 by $103 million. \u2047 To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. \u2047 Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions. \u2047 Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant-currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. \u2047 We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. \u2047 We've received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since our inception more than five years ago. \u2047 Now, I'll walk through our third quarter performance. \u2047 At the outset of the pandemic, we committed to preserving our financial strength and positioning the company to emerge even stronger. \u2047 In Q1 and Q2, we told you we were responding to economic uncertainty by making significant operational adjustments. \u2047 We said we reduced cost and capital spend to align with lower anticipated sales. \u2047 And while ramping down production and reducing inventory impacts margins, we said that when sales growth resumed, we expect improved profitability. \u2047 Now, looking at the third quarter, we grew 16% -- sales grew 16% sequentially to $3 billion, and our operating margin expanded by 710 basis points sequentially, to 18.3%. \u2047 This resulted in net income of $380 million and earnings per share of $0.43, up 72% sequentially. \u2047 We also said we would maintain a strong cash balance and generate positive free cash flow for the year. \u2047 In the third quarter, free cash flow grew to $518 million, cumulative free cash flow for the first three quarters was $484 million. \u2047 We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.5 billion and expect to generate additional positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter as we continue to reduce cost, control inventory and execute well overall. \u2047 As a result, I'm confident that we will succeed on our free cash flow goals. \u2047 These actions -- the actions we're taking are clearly working. \u2047 We have delivered great operational improvements, which started to show results in Q2, and really accelerated in Q3. \u2047 We expect the benefit of these actions to continue in Q4, contributing to another strong quarter. \u2047 Now, let's review the business segments. \u2047 In display technologies, third quarter sales were $827 million, up 10% sequentially, and net income was $196 million, up 29% sequentially. \u2047 Display glass volume grew approximately 10% sequentially, as panel makers increase utilization, resulting in strong incrementals. \u2047 Sequential price declines were moderate, as expected. \u2047 From an end-market perspective, it appears that the impact from COVID-19 has been a positive. \u2047 In developed markets, consumers are prioritizing in-home entertainment. \u2047 Globally, work and study from home trends are growing. \u2047 This is increasing demand for TV and IT products. \u2047 On the other hand, smartphone demand has been down. \u2047 In total, the retail market, as measured in square feet of glass, is up mid-single digits year-to-date through August. \u2047 Of course, the upcoming holiday retail season will be a big factor in how the market actually plays out for the full year. \u2047 Longer term, we remain confident that TV screen size will continue to grow. \u2047 TVs at 65 inches or larger grew 40% year-to-date through August. \u2047 And we are well positioned to capture the majority of that growth with Gen 10.5, which is the most efficient gen size for large TV manufacturing. \u2047 We continue to expect display pricing to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2020. \u2047 We believe that three factors drive a favorable glass pricing environment: First, we expect glass supply/demand to be balanced to tight. \u2047 For Corning, we are ramping our Gen 10.5 tanks to align with panel makers' schedules. \u2047
