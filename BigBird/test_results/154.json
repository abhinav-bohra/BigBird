{"article": ["I hope you are all well and safe. \u2047 Joining me virtually today are Bryan Hanson, our President and CEO; and CFO, Suky Upadhyay. \u2047 We're obviously very pleased to see that so many people now have access, full access to the COVID-19 vaccinations, and that adoption has been pretty strong so far. \u2047 Now of course, we'd like to see this even more broadly on a worldwide basis, but it certainly feels like we're making really important progress toward moving forward -- and ultimately, as a result of that moving, hopefully, on from the pandemic. \u2047 Now it's not over. \u2047 I think all of us realize that. \u2047 But I, for one, feel more optimistic than ever that we're coming out, I think, on the other side of COVID-19 and with that, much better days ahead and I guess with that, probably it's a good lead into our Q1 call. \u2047 Q1 was a stronger quarter than we initially expected and I'm pretty excited to discuss it with you. \u2047 Whenever you have a good quarter, obviously, earnings calls are a lot more fun. \u2047 So clearly, we're excited about this one and I'm going to try to keep my remarks relatively brief this way. \u2047 I know you're kind of laughing at that because it's not always easy for me to do that. \u2047 I'm going to try to keep it brief. \u2047 So I'm just going to stick to really three topics, as a result. \u2047 Number one, I want to talk about the COVID recovery just briefly and our execution inside of that recovery and then ZB's ongoing transformation and our progress against that. \u2047 That will be the second topic and the third topic would just be around our long-term growth strategy, just reiterating our position there and how we believe that's going to drive value for our shareholders and stakeholders overall. \u2047 So let's start with navigating COVID and how we're executing inside of it. \u2047 COVID clearly is not over, just as I stated a minute ago and I'm very confident we're going to continue to have surprises ahead and disruptions ahead, but based on what we saw at the end of Q1 and what we're seeing in the beginning of Q2 and coupling that with just the pace of vaccine rollouts right now, we're clearly moving in the right direction. \u2047 I don't think anybody can argue against that and is that shift toward what I would define as more stability, and I know that's on a relative basis, kind of talk about stability here. \u2047 But that shift toward more stability, it really enabled us to give you the full year 2021 financial guidance. \u2047 Now inside of that guidance, there's going to be some important assumptions about trends and recovery timing that underpin our outlook, and Suky's going to get into more of that in just a few minutes. \u2047 But overall, it feels good, feels good to have better insight into the broader market and greater confidence in what the rest of 2021 should look like for our business. \u2047 Now as we start to return to a more normal environment, I'm going to put normal environment in air quotes given the situation right now. \u2047 But when that happens, we expect that part of what we'll see is a pretty significant tailwind from the backlog of patients that has built up over the last year or more. \u2047 Now how fast that happens, how fast we work through that backlog, especially across certain regions is something we're going to have to pay attention to. \u2047 You're going to have to watch and track. \u2047 But we absolutely believe that the vast majority of those patients who put off in elective procedure will come back into the funnel and that's going to provide a significant tailwind well into 2022 and I, for one, cannot wait for that tailwind and I can tell you that ZB is ready for them. \u2047 They're ready for those patients, and we're ready to be able to help our customers, care for those patients. \u2047 Speaking of being ready. \u2047 As I've said to you before, the things that ZB was able to directly control over the past year, I truly think the team has executed against. \u2047 I'm very proud of the ZB team for how they stood up and delivered against a backdrop of a whole lot of things that were absolutely out of their control and I know I talk a lot about the importance of our talent, our mission, our culture here at ZB and I can tell that each were absolutely critical for us in 2020 and continue to be in 2021 and well beyond and with that in mind, we've made some additional changes to our leadership team here very recently. \u2047 We've added a Chief Transformation Officer, again, to help us with all the transformation that we're going to continue to have as an organization. \u2047 We've appointed a new Chief Human Resource Officer to help us move our talent agenda forward. \u2047 One of the key areas of focus for me as we move forward as an organization, and promoting Sang Yi to group President of Asia Pacific. \u2047 He's now going to have some responsibilities of certain projects, OUS. \u2047 He brings a real disciplined execution mindset, and he can absolutely help us outside of Asia Pacific and then expanding Ivan Tornos' role as a Chief Operating Officer with the added leadership now of EMEA, which is a region that he has had deep responsibility for in the past and knows very, very well, and I know it can bring us value in that region. \u2047 So I can tell you is continued focus on talent and development is not just contained to the executive ranks. \u2047 Our entire ZB organization is hyper-focused on our people. \u2047 I'm really getting the right team members in the right roles and giving them the tools and support and really the opportunities to drive their performance, to develop and excel, and it's working. \u2047 I can tell you, this focus on talent is working and I believe it is going to continue to set us apart from the competition and in addition to the foundation built by our team members, our mission, our culture, our core business momentum is stronger than ever. \u2047 The team's execution continues to be on point. \u2047 Our market momentum is building. \u2047 Our commercial confidence is higher than ever and I can say right now, we are very excited about the R&D innovation pipeline that we still have coming. \u2047 That's an important part of our revenue growth. \u2047 Throughout Q1 and even in recent weeks, we hit key milestones with our ZB products and our innovation. \u2047 The application for Partial Knee now is available for ROSA. \u2047 I was just approved by the FDA. \u2047 We've actually already had our first procedure using that application last week with very good results and this is just the latest addition to our ROSA robotics program, our platform here and it's also another launch inside of our ZB edge suite of integrated digital and robotic technologies. \u2047 Again, something we truly do believe will set us apart from the competition. \u2047 So if I just look at ROSA overall in the quarter, we continue to see strong market demand traction with our ROSA platform. \u2047 For Persona Revision, another strong performance. \u2047 This continues to move forward in an amazing way. \u2047 Q1 was ahead of our expectations and it is another example of a tip of the spear product that we have that as we make the conversion of provision, we also have the opportunity then to go after the standard knee business as well. \u2047 So again, still exciting opportunities there for revision and then our Signature ONE Planner for shoulder procedures, again, demonstrated a very strong sequential growth from Q4. \u2047 We're actually up 65% over Q4 when we look at registrations. \u2047 Again, that's a pretty significant move. \u2047 And again, this provides that stickiness with our customers in that procedure, but it also provides a mix benefit wherever that presurgical planning is used. \u2047 And as we come into Q2 and the rest of 2021, ZB has additional innovation that's coming. \u2047 And it's pretty exciting innovation with our anticipated launch of Persona iQ and also ROSA Hip later in the year. \u2047 And I can tell you, for Persona iQ, the initial feedback from evaluating surgeons has been very positive. \u2047 And I can tell you that they're interested in being able to capture data from inside the body. \u2047 I mean this is unique. \u2047 They've not been able to do this before. \u2047 And then ultimately, remotely monitoring those data the hope would be that using that information to change the way that we care for patients. \u2047 So the excitement around this is very strong from our surgeons. \u2047 And we can tell that the momentum is going to be strong when we do get regulatory approval. \u2047 So all I have to say, the momentum on the innovation front is real here at ZB. \u2047 This will allow us multiple shots on goal across a number of innovations. \u2047 Again, with multiple robotics launches, continuing success with Persona Revision, Persona iQ, new iterations of mymobility and just really the broader ZB edge ecosystem to drive mix benefit, for sure, but also competitive conversions. \u2047 And ultimately, we really believe, change the way that we care for patients, change the treatment paradigm for patients. \u2047 That's really what it's about. \u2047 It's about driving the mission of this organization. \u2047 Truthfully to remove pain from patients around the world and improving the quality of their life. \u2047 And we truly do believe ZB edge can help us do that. \u2047 Now you've heard me talk about the three phases of transformation. \u2047 The first was winning the hearts and the minds of the organization of the team members and really dealing with the execution challenges that we had that we spent a lot of time on in the first year. \u2047 And then second was moving to that longer-term firm strategy for the organization that would drive innovation and really building the structure around that strategy and the operating mechanisms to ensure that we move it forward. \u2047 And then third, where we are now is the portfolio transformation. \u2047 And truly, that is where we sit that is squarely where we are positioned today in Phase III, these three phases. \u2047 And we have the ZB portfolio management strategy and process in place. \u2047 And we have definitely built out our capabilities to move forward in this phase. \u2047 We're focused on what we're going to define as mission-centric M&A that is WAMGR accretive that would absolutely increase our weighted average market growth and does not disrupt our best-in-class margin profile and as you've seen, we've moved this forward already with selective tuck-in acquisitions that we did last year and that really does illustrate the strategy of work. \u2047 Now those deals were smaller. \u2047 No question, they're smaller, and they're relatively immaterial when it comes to the initial revenue that we acquired, but they're absolutely designed to fill portfolio gaps and better position us in high-growth markets. \u2047 Those high-priority markets and submarkets where ZB has a path to leadership, and we believe are right to win in markets like sports medicine, ASC and in the external closure market for us and each of these deals gives us a gap filling and, we believe, differentiated product portfolio to drive growth, and that's important to growth, but also drive additional confidence in our ASC business category and of course, inside of this active portfolio management phase, there's the planned spin-off transaction of our spine and dental business that we discussed back in Q4. \u2047 That process of creating two independent even stronger companies is on track. \u2047 It's early days, obviously, but it is on track and as you saw from our Q1 results, we do not believe it's causing distraction or disruption in our business. \u2047 In fact, it's more the opposite. \u2047 We've seen significant energy in the business, kind of a gelling in the business as the NewCo team starts to come together under CEO Vafa Jamali, and they begin to build out their own strategy and their focus. \u2047 So again, it's early days, but we're very happy with the progress so far of this spin. \u2047 We've said before, we'll say it again that the spin-off of NewCo actually serves to de-risk and potentially accelerate our path to mid-single-digit growth and a best-in-class 30% operating margin profile by the end of 2023 and we're confident that throughout this process and as we achieve this growth in margin profile, we're also going to have the flexibility to reinvest for growth and that is a key thing for us. \u2047 We've got to continue to be disciplined, but ultimately invest for growth in this business. \u2047 And that's what we will continue to do. \u2047 Now to get these growth levels and to achieve our top quartile performance in TSR, which, I think, you probably remember, is one of our strategic pillars, and we're going to continue to execute in our priority growth areas. \u2047 And just as a reminder, that means that we expect to drive above-market growth sustainably in knees. \u2047 We plan to grow hips consistently at market, but then later this year, above-market rates when we launched the ROSA Hip application and we expect to stabilize, first and foremost, but also drive focus. \u2047 And then ultimately, through that focus, drive our set business at the higher end of market rates there. \u2047 We're also very focused on driving change for ZB, a real evolution of the company from a metal and plastic provider of implants to a leading med tech innovator. \u2047 Think of us as a high-tech company that happens to be in med tech. \u2047 That's the ZB brand that we're looking for, that brand evolution of this company and I can tell you that already, more than 70% of our product development dollars are being spent in this area, being spent on ZB edge, that ecosystem of connected technologies. \u2047 Now we're always going to be an implant company and that's the center of the universe for this company. \u2047 But the ZB edge ecosystem around it is the way that we can differentiate ourselves versus the competition and we're already -- we have exclusive relationships to help us here. \u2047 We have relationships already with Apple and several other tech companies that we truly do believe will drive future innovation that will delight our customers and ultimately benefit patients and I believe, fundamentally, that this shift is coming, not only for us -- this technology shift, not only for us, but for the entire market that we play in them and I truly do believe that the technology advancements potentially can reshape the growth curve of these markets. \u2047 I'll say that again, I think the technology advancements that we're seeing and the value they bring can reshape the growth curve of the markets that we play in. \u2047 And I think very importantly, also change the care paradigm for our customers and their patients. \u2047 Let me close by saying that I continue to be highly confident in the"],
