{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Kent Masters, chief executive officer; and Scott Tozier, chief financial officer. \u2047 Our GBU Presidents, Raphael Crawford, Netha Johnson, and Eric Norris are also available for Q&A. \u2047 Please also note that some of the comments made today refer to non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Scott will provide more details on our financial results, outlook, and capital allocation priorities. \u2047 And finally, I'll walk you through our 2022 objectives. \u2047 2021 was a transformative year for Albemarle. \u2047 Our strategic execution and ability to effectively manage the challenges of the global pandemic enabled us to capitalize on the strength of the lithium and bromine markets and generate results that exceeded expectations. \u2047 For the year, excluding our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in June of 2021, we increased net sales by 11% to $3.3 billion, which was in line with our previous guidance. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA grew 13% in 2021 to $871 million, surpassing the upper end of our guidance. \u2047 Looking ahead, our outlook for 2022 has improved based primarily on favorable market conditions for lithium and bromine. \u2047 We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 35% and 55% versus 2021, excluding fine chemistry services. \u2047 To continue driving this growth, we are focused on quickly bringing capacity online with accelerated investments. \u2047 La Negra 3 and 4 is currently in commercial qualification, and we expect to start realizing first sales from this facility in the second quarter. \u2047 In November, we achieved mechanical completion of the first train at Kemerton. \u2047 The construction team is now dedicated to the second train, and we will be able to leverage our experience from train one to improve efficiencies and timeliness of this project. \u2047 And we recently signed a nonbinding letter agreement to explore the expansion of our MARBL joint venture with increased optionality and reduced risk. \u2047 Now looking at Slide 5. \u2047 We introduced this slide early last year to lay out our 2021 objectives designed to support the four pillars of our strategy: to grow profitably, to maximize productivity, to invest with discipline, and to advance sustainability. \u2047 Virtually all the goals we set last year were met or exceeded despite challenges related to severe weather, supply chain issues, and the ongoing effects of the pandemic. \u2047 The focus of our people around the world is what drove our strong year and underscores our ability to deliver on our commitments. \u2047 These accomplishments have also set the stage for us to take advantage of the growth opportunities ahead. \u2047 Just as important as driving growth is an ongoing dedication to strong ESG values. \u2047 I'm very proud of what you see on Slide 6. \u2047 Since I became CEO in 2020, one of my main priorities has been continued improvement in sustainability. \u2047 I'm pleased to see that these efforts are increasingly being recognized externally, but it certainly isn't a new initiative for Albemarle. \u2047 Sustainability is not just doing the right thing but also doing it the right way. \u2047 For example, the lithium market is expected to see significant demand growth in the coming years. \u2047 As a leader in lithium production, we expect to be an example and help define the standards of sustainability in this market as it goes through this fundamental shift. \u2047 Now turning to Slide 7 and more on the lithium market outlook. \u2047 Based on our current market data, EV trends, and regular interactions with our customers, we are revising our lithium demand outlook upwards once again. \u2047 We now expect 2025 lithium demand of approximately 1.5 million tons, up more than 30% from our previous estimates. \u2047 Beyond 2025, we anticipate continued growth with lithium demand of more than 3 million tons by 2030. \u2047 EV sales growth is accelerating as consumers become more energy-conscious, governments incentivize clean energy, technology improves, and EVs approach pricing parity with internal combustion vehicles. \u2047 In 2021, global EV production nearly doubled to over 6 million vehicles from 3 million in 2020. \u2047 By the end of the decade, EVs are expected to account for close to 40% of automotive sales. \u2047 When you look at last year's growth rate of nearly 50% and the auto industry's ambitions for a rapid transition to EVs, it's easy to see why demand expectations are so bullish. \u2047 However, meeting this demand will be a challenge. \u2047 Turning to our wave two projects on Slide 8. \u2047 La Negra 3 and 4, which will add conversion capacity for our Chilean brine resource in the Salar de Atacama, is currently in the customer qualification process. \u2047 We anticipate incremental volumes and revenue contribution from this project in the second quarter of this year. \u2047 While there are significant changes taking place to the political landscape in Chile, we do not anticipate any material impacts to our business. \u2047 We support the Chilean people's right of self-determination and applaud the peaceful leadership transition in that country. \u2047 Our team has already begun building relationships with the incoming administration. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, Kemerton 1 reached mechanical completion late last year and is currently in the commissioning phase. \u2047 This puts us on track to begin first sales in the second half of this year. \u2047 Kemerton 2 remains on track to reach mechanical completion by the end of this year. \u2047 The OEMs and battery manufacturers have been investing heavily in growth, including commitments in North America and Europe, and the lithium industry must do the same. \u2047 Turning to Slide 9. \u2047 We provide an overview of how Albemarle is investing to support downstream growth. \u2047 Since our Investor Day, we have accelerated and further defined our wave three projects, including the announcement of three strategic investments in China. \u2047 This wave of investments will provide Albemarle with approximately 200,000 tons of additional capacity. \u2047 That's up from 150,000 tons of capacity originally planned for wave three. \u2047 We've also continued to progress our growth options for wave four. \u2047 Based on discussions with our customers, we are analyzing options to restart our Kings Mountain lithium mine and the potential to build conversion assets in North America and Europe. \u2047 Our vertical integration, access to high-quality, low-cost resources, years of experience bringing conversion capacity online, and strong balance sheet provide us with considerable advantages. \u2047 I'm on Slide 10 now. \u2047 In China, we expect to close the acquisition of the Qinzhou conversion facility in the first half of this year. \u2047 This transaction is progressing well, and we continue to work through the appropriate regulatory reviews. \u2047 The Qinzhou plant is currently being commissioned, and we have begun tolling our spodumene to assist with that process. \u2047 We continue to progress the two greenfield lithium conversion projects in Meishan and Zhangjiagang. \u2047 We have started site clearing at Meishan and expect to break ground at Zhangjiagang later this year. \u2047 We expect mechanical completion of both projects by the end of 2024. \u2047 The restart of one of three processing lines at the Wodgina mine is going well, with first spodumene concentrate production now expected in the second quarter. \u2047 At Greenbushes, Talison continues to ramp production from the CGP 2 facility to meet design throughput and recovery rates. \u2047 In addition, the tailings project at Talison is on track. \u2047 Our bromine business is investing in innovation and capital projects to take advantage of growth opportunities. \u2047 We expect new products to make up more than 10% of annual bromine revenues by 2025, up from essentially a standing start. \u2047 The first of these products to launch is SAYTEX ALERO, our next-generation polymeric flame retardant. \u2047 We first discussed SAYTEX ALERO at our Investor Day last year, and I'm excited to say that we have achieved first commercial sales in January and expect to scale production throughout the year. \u2047 We've also invested in the resource expansion at the Smackover formation in Arkansas, and we continue to grow our conversion and derivative capacity in both Arkansas and Jordan. \u2047 Scott, you might be on mute. \u2047 Can you hear me now? \u2047 I was on mute. \u2047 I'll begin on Slide 12. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, we generated net sales of $894 million, which is an increase of $15 million compared to the prior-year quarter. \u2047 This was driven by higher sales from lithium and bromine, partially offset by the loss of revenue from our fine chemistry services business, which was sold in June 2021. \u2047 Excluding FCS, we grew by 11%. \u2047 The fourth-quarter net loss attributable to Albemarle was $4 million, reflecting an increased cost estimate to construct our Kemerton lithium hydroxide plant due to anticipated cost overruns from the impact of pandemic-related issues on the supply chain and labor. \u2047 Fourth-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.01 was down 14% from the prior year. \u2047 The primary adjustment to earnings per share is the $1.13 add-back of that Kemerton revision. \u2047 Excluding FCS, fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA was up 12% from the prior year. \u2047 Lithium results remained strong driven by higher volumes as well as higher pricing. \u2047 Bromine results were roughly flat year over year, reflecting strong performance in late 2020 and repeating it in 2021. \u2047 And Catalyst improved in the fourth quarter as refinery markets continue to rebound and the business saw benefits from onetime items. \u2047 Our second-half sales grew 13% from the first half of the year, following a relatively flat growth since mid-2020. \u2047 This acceleration of growth is expected to continue into 2022. \u2047 On Slide 14, you can see we are expecting both volume and pricing growth in all three of our business units in 2022. \u2047 We expect net sales of between $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.3 billion. \u2047 This implies an adjusted EBITDA margin of between 27% and 29%. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share and net cash from operations are also expected to improve year over year. \u2047 We anticipate healthy growth in adjusted EBITDA in all four quarters this year, and we expect Q1 to be the strongest quarter for several reasons. \u2047 All three GBUs are expected to benefit from lower-cost inventory sold at prices that have been raised in anticipation of inflation. \u2047 In the first quarter, lithium also has the benefit of strong shipments from our Talison joint venture to our partner as well as a onetime spodumene sales material produced at Wodgina on initial start-up in 2019. \u2047 And finally, going forward, higher spodumene transfer pricing increases are going to increase our cost of sales and only partially be offset by higher Talison joint venture income, which is included in our EBITDA after tax. \u2047 And this creates a tax-impacted EBITDA margin drive. \u2047 As Kent mentioned, capex is expected to increase to the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range this year as we accelerate lithium investments to meet increased customer demand. \u2047 The key actions to meet or exceed this guidance include: first, successful execution of our lithium project start-ups; second, closing the acquisition in China; third, solid performance at our sold-out plants in lithium, bromine, and FCC catalysts; fourth, continued strength in our end-use markets and favorable pricing environment; and lastly, solid procurement to combat inflation. \u2047 Lithium's full year 2022 EBITDA is expected to be up 65% to 85%, a significant improvement from our previous outlook. \u2047 We now expect volume growth to be up 20% to 30% for the year with the new capacity coming online as well as ongoing efficiency improvements. \u2047 Average realized pricing is now expected to increase 40% to 45% compared to 2021 due to strong market pricing as well as the expiration of pricing concessions originally agreed to in late 2019. \u2047 In some cases, as these concessions rolled off, pricing reverted to legacy contracts with significantly higher variable pricing. \u2047 And as we've been saying, we've also taken the opportunity to work with our strategic customers to renegotiate contracts to more variable-rate structures. \u2047 Catalyst EBITDA is expected to be up 5% to 15%. \u2047 This is below our previous outlook, primarily due to cost pressures related to high natural gas pricing in Europe and raw material inflation. \u2047 Volumes are expected to grow across segments with overall refining markets improving. \u2047 We continue to see volumes returning to pre-pandemic levels in late 2022 or 2023. \u2047 FCC volumes are already there, but HPC volumes are lagging. \u2047 Bromine EBITDA is expected to be up 5% to 10%, slightly above our previous outlook based on strong flame retardant demand supported by macro trends, such as digitalization and electrification. \u2047 Volumes are expected to increase based on the expansions we began in 2021. \u2047 And as discussed, higher pricing and ongoing cost and efficiency improvements are expected to offset higher freight and raw material costs. \u2047 Now turning to Slide 16, I'll provide some additional color on lithium volume growth. \u2047 This slide shows the expected lithium production volume ramp from the new conversion facilities we expect to complete this year. \u2047 We begin the year with a baseload production of 88,000 metric tons in 2021, which includes Silver Peak, Kings Mountain, Xinyu, Chengdu, and La Negra 1 and 2. \u2047 And you can see that this is virtually a 50-50 split of carbonate and hydroxide. \u2047 As our wave two projects come online, output will begin to favor hydroxide. \u2047 Generally speaking, we expect it to take about two years to ramp to full conversion capacity at a new plant, including approximately six months for commissioning and qualification. \u2047 Therefore, we expect to reach our full 200,000 tons of conversion production by early 2025. \u2047 Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. \u2047 Our primary focus is to invest in profitable growth opportunities, particularly for lithium and bromine. \u2047 Strategic portfolio management and maintaining financial flexibility are important levers to support this growth. \u2047 For example, we have divested non-core businesses like FCS and reallocated funds to organic/inorganic growth opportunities, like the expected acquisition of the Qinzhou plant. \u2047 The strategic review of Catalyst is progressing well and is on track for us to make an announcement of the outcome in the first half of this year. \u2047 We'll also continue to evaluate bolt-on acquisitions to accelerate growth or bolster our portfolio of top-tier assets. \u2047 As always, future dividends and share repurchases are subject to board approval. \u2047 However, we expect to continue to support our dividend. \u2047 Given the outsized growth opportunities we see in lithium, we don't anticipate share repurchases in the foreseeable future. \u2047 First, we will continue to grow profitably. \u2047 This means completing our wave two expansions and progressing wave three"],
