{"article": ["Leading today's discussion are Vince McMahon, WWE's Chairman and CEO; Nick Khan, WWE's President and Chief Revenue Officer; Stephanie McMahon, WWE's Chief Brand Officer; and Kristina Salen, WWE's Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Their remarks will be followed by a Q&A session. \u2047 Actual results may differ materially and undue reliance should not be placed on them. \u2047 Additionally, the matters we will be discussing today may include non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 You should know that all comparisons are versus the year ago quarter unless otherwise described. \u2047 We generated solid second quarter financial results as we focused on fan engagement and increasing efficiency in our content production. \u2047 We have positive trends in our OIBDA and the demand for our live event ticket sales as well as our television ratings and digital consumption. \u2047 Live events that have aired through July 26 have been at closure at full capacity. \u2047 We have advances for our live events that looked excellent including I might add SummerSlam,, which will be the largest SummerSlam event we've ever had here in the United States. \u2047 Television ratings for our initial shows were up significantly. \u2047 First-time we played before large crowd on July 16, it was up 42% increase in 18 to 49 demo, which was extraordinary, Raw of 15% as well. \u2047 In the quarter, we implemented certain organizational changes that will also increase efficiency and our content production on the post event. \u2047 I'll give you a little bit more information on that. \u2047 Looking ahead, we believe we can take advantage of the evolving business environment as we always have crowd engagement developing business and will drive growth. \u2047 Do you want to go, Nick? \u2047 Nice to speak with you all again. \u2047 As always, we'd like to start with some industry perspective. \u2047 In our last earnings call, we discussed how earlier this year the NFL, NHL and Major League Baseball realized substantial increases in the rights fees for their license programs even with lower linear television ratings. \u2047 The NFL saw media rights increase of 79%, the NHL more than tripled its media rights AAV and Major League Baseball is getting a higher per game rate as part of its new Disney deal. \u2047 The second quarter was another busy quarter with deal activity. \u2047 A number of rights holders closed media rights deals that saw substantial increases or their product, both in their home market, as well as in other territories. \u2047 Also in this quarter, we saw a number of private equity firms invest in sports teams, primarily based on the assumption that there was growth opportunity yet to be realized for their media rights. \u2047 Additionally, Steph and I would like to touch on the growth opportunity that exists in our sponsorship segment. \u2047 We will end by updating all of you on a number of WWE deals from this quarter that have led to new revenue streams. \u2047 The top Spanish soccer division, La Liga, closed an eight-year deal with Disney in the United States with an estimated AAV of $175 million, which represents a 35% increase from their prior deal with ESPN. \u2047 Wimbledon recently announced its 12-year extension with Disney in the U.S. and a three-year extension with the BBC in the U.K. Both deals saw significant increases. \u2047 Also in this quarter, private equity from RedBird Capital announced that it was acquiring a 15% stake in an Indian Premier League cricket team valuing the team between $250 million and $300 million. \u2047 Part of the rationale for this investment stems from the rising value of media rights for live sports content globally. \u2047 We're confident in saying this because we are seeing similar growth for our own international deals. \u2047 Just last week, we renewed our deal in Australia with our partners at Foxtel securing an increase for package of rights in that territory. \u2047 As we begin our efforts to license WWE Network internationally, we are encouraged by the trends we saw this quarter and are confident we will continue to see success as we engage with our partners internationally. \u2047 More on that to come in the future. \u2047 As Vince mentioned at the top of the call, ratings are up across all of our shows following the return of live fans. \u2047 Stephanie will provide more details on the ratings growth shortly. \u2047 Allow us to discuss Peacock for a moment. \u2047 Four months into the Peacock partnership, we are seeing the benefits of a streaming partnership with a platform that has broad distribution and continues to grow. \u2047 Since moving to Peacock, viewership of our pay-per-view events have increased with Backlash up 26%, Hell In A Cell up 25%, and Money In The Bank up 46% from the prior year performance on what was the stand-alone WWE Network. \u2047 These viewership numbers are also up considerably from our pre-pandemic WWE Network numbers. \u2047 As you recall, when we announced the Peacock deal, we said one of the key reasons for the partnership was to bring the WWE product to a wider audience than those subscribed to WWE Network. \u2047 We expect viewership of WWE to continue to increase, particularly as Peacock rose its base of users. \u2047 We also wanted to discuss our return to live event touring with you. \u2047 As many of you know, we made our return to live event touring on Friday, July 16 with SmackDown on FOX from Houston, Texas. \u2047 One nuance to know here. \u2047 This was not a return to live events for us. \u2047 We held live events with fans via video screens throughout the pandemic, not one week of production missed. \u2047 So, again, this is really our return to touring with live fans, felt great for the fans, for our Superstars and for our business. \u2047 Normally, we won't walk you through the specifics of events; however, today, allow me to give you a taste of how our live events are performing. \u2047 On Friday, July 16 at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas, we sold out. \u2047 This event was the highest-grossing non-pay-per-view event in WWE history in Houston. \u2047 Our merchandise sales for that night almost 50% greater than they were for our last event in Houston. \u2047 Please keep in mind that these merchandise figures come off of a phenomenal e-commerce sales period throughout COVID. \u2047 Two nights later at Money In The Bank on Sunday, July 18 at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas, we sold out. \u2047 This event was a highest-grossing non-WrestleMania event in WWE history in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. \u2047 Our merchandise sales for that night, almost the 100% greater than they were for our last event in the area. \u2047 These two arena sold out prior to John Cena surprise return at the end of the second show, the end of the Money In The Bank show that is. \u2047 The very next night, Monday, July 19 at American Airlines in Dallas, just down the road from Fort Worth, with a highest paid attendance in Dallas in over three years, our merchandise sales for that night almost 50% greater than they were at our last 2019 event in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. \u2047 Our next live event, SmackDown, this past Friday from Cleveland. \u2047 This event was our highest grossing non-pay-per-view gate in WWE history in Cleveland. \u2047 Our merchandise sales for that night over 60% greater than they were at our last event in Cleveland. \u2047 That same night, this past Friday, we also made our first-ever appearance for either our Raw or SmackDown brands at a music festival in the U.S. Rolling Loud, the preeminent hip-hop music festival, which was in Miami, over 230,000 paid attendees over the course of that three-day event, two WWE matches including our SmackDown women's champion, Bianca Belair coming off of her and Sasha Banks' ESPY win for best WWE moment in front of over 75,000 fans on Friday night, almost all under the age of 25. \u2047 We saw strong merchandise sales there as well. \u2047 The next night, we held our first non-televised live event since the pandemic from Pittsburgh. \u2047 This was the highest-grossing non-televised live event gate in WWE history in Pittsburgh, 95% of tickets sold. \u2047 Our merchandise sales for that night, more than 25% greater than they were at our last event in Pittsburgh. \u2047 And the night after that, another non-televised live event from Louisville, Kentucky. \u2047 This was the highest-grossing event at the KFC Yum Center in WWE history and a highest paid attendance for a non-televised event in Louisville in over five years. \u2047 Our merchandise sales for that night, more than 25% greater than they were at our last event in Louisville. \u2047 On Raw this past Monday, just three nights ago from Kansas City, Missouri. \u2047 This is our highest grossing WWE non-pay-per-view event in Kansas City in 14 years. \u2047 Our merchandise sales for that night were almost 50% greater than they were at our last Kansas City event. \u2047 Also in the quarter, we added the ability to purchase merchandise via our app for in-venue pickup or to be shipped from the venue to any location you choose. \u2047 Also, as you may recall, as part of our 2021 Live Events Calendar, we announced that SummerSlam would be taking place for the first time from an NFL stadium, from Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas on a Saturday night, August 21. \u2047 Saturday is a new Night for us in terms of a pay-per-view event. \u2047 Without a main event or even a card announced, we have sold over 40,000 of 45,000 tickets and we'll have a record gate for a non-WrestleMania event. \u2047 From Rolling Loud, which I previously mentioned, Bianca Belair also announced with Atlanta Hawks Superstar, Trae Young that we'll be having a New Year's Day pay-per-view this January 1, again, a Saturday from State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, Atlanta expects over 300,000 visitors for New Year's weekend. \u2047 New Year's Eve is a Friday this year. \u2047 The college football playoff championship games are on that New Year's Eve, December 31, Friday. \u2047 The NFL, which traditionally goes on Saturday nights, when the college football regular season has ended, is not going on Saturdays late season with its new 18-week regular season. \u2047 So, we saw what we think as an opening on the sports calendar and we believe ticket sales and viewership will both be indicative of that. \u2047 We look for us to announce the rest of our 2021 calendar and most of our 2022 pay-per-view calendar shortly. \u2047 Another area where we are growing and believe we will continue to grow as our sponsorship business, Stephanie and our global sales and sponsorship team have delivered over 20 new and existing sponsors so far in 2021 with many of them Blue Chip companies and executed on a number of innovative activations that really only can be done by WWE. \u2047 We're bullish on this segment and we're confident brands looking for unique ways to reach consumers will see our record of success and seek us out. \u2047 One thing to note, we announced our first ever ring announcer competition on TikTok, sponsored by Pure Life Water where anyone can submit how they would announce one of our Superstars on their ring walk. \u2047 The winners will be the ring announcers for match at SummerSlam. \u2047 So far, there have been over 9 million views of the TikTok announcement and thousands of submissions. \u2047 Stephanie will have more on sponsorship and a few other items shortly. \u2047 As we look ahead to SummerSlam, we're planning our second NFT drop leading into SummerSlam this time with John Cena. \u2047 This follows our successful NFT launch with the Undertaker of WrestleMania. \u2047 As you're all aware, NFTs trading cards, memorabilia, all incredibly popular right now. \u2047 With our wholly owned intellectual property, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this growing business. \u2047 Last, we announced this past Monday that we partner with Jason Blum in Blumhouse on our first scripted dramatic mini series. \u2047 The United States of America versus Vince McMahon, which will tell the story of the federal indictment of our Founder and CEO by the United States Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York. \u2047 The 30th anniversary of that not-guilty verdict and acquittal was just last week. \u2047 We're excited for this story to be told. \u2047 This is an exciting time for our business. \u2047 Although we don't know precisely what the future holds, the return to our live event touring positions us at an inflection point in terms of our potential fan engagement and financial performance. \u2047 As Nick mentioned, we return to live event touring with fans in attendance on July 16 for the first time in well over a year. \u2047 As a smaller side, Triple H and I went outside to greet our fans in person before doors opened at the Toyota Center in Houston and the feeling was overwhelming. \u2047 And the energy and excitement has only picked up, especially with the return of one of our biggest superstars, John Cena, kicking off what we have branded the Summer of Cena, taking us into SummerSlam. \u2047 Our partners NBCU and Fox supported our return with different campaigns airing across their respective platforms and programing. \u2047 From a production standpoint, WWE applied key learnings and techniques from producing virtual and physical television to upgrade our audio and visual experience, including the use of a 40-foot-tall by 80 foot wide state of the art curved LCD display for superstar entrances. \u2047 In addition, we are utilizing Epic's Unreal Engine 3D creation tool to generate a wide variety of augmented reality elements and surroundings, bringing our superstars to life in ways we have never done before. \u2047 Costs associated are on par with 2019 per episode costs on average and we have seen the results translate into linear viewership. \u2047 As Vince was mentioning earlier, the July 16 episode of SmackDown generated a 21% year-over-year increase in total viewers and a 42% increase in the coveted 18 to 49 demo. \u2047 Similarly, the July 19 episode of Raw generated an 8% year-over-year increase in total viewers and a 15% increase in the 18 to 49 demo. \u2047 Strong demand for live event tickets and the increase in television ratings builds upon favorable trends in key operating metrics evident in the second quarter. \u2047 TV viewership continued to remain stable, maintaining a trend that began when we transitioned out of the performance center and invested in WWE ThunderDome at the end of August. \u2047 From that time to the end of the second quarter, Raw ratings have increased modestly and SmackDown ratings have increased 7%. \u2047 Since the return of our live audience, however, Raw ratings are up 22% in the 18 to 49 demo and SmackDown ratings are up 20%. \u2047 In the quarter, digital consumption increased 5% to a quarterly record of 394 million hours and video views increased 13%"], "gold_summary": ["compname
