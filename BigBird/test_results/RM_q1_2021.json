{"article": ["These statements are not guarantees of future performance and therefore you should not place undue reliance upon them. \u2047 Also, our discussion today may include references to certain non-GAAP measures. \u2047 I'm joined today by Harp Rana, our chief financial officer. \u2047 Following our strong performance in the second half of last year, we carried forward the momentum into 2021. \u2047 In the first quarter, we generated record bottom-line results of 25.5 million of net income and $2.31 of diluted EPS. \u2047 Our growth initiatives helped to reduce our typical first-quarter seasonal liquidation and the impact of new stimulus payments, which in turn drove strong revenue performance. \u2047 At the same time, we maintained a superior credit profile with historically low 30-plus day delinquencies. \u2047 Despite pressure from a combination of tax refunds and two stimulus payments in the quarter, our core small and large loan portfolio grew by $18 million, or 2%, over the prior-year period, and was down only $28 million, or 2.5%, quarter over quarter. \u2047 This strong result was driven, in part, by the new growth initiatives that we implemented in 2020, which continued to perform very effectively. \u2047 We originated $231 million of loans in the quarter, up 1% year over year and up 5% from the first quarter of 2019, with 29 million[Inaudible] originated loans derived from new growth initiatives. \u2047 The second round of $600 stimulus checks appeared to have been spent relatively quickly. \u2047 The third round of $1,400 stimulus checks led to a temporary period of higher loan payment activity along with some weakening of loan demand. \u2047 As a result, while the stimulus payments impacted first-quarter demand, the overall impact on our typical first-quarter seasonal loan portfolio liquidation was much lower than we expected and much lower than what some others in our industry and in the prime credit space experienced. \u2047 Our large loan portfolio actually grew sequentially in the first quarter by $4 million or 0.6% as the stimulus measures disproportionately impacted our higher-rate small loan portfolio. \u2047 Loan demand remained relatively soft in April due to the impact of the distribution of the remaining 20% of stimulus payments along with additional tax refunds. \u2047 However, we saw demand start to pick up in the latter part of April, and we expect demand to continue to rebound in May and June, which should enable us to generate modest loan growth in the second quarter. \u2047 We continue to believe that loan demand in the second half of the year will be strong as the economy more fully reopens. \u2047 Credit quality continued to remain very solid in the quarter, and our balance sheet remains robust. \u2047 Our net credit loss rate during the quarter was 7.7%, a 280 basis points improvement from the prior-year period. \u2047 And we ended the quarter with a record-low, 30-plus day delinquency rate of 4.3%, a 230 basis points improvement from the end of March of 2020. \u2047 As of April 30, our 30-plus day contractual delinquency rate further improved to approximately 3.7%. \u2047 We expect that our credit performance will continue to be strong throughout 2021. \u2047 Any COVID-related net credit losses will occur in late 2021 at the earliest, though we anticipate that our delinquency rate will begin to normalize throughout the balance of the year as the benefits of federal stimulus dissipate. \u2047 Given our continued superior credit performance, we released $6.6 million in COVID-19 reserves in the first quarter and $3.8 million of additional reserves as a result of the seasonal runoff in the portfolio. \u2047 our 139.6 million allowance for credit losses as of March 30 first continues to compare quite favorably to our 30-plus day contracts of delinquency of 47.7 million. \u2047 Our allowance includes a 23.8 million reserve for additional credit losses associated with COVID-19. \u2047 We remain conservative in our maintenance with COVID reserves as the overall economy has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. \u2047 We also continue to further strengthen our overall balance sheet and liquidity position. \u2047 In April, we enhanced our warehouse facility capacity by closing on two new warehouse facilities with our current lenders, Wells Fargo and Credit Suisse, and by adding a third warehouse facility with a new lender JPMorgan. \u2047 While our prior facility only funded large loans, the new facilities fund multiple collateral types, including small loans, large loans, convenience checks, and digitally originated loans. \u2047 We are very pleased with this outcome. \u2047 It represents yet another step in the evolution of our capital structure as we continue to pursue new avenues of funding diversification and additional capacity to support our business growth plans and our capital return program. \u2047 To that end, we are happy to announce an increase of our quarterly dividend by 25% to $0.25 per share. \u2047 In addition, in May, we completed a $30 million stock repurchase program that began in the fourth quarter of 2020, having repurchase, in total, 951,841 shares at a weighted average price of $31.52 per share. \u2047 Our board of directors recently authorized a new $30 million stock repurchase program, which we plan to commence later this month. \u2047 Our outstanding performance and financial results over the past year have enabled us to maintain and expand an attractive capital return program for our shareholders. \u2047 As we discussed on our last call, 2021 is a year of investment in our long-term growth. \u2047 We remain focused on investing in our digital capabilities to complete our omnichannel model, geographic expansion into new states, and new product and channel development to drive additional long-term growth. \u2047 In the first quarter, we completed development of and began testing our improved digital pre-qualification experience for our customers. \u2047 Digitally sourced originations represented 33% of our total new borrower branch volume in the first quarter and 25% of all branch originations we bought remotely in March. \u2047 We are very pleased to see the success of our digital and technological investments, and the adoption of our expanding omnichannel model by our customers. \u2047 In the second and third quarters, we expect to roll out the new prequalification experience to all our states and to begin integrating the new functionality with our existing and new digital affiliates and lead generators. \u2047 In addition, within the next few months, we will begin testing a new guaranteed loan offer program, which is an alternative to our convenience check loan product and offers online settlement with ACH funding into a customer's bank account. \u2047 We also remain on track to be in testing our end-to-end digital origination products for new and existing customers later this year. \u2047 And by the first quarter of 2022, we expect to roll out an improved online customer portal and the mobile app. \u2047 As we communicated previously, we entered Illinois, our 12th state, in mid-April and are excited to begin offering our valuable loan products to millions of new consumers in the state. \u2047 We plan to open 15 to 20 net new branches in 2021. \u2047 We also expect to enter up to two additional states by the end of 2021 and an additional four to six states over the next 18 months. \u2047 Our geographic expansion will be supported by our digital and new growth initiatives, allowing our branches in these states to maintain a wider geographic reach, resulting in higher average receivables per branch and the need for fewer branches. \u2047 Our digital investments and geographic expansion will also offer new products to our customers including our new auto secured product which we began testing in the first quarter, and we expect to roll out to all our states by the end of the third quarter. \u2047 We are very excited about the rest of this year and what the future holds for our franchise. \u2047 We will continue to invest throughout the year and our growth initiatives while maintaining our focus on credit quality and optimizing our overall underwriting capabilities. \u2047 As of March 31, approximately 70% of our total portfolio had been originated since April 2020. \u2047 The vast majority of which was subject to enhance credit standards that we deployed following the outset of the pandemic. \u2047 Our credit performance and underwriting capabilities continue to be foundational to our operational success and provide us with confidence as we pursue our long-term growth strategies. \u2047 We could not be happier with our first-quarter performance, which is a testament to the strength and dedication of the entire regional team. \u2047 We remain fully committed to our customers and our path forward, and we are in a prime position to generate strong top and bottom-line growth for the full year. \u2047 As we execute on our priorities this year, we are also looking ahead to 2022 and beyond. \u2047 We are focused on our key strategic initiatives of digital innovation, geographic expansion, and the development of new products and channels, all of which will allow us to gain market share and create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders. \u2047 Let me take you through our first-quarter results in more detail. \u2047 We generated net income of 25.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $2.31, resulting from our growth initiatives, stable operating expenses, lower funding costs, and strong credit. \u2047 As illustrated on Page 4, branch originations were comparable to prior year as we ended first quarter, originating 169.7 million of loans. \u2047 Meanwhile, we grew direct mail and digital origination by 9% year over year to 61.7 million. \u2047 Our total originations were 231.4 million, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis and 5% higher than the first quarter of 2019 despite two rounds of government stimulus payments in the first quarter. \u2047 Our new growth initiative[00:13:13.23][Inaudible] 29 million of first quarter origination. \u2047 Page 5 displays our portfolio growth and mixed trends through March 31. \u2047 We closed the quarter with net finance receivables of 1.1 billion, up 3 million from the prior-year period as we continue to successfully execute on our new growth initiatives and marketing efforts. \u2047 Our core loan portfolio grew 18 million, or 1.7%, from the prior year and decreased only 2.5% from the end of the fourth quarter, in line with normal seasonal liquidation despite the two rounds of government stimulus. \u2047 Small loans decreased 8% quarter over quarter due to the disproportionate impact of the stimulus payments on this portfolio, while large loans grew slightly at 0.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 For the second quarter, as Rob noted, we expect some trailing impact from the third round of stimulus and tax refunds due to the extended tax season in April, followed by a rebound in demand this month and next. \u2047 Overall, we expect to see modest quarter-over-quarter growth in our finance receivables portfolio in the second quarter. \u2047 On Page 6, we show our digitally sourced originations, which were 33% of our new borrower volume in the first quarter. \u2047 Another high watermark for us. \u2047 This demonstrates our commitment to meeting the needs of our customers and serving them through our omnichannel strategy. \u2047 During the first quarter, large loans were 64% of our digitally sourced originations. \u2047 Turning to Page 7, total revenue grew 2% to 97.7 million. \u2047 Interest in field increased 10 basis points year over year, primarily due to improved credit performance across the portfolio as a result of the government stimulus, tightened underwriting during the pandemic, and our overall mix shift toward higher credit quality customers. \u2047 This resulted in fewer loans in nonaccrual status and fewer interest accrual reversals, offset in part by the continued product mix shift toward lower yielding large loans. \u2047 Sequentially, interest in field and total revenue yield decreased 80 and 90 basis points, respectively. \u2047 Due to a combination of seasonality, our continued portfolio mix shift to larger loans, and the second stimulus payment, which is noted previously, had a disproportionate impact on our small loan runoff in the first quarter. \u2047 As of March 31, 65% of our portfolio were large loans and 81% of our portfolio had an APR at or below 36%. \u2047 In the second quarter, we expect total revenue yield to be approximately 30 basis points lower than the first quarter, and our interest in field to be approximately 20 basis points lower due to the impact that the third and largest stimulus payment is expected to have on our higher-yielding small loan portfolio. \u2047 Moving to Page 8, our net credit loss is 7.7% for the first quarter, a 280-basis-point improvement year over year, while delinquencies remain at historically low levels. \u2047 Net credit loss is roughly 80 basis points from the fourth quarter. \u2047 This is due to normal seasonal increases of NPLs in the first quarter, but the rate of increase of 80 basis points in frst quarter was below the 150 and 180 basis point seasonal increases that we experienced in 2020 and 2019, respectively. \u2047 Due to government stimulus improving economic conditions and our lower delinquency levels, any COVID-related losses will occur in late 2021 at the earliest. \u2047 As a result, we expect that our full-year net credit loss rate will be approximately 8%. \u2047 Our 30-plus day delinquency levels as of March 31 was a record 4.3%, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year and 100 basis points lower than December 31. \u2047 At the end of April, we saw 30-plus day delinquencies dropped further to a record low of approximately 3.7%. \u2047 Moving forward, we expect 30-plus day delinquencies to gradually rise off the April low to more normal levels. \u2047 Turning to Page 10, we ended the fourth quarter with an allowance for credit losses of 150 million or 13.2% of net finance receivables. \u2047 During the first quarter of 2021, the allowance decreased by 10.4 million to 12.6% of net finance receivables. \u2047 The decrease in reserves, including the base reserve release of 3.8 million from portfolio liquidation and a COVID-19 reserve release of 6.6 million. \u2047 As a reminder, going forward, as our portfolio grows, we will build additional reserves to support this new growth. \u2047 At the moment, the severity and the duration of our macro assumptions remain relatively consistent with our fourth-quarter model, including an assumption that the unemployment rate will be below 10% at the end of 2021. \u2047 We will review these assumptions every quarter to reflect changing macro conditions as the economy begins to rebound. \u2047 Our 139.6 million allowance for credit losses as of March 31 continues to compare very favorably toward 30-plus day contractual delinquency of 47.7 million. \u2047 We remain confident that we remain sufficiently reserved. \u2047 Looking to Page 11, G&A expenses for the first quarter of 2021 were 45.8 million, an improvement of 0.4 million or 0.9% from the prior-year period. \u2047 Primarily driven by reductions in executive transition costs and operating costs related to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses, marketing expenses, and investment in digital and technological capabilities to support our new growth initiatives and omni"], "gold_summary": ["q1 earnings per share $2.31.  \u2047  q1 revenue rose 1.7 percent to $97.7
