{"article": ["Hopefully, each of you had a wonderful holiday season. \u2047 I will begin today's call with a few highlights from the quarter and commentary on CMC's strategic growth projects. \u2047 Paul Lawrence will then cover the quarter's financial information in more detail, and I will conclude with a discussion of the current market environment and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. \u2047 After which, we will open the call to questions. \u2047 I'm pleased to report that CMC's first quarter fiscal 2022 earnings were the best in our company's 106-year history. \u2047 Earnings from continuing operations were 232.9 million or $1.90 per diluted share on net sales of 2 billion. \u2047 Excluding the impact of a tax benefit related to an international reorganization, adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 199.2 million or $1.62 per diluted share. \u2047 CMC generated core EBITDA of 326.8 million, an increase of 109% from the year-ago period and an improvement of 28% from the prior quarter. \u2047 This was the third consecutive quarter in which our company has reported record bottom-line earnings, core EBITDA, and segment-level EBITDA. \u2047 These achievements are a result of the execution of our strategic plans presented to shareholders during our virtual investor day in August of 2020. \u2047 Strong market conditions and strong margins across several product lines certainly contributed to these exceptional results. \u2047 However, to put this performance into context, during the fiscal 2014 and 2015 time period, we experienced similar robust market conditions to what we enjoy today, and our 12-month EBITDA was between 375 million and 400 million with return on invested capital in the mid-single digits. \u2047 This significant improvement over the past six years underscores the enhanced earnings power of CMC today, and it is our objective to produce better returns with higher highs and lower lows through the economic cycle. \u2047 To back up this statement, CMC achieved an annualized return on invested capital of 25.1% during the first quarter and an annualized return on equity of 35.6%. \u2047 Our team members continue to tightly manage controllable costs, reflecting changes to costs on a per-unit basis, better than most industry and macro benchmarks we track. \u2047 We are certainly proud of CMC's record financial results delivered by strong execution of our strategic initiatives, as well as solid market fundamentals. \u2047 While we are proud of the performance to date, let me take a moment to explain why I believe CMC's best days are still ahead of us. \u2047 I'll start with sustainability. \u2047 Before we can responsibly talk about growth, we need to be certain that what we are growing is sustainable. \u2047 CMC was founded 106 years ago as a metals recycler, and we carry on that legacy today, operating possibly the cleanest portfolio of steel mills in the world. \u2047 We're also committed to further improvement as we make significant progress toward our 2030 environmental goals. \u2047 CMC's Scope 1 and 2 emissions are already well under the 2040 Paris Accords target, and our emissions have improved by 6.2% per ton of steel produced compared to our fiscal 2019 baseline. \u2047 This two-year improvement stands in stark contrast to the global industry, which increased its emissions intensity over the same time frame. \u2047 Since fiscal 2019, we've also improved our energy efficiency by 7.8%, while the global industry's performance has deteriorated by nearly 6%. \u2047 We are sourcing more renewable energy than ever before, and the proportion of green energy within our overall consumption has risen by roughly 3 percentage points over the last two years, and we continue to work every angle to move this figure higher. \u2047 Our commitment to renewable sourcing is demonstrated by the design of our future Arizona 2 micro mill now under construction in Mesa. \u2047 This exciting new plant will be capable of directly connecting to an on-site solar field, making micro mill steelmaking the world's cleanest steelmaking technology even cleaner. \u2047 In our industry, sustainability also means treating our people with the right way and keeping them safe on the job. \u2047 CMC's mission is that each day, every one of our employees finishes their shift in the same condition they started. \u2047 We have developed a unique safety culture that leans on innovative thinking, emphasizes shared accountability, and aims toward an ultimate goal of zero incidents. \u2047 Through this approach, CMC has achieved several consecutive years of improvement in our incident rates, including dramatic improvements at acquired facilities where we have instilled our CMC culture. \u2047 Across each line of business, we focus extensively at keeping our people safe and healthy. \u2047 Not only is this the right thing to do, but over the long term, we expect the care we have for our employees will lead to long-term retention of our exceptional workforce and make CMC an employer of choice within our industry. \u2047 I touched on only a few highlights of our ESG commitment, which is detailed in our sustainability report published in December 2021, and I encourage you to read the report. \u2047 To sum up, I would say that CMC is not just sustainable, but a sustainability leader. \u2047 Being a leader means always pushing further and never standing still. \u2047 In the years ahead, we will do just that. \u2047 And clearly -- our clearly sustainable platform gives us a solid foundation on which to grow. \u2047 I'd like to now discuss some of our exciting initiatives which are a result of the disciplined and deliberate execution of CMC's strategic plan. \u2047 These projects strengthen and reinforce our organization's core capabilities. \u2047 While extending CMC's growth runway into markets, customer groups, and applications, we already know well. \u2047 Recently, we announced a series of exciting growth initiatives, which have been under consideration for some time. \u2047 I'd like to emphasize that we have been disciplined in knowing the strategic direction and goals that most benefit our shareholders, disciplined in taking the next step in identifying opportunities that move our organization toward these goals, and then, acting decisively when these opportunities arise and the timing is right. \u2047 Let me begin with an update on CMC's third micro mill currently under construction in Mesa, Arizona. \u2047 This plant will be the first micro mill in the world capable of producing merchant bar and, as I mentioned earlier, will be among the greenest in the world. \u2047 Arizona 2, as we are calling it, provides significant strategic value to CMC. \u2047 It will replace the much higher cost and inefficient rebar capacity of the former Steel California operations. \u2047 The sale of which will fund over half the cost of our new plant. \u2047 Arizona 2 will also give CMC a coast-to-coast merchant bar footprint and serve several customers we already know well through our MBQ operations in Alabama, South Carolina, and Texas. \u2047 Importantly, Arizona 2 will help further optimize CMC's operational network and enhance customer service. \u2047 The new mill, dubbed MM4, will augment our operational footprint in the Eastern United States and enhance our ability to serve markets in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest. \u2047 We expect significant internal synergies from this investment, including enhanced production flexibility among our Eastern U.S. mill network, improved customer service capabilities, as well as enhanced delivery times and logistical efficiencies in getting steel to its destination. \u2047 MM4 is a project we have studied for several years and now feel the time is right to execute. \u2047 MM4 will be rebar-centric with additional capabilities under consideration. \u2047 This investment further demonstrates our commitment to a sustainable future for CMC. \u2047 Both mill projects stand to benefit directly from the largest infrastructure package to be enacted in the U.S. in several decades. \u2047 The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed last November will provide 1.2 trillion in funding over five years and stimulate an estimated 1 million to 1.5 million tons of incremental annual rebar demand at full run rate. \u2047 This would add roughly 15% to current domestic consumption of around 8.5 million tons. \u2047 We expect the time between the bill's enactment and the commencement of significant construction activity to be in the range of 18 to 24 months, which lines up very well with the scheduled future commissioning of Arizona 2. \u2047 We further anticipate a late calendar 2024, early 2025 start-up of MM4, and this would coincide with infrastructure-related demand nearing full run rate. \u2047 Stepping beyond mill investments, CMC's agreement to acquire Tensar Corporation announced last month will add additional products and capabilities, which will make CMC a unique provider of value-added reinforcement solutions for the domestic and international construction markets. \u2047 This transaction represents CMC's entry into an adjacent and complementary product space through the purchase of a proven market and innovation leader. \u2047 The acquisition meaningfully extends CMC's growth runway and provides a platform for further expansion into high-margin, high customer service engineered solutions. \u2047 As we discussed in our call in December, Tensar's offerings provide best-in-class value propositions to customers, particularly against competing traditional reinforcing solutions but are underpenetrated in the marketplace. \u2047 We believe this combination of attractiveness to customers and large potential market opportunity will support significant organic growth at Tensar in the years ahead. \u2047 Tensar is already very well managed with a strong reputation and proven innovation and operational capabilities. \u2047 We believe these factors greatly reduce the execution risk of this transaction while providing CMC with solid commercial synergy opportunities out of the gate. \u2047 Currently, we expect to close on the acquisition during the fiscal third quarter. \u2047 The two U.S. mill expansions plus the Tensar acquisition, combined with our recently commissioned rolling line in Europe, should provide CMC with at least 200 million of sustainable through-the-cycle EBITDA once fully operational. \u2047 My belief that CMC's best days are ahead is based not just on our announced strategic investments but several other factors as well, including the quality of our people. \u2047 We've not discussed this topic much in the past, but it's vitally important to the future of CMC with a longer-term impact greater than any new capital project. \u2047 As we sit here today, I'm very confident regarding the new generation of leaders that are developing at every level of our organization. \u2047 Our bench strength has never been better. \u2047 CMC's transformational growth projects over the last several years have expanded our North American business by nearly 50%, necessitating organizational adjustment to accommodate such rapid growth. \u2047 Employees were provided with opportunities to take on new responsibilities and new roles across the company, giving each an expanded perspective of CMC's business and valuable experience in managing through change. \u2047 Additionally, the last two years have involved unprecedented challenges, first related to complications due to the pandemic, followed by high inflation, logistical issues, and labor shortages. \u2047 Our team has responded exceptionally well to the series of challenges, and we have all seen the outcome, a stronger company generating record financial results. \u2047 With hindsight, it's clear the events of the last several years has created an innovative, adaptable, stress-tested roster of current and future key leaders at CMC. \u2047 Lastly and while this is outside CMC's control, I'm confident about the future of our core geographical markets. \u2047 CMC has exposure to the most economically vibrant and rapidly growing regions in both the U.S. and Europe. \u2047 For more than a decade, population growth within CMC's key U.S. markets have outpaced the broader United States. \u2047 This trend has picked up pace considerably since early 2020 and has been reflected in new community formation and relocation of businesses. \u2047 Ultimately, population drives construction over the long term, and CMC is well-positioned to benefit. \u2047 The dividend will be paid on February 3, 2022. \u2047 This represents CMC's 229th consecutive quarterly dividend with the amount paid per share increasing 17% from a year ago. \u2047 As we announced last quarter, we are also committed to returning capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program, and Paul will give you an update on our activity this past quarter. \u2047 With that as an overview, I'll now turn the discussion over to Paul Lawrence, senior vice president and chief financial officer, to provide some more comments on the results for the quarter. \u2047 As Barbara noted, we reported record fiscal first quarter 2022 earnings from continuing operations of 232.9 million or $1.90 per diluted share, more than triple prior-year levels of 63.9 million and $0.53, respectively. \u2047 Results this quarter include a net after-tax benefit of 33.7 million, primarily related to a tax capital loss recognition on an international tax restructuring transaction, which took place in the quarter. \u2047 Excluding the impact of this item, the adjusted earnings from continuing operations were 199.2 million or $1.62 per diluted share. \u2047 Core EBITDA from continuing operations was 326.8 million for the first quarter of 2022, more than double the 156.6 million generated during the prior-year period. \u2047 Both our North America and Europe segments contributed significantly to year-over-year earnings growth, while core EBITDA per ton of finished steel reached a record level of $233 per ton. \u2047 The first quarter marked the 11th consecutive quarter in which CMC generated an annualized return on invested capital at or above 10%, which is in excess of our cost of capital. \u2047 Now, I will review our results by segment for the first quarter of fiscal '22. \u2047 The North American segment recorded adjusted EBITDA of 268.5 million for the quarter, an all-time high. \u2047 This compares to adjusted EBITDA of 155.6 million in the same period last year. \u2047 Largest driver of this 73% improvement was a significant increase in margins on steel products and raw materials. \u2047 Partially offsetting this benefit were higher controllable costs on a per ton of finished steel basis due primarily to increased unit pricing for freight, energy, and alloys. \u2047 Selling prices for steel products for our mills increased by $364 per ton on a year-over-year basis and $76 per ton sequentially. \u2047 Margin over scrap on steel products increased $202 per ton from a year ago and $82 per ton sequentially. \u2047 The average selling price of downstream products increased by $158 per ton from the prior year, reaching $1,092. \u2047 This increase was consistent with the rise in underlying scrap costs, resulting in unchanged margins over scrap relative to the prior period. \u2047 During our fourth quarter earnings call, I indicated that CMC's downstream backlog was expected to reprice higher throughout fiscal 2022 as new higher price work replaces older lower-priced work. \u2047 Through the first four months of the fiscal year, we are seeing the anticipated rate of repricing play out. \u2047 We continue to expect forward -- further upward movement in CMC's average backlog price through the remainder of the fiscal year, particularly in light of strong market demand and bid volume, which we are experiencing in our downstream geographies. \u2047 Shipments of finished product in the first quarter were essentially flat from a year ago. \u2047 End market demand"], "gold_summary": ["q1 earnings per share $1.90 from continuing operations.
