{"article": ["I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 The pass code for both numbers is 13723396. \u2047 During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. \u2047 Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. \u2047 These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories. \u2047 During the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a non-cash impairment of $582 million that reflected our expectation for reduced profitability from our Houston refinery. \u2047 I'm pleased to join for my 28th and last earnings call as CEO of LyondellBasell. \u2047 Per our usual practice, we will review our results from the quarter. \u2047 As I prepare to leave the company at the end of the year, I've taken some time to reflect on the strong company we have built and our outlook for the future. \u2047 Without a doubt, LyondellBasell's future is very bright. \u2047 Because of the efforts of our incredibly talented and hard-working global team, we've built a company that has proven it can perform under a range of conditions. \u2047 During an event like a global pandemic, that no one could have predicted or imagined, we were able to fund our dividend with cash from operations and grow our company through accretive M&A. \u2047 I'm confident that LyondellBasell will continue to deliver for its stakeholders in the future. \u2047 This is a company that is focused on building value for the long term and one that is built to stand the test of time. \u2047 With that said, let's review our third quarter results. \u2047 LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from robust global demand and tight market conditions. \u2047 In the third quarter, our company delivered $5.25 per share of earnings, more than 4 times higher than the same quarter last year. \u2047 EBITDA was approximately $2.7 billion, a year-over-year quarterly improvement of $1.8 billion. \u2047 Efficient cash conversion generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, a new quarterly record for our company. \u2047 These results are indicative of strong markets, the discipline with which we approach running our business and the increased earnings power from our value-driven investments and accretive growth over the past several years. \u2047 We remain focused on improving LyondellBasell's cash generation through all stages of the business cycle. \u2047 While our portfolio delivered $2.7 billion of EBITDA, this quarter's results reflect a sequential decline of 11%. \u2047 Increased costs for natural gas, ethane, naphtha and butane compressed margins for many products from the highs seen in the second quarter. \u2047 This, however, does not change how we see the future. \u2047 We continue to see very solid demand for our products and remain highly constructive on the outlook for our businesses as global reopening continues to play out over the coming quarters. \u2047 We expect a combination of a well-funded economy and pent-up consumer demand for durable goods as well as the nondurable goods associated with travel, leisure and other in-person activities will continue to underpin attractive markets. \u2047 In short, we remain confident that a reopening global economy and eventual normalization of global supply chains will support continued growth for our businesses over the coming quarters. \u2047 Our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors rose to 0.24 during the third quarter. \u2047 Much of this increase is associated with the tragic incident at our acetyls facility in La Porte, Texas, during July. \u2047 We remain committed to learning from this incident and incorporating the learnings from the investigations to help prevent such tragedies from ever happening again. \u2047 Looking more closely at the chart, we are encouraged by the notable improvement in chemical industry safety performance during 2020. \u2047 We are watching to see if this is a durable trend or perhaps a onetime benefit from reduced in-person work hours during the height of the pandemic. \u2047 At LyondellBasell, continuous learning and a self-improving culture are key focus areas in our pursuit of GoalZERO safety performance for both our employees and our contractors. \u2047 On slide six, I would like to highlight LyondellBasell's increased commitments to help address the global challenge of climate change. \u2047 In late September, we announced accelerated targets and a goal to achieve net zero Scope one and Scope two greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. \u2047 We now aim to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. \u2047 We plan to achieve these goals by advancing progress on several fronts. \u2047 First, we are improving energy efficiency in all our plants and reducing our need for high carbon content fuel sources, such as coal. \u2047 We are already moving on this front. \u2047 In September, we announced our plan to phase out coal from the power plant at our site in Wesseling, Germany. \u2047 Second, we intend to procure at least 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. \u2047 Third, we are focusing on minimizing flare emissions from our clients, particularly during shutdowns and start-up events. \u2047 In addition, we're evaluating a portfolio of technology options across the company's manufacturing footprint, including sustainable hydrogen increased electrification and carbon capture for storage or reutilization in our processes. \u2047 We believe this strategy puts us on an achievable pathway toward our net zero goal. \u2047 In the near term, we do not expect significant increases in our overall capital budget as reduced spending associated with the completion of our PO/TBA project in 2022 will be offset by an increasing share of climate-related investment. \u2047 Before I begin, I would like to share my sincere gratitude to Bob for his tireless work, inspirational energy and thought partnership in leading and growing LyondellBasell for nearly 12 years. \u2047 We are all sad to see you go, Bob, but we will be eagerly watching your progress and wishing you continued success. \u2047 In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated a record $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward the $5.4 billion of cash generated over the last 12 months. \u2047 Our free operating cash flow for the third quarter improved by more than 10% relative to the second quarter, and our free operating cash flow yield was 15% over the last 12 months. \u2047 We expect this chart will continue to improve during the fourth quarter as 2020 results drop off from our trailing performance. \u2047 As I have mentioned during previous calls, we are highly focused on shareholder returns. \u2047 A strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. \u2047 In addition to our dividend, we also resumed share repurchases during the third quarter and reduced our share count by approximately one million. \u2047 We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $500 million in capital expenditures. \u2047 Strong cash flows supported debt reduction of nearly $700 million, bringing our year-to-date debt reduction to $2.4 billion. \u2047 We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.9 billion. \u2047 In July, S&P Global Ratings recognized the improvement in our balance sheet by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce debt by up to $4 billion during 2021, and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. \u2047 After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $650 million of bonds in late October. \u2047 We do not foresee the need for additional debt repayment in 2022. \u2047 Confidence around our deleveraging targets enabled us to resume share repurchases in September, and we continued to opportunistically repurchase shares during October. \u2047 As of October 22, we have repurchased a total of 1.6 million shares. \u2047 Now I would like to highlight the results for each of our segments on slide nine. \u2047 In the third quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $2.7 billion. \u2047 Our results reflect strong margins supported by robust demand for our products and tight market conditions, offset by higher costs, primarily in our O&P Europe, Asia, international segment and our I&D segment. \u2047 Let's begin the individual segment discussions on slide 10 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins-Americas segment. \u2047 Robust demand drove EBITDA to about $1.6 billion, slightly lower than the second quarter. \u2047 Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million compared to the second quarter due to lower margins and volumes. \u2047 Despite relatively stable benchmark ethylene margins, our margins declined as we purchased ethylene to supplement production and meet strong derivative demand. \u2047 Volumes decreased due to unplanned maintenance, resulting in a cracker operating rate of 89%. \u2047 Polyolefins results increased more than $75 million during the third quarter as robust demand in tight markets drove spreads higher with polyolefin prices increasing slightly more than monomer prices. \u2047 In fact, our polypropylene spreads reached a historic high. \u2047 We continue to see strong demand for our products as we begin the fourth quarter. \u2047 However, higher energy and feedstock costs, along with typical seasonality demand softness toward the end of the year are likely to compress margins for our O&P-Americas businesses. \u2047 Higher feedstock cost and lower seasonal demand during summer holidays reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets resulting in a third quarter EBITDA of $474 million, $234 million lower than the second quarter. \u2047 Olefins results declined about $50 million as margins decreased driven by higher feedstock costs despite the higher ethylene and co-product prices. \u2047 We operated our crackers at a rate of 92% of capacity due to planned maintenance. \u2047 Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $120 million compared to the prior quarter. \u2047 Lower seasonal demand drove declines in polyolefin price spreads relative to monomer cost and reduced volumes. \u2047 Declining polyolefin spreads also affected our joint venture equity income by about $35 million. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we expect to see further margin declines from higher energy and feedstock costs along with end-of-year seasonality. \u2047 Our ethylene volumes are expected to decline due to planned maintenance. \u2047 Rising feedstock and energy costs drove margin declines in most businesses resulted in third quarter EBITDA of $348 million, $248 million lower than the prior quarter. \u2047 Results were impacted by approximately $25 million due to site closure costs associated with the exit of our ethanol business. \u2047 Third quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased about $15 million as margins declined slightly from the historical highs of the second quarter. \u2047 Durable goods demand remained strong, resulting in increased volumes. \u2047 Intermediate Chemicals results decreased approximately $140 million. \u2047 Margins declined in most businesses, primarily styrene and volumes decreased as a result of downtime in our acetyls business. \u2047 Oxyfuels and related products results decreased about $40 million as increased butane feedstock prices more than offset the increased volume from improved gasoline demand. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we expect volumes to increase with the restart of our La Porte acetyls facility and continued strength and demand for durable goods. \u2047 Margins are likely to moderate with fourth quarter seasonality and higher raw material costs for our I&D segment. \u2047 Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on slide 13. \u2047 Customer supply chain constraints continue to hinge results with third quarter EBITDA of $121 million, $8 million lower than the second quarter. \u2047 Compounding and solutions results were relatively unchanged. \u2047 Margins were higher but partially offset by a decrease in volume due to restricted production in downstream markets, including the automotive sector, appliance manufacturing and other industries affected by semiconductor shortages. \u2047 Advanced Polymer results decreased about $10 million driven by lower margins and volumes primarily due to plant maintenance. \u2047 We expect results will be similar in the fourth quarter as it will likely take several quarters before supply chain constraints begin to improve. \u2047 Margins improved significantly in the third quarter, resulting in an EBITDA improvement of $122 million to a positive $41 million. \u2047 In the third quarter, prices for byproducts increased, costs for renewable identification number credits, or RINs, decreased and the Maya 2-11 benchmark increased by $1.65 per barrel to $23.11 per barrel. \u2047 The average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 260,000 barrels per day, an operating rate of 97%. \u2047 Improved demand from increasing mobility should be supportive for our refining margins and could enable continued profitability during the fourth quarter. \u2047 Let's finish the segment discussion on slide 15 with the result of our Technology segment. \u2047 Increased licensing revenue drove third quarter EBITDA to a record $155 million, $63 million higher than the prior quarter. \u2047 We expect that fourth quarter profitability for our technology business will return to similar quarterly levels as the first half of this year based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue and catalyst demand. \u2047 Our approach is to pursue prudent and accretive investments that chart a clear path for increasing EBITDA. \u2047 In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and forming the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment from both legacy and acquired businesses. \u2047 With integration complete, we have a solid platform for future growth and synergies should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the markets served by this segment. \u2047 In the second quarter of 2020, we started a 500,000 ton per year polyethylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation Hyperzone HDPE technology. \u2047 At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this asset is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA. \u2047 In September of 2020, we established a new integrated cracker joint venture in Northeastern China. \u2047 This investment is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our company, again based upon full capacity and historical industry margins. \u2047 In December of 2020, we closed the transaction for the integrated polyethylene joint venture in Louisiana. \u2047 At full capacity and historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA for our company. \u2047 In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, the combination of two new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023 could together add almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. \u2047 Taken together, we estimate these initiatives could add up to $1.5 billion of EBITDA to"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share $5.25.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $5.25.  \u2047  lyondellbasell - expect strong demand for co's products to continue as roll out of vaccines drives improvement in economic activity around the world.  \u2047  lyondellbasell - third quarter results reflect robust demand for lyondellbasell products and tight market conditions."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3 earnings per share $5.25.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $5.25.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $5.25."]}
