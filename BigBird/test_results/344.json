{"article": ["Jim Hatfield, Chief Administrative Officer; Daniel Froetscher, APS' President and COO; Barbara Lockwood, Senior Vice President, Public Policy; and Jacob Tetlow, Senior Vice President, Operations, are also here with us. \u2047 First, I need to cover a few details with you. \u2047 It will also be available by telephone through May 12, 2021. \u2047 2021 has started off in line with our financial expectations. \u2047 And so, before Ted discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent operational and regulatory developments. \u2047 And I'll also touch on our progress toward achieving our 2021 goals. \u2047 Spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work. \u2047 And while we've always had a robust summer preparedness program, resource adequacy has recently become a more visible topic, given the events in neighboring states over the past year. \u2047 To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, each year we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operation center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders. \u2047 We're also procuring an additional 450 megawatts of seasonal peaking capacity, including hydro power, and we expanded our contract up to 60 megawatts for demand response from our commercial and industrial customers to help ensure that we've got adequate resources through the 2021 summer season. \u2047 Our procurement process is another important way that we help ensure long-term resource adequacy. \u2047 Last year, we announced the addition of 141 megawatts of battery storage to be located on six of our APS-owned solar sites. \u2047 Development has begun and this project is on track to meet the expected 2022 in-service date. \u2047 We also announced two RFPs last year, including an all-source RFP and a battery RFP. \u2047 The response to these solicitations was robust and we're in the process of reviewing the proposals. \u2047 We expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon. \u2047 On the regulatory front, the Commission continues to evaluate the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year. \u2047 In fact, the Commission is scheduled to discuss the clean energy rules at their open meeting today. \u2047 The Commission may hold their final vote today or they may choose to continue the discussion. \u2047 For our rate case, the hearing concluded in March and initial briefs were filed on April 6 and reply briefs were filed on April 30. \u2047 The ACC is scheduled to discuss at their open meeting today whether to reopen the evidentiary record in our pending case to include additional evidence, including evidence regarding adjusted cost recovery mechanisms. \u2047 We believe the rate case record is sufficient and that adjustors provide substantial benefit to customers by supporting both critical programs and reflecting changes in utility cost that can be properly passed on to customers. \u2047 Pending this decision, the next steps in this rate case are that the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion and order and the Commission will schedule the case for an open meeting to vote. \u2047 We currently expect a decision on the rate case will be issued during the third quarter of 2021. \u2047 Turning to our 2021 goals. \u2047 On the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we highlighted improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship and continuing to execute our clean energy commitment as three key priorities. \u2047 We've made progress toward these objectives during the first quarter, but we recognized there is more work to do. \u2047 Customer enrollment in our Cool Rewards program surpassed 36,000 connected smart thermostats. \u2047 We're also working on a customer bill redesign project to simplify customer bills. \u2047 And a lot of the work that we're doing in the customer communication and education space is the result of collaboration with an input from our customer advisory and our stakeholder advisory boards. \u2047 I can say, we truly appreciate the individuals and organizations that participate in these forums and they provide us with tremendous feedback. \u2047 In the regulatory space, we appreciate the Commission's balanced decision to implement our annual power supply adjusted rate change, 50% in April and 50% in November, instead of our typical February 1 implementation date. \u2047 This decision recognizes and balances the ongoing COVID impacts on customers providing rate gradualism and helping to ensure that the company remains financially secure. \u2047 I already covered some of the progress we've made on procuring additional clean energy. \u2047 I'm also proud to share that the US Environmental Protection Agency selected APS as a 2021 Energy Star Partner of the Year in recognition of our demand-side management programs. \u2047 These programs contributed to our overall 2020 energy efficiency savings of nearly 586,000 megawatt hours and they will contribute to reducing lifetime carbon emissions by an estimated 2.1 billion pounds. \u2047 In addition, we continue to explore partnerships with our customers to expand our microgrid offerings. \u2047 I'll close my comments by sharing that Daniel Froetscher, President and Chief Operating Officer, will retire this August after serving nearly 41 years with the company. \u2047 Daniel has been instrumental in the success of this company over the past four decades. \u2047 In particular, he served as a respected and admired leader both within the companies and in the communities that we serve and as a mentor to many. \u2047 I can't express in words my gratitude and appreciation for Daniel's contribution. \u2047 I join my colleagues in congratulating Daniel on his retirement. \u2047 As Stephanie mentioned, Jacob Tetlow, Senior Vice President of Operations, is here today and he'll be joining our earnings calls going forward. \u2047 Jacob has a wealth of experience in both transmission and distribution operations and fossil generation here at APS. \u2047 And Jacob's extensive experience as well as the company's robust succession planning position us well to continue operating with top-tier reliability. \u2047 With Jeff having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. \u2047 I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth. \u2047 2021 started strong, earning $0.32 per share compared to $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Higher pension and other post-retirement non-service credits, higher transmission revenue and weather, all contributed to the increase in earnings, partially offset by a higher operations and maintenance expense due to higher planned outage expense compared to the prior year period. \u2047 We also experienced 2.1% customer growth and positive weather-normalized sales growth, both within our expected guidance for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020. \u2047 Economic development continues to support our customer and sales growth as headlines regarding new companies moving to our state are becoming even more frequent. \u2047 Chris Camacho, the Greater Phoenix Economic Council President and CEO, said the organization is working with 291 companies that are considering relocating or expanding in the Phoenix area. \u2047 To support the expansion of businesses, Phoenix is projected to add 18.4 million square feet of new industrial space in 2021, placing the valley second nationwide after Dallas according to a study by CommercialSearch. \u2047 This represents a 76% increase over last year for industrial construction. \u2047 The influx from business for relocation also adds to the residential population growth we have experienced. \u2047 Turning to our financial health. \u2047 We are following the status of President Biden's infrastructure and tax plan, including the potential for new tax incentives and we'll integrate any necessary changes to our resource procurement plans and capital if the proposal passes. \u2047 With regard to the potential for a corporate tax rate increase, we are well positioned to address future changes through our existing TEAM adjustor mechanism. \u2047 As an update on our customer delinquent account balances, the cumulative total dollar amount of all residential accounts in arrears has decreased 30% since December 31, 2020. \u2047 We see this trend continuing as customers are paying down past due balances. \u2047 We expect the Commission's preliminary vote at the April open meeting to implement a permanent summer disconnect moratorium will result in this continuing trend of increasing delinquent balances through the summer and decreasing balances after the expiration of the annual moratorium. \u2047 For 2021, we expect the increased bad debt expense associated with the summer disconnect moratorium and COVID-19 disconnect moratorium will result in a negative impact to our 2021 operating results of approximately $20 million to $30 million pre-tax compared to prior years that did not have a disconnect moratorium. \u2047 This is consistent with the results we experienced in 2020. \u2047 Including the impacts from COVID and the summer disconnect moratorium, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, solid investment grade credit ratings, a well-funded pension and sufficient liquidity. \u2047 In addition, our focus and progress on cost saving initiatives continues to result in improvements. \u2047 As a recent example, our supply chain team installed a new inventory optimization software. \u2047 The software uses scenario-based service level-driven methodologies to establish optimal inventory policies. \u2047 Since implementation in August of last year, this software has reduced our inventory by nearly $9 million, which mitigates potential inventory write-off risk in the future. \u2047 Our Lean efforts continue for managing costs, combined with the key initiatives Jeff highlighted for 2021. \u2047 They all support our commitment to provide long-term value to both shareholders and customers. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share of $0.32.  \u2047  qtrly earnings per share $0.32."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $0.32.
