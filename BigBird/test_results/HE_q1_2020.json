{"article": ["On the call today are Jeff Jones, our President and CEO; and Tony Bowen, our CFO. \u2047 Some of the figures that we'll discuss today are presented on a non-GAAP basis. \u2047 Such statements are based on current information and management's expectations as of this date and are not guarantees of future performance. \u2047 As such, our actual outcomes and results could differ materially. \u2047 You can learn more about these risks in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2019 and our other SEC filings. \u2047 During Q&A, we ask that participants limit themselves to one question with a follow-up after which they may choose to jump back into the queue. \u2047 When we talked with you last quarter, we outlined our strategic objectives to digitally enable every aspect of our business to deliver our expertise to consumers in new and exciting ways, and we're seeing some positive results. \u2047 We're focused on serving Assisted clients with higher quality and better value and are on track to achieve our goal of holding share in the category. \u2047 We are seeing stronger demand for our Virtual product Tax Pro Go. \u2047 We continue to grow clients in DIY. \u2047 Client satisfaction scores are up across all products following a year in which we saw unprecedented growth. \u2047 And we continue to make strides in small business including another strong quarter from Wave. \u2047 While I'm pleased with these early results we identified a couple of areas to improve DIY performance in the second half, that I will comment on later. \u2047 First, I'll provide our perspective on what we've seen in the tax industry. \u2047 Then I'll review our tax season to date results, discuss our expectations for the second half of the season and provide an update on small business. \u2047 Finally, Tony will review our third quarter results and offer additional thoughts on our financial outlook for the fiscal year. \u2047 Starting with the industry. \u2047 Overall trends in filings are consistent with our expectations. \u2047 At this point the increase in DIY mix is at levels lower than last year. \u2047 So while there was speculation by some that the second year of the new tax law would cause more Assisted filers to switch to DIY, we aren't seeing any evidence of this in either our data or the industries and the change has actually moderated. \u2047 Turning to our performance, I'd like to spend some time providing an update on our progress in each of the key areas we outlined last quarter. \u2047 We're focused on leading the industry with upfront transparent pricing, enhancing our standard operating procedures and digitizing how tax pros serve clients through Work Center. \u2047 In pricing, we're bringing upfront and transparent to life in an even stronger way this year through a new price estimator tool to help our tax pros provide clients a better estimate at the outset. \u2047 Upfront transparent pricing is the key element of our recently launched No Surprise Guarantee, which also provides three audit assistance and a midyear tax check-in for clients across all of our products. \u2047 We've also improved Work Center which digitizes how our tax pros serve and communicate with clients, providing them with a superior experience. \u2047 We're seeing results from these efforts with higher retention for both new and prior clients as well as better conversions. \u2047 Client survey scores increased 3 points for price for value and 2 points for overall quality, considering the 9 point improvement in these scores last season, these results are tremendous. \u2047 This has led to a significant improvement in client trajectory compared to this time last year. \u2047 With a lot of season left, we're confident that we will achieve our goal of holding share in the Assisted category. \u2047 Tax Sseason '20 marks the second year of Tax Pro Go. \u2047 An innovative product that provides clients with access to be unparalleled expertise of our tax pros from the convenience of their mobile device. \u2047 This year we redesigned the client experience to improve the product flow, simplified pricing, and made it easier to connect with our expert tax pros. \u2047 We're also highlighting the advantages of this product in our marketing, which is driving an increase in Tax Pro Go demand and mobile usage. \u2047 We're seeing the results of these efforts with improvements in key client service metrics and strong client growth. \u2047 And while we're still in the early stages of this product, this continued growth gives us confidence that we can satisfy unmet needs and attract new clients to our brand. \u2047 In DIY, we've maintained our challenger strategy of investing to improve the product and user experience, pricing at a level that is competitive and provides value to clients, and communicating this value to grow awareness in compelled DIY consumers to switch to H&R Block. \u2047 We continue to utilize AI and machine learning to improve ease, speed and personalization in our product. \u2047 We've also increased the prominence of Online Assist, which provides DIY clients with on-demand access to a tax pro through chat, phone and screen sharing. \u2047 This product is priced competitively and is supported by the unmatched expertise of our extensive tax pro network. \u2047 And our service levels have been tremendous this season, with most clients able to access the Tax Pro within one minute. \u2047 Collectively, these efforts have led to strong results in our net promoter scores increasing over 3 points. \u2047 This is a significant -- this is significant considering the 9 point increase we saw last year. \u2047 And our product has received a number of third-party accolades, including number one in thestreet.com's ranking of the best online tax software and NerdWallet's best software for simple returns. \u2047 While we're excited about the progress we're making in our product and in the value we're delivering for our clients, we believe we can improve both our volume and net average charge result in the second half and have already taken the appropriate steps. \u2047 First, we made changes to optimize our marketing investment to drive greater new client demand. \u2047 And second, we have corrected an issue with a key online page that didn't allow clients to choose a different product, resulting in a loss of monetization. \u2047 Since we have remedied the issue we have seen a 4% improvement in net average charge in DIY. \u2047 We're confident that we've made the appropriate changes and believe that our second half will be stronger. \u2047 We expect to end the year growing DIY clients in line with the category. \u2047 Finally, in small business, starting with tax. \u2047 We've highlighted our expertise through new tools and a redesigned experience. \u2047 We're beginning to see traction from these new initiatives but believe it will take some time to increase awareness of our small business expertise. \u2047 With Wave, we continue to innovate to simplify the financial lives of small business owners. \u2047 During the quarter, Wave continued to make progress on its strategic roadmap in a number of areas. \u2047 We're seeing demand grow for Wave advisors, where clients can get personalized help from our in-house bookkeepers. \u2047 In payroll, we're adding full service capabilities in more states to automatically file clients state and federal payroll taxes. \u2047 And in payments, we've made key changes to streamline the client onboarding process to assist clients and getting the right product and to gather key information earlier in the process. \u2047 All of these improvements are fueling Wave's impressive performance which continued this quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of over 40%. \u2047 To summarize, we're on track to deliver our financial outlook for the year by digitally enabling our business, driving improved client trajectory in Assisted, innovating in Virtual, enhancing our award winning DIY product and expanding in small business. \u2047 We have clear visibility in the areas for improvement and are focused on executing in the second half to deliver stronger results by seasons end. \u2047 With that, I'll now hand the call over to Tony. \u2047 Before I get into the details of our results, as a reminder, we typically report a loss during the fiscal third quarter due to the seasonality of our tax business. \u2047 Therefore, third quarter results are not representative of our full year performance. \u2047 Starting with revenues, we saw a year-over-year growth of $51 million or 11% to $519 million. \u2047 This increase was primarily due to higher tax preparation fees due to volume growth in Assisted and DIY and the acquisition of just over 200 franchise offices this year which continues to be a good use of capital. \u2047 The volume growth also resulted in higher royalties as well as increased revenues related to our Tax Plus products. \u2047 In addition to increases in our tax business, Wave contributed $11 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of more than 40%. \u2047 Total operating expenses increased $65 million or 11% to $672 million. \u2047 The majority of this increase was anticipated as it was driven by Wave, increased compensation due to higher Assisted volumes, and planned investments related to our technology roadmap. \u2047 We also recorded $19 million of incremental marketing expense during the quarter that was entirely due to a pull forward of recognition from Q4 to Q3, and was not due to an increase in spend. \u2047 Because of this timing shift, we expect marketing expense to be lower in Q4. \u2047 I'll discuss our full year outlook including expectations for operating expenses later in the call. \u2047 Interest expense was $26 million, which reflects an increase from the prior year due to higher draws on our line of credit. \u2047 The changes in revenue and expenses resulted in an increase in pre-tax loss from continuing operations of $18 million. \u2047 GAAP loss per share increased $0.08 to $0.66. \u2047 As we shared last quarter, we are now reporting GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. \u2047 Adjusted loss per share increased $0.07 to $0.59 driven by the increase in pre-tax loss and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by an increased tax benefit. \u2047 As a reminder, while beneficial on a full year basis, the lower share count negatively impacts earnings per share in quarters in which we report a loss. \u2047 In discontinued operations there were no changes to accrued contingent liabilities related to Sand Canyon during the quarter. \u2047 Regarding capital, our priorities remain unchanged. \u2047 At the top of list is maintaining adequate liquidity for our operational needs to account for our seasonality. \u2047 We came into this year with a strong financial position after generating over $500 million of free cash flow in fiscal '19. \u2047 We then make strategic investments back in to the business that we believe deliver value to our clients, ultimately benefiting our shareholders. \u2047 Making prudent investments to drive sustainable growth remains a key element of our capital allocation. \u2047 Last, we will deploy excess capital through quarterly dividends and share repurchases. \u2047 We've increased our quarterly dividend each of the last four years, resulting in a 30% increase over that time. \u2047 Regarding share repurchases in the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $66 million at an average price of $23.35. \u2047 Year-to-date, we have repurchased a total of 10.1 million shares for $247 million at an average price of $24.36. \u2047 Going forward, we will continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase approach. \u2047 I'd now like to provide thoughts on our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. \u2047 Starting with the tax industry, we continue to expect overall return growth of around 1%, with Assisted volume flat to slightly up and DIY growing around 3%. \u2047 This is consistent with the trends we've seen over the last several years. \u2047 For H&R Block, as Jeff shared, we expect growth in DIY clients in line with the category, and an improvement in client trajectory in Assisted as we hold market share in that category. \u2047 Combined this would be the third consecutive year of overall client growth. \u2047 Regarding pricing, in Assisted we expect net average charge to remain consistent with last year, following a year in which we reset price. \u2047 In DIY, during the first half of the season, we saw a decrease in net average charge, due to the product issue that Jeff discussed. \u2047 We've remedied this and combined with anticipated growth in Online Assist, we expect mix to improve in the second half, resulting in net average charge similar to last year. \u2047 Consistent with the outlook we provided last quarter, we expect these client growth and net average charge expectations along with Wave to result in revenue growth of 1.5% to 3.5%. \u2047 For the full year, we expect to grow revenue faster than EBITDA resulting in a decline in EBITDA margin compared to fiscal '19. \u2047 This year, we realized approximately $15 million of unplanned one-time expenses -- one-time expense increases, due to legal cost and Refund Advance fees, which will also impact our margin. \u2047 Despite these expense increases, we continue to expect EBITDA margin to be within our previously provided range of 24% to 26%. \u2047 Given our year-to-date results, this full year outlook infers a significant increase in EBITDA in the fourth quarter. \u2047 This will be achieved through continued revenue growth as well as a reduction of certain expenses in the fourth quarter related to the timing of marketing expense recognition that I mentioned earlier and lower compensation related to accrued bonuses. \u2047 As we indicated last quarter, we expect the tax rate of 19% to 21% due to favorable settlements with tax authorities during the second quarter. \u2047 The rest of our financial outlook also remains unchanged with total depreciation and amortization of $165 million to $175 million, of which $70 million to $80 million will be amortization of intangibles related to acquisitions. \u2047 This amortization expense reflects both Wave and tax office acquisitions and is excluded from earnings per share for non-GAAP reporting. \u2047 We continue to expect interest expense of $90 million to $100 million and capital expenditures of $70 million to $80 million. \u2047 To conclude, I'm confident in our plans for the second half of the tax season, and we are on track to deliver our financial objectives for the fiscal year. \u2047 Their dedication to providing help and inspiring confidence in our clients and communities is what makes H&R Block the great company it is today. \u2047 Overall, I'm excited about the progress we're making toward our long-term goals and I'm confident we're taking the steps necessary to deliver on our objectives for the fiscal year. \u2047 I look forward to sharing more with you when we report our full-year result in June. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted loss per share $0.59.  \u2047
