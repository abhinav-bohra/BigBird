{"article": ["Before we begin, I'd like to mention we will be discussing future estimates and expectations during our call today. \u2047 On the call today, we have Scott Donnelly, Textron's chairman and CEO, and Frank Connor, our chief financial officer. \u2047 Revenues in the quarter were $3.3 billion, down from $3.7 billion in last year's fourth quarter. \u2047 During this year's fourth quarter, we reported income from continuing operations of $0.93 per share. \u2047 In the quarter, we recorded $5 million in pre-tax special charges related to our 2020 restructuring plan or $0.01 per share after tax. \u2047 Excluding these special charges, adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, was $0.94 per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $1.06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 Segment profit in the quarter was $310 million, down $14 million from the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions totaled $298 million in the quarter. \u2047 For the full year, revenues were $12.4 billion, up $731 million from last year. \u2047 Adjusted income from continuing operations was $3.30 per share compared to $2.07 per share in 2020. \u2047 Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $1.1 billion, up from $596 million in 2020. \u2047 Our business has closed out the year with another solid quarter. \u2047 At aviation, we continue to see favorable market conditions, including improved aircraft utilization, low preowned inventory levels and strong customer demand. \u2047 Order activity remained very strong with backlog growth of $655 million in the quarter and $2.5 billion for the full year, resulting in a $4.1 billion backlog at year-end. \u2047 As a result, we delivered aircraft on a more linear trend through the year, which improved manufacturing efficiency and cash flow generation. \u2047 Reflecting this improved operating environment and strong execution of our teams, aviation achieved a segment margin of 10.1% in the fourth quarter. \u2047 For the year, we delivered 167 jets, up from 132 last year and 125 commercial turboprops, up from 113 in 2020. \u2047 Also in the year, we saw sequentially higher aftermarket revenue on a quarterly basis driven by increased aircraft utilization. \u2047 Moving to defense, aviation was awarded a $143 million contract for eight AT-6 aircraft, ground support equipment, spare parts and training from the Royal Thai Air Force. \u2047 This contract establishes Thailand as the international launch customer for the U.S. Air Force's latest light attack aircraft. \u2047 On the new product front, the Beechcraft Denali completed its first plate in November, launching the start of the flight test program. \u2047 Total revenues were down slightly in the quarter, largely on lower military revenues as expected, reflecting the continued wind down of the H-1 production program, partially offset by higher commercial revenues. \u2047 In December, Bell completed the first assault improvement modifications of an Air Force CV-22 Osprey. \u2047 This effort is part of an ongoing process to upgrade the Air Force Osprey fleet. \u2047 On the commercial side of Bell, we delivered 156 helicopters in 2021, up from 140 in 2020. \u2047 We also saw solid commercial order activity for the year, reflecting broad-based demand. \u2047 Moving to Textron Systems. \u2047 We saw another strong quarter of execution that contributed to a full year margin of 14.8%, up 320 basis points from 2020. \u2047 During the quarter, we delivered the fourth Ship-to-Shore Connector to the U.S. Navy after its successful completion of acceptance trials. \u2047 On the Shadow program, systems was awarded an $82 million logistics support contract for 2022. \u2047 On our common unmanned surface vessel platform, we completed file testing related to the unmanned influenced sweep system program, setting up potential for a production contract award in the first quarter of 2022. \u2047 Revenues were lower in the quarter as we continue to experience supply chain challenges, including order disruptions in Kautex related to global auto OEM production schedules. \u2047 At Textron specialized vehicles, we continue to see a strong pricing environment and steady retail demand. \u2047 Despite the ongoing supply chain challenges, both businesses saw sequential revenue improvements in the quarter. \u2047 In summary, there were many items to highlight in 2021 across our segments. \u2047 In aviation, strong order activity and customer demand throughout the year drove $2.5 billion of backlog growth. \u2047 On the new product front, we continued our product refresh strategy with the introduction of the Citation M2 XLS and CJ4 Gen2 aircraft. \u2047 Sky Courier completed the flight test program with 2,100 hours of flight test activity, and we expect FAA certification in the first half of 2022. \u2047 At Bell, we continued our work on the FVL programs. \u2047 We submitted the proposal for the FLRAA program in September, and the U.S. Army is expected to award the FLRAA program contract in 2022. \u2047 On FARA, we've made significant progress on the 360 Invictus prototype build with 75% of the effort complete at year-end. \u2047 We opened the Bell Manufacturing Technology Center, an innovative proving ground to test and refine technologies and processes across Bell's core production capabilities. \u2047 Textron Systems, ATAC continued to grow its fleet of certified F1 aircraft in support of increased demand on U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corp tactical air programs. \u2047 We continued our innovation and development activities with the rollout of the Ripsaw M5 prototype vehicle for the U.S. Army and the Cottonmouth ARV for the Marine Corps. \u2047 At Textron specialized vehicles, we entered into a strategic collaboration with GM, which will assist our ground support equipment business and electrification of baggage tractors, cargo tractors and belt loaders for use in airports globally. \u2047 We also introduced the Liberty, the industry's first PTV to offer four forward-facing seats in a compact golf cart-sized platform powered by lithium-ion battery. \u2047 At Kautex in 2021, we were awarded eight contracts on new vehicle programs for our hybrid electric fuel systems. \u2047 Looking to 2022 at aviation, we are projecting growth driven by increased deliveries across all product lines and higher aftermarket volume. \u2047 At Bell 2022 represents the beginning of a transitional period as we expect lower revenues related to military production programs while awaiting a downselect and award on the FLRAA program. \u2047 At systems, we're expecting flat revenue with growth on ship-to-store and tactical air programs, offset by lower fee-for-service volume. \u2047 In industrial, we're expecting revenue growth and margin improvement. \u2047 Within Kautex, we expect increasing volumes from improving OEM auto production. \u2047 While specialized vehicles, we anticipate improving supply chain conditions and increasing volumes across our products. \u2047 Earlier in 2021, we launched our eAviation initiative to leverage the resources and expertise across our aviation businesses to develop new opportunities in aircraft-utilizing electric propulsion systems. \u2047 In 2022, we plan to expand these efforts and increase our investment in developing technologies to accelerate the shift to sustainable flight, including eVTOL and fixed-wing aircraft. \u2047 With this backdrop, we're projecting revenues of about $13.3 billion for Textron's 2022 financial guidance. \u2047 We're projecting earnings per share in the range of $3.80 to $4 per share. \u2047 Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions is expected to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. \u2047 Let's review how each of the segments contributed, starting with Textron aviation revenues at Textron aviation of $1.4 billion were down $201 million from a year ago, largely due to lower aircraft volume, partially offset by higher aftermarket volume. \u2047 Segment profit was $137 million in the fourth quarter, up $29 million from last year's fourth quarter, largely due to favorable pricing net of inflation of $21 million and improved manufacturing performance. \u2047 Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $4.1 billion. \u2047 Revenues were $858 million, down $13 million from last year, reflecting lower military revenues, partially offset by higher commercial revenues. \u2047 Segment profit was $88 million -- of $88 million was down $22 million, primarily due to lower military volume and mix. \u2047 Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $3.9 billion. \u2047 At Textron Systems, revenues were $313 million, down $44 million from last year's fourth quarter due to lower volume, which included the impact from the U.S. Army's withdrawal from Afghanistan on the segment's fee-for-service contracts. \u2047 Segment profit of $45 million was down $4 million from a year ago, largely due to the lower volume. \u2047 Backlog in the segment ended the quarter at $2.1 billion. \u2047 Industrial revenues were $781 million, down $85 million from last year, reflecting lower volume and mix of $133 million, largely in the fuel systems and functional components product line, reflecting order disruptions related to the global auto OEM supply chain shortages, partially offset by a favorable impact of $50 million for pricing largely in the specialized vehicles product line. \u2047 Segment profit of $38 million was down $17 million from the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to lower volume and mix, partially offset by favorable impact from performance. \u2047 Finance segment revenues were $11 million, and profit was $2 million. \u2047 Moving below segment profit, corporate expenses, and interest expense were each $29 million. \u2047 Our manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions was $298 million in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year. \u2047 In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares, returning $335 million in cash to shareholders. \u2047 For the full year, we repurchased approximately 13.5 million shares, returning $921 million of cash to shareholders. \u2047 Turning now to our 2022 outlook. \u2047 At Textron aviation, we're expecting revenues of about $5.5 billion, reflecting higher deliveries across all our product lines and increased aftermarket volume. \u2047 Segment margin is expected to be in the range of approximately 10% to 11%, reflecting higher volume, favorable pricing and increased operating leverage. \u2047 Looking to Bell, we expect revenues of about $3 billion, reflecting lower military volume, primarily related to lower H-1 production. \u2047 We're forecasting a margin in the range of about 10% to 11%, largely due to the lower military volumes and continuing high levels of R&D investment. \u2047 At systems, we're estimating revenues of about $1.3 billion with a margin in the range of about 13.5% to 14.5%. \u2047 At industrial, we're expecting segment revenues of about $3.5 billion on higher volumes at Kautex and specialized vehicles. \u2047 We're estimating industrial margins to be in the range of about 5.5% to 6.5%. \u2047 At finance, we're forecasting segment profit of about $15 million. \u2047 Moving to slide nine. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, we're expecting earnings per share to be in the range of $3.80 to $4 per share. \u2047 We're also expecting manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions to be about $700 million to $800 million, which includes an approximately $300 million impact from a change in the R&D tax law beginning in 2022. \u2047 Looking to slide 10. \u2047 We're projecting about $150 million of corporate expense, which includes $30 million of investment in eAviation. \u2047 We're also projecting about $120 million of interest expense and a full year effective tax rate of approximately 18%. \u2047 Looking to the other items and turning to slide 11. \u2047 We're estimating 2022 pension income to be about $120 million, up from $30 million last year. \u2047 Turning to slide 12. \u2047 R&D is expected to be about $585 million, down from $619 million last year. \u2047 We're estimating capex will be about $425 million, up from $375 million in 2021. \u2047 Our outlook assumes an average share count of about 219 million shares in 2022. \u2047 "],
