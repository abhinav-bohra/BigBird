{"article": ["On a per share basis, first quarter earnings were $1.93 compared to a loss per share of $1.06 last year and earnings per share of $1.52 for the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 This year's quarter includes pre-tax charges of $2 million related to the impairment of one of the company's minority investments, and $2 million primarily related to severance costs in connection with the reorganization of certain support functions. \u2047 Excluding these items, first quarter non-GAAP earnings were $1.96 per share, a significant reversal to the loss per share of $0.67 for the first quarter of last year and up 28.1% compared to earnings per share of $1.53 for the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 We're excited to have him on board. \u2047 Last quarter, I talked about entering our fiscal 2021 momentum. \u2047 That was certainly the case in our first quarter. \u2047 And the momentum gained strength as the quarter progressed, enabling us to deliver exceptional top line and bottom line results, even against the ongoing challenges of store closures in Europe and Canada and congestion at the U.S. ports, leading to abnormally lean inventory levels. \u2047 On a sequential basis, comps dramatically accelerated through the quarter, led by our stores. \u2047 A mid-teens decline in February due mainly to launch calendar shifts and tax refund delays gave way to strong triple-digit gains in March and April as we lapped the onset of the COVID pandemic last year and the disruption caused by the shutdown of our store fleet. \u2047 But our stores weren't the only highlight. \u2047 Our digital business also remained quite strong, up 43% on a comp basis and landing at a penetration rate of 25% of our total sales, which was higher than our expectations coming into the quarter. \u2047 Perhaps more impressively, even with the challenges I mentioned, our sales performance was not only strong relative to last year's unprecedented first quarter, but also versus Q1 2019, where we saw low single-digit growth versus a strong result that year. \u2047 Athleisure and fitness consumer trends continued to drive strong demand across genders and families of business. \u2047 Although our inventory levels were lower than we would have liked, the composition and quality of goods was fresh, and our consumers responded very well to our merchandise assortments. \u2047 This resulted in higher inventory productivity and significantly less promotional activity, enabling us to deliver healthier margins and a truly impressive bottom-line performance. \u2047 Finally, we believe U.S. government stimulus and tax refunds provided incremental positives in the quarter. \u2047 This stellar performance would not have been possible without all of the associates whose dedication to the success of our company and whose passion for creating incredible experiences for our customers drives our business every day. \u2047 I often say we have the best team in retail, and our performance in Q1 serves as a testament to the strength of our team. \u2047 As we expected, COVID-related restrictions pressured our business in Europe throughout Q1, as the EMEA fleet was opened only 39% of possible operating days in the quarter. \u2047 But omnichannel growth was positive, nonetheless. \u2047 And in pockets where lockdowns began to ease, such as the U.K., we saw pent-up demand drive growth at the store level as well, leaving us optimistic that the trend will continue as the region opens back up. \u2047 To that end, we continue to break exciting new ground in Europe, including today's opening of our first high-profile store in Barcelona. \u2047 The store features dedicated women's and kids' spaces, local artwork and curation and enhanced connectivity, including a digital interactive zone and BOPIS lockers. \u2047 Additionally, we refreshed several stores across EMEA during Q1, with upgrades to fixtures, layouts and light touch improvements as we anticipate the broader reopening of the economy in EMEA. \u2047 Looking ahead, we continue to have strong product tailwinds, led by the culture of basketball and footwear, comfort trends in apparel and new and exciting strategic brands in our portfolio, which Andy will talk to in more detail. \u2047 While we continue to manage against the remaining port delays and gradual reopening's in Europe and Canada, these are transient issues, and we remain optimistic about our prospects as we move through the year. \u2047 As it relates to the West Coast ports, there's some good news to share. \u2047 Inventory flow and receipt velocity did improve as delays began to ease through the first quarter, and we expect further improvement in Q2, which should reflect positively on our inventory levels. \u2047 In the meantime, we have been working with our vendor partners to utilize ultimate ports and expedited rail and truck services to accelerate the flow of goods. \u2047 Now let me provide an update on our strategic initiatives and technology milestones. \u2047 We continue to see enrollment increase with over 20 million members now enrolled in the countries where the program is active. \u2047 We also continue to refine the KPIs that will define success for FLX moving forward, including customer retention and satisfaction. \u2047 In addition to growing membership in 2021, we will also focus on expanding into additional countries, driving engagement and incremental spend by connecting in more relevant ways with our customers and integrating FLX deeper into the customer experience at Foot Locker, Inc., adding value to programs like BOPIS and Launch Reservation. \u2047 Now for some highlights on our key technology initiatives. \u2047 First, we continued to build on our new payments platform, adding Adyen, Giropay, and Clearpay to our selection of payment options in Europe. \u2047 Providing increased convenience and flexibility for our consumer remains an imperative for us, and these new options will complement the successful rollout of Apple Pay and Google Pay last quarter. \u2047 Second, as part of our digital commerce transformation, we deployed new websites in four additional European countries: the U.K., Netherlands, Germany and France, that build off the modernized platform we launched in North America last year. \u2047 The new sites are easier to personalize to local markets, less costly to maintain and better leverage data analytics. \u2047 Finally, we expanded the SKUs we offer on Eastbay as part of the Nike dropship program we announced in February, and we're working toward getting additional banners up on the program in the coming months. \u2047 Having the right product at the right time is fundamental to our business. \u2047 This program is one step toward providing more flexibility to meet customer demand. \u2047 Now I'd like to discuss an important update on our organizational evolution. \u2047 We've talked a lot about how the accelerated shift to digital throughout pandemic pushed us to more quickly adapt to our consumers' changing preferences and to create stronger connections with them. \u2047 It's also led us to proactively accelerate our initiatives to optimize our real estate portfolio in our best-performing banners and across the most valuable locations to competitively position our store fleet for the future. \u2047 The decision to shutter Runners Point in Europe during 2020 is an example of this ongoing effort, as was the decision in the U.S. to more closely align Champs Sports and Eastbay. \u2047 With that in mind, during the second quarter, we have made the strategic decision to wind down our Footaction banner over the next two years and focus our resources on our iconic concepts: Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports and Eastbay. \u2047 We are currently in the process of assessing the Footaction fleet to determine the best decision for each location. \u2047 First, as we've discussed on prior calls, the flexibility we have with respect to our portfolio management will allow us to take advantage of a number of lease expirations over the next two years. \u2047 Second, we plan to convert approximately one-third of the top-performing Footaction locations into new Foot Locker stores, establishing a bolder women's and kids presence as well as new Champs Sports and Kids Foot Locker stores. \u2047 We are excited about the opportunities to expand our women's and kids presence within our Foot Locker and Champs Sports banners. \u2047 But a decision like this is never easy. \u2047 Through their contributions, we've gained valuable learnings and consumer insights. \u2047 As we look ahead, we see this as an opportunity to strengthen our global portfolio of brands, increase our value to our shareholders and vendor partners and ultimately position Foot Locker, Inc. to better serve our consumers in a post-COVID marketplace. \u2047 As part of our broader brick-and-mortar strategy, we will also continue to flex our powerful and expansive real estate portfolio to our advantage to accelerate our pivot off-mall, while continuing to invest in our community and Power Store assets. \u2047 We also intend to grow the Champs Sports homefield concept, with extended assortment for men's, women's and kids that will expand to include lifestyle and performance categories. \u2047 It truly speaks to the power of this category and our consumers' appetite for cool, premium product. \u2047 For over a year now, we have been tested by the COVID pandemic and have prevailed as a leader in our industry. \u2047 Most importantly, COVID has taught us to innovate, to move faster and to go above and beyond for our consumers as we strive to inspire and empower youth culture. \u2047 Many parts of the world are still dealing with lockdowns due to emerging COVID variants and the uneven vaccine distribution. \u2047 We continue to feel that impact on our business in Europe and Canada, where roughly 230 stores are temporarily closed. \u2047 That said, there's a lot to be excited about right now in our business and industry. \u2047 Trends and momentum are strong. \u2047 Our strategic direction and focus have never been sharper. \u2047 Our financial position is in excellent shape and our bench of talent is deep. \u2047 I'm confident in our team's ability to take advantage of the many opportunities we see as the year progresses and the world continues to recover. \u2047 With that, let me pass it over to Andy. \u2047 I'm looking forward to the partnership ahead. \u2047 Throughout the quarter, we remain focused on our strategies to strengthen our competitive advantages, while reinforcing our existing relationships and bringing new consumers into our business. \u2047 We did that by building on three key areas of strength: Our product leadership and diversity; continuing to create a pipeline of new products, new brands, new categories and new ideas to excite our consumers; our omni experiences, utilizing our global scale and investments to enhance and further connect the digital and physical journey for our consumers; and our commitments to our communities, being of the community and in the community, and personalizing our relationships to make a meaningful impact on our consumers' lives. \u2047 All of that was evident in the first quarter as we delivered new products, new content and new experiences to delight our consumers. \u2047 In total, all our families of business were strong. \u2047 Our footwear business increased over 70%, while our apparel and accessory businesses were both up triple digits. \u2047 Both families of business also increased as compared to 2019. \u2047 The strength in footwear was broad-based with gains across all regions, led by North America and Asia Pacific. \u2047 Similarly, we saw strong double-digit increases across men's, women's and kids' footwear, with our women's business driving the largest gain. \u2047 By category, men's basketball continued to see healthy momentum, delivering a high double-digit increase led by the Jordan brand, key Nike icons and some compelling new initiatives by Puma and Reebok. \u2047 Additionally, we brought new consumers into the business with an increased focus on our seasonal category. \u2047 This helped to drive a triple-digit increase with gains in UGG, BIRKENSTOCK and new brand introductions, including Crocs. \u2047 Meanwhile, men's running increased strong double digits, led by the key franchises of Max Air, Adidas Nomad, Puma RS-X and strong momentum in our partnership with New Balance. \u2047 It was also a strong quarter for our apparel business, which was up triple digits compared to the first quarter of last year and up double digits versus the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Men's and kids led the way up triple digits, while women's increased strong double digits. \u2047 The casualization of society remained the catalyst for our business, and we saw all major categories increase, with shorts driving the largest gain with momentum across many brands, including our own. \u2047 And across all product areas, our customers continue to respond well to elevated storytelling, with our consumer concept offense delivering exciting exclusive programs. \u2047 These included, City to the World from Nike, and All Day I Dream About Sneakers with Adidas, which both feature unique versions of their respective iconic silhouettes. \u2047 We also partnered with We Need Leaders and New Balance to pay homage to the leaders of the street running movement, and we created some fun with our Sesame Street and Champion collaboration. \u2047 Looking ahead, there's a lot coming to market to keep our consumers engaged. \u2047 The culture of basketball remains strong with new launches from Adidas, Puma and New Balance bringing further dimension to the category. \u2047 We are continuing our seasonal expansion with UGG, Crocs, Converse and Vans, and we have a very strong pipeline of ideas and inventory in apparel to maximize the ongoing momentum in the category. \u2047 And we will continue to enhance our storytelling in Q2 through our celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Griffey 1 with our Nike concept and our second installment of All Day I Dream About Sneakers with Adidas. \u2047 We also have exciting collaborations in the pipeline with the likes of Kids of Immigrants and Vans, Louis de Guzman and New Balance, and Puma and White Castle, to name a few. \u2047 Beyond product, I also remain enthusiastic about our community initiatives and how we continue to lead with purpose and extend our community stores across the globe and expand our local geo teams to ensure that we are more deeply rooted in the neighborhoods we serve. \u2047 That includes local experiences, local products and local give back. \u2047 And we continue to bring this to life with the openings of Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker in Old Spanish Trail in Houston and Champs Sports in the Oakbrook Mall in Chicago. \u2047 We also continue to fuel the future of our industry for the next generation of creators through our greenhouse incubator and our homegrown and lead initiatives. \u2047 On the latter, in addition to our work to advance education and economic opportunities for the black communities we serve, we have also established partnerships with 45 new black-owned brands and creators to provide a platform to showcase their design collaborations this year. \u2047 Next to that, we also continue to invest in growing our membership and enhancing our consumer journey through the geographic rollout of FLX and adding millions of new members to our business in Q1, expanding our dropship initiative, elevating our mobile app experience, enhancing our buy online and pickup in-store journey, providing new payment options and much more, all to better serve our consumer. \u2047 So a lot of work against our key strategic initiatives as we continue to push our consumer offense forward. \u2047 It's a combination of product leadership and diversity, our enhanced omni capabilities and our focus"], "gold_summary": ["foot locker q1 non-gaap earnings per share $1.96.  \u2047  q1 non-gaap earnings per share $1.96.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $1.93.  \u2047  q1 same store sales rose 80.3
