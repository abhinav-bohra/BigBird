{"article": ["We're grateful for the healthcare workers and the many others on the front lines providing supplies and services as we collectively weather this pandemic. \u2047 Today I'll start with COVID-19 impacts in Hawaii plans for reopening our economy and how our companies are positioned. \u2047 Hawaii is facing an unprecedented challenge from COVID-19 and we're especially mindful of the essential roles our companies play. \u2047 Through our utility we provide reliable electricity to keep our hospitals homes and essential businesses running. \u2047 And through our bank we help ensure money keeps flowing through our economy. \u2047 Continuing to provide these vital services while protecting the health of our customers as well as our employees has been a core focus. \u2047 In Hawaii we talk about our special culture of Aloha and of Kuleana our responsibility to others. \u2047 It's a culture that we've described previously in terms of our community coming together to take care of each other and of the land and environment. \u2047 And it's a culture that has served us well in managing the public health impacts of COVID-19. \u2047 Our government's early actions to impose statewide stay at home work from home orders and mandatory 14-day quarantines for all incoming travelers both visitors and residents alike and a whole of community response have succeeded in flattening the curve in Hawaii. \u2047 As of May 4 we have had sadly 17 deaths and a total case load of 621 but also 16 days where new cases were in the single digits. \u2047 On our most populous island of Oahu where population density is comparable to cities like San Jose California. \u2047 We've even had multiple days of no new cases. \u2047 These numbers are encouraging and have enabled us to start reopening our economy. \u2047 While this is a difficult time we believe we will get through this crisis. \u2047 Although Hawaii's tourism industry has been significantly impacted by the stay at home orders and the travel quarantine the beauty of our state and the Aloha of Hawaii's people will not change. \u2047 Post 9/11 and post the Great Recession tourism came back strongly. \u2047 It was clear that people still wanted to travel but they wanted to travel to a safe destination. \u2047 In this crisis we have the opportunity to rebrand Hawaii as the safest place on Earth. \u2047 We believe that we can demonstrate that our state will be a welcoming and safe place for visitors and that Hawaii will continue to be a very attractive place for tourism. \u2047 Hawaii will also remain continue to remain of strategic importance for the military and federal state and local government will continue to play a major role here. \u2047 Our housing market has also proven resilient. \u2047 It was relatively stable during and after the Great Recession and continues to be characterized by robust demand for a limited supply. \u2047 The public and private sectors here are collaborating to responsibly reopen our economy for both residents and visitors and also to shape what we want our economy to look like in the future. \u2047 Our company's leaders are deeply involved in these efforts. \u2047 In addition Alan Oshima former CEO of Hawaiian Electric who stepped down just a couple of months ago was appointed by our Governor Ige to coordinate and navigate our state's economic and community recovery in a collaborative fashion. \u2047 The overarching plan has three phases: Phase one stabilization of the number of COVID cases; Phase two a gradual reopening and recovery of our economy; and Phase theree making our economy even more resilient with strong business and job growth. \u2047 Parks and golf courses have reopened elective surgeries have resumed and low contact businesses such as car dealerships and automated service providers were allowed to reopen May 1. \u2047 We anticipate economic activity will increase over the coming weeks and months with meaningful activity resuming mid-to-late summer and significant recovery by year-end. \u2047 Yesterday our University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization updated their forecast for Hawaii's economic recovery. \u2047 And they believe that local economic activity will return by 35% to 45% in May and June and 75% by year-end. \u2047 Tourism will take longer likely beginning to return late July with arrivals by year-end reaching half of their normal levels. \u2047 This reopening gives our state a unique opportunity to consider the future of our economy and there too we're looking at doing it responsibly and ensuring that the choices and investments we make move us toward a more sustainable economy. \u2047 We're thinking about the right level of tourism that ensures a good experience for visitors and is sustainable for our environment our lands our economy and our communities. \u2047 As a company we're working to support and advance our state's recovery. \u2047 At our bank we're focused on building the innovation economy to diversify and expand job opportunities. \u2047 At our utility we continue to partner with stakeholders to progress clean energy projects and identify opportunities to rebuild with Hawaii's green economy goals in mind. \u2047 And we remain committed to our state's 100% renewable portfolio standard and carbon neutrality goals. \u2047 Protecting the health and safety of our employees helping our customers and supporting our community through this time have been core goals for our companies. \u2047 To protect employees and customers we implemented a mandatory work from home policy for employees who are able and we instituted the use of discrete work teams to increase physical distancing for those employees who must be on the job such as our linemen and power plant operators. \u2047 We also scaled back our open bank branches and implemented extensive cleaning and physical distancing precautions for those that remain open. \u2047 The bank has seen strong increases in online account enrollments and mobile usage which is encouraging and should help keep reducing costs for routine transactions over time. \u2047 As the state and county stay-at-home orders get phased out over time we will likely phase back into full operations albeit with new practices to maintain health and safety. \u2047 We've been pleased that our liquidity and balance sheet strength of our utility bank and consolidated enterprise have enabled us to support our customers in this uncertain time. \u2047 Our utilities has suspended disconnections for nonpayment through the end of June and urged customers experiencing hardship to reach out so we can help with payment arrangements. \u2047 We also remain very focused on affordability of customer bills. \u2047 We are mindful of the need to operate even more efficiently given the economy and how it may impact pending rate requests. \u2047 One bright spot has been fuel costs which are largely a pass-through item for our customers. \u2047 Our customers are seeing some benefits of lower fuel prices just when they need it most. \u2047 For example on Oahu in May lower fuel costs would reduce a 500-kilowatt hour per month bill by more than $12 compared to March. \u2047 We expect lower fuel prices to continue to benefit customers for the next few months. \u2047 But longer term we remain concerned about the volatility of oil and its impact on customers. \u2047 So we're still focused on moving off oil as rapidly as possible. \u2047 At our bank we made a huge push with teammates working round-the-clock shifts to secure loans under the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP to help small businesses pay employees and other essential bills like utilities. \u2047 We're proud that Americans secured over $370 million for approximately 3600 small businesses employing roughly 40000 individuals. \u2047 And that Hawaii banks in total obtained funding for 78% of our states eligible payrolls in the first round placing Hawaii in the top five states in the nation. \u2047 American is also helping customers by providing loan deferral and forbearance options and waiving a number of fees. \u2047 Like Hawaii as a company our fundamentals remain strong and that serves us well to weather the challenges of COVID-19. \u2047 On a consolidated basis we're comprised of stable operating companies in essential industries. \u2047 Our utility has delivered power for our state for over 125 years through many different economic and social conditions. \u2047 During this COVID period we do expect higher bad debt expense and lower kilowatt hour sales. \u2047 And indeed in the last week of March we saw lower loads 7% lower on Oahu and Hawaii Island and 14% lower on Maui. \u2047 Given the utilities fully decoupled regulatory structure the primary financial effect relates to liquidity. \u2047 Although decoupling enables the recovery of target revenues approved by the PUC despite lower loads cash collections under that mechanism would be delayed until 2021 under the revenue balancing account. \u2047 We've taken steps to meaningfully strengthen the utility's liquidity position including through an expanded revolver and a private placement which priced last week and which included our first green bond offering. \u2047 The lower loads also impact our renewable portfolio standard or RPS performance albeit in a positive fashion since the lower kilowatt hour sales reduces the denominator in the RPS calculation and we expect to comfortably exceed our 2020 RPS goal of 30%. \u2047 Our utility and regulators continue to move regulatory processes forward with minimal disruption. \u2047 The performance-based regulation or PBR docket remains on track for final decision by year-end with workshops proceeding remotely. \u2047 Our Hawaiian Electric 2020 rate case is also moving forward although the schedule for an interim decision and order is now October rather than July. \u2047 As part of that rate case the PUC implemented a management audit. \u2047 That's been a constructive process and the audit report is still expected in May. \u2047 On April 29 the PUC published an order terminating the mandatory triennial rate case cycle. \u2047 As such we are no longer required to file a Maui Electric rate case and we're evaluating our options there. \u2047 Our bank has served our state for 95 years and has a conservative risk culture lending practices and loan portfolio. \u2047 These attributes helped ASB perform well compared to other banks during the 2008 2009 financial crisis and position it well for the challenge at hand. \u2047 While net interest income will decline due to lower rates across the curve and credit losses will rise due to the economic slowdown the bank remains a good contributor to HEI. \u2047 ASB independently maintains strong liquidity and capital and regularly conducts stress testing implemented after the banking crisis of the Great Recession including under scenarios more severe than what is anticipated from COVID-19. \u2047 Our bank also has limited exposure to industries such as accommodations food services and retail with a commercial and industrial loan portfolio that is highly focused and secured by real estate. \u2047 At this point we do not see a scenario that would require HEI to inject capital into the bank. \u2047 However to maintain its target leverage ratio while supporting increased lending under the Paycheck Protection Program the bank will retain capital it otherwise would have paid in dividends to the holding company. \u2047 At the holding company we have enhanced our liquidity to ensure that we can be a source of strength to our subsidiaries in the unlikely event that it is needed while maintaining our investment-grade capital structure and our shareholder dividend. \u2047 We have paid uninterrupted dividends since [1901 including during the Great Recession and maintaining the stability of our dividend is no less important today. \u2047 We have a strong leadership team with the experience and judgment to guide our companies through this period. \u2047 I was CEO of HEI through 9/11 and the Great Recession. \u2047 Rich led a publicly traded Korean bank through that crisis. \u2047 Our bank CFO led a recapitalization of another bank here in Hawaii and our utility and executive teams have decades of experience and are well versed in incident and crisis management. \u2047 Our Board members with whom we've been very actively engaged in this period include former utility and bank executives who steered their companies through the financial crisis as CEOs CFOs and Chief Risk Officers. \u2047 Despite our company's strengths and the essential services we provide we do expect impacts from COVID-19. \u2047 We saw the beginnings of those in the first quarter including higher bad debt expense at our utility and higher allowance for credit losses at our bank. \u2047 With the exception of bad debt COVID-19 related costs were not significant for the first quarter but may increase in the next few quarters. \u2047 As a result the utility has filed a request for deferral treatment of COVID-19 related costs and plans to seek recovery of those costs at a later time. \u2047 The first quarter was impacted by items other than COVID-19 in particular higher-than-planned utility O&M expense. \u2047 Utility O&M expense management has been an area of focus for us. \u2047 And while we have a number of efforts under way we do have more work to do. \u2047 I'll now ask Greg to discuss our first quarter results our liquidity and our guidance. \u2047 I'll speak briefly on our Q1 results before moving to our outlook. \u2047 On slide nine our Q1 earnings were $0.31 per share compared to $0.42 per share in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 COVID-19 expense impacted earnings at both the utility and the bank including $2.5 million higher utility bad debt expense pre-tax than Q1 of last year and additional provisioning for COVID-19 of over $4 million at the bank. \u2047 Bad debt expense at the utility also impacted utility ROE. \u2047 And we expect that bad debt expense will continue to impact our income statement until deferral treatment is granted for future recovery. \u2047 Although we did have negative impacts from COVID-19 during the quarter we also had a very strong start to the year prior to the pandemic. \u2047 Loads were strong and showed increases over the prior year of nearly 5%. \u2047 We started the year with one of the nation's lowest unemployment rates and the strength of the pre-COVID Hawaii economy makes us optimistic about our future once we're through the crisis. \u2047 On slide 10 utility earnings were $23.9 million compared to $32.1 million in the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 The most significant drivers of the variance were: $3 million revenue increase from higher rate adjustment mechanism revenues $1 million revenue increase from the recovery of West Loch and Grid Modernization projects under the major project interim recovery mechanism; and $1 million lower interest expense due to debt refinancings at lower rates. \u2047 These items were offset by $7 million higher O&M expenses compared to Q1 2019 primarily due to increased bad debt expense due to COVID-19 the absence of onetime of a onetime benefit in Q1 2019 due to deferral treatment for certain previously incurred expenses and an increase in vegetation management work and higher outside service costs. \u2047 In addition we had approximately $1 million higher depreciation expense $1 million lower net income from the absence of renewable procurement performance incentive mechanism. \u2047 And we received that we received in 1Q 2019 $1 million from the absence of mutual assistant work reimbursement from the first quarter of 2019 and $1 million lower AFUDC as there were fewer long duration projects in construction work in progress particularly after the West Loch was placed in service in November. \u2047 Turning to the bank. \u2047 American's net income was $15.8 million in the quarter down from $28.2 million in the previous quarter. \u2047 Although as a reminder 4Q the fourth quarter of 2019 included $7.7 million of net income from the sales of the former of former properties. \u2047 Net income was also down by $5 million versus the first quarter of 2019 mostly due to the provision taken due to COVID-19. \u2047 Following our adoption of CECL and the additional provision in the first quarter relating to COVID we believe we are"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share of $0.31.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $0.31.  \u2047  board maintains quarterly dividend."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $0.31.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $0.31.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $0.31."]}
