{"article": ["On Slide 2 is the safe harbor statement. \u2047 These statements are based on our beliefs and assumptions, current expectations, estimates, and forecasts. \u2047 The company's future results are influenced by many factors beyond the control of the company. \u2047 During today's call, management will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures, including organic sales growth, adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin, and adjusted diluted EPS. \u2047 Before we dive into our Q3 results and raised 2020 guidance, I like to make clear the importance of our mission at West and the values that formed the pillars in which we operate. \u2047 In today's uncertain environment and what seems like a new set of challenges each day, we remain focused on two key priorities: keeping our team members safe and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we currently serve. \u2047 Moving to Slide 5, West is uniquely positioned to satisfy increasing market demand by leveraging our global operation of scale and our resources. \u2047 Our team recognized at the outset of the pandemic that need to increase production capacity. \u2047 We were already supporting the growth trajectory of our base business and the future demand for our products required for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics meant that we needed to act quickly and very decisively. \u2047 To address the increase in demand, we brought forward planned capital investments and production capacity. \u2047 So, earlier this month we installed new manufacturing equipment at one of our HVP sites to prepare for the future demand of FluroTec and NovaPure. \u2047 As of this week, that capacity is operational and we have additional equipment being installed at a second HVP site with more installations planned in the coming months at other global sites. \u2047 The strength of our performance this past quarter demonstrates the forward momentum we have built over time with our market led strategy and also One West team approach to satisfy market demand. \u2047 And now turning to Slide 6, the disruption caused by the pandemic has impacted the way all of us conduct business in our daily lives. \u2047 West is no exception. \u2047 Customers can come to West for a scientific and technical expertise, and this differentiates us in the market. \u2047 We have been investing in digital technology and automation with two objectives in mind, bringing new connected products to market, as well as enhancing the productivity of our operations at every level of the organization. \u2047 While we're early in our digital journey, I would like to share a few examples of the recent success, starting with our manufacturing automation strategy. \u2047 We made great strides over the past year and helping us to achieve continuous improvements and quality, safety, service and cost. \u2047 Petersburg, Florida site has developed an automation process for robotically loading and unloading molding presses. \u2047 This has considerably reduced idle production time associated with product changeovers and improved operating efficiency. \u2047 Our Kinston site has automated molding, trimming, rinsing processes, which will drive higher quality and final product and greater efficiency gains. \u2047 And I'm especially pleased with the team's agility in bringing forward the production capacity expansion, I mentioned earlier. \u2047 A great deal of planning and engineering went into this initiative to help us meet our customers' requirements. \u2047 On the digital front, we have just introduced the West virtual, the future of customer interactions with a truly immersive, fully interactive online experience. \u2047 We expect this tool to be a primary customer interface, even beyond the current pandemic. \u2047 So, turning now to Slide 7 and our performance in the third quarter, our financial results remain strong. \u2047 I'm pleased to say that the growth trends we have experienced over the past several quarters continued in the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter remains positive. \u2047 And we've had over 18% organic sales growth in the third quarter, driven again by robust high value product sales, as well as sales in contract manufacturing. \u2047 And we experienced solid growth in operating profit margin expansion. \u2047 This resulted in a strong adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow for the third quarter. \u2047 Similar to the second quarter, our base business had solid organic sales growth in the third quarter. \u2047 We also had incremental sales associated with many COVID-19 development projects we are supporting for both therapeutics and vaccines. \u2047 Specifically for vaccines, toward really the back end of the quarter, we were asked by our customers to accelerate initial deliveries of components is more than offset continued sales decline of products associated with injectable drugs and treatments such as dental and elective surgeries that have been impacted negatively by the pandemic. \u2047 As for guidance for the remainder of the year, we are confident that we're well positioned with the strength and resiliency of our core underlying business and the incremental opportunities being presented to support our customers with pandemic solutions. \u2047 Therefore, we're raising our sales and earnings per share guidance for the remainder of this year. \u2047 Let's review the numbers in more detail. \u2047 We'll first look at Q3 2020 revenues and profits, where we saw strong sales and earnings per share growth, led by strong revenue performance primarily in our biologics and generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. \u2047 I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. \u2047 Finally, we'll review our updated 2020 guidance. \u2047 Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16 to 20. \u2047 We recorded net sales of $548 million, representing organic sales growth of 18.2%. \u2047 COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $32 million in the quarter. \u2047 These net revenues include the assessment of our components associated with treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. \u2047 Excluding net COVID impact, organic sales grew by approximately 11%. \u2047 Looking at Slide 9. \u2047 Proprietary product sales grew organically by 20.3% in the quarter. \u2047 High-Value Products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter, grew double-digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q3. \u2047 Looking at the performance of the market units, Biologics market units that were -- have delivered strong double-digit growth. \u2047 We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. \u2047 The generics market unit experienced high single-digit growth led by sales of Teflon stoppers and FluroTec components. \u2047 Our Pharma market unit saw mid single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products and services, including Westar and FluroTec components. \u2047 And Contract Manufacturing had double-digit organic sales growth for the third quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and healthcare-related injection devices. \u2047 We continue to see improvement in gross profit. \u2047 We recorded $194.6 million gross profit, $46.8 million or 31.7% above Q3 of last year. \u2047 And our gross profit margin of 35.5% was a 310 basis point expansion from the same period last year. \u2047 We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit, with $103.9 million recorded this quarter, compared to $70.1 million in the same period last year for a 48.2% increase. \u2047 Our adjusted operating profit margin of 19% was a 360 basis point increase from the same period last year. \u2047 Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 46% for Q3. \u2047 Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.02 in Q3, earnings per share grew by some 53%. \u2047 Let's review the gross drivers in both revenue and profits. \u2047 On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. \u2047 Volume and mix contributed $77.1 million or 16.9 percentage points of growth, including approximately $32 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. \u2047 Sales price increases contributed $6.1 million or 1.3 percentage points of growth, and changes in the foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $8.7 million or a reduction of 1.9 percentage points. \u2047 Looking at margin performance. \u2047 Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 35.5% for Q3 2020, up from 32.4% in Q3 2019. \u2047 Proprietary products third-quarter gross profit margin of 40.8% was 260 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Our key drivers of the continued improvement in proprietary products gross profit margin were: favorable mix of products sold, driven by high-value products; production efficiencies; and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. \u2047 Contract Manufacturing third-quarter gross profit margin of 17.9% was 350 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 This is a result of improved efficiencies and the plan utilization. \u2047 Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. \u2047 On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. \u2047 Operating cash flow was $323.8 million for the year-to-date 2020, an increase of $63 million, compared to the same period last year, a 24.2% increase. \u2047 Our year-to-date capital spending was also $116.7 million, $27.9 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. \u2047 Working capital of $790.6 million at September 30, 2020 was $73.5 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in Accounts Receivable due to increased sales activity and inventory, mainly as a result of increasing safety stock. \u2047 Our cash balance at September 30 of the $519.4 million was $80.3 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. \u2047 Our capital and financial resources, including overall liquidity, remain strong. \u2047 Turning to guidance, slide 13 provides a high-level summary. \u2047 Full year 2020 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.1 billion and $2.11 billion. \u2047 This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of also approximately $85 million. \u2047 There is an estimated headwind of $4 million based on current foreign exchange rates. \u2047 We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 14% to 15%. \u2047 This compares to prior guidance of $2.035 billion to $2.055 billion and growth of approximately 12%. \u2047 We expect our full year 2020 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to be in a range of $4.50 to $4.55, compared to prior guidance of $4.15 to $4.25. \u2047 As Eric discussed, we are expanding our HVP manufacturing capacity at the existing sites to meet anticipated 2021 COVID-19 vaccine demand. \u2047 Capex guidance remains at $170 million to $180 million. \u2047 There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review this revised guidance. \u2047 Estimated FX headwinds on earnings per share has had an impact of approximately $0.02 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. \u2047 The revised guidance also includes $0.18 earnings per share impact from tax benefits from stock-based compensation. \u2047 So just to summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top-line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and growth in operating and free cash flow. \u2047 Our sales and earnings per share projections for 2020 and performance are in line with our long-term construct or approximately 6% to 8% organic sales growth and earnings per share expansion. \u2047 Before I close, I'm pleased to share that last evening we received FDA clearance for West to market our 20 millimeter Vial2Bag advanced product. \u2047 The team is excited to bring this innovative product to the healthcare professionals. \u2047 To conclude, there are many challenges ahead of this, but we're resolute in our mission focus systems and most importantly, the team to address these challenges. \u2047 We see strengths in our core business and we're confident in our long-term growth strategy. \u2047 Our market led strategies delivering unique value propositions to our customers. \u2047 Our global operations network is able to flex and respond to the demand, while driving our market leading service and quality. \u2047 And our investments in digital technology and automation will continue to keep us on the forefront of the industry. \u2047 We remain focused on delivering value to all our stakeholders on a very sustainable basis and doing our part to support the healthcare industry as it works to resolve this global pandemic. \u2047 On behalf of the team members at West, we continue to wish you well in the days ahead. \u2047 Gila, we're now ready to take questions. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["sees fy 2020 adjusted earnings per share $4.50 to $4.55.  \u2047
