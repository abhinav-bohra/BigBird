{"article": ["We will conclude the call with a question-and-answer session. \u2047 Today, we will discuss non-GAAP basis information. \u2047 Today, we reported our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results and issued our final guidance for 2021. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, our operating divisions continue to face challenges associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Over the course of the pandemic, we experienced a decline in overall occupancy levels at several of our federal facilities. \u2047 Due to the decline in the overall federal population, we have previously announced that the Federal Bureau of Prisons had decided not to renew three of our BOP contracts that are scheduled to expire during the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 More recently, the president issued an executive order directing the attorney general to not renew DOJ contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities. \u2047 While we continue to monitor the scope and implementation timeline for this order, we have assumed that it could result in additional nonrenewals of our BOP contracts in 2021 and coming years and we have incorporated this assumption into our guidance. \u2047 Marshals Service, which is also under the U.S. Department of Justice, does not own and operate its facilities. \u2047 The U.S. Marshals Service contracts for bed capacity which is generally located in areas near the federal courthouses to house pre-trial offenders who have been charged with federal crimes under the laws passed by Congress. \u2047 The U.S. Marshals Service contracts for these facilities primarily through -- contracts primarily for this fiscal is through Intergovernmental Service Agreements and to a lesser extent on direct contracts. \u2047 The U.S. Marshal Service may determine to conduct a review of the possible application of the executive order on its facilities. \u2047 Our GEO care segment has also been impacted by lower occupancy levels across our reentry centers, day reporting programs, and youth services facilities due to COVID-19. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we incurred a non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with our reentry centers, primarily due to the negative impact the pandemic had on this segment. \u2047 Despite these challenges, we believe our company remains resilient and is underpinned by long-term real estate assets and supported by contracts entailing essential government services. \u2047 We've provided these essential services to government agencies at the federal and state levels under both Democratic and Republican administrations and during times when either party has been in control of the legislative branch of the government. \u2047 Our frontline employees remain focused on providing high quality services inhumane care for all those entrusted to us. \u2047 During the past year, our employees have shown incredible commitment and resilience as our company has managed through unprecedented times and we are very proud of their dedication. \u2047 From the outset of the pandemic, we have implemented companywide steps to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 to all those in our care and our employees and we continue to evaluate these steps. \u2047 Ensuring the health and safety of all those in our facilities and our employees has always been our number one priority. \u2047 We also recognize that in addition to the challenges associated with COVID-19, heightened political rhetoric has led to a mischaracterization of our role as a government services provider and it's created concerns regarding our future access to financing. \u2047 Our board of directors and our management team are aware of the importance of allocating capital to pay down debt in the current environment. \u2047 Consistent with our previous guidance, we paid down approximately $100 million in net debt during 2020. \u2047 To continue our focus on paying down debt, our board recently reduced our quarterly dividend payment to $0.25 per share for the quarter. \u2047 Our board will continue to evaluate our dividend and capital allocation strategy including our plan capital expenditures with a goal of targeting a minimum of $75 million to $100 million in net debt repayment in 2021 and annually thereafter. \u2047 Additionally, we continue to evaluate cost savings opportunities at the corporate and facility levels, and we have identified several company-owned assets that could potentially be sold. \u2047 We remain committed to balance our continued creation of value for our shareholders with prudent management of our balance sheet. \u2047 Today, we reported fourth-quarter revenues of approximately $578 million and net income attributable to GEO of $0.09 per diluted share. \u2047 Our fourth-quarter results reflect a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $21 million. \u2047 This goodwill impairment charges associated with our community-based reentry centers which have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Our fourth-quarter results also reflect a $5.7 million pre-tax loss on real estate assets at $2.3 million pre-tax gain on the extinguishment of debt and $2.5 million in pre-tax COVID-19 related expenses. \u2047 Excluding these items, we reported fourth-quarter adjusted net income of $0.33 per diluted share. \u2047 We also reported fourth-quarter AFFO of $0.62 per diluted share. \u2047 Moving to our outlook, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact on several segments of our company. \u2047 The pandemic has resulted in lower occupancy levels at several of our facilities and programs beginning last March and continuing through the end of 2020. \u2047 As we have previously disclosed, the Federal Bureau of Prisons has decided that it will not renew our contracts for the D. Ray James, Georgia; Rivers, North Carolina; and Moshannon Valley, Pennsylvania facilities due to the decline in the federal prison populations more recently as a result of the COVID pandemic. \u2047 The D. Ray James facility contract expired on January 31st and the two other contracts are set to expire on March 31st, and our garden -- our guidance for 2021 accounts for these expirations. \u2047 Additionally, the administration has issued an executive order directing the U.S. attorney general to not renew DOJ contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities. \u2047 While we continue to monitor the scope and implementation timeline of this order, our guidance presently accounts for the potential non-renewal of three additional BOP contracts that have option periods expiring in 2021. \u2047 The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in lower occupancy levels across our other federal reentry and youth facilities. \u2047 Our 20 21 guidance assumes the continued impact of COVID-19 in the first part of the year with a slow recovery to more normalized operations by the -- by year end. \u2047 Marshals facility in Eagle Pass Texas which began last year. \u2047 We expect to achieve normalized operations at these four facilities over the course of 2021. \u2047 Taking all these factors into account, we expect full-year 2021 net income attributable to GEO to be in a range of $0.88 to $0.98 per diluted share on total revenues of approximately $2.24 billion to $2.27 billion. \u2047 We expect full-year 2021 AFFO to be in a range of $1.98 to $2.08 per diluted share, and we expect full-year 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $386 million to $400 million. \u2047 For the first quarter 2021, we expect net income attributable to GEO to be in a range of $0.18 to $0.20 per diluted share, our quarterly revenues of $579 million to $584 million. \u2047 And we expect first-quarter 2021 AFFO to be between $0.48 and $0.50 per diluted share. \u2047 Moving to our capital structure. \u2047 At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $284 million in cash on hand and approximately $136 million in borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. \u2047 In addition to an accordion feature of $450 million under our credit facility. \u2047 With respect to our capital expenditures, we expect total capex in 2021 to be approximately $104 million including $26 million for maintenance capex and $77 million in gross capex. \u2047 Our estimated growth capex for the year includes $32 million to upgrade our BI electronic monitoring devices to the new 5G cellular network and $45 million for facility capex. \u2047 To continue our focus on paying down debt, our board reduced our quarterly dividend payment to $0.25 per share last month. \u2047 In 2020, we paid down approximately one $100 million in net debt consistent with our prior guidance. \u2047 Our board will continue to evaluate our dividend and capital allocation strategy including our planned capital expenditures with a goal of targeting a minimum of $75 million to $100 million in net debt repayment in 2021 and annually thereafter. \u2047 Additionally, we continue to dialogue with our lenders and creditors and our monitoring credit market conditions. \u2047 We are also continuing to evaluate potential cost savings opportunities as well as the potential sale of a number of company-owned assets. \u2047 During the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of our interest in the Talbot Hall reentry facility with net proceeds of approximately $13 million. \u2047 I'd like to provide you a brief update on the 2020 operational highlights for our GEO secure services business unit. \u2047 Over the last 12 months, our operational efforts have been focused on implementing mitigation strategies to address the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 From the start of the pandemic, we began taking steps at our facilities to implement best practices consistent with the COVID-19 guidance that was issued for correctional and detention facilities by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u2047 These practices included the implementation of quarantine, cohorting, and medical isolation procedures. \u2047 We also have provided educational guidance to our employees and the individuals in our care and the best preventative measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \u2047 We have continuously exercised paid leave and paid time off policies to allow our employees to remain at home if they exhibit flu-like symptoms or to care for family members. \u2047 We remain focused on implementing increased sanitation measures and deploying personal protective equipment including face masks for all employees and all those in our care. \u2047 We have also taken steps to increase testing at our facilities including the deployment of Abbot rapid test devices. \u2047 We've administered over 51,000 COVID tests in our facilities at the close of 2020. \u2047 We continuously evaluate these steps and we'll make adjustments based on updated guidance by the CDC and other best practices. \u2047 Despite the unprecedented challenges associated with the pandemic, our frontline employees have remained focused on providing high-quality services and delivering humane and compassionate care for all those in our facilities. \u2047 During 2020, our employees and facilities achieved several important milestones. \u2047 Our facility successfully underwent 100 audits including internal audits, government reviews, third-party accreditation, and certification under the Prison Rape Elimination Act. \u2047 Our medical services staff undertook over 350,000 quality healthcare related encounters including intake health screenings, sick calls, and offsite medical visits. \u2047 During the year, we achieved over 42000 employee training completions in our GTI transportation division safely completed over 14 million miles driven. \u2047 We are incredibly proud of our employees for their dedication and daily commitment to operational excellence. \u2047 Last month, the president issued an executive order directing the attorney general to not renew DOJ contracts with privately operated criminal detention facilities. \u2047 While we continue to monitor the order scope and implementation timeline as we have noted in our recent announcements, the Bureau of Prisons has experienced a decline in federal populations more recently due to COVID-19. \u2047 As a result, the BOP has previously announced that it would not renew or rebid three of our existing contracts with the agency. \u2047 That contract at our D. Ray James, Georgia facility ended on January 31st. \u2047 And our contracts at our Rivers, North Carolina, and Moshannon Valley, Pennsylvania facilities expire on March 31st. \u2047 We have three additional company-owned facilities contracted with BOP that have current option periods expiring in 2021. \u2047 Our Great Plains, Oklahoma facility at the end of May, and our Big Spring and Flightline facilities in Texas at the end of November. \u2047 Given the president's executive order and the decline in federal prison populations, we are preparing operationally for the potential that additional contracts with the Bureau of Prisons may not be renewed with their current option periods expire. \u2047 The BOP owns and operates approximately 90% of the beds housing federal inmates. \u2047 And since the late 1990s, the agency has used contractor-operated facilities as the swing capacity it needed to deal with overcrowding conditions in the federal prison system. \u2047 Contractor-operated facilities have historically been used by the Bureau of Prisons to house almost entirely non-U.S. citizen criminal aliens serving sentences for federal crimes committed in the United States. \u2047 Marshals Service which is also under U.S. Department of Justice does not own and operate its facilities. \u2047 The U.S. Marshal service contracts for bed capacity which is generally located in areas near federal courthouses to house pre-trial offenders who have been charged with federal crimes under laws passed by Congress. \u2047 The U.S. Marshal service contracts for these facilities primarily through Intergovernmental Service Agreements and to a lesser extent direct contracts. \u2047 The U.S. Marshal service may determine to conduct a review of the possible application of the executive order in its facilities. \u2047 The administration has also taken several executive actions related to immigration. \u2047 However, at this time, there have been no directives related specifically to enforcement or detention policies. \u2047 Earlier this month the president signed an executive order establishing an inter-agency task force on the reunification of families to identify migrant minors separated from their families. \u2047 As we have publicly stated in the past, we do not manage any facilities that house unaccompanied migrant minors. \u2047 Our ICE processing centers are highly rated by National Accreditation Organizations and provide high-quality culturally responsive services in a safe and humane environment. \u2047 Typical amenities at our centers include flat-screen TVs in the housing areas, multi-purpose rooms, outdoor covered pavilions, and artificial turf soccer fields. \u2047 All those entrusted in our care are provided culturally sensitive meals approved by a registered dietitian, clothing, 24/7 access to healthcare services, and full access to telephone and legal services. \u2047 Health care staffing at our ICE processing centers is approximately double than that of our state correctional facilities which is needed to provide appropriate treatment for individuals who have numerous and diverse health and mental health needs. \u2047 We have provided high quality services for over 30 years under Democratic and Republican administrations, including eight years under President Obama's administration. \u2047 I'd like to briefly review the 2020 operational highlights for our GEO care business unit. \u2047 Consistent with the efforts undertaken by our GEO secure services facilities, we have been focused on implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies, all of our residential facilities and GEO reentry and GEO youth services issued guidance consistent with the guidance issued by the CDC. \u2047 We put in place quarantine and cohorting policies and procedures and provide educational and preventative guidance to our employees and all individuals in our care. \u2047 We have to focus our efforts on increased sanitation measures, testing, and deploying personal protective equipment including facemasks. \u2047 We have continuously exercises paid leave and paid time off policies to"],
