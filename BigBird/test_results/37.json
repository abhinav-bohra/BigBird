{"article": ["These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. \u2047 You should also note that we will be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures, unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. \u2047 Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. \u2047 For the first quarter, the largest difference between our GAAP and core results stemmed from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts. \u2047 With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be mark-to-market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. \u2047 For us, this increased GAAP earnings in Q1 by $308 million. \u2047 To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. \u2047 Our currency hedges provide us -- protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth and our future shareholder distributions. \u2047 Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using a constant currency rate aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. \u2047 We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. \u2047 We received $1.7 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago. \u2047 A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the investor relations section of our website at corning.com. \u2047 You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the interactive analyst segment. \u2047 We encourage you to follow along. \u2047 They're also available on our website for downloading. \u2047 Today, we reported a strong start to what we expect to be an outstanding year. \u2047 For the first quarter, we grew sales 29% year over year to $3.3 billion. \u2047 We grew earnings per share by 125% to $0.45. \u2047 Free cash flow of $372 million builds on the momentum we established in the second half of 2020. \u2047 All five of our segments delivered double-digit sales and net income growth year over year, with sales growth rates ranging from 15% for display to 38% for environmental. \u2047 But last year was an easy compare. \u2047 So I think it's worth noting that total company sales are up 14% since the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 No question, we're in a strong position. \u2047 I'll frame my remarks around three points. \u2047 First, invention is fundamental to our long-term strategy. \u2047 Through our relentless commitment to R&D, we developed category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. \u2047 Second, as we partner closely with our customers to move their industries forward, we unlock new ways to integrate more Corning content into their ecosystems. \u2047 This is a powerful growth mechanism. \u2047 And finally, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company, one that is committed to rewarding shareholders while supporting our customers, our people and our communities. \u2047 Now let me expand on my first point. \u2047 We're living in a world that Corning anticipated exactly a decade ago in our video, A Day Made of Glass. \u2047 It's a world where technology underpins every facet of human life; a world of communication and connection, where massive bandwidth facilitates real-time information and on-demand connections and people stay connected through a virtual environment that is literally at their fingertips. \u2047 Let's think about what it means as displays and touchscreen devices make their way to the very center of daily life. \u2047 The demands we're putting on today's screens and the expectations we have for tomorrow's imply a very specific set of properties. \u2047 The requirements for precision glass and ceramics become more and more exacting. \u2047 We need a material that is strong, yet thin and lightweight, flexible and conformable, durable, damage-resistant and impermeable, stable enough to withstand hostile weather, extreme temperatures and cleaning agents. \u2047 It needs to be touch-friendly and look elegant. \u2047 It must scale for very large applications and yet be useful in the palm of your hand or on your wrist. \u2047 The material must also be operable with a world of technical capabilities that lie just below the surface, enabling complex electronic circuits and nano scale structure. \u2047 And it must be mindful of the environment. \u2047 When it comes to the critical components that enable high-technology systems in multiple markets that we serve, the bar just keeps getting higher. \u2047 This leads to a world where precision glass and ceramics win. \u2047 And we have been winning. \u2047 When we examine the growth in all our business today, we see key trends converging around our capabilities at a very exciting pace. \u2047 In short, we're vital to progress. \u2047 We succeed through sustained investments in R&D and years of material science and process engineering knowledge. \u2047 Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. \u2047 Corning is one of the world's most proficient innovators in materials science. \u2047 We combine our unparalleled expertise in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics with our proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms to develop category-defining products that transform industries and enhance lives. \u2047 Today, our inventions clean the air we all breathe, connect people to information and each other, provide the window through which we access information and entertainment. \u2047 And they help facilitate the discovery and delivery of new medicines. \u2047 And we're building in each of these areas. \u2047 We're helping our customers move toward a world with nearly infinite and ubiquitous bandwidth; with large lifelike displays, where cars are cleaner, autonomous and connected; where medicines are individualized, effective and safe; and where you can do more right from your mobile device, protected by cover materials that can withstand even greater reviews. \u2047 That leads me to my second point. \u2047 As we work closely with our customers to advance these visions, we find ways to solve their toughest technology challenges. \u2047 Our probability of success increases as we apply more of our world-class capabilities, and our cost of innovation declines as we reapply talent and repurpose our existing assets. \u2047 As we apply our focused portfolio, we invent solutions that add even more value to our customers' offerings, and this provides a powerful growth mechanism. \u2047 We aren't exclusively relying on people just buying more stuff. \u2047 We're putting more Corning into the products that people are already buying. \u2047 Now through that lens, let's look at our progress across our market access platforms. \u2047 In mobile consumer electronics, we continue to help transform the way people interact with and use their devices. \u2047 And we are capturing significant growth by increasing the value we offer on each of those devices. \u2047 As we advance state-of-the-art for cover materials, we drive sustained outperformance across up and down markets. \u2047 We've grown specialty sales every year from 2016 to today despite smartphone unit sales being roughly flat or down each year. \u2047 Over that five-year period, we've added more than $750 million in sales on a base of more than $1 billion. \u2047 Fast Company recently recognized our achievements in this space. \u2047 Noting both Ceramic Shield and Gorilla Glass Victus, the magazine named Corning, The Most Innovative Company in Consumer Electronics for 2021. \u2047 We see a similar growth story playing out in automotive since 2017, the peak year for car sales. \u2047 Our auto sales are up more than 40%, while global car sales are down 20%. \u2047 We're helping customers navigate an industry that is expected to change more in the next 10 years than it has in the past 50. \u2047 And as we do, we're working to capture and expand $100 per car content opportunity across emissions, auto glass solutions and other technical glass products, including our patented 3D ColdForm technology. \u2047 We were thrilled to see the world premier event for the all-electric EQS for Mercedes. \u2047 Its hyper screen features a Gorilla Glass cover almost five-feet wide. \u2047 We've also launched a new generation of GPS. \u2047 They're helping vehicles, including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate emissions. \u2047 And they're helping us exceed a $500 million GPF business ahead of our original time frame. \u2047 In life sciences, we are delivering growth on two fronts. \u2047 First, demand is growing based on COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostics. \u2047 Second, we're becoming increasingly relevant as we help the industry move toward cell- and gene-based therapies, and that shift translates into more of our content per drug sold. \u2047 Looking longer term, we're making significant strides toward building a valor glass franchise, addressing a multibillion-dollar content opportunity in pharmaceutical packaging markets. \u2047 We doubled valor vial production in Quarter 1 versus Quarter 4. \u2047 And to date, the company has shipped enough valor vials for hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines. \u2047 Corning also expanded its agreement with the U.S. government to boost capacity for vials to $261 million, a $57 million increase from our initial June 2020 agreement. \u2047 We're leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver stable returns. \u2047 I'm pleased to note that in Quarter 1, we experienced the most favorable first-quarter pricing environment in more than a decade. \u2047 And we announced a moderate increase to our display glass substrate prices for the second quarter. \u2047 Stepping back, we are the lowest-cost producer of display glass, which makes us significantly more profitable than our competitors. \u2047 Our superior products, innovation capabilities and deep customer relationships enable us to maintain our leadership position. \u2047 And our flexible fusion manufacturing platform allows us to match operating capacity with demand. \u2047 Meanwhile, the emergence of Gen 10.5 has given us a unique opportunity. \u2047 Demand for large-sized TVs continues to grow. \u2047 75-inch sets were up more than 60% last year. \u2047 These TVs are most efficiently made on the largest fabs, and Corning is well-positioned to drive more content into the market in 2021 with its Gen 10.5 plants in China. \u2047 Finally, let's look at optical. \u2047 I'm energized by the outlook for this business. \u2047 We gauge the market by three indicators. \u2047 First is network need, and we can all see that demand on the network is only increasing. \u2047 Second is customer statements. \u2047 Broadly, network operators are making encouraging announcements on capital investment for 5G and hyperscale data center deployments. \u2047 And there's also good news on fiber to the home. \u2047 AT&T's CEO, John Stankey recently said that fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, serving both wired and wireless. \u2047 His company announced plans to increase its fiber-to-the-home footprint by an additional 3 million customer locations across more than 90 metro areas in 2021. \u2047 Verizon CFO Matt Ellis said the fiber serves as the critical backbone to our 5G deployment. \u2047 Our commitments with our vendor partners, such as Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson, and Corning, represent key strategic agreements to drive innovation in 5G. \u2047 And finally, the third indicator that we watch is our order book. \u2047 We're seeing orders and sales increase. \u2047 And we're also seeing multiple governments starting to shape policy that asserts broadband is a basic right. \u2047 They're developing action plans to take optical solutions to many more homes. \u2047 The White House is calling for more than $120 billion to bring high-speed Internet to every American. \u2047 Just looking at the two biggest efforts, the Rural Opportunity Development Fund and the President's Infrastructure Plan, we see a multibillion-dollar opportunity for Corning. \u2047 launched its GBP 5 billion Project Gigabit. \u2047 The plan is to bring next-generation broadband to more than 1 million hard-to-reach homes and businesses. \u2047 And the European Commission is calling for EUR 135 billion to support the rollout of rapid broadband services to all regions and households starting in 2021. \u2047 In addition, we remain the unquestioned technology and market leader. \u2047 We consistently create new products and extend our lead by delivering solutions that help our customers realize their network visions faster, better and cheaper. \u2047 Simultaneously, we're driving productivity improvements to increase capacity and lower our cost. \u2047 In total, we're feeling very good about optical. \u2047 So I've talked about how we invest to create and make innovations that solve tough challenges, deliver for our customers and grow. \u2047 Now I want to add on my final point. \u2047 As we effectively build our strength as a company, we will continue to reward our shareholders. \u2047 The strength of our businesses results in significant cash generation. \u2047 Our first priority is to invest for growth. \u2047 And we are committed to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and opportunistic buybacks. \u2047 In the first quarter, we announced a 9% increase to our dividend. \u2047 And earlier this month, we seized a great opportunity to resume share buybacks. \u2047 Through our recent transaction with Samsung display, we repurchased 4% of our outstanding shares. \u2047 This is a great deal for our shareholders, and it's great news for Corning that Samsung retained a 9% long-term ownership stake in the company. \u2047 We see their investment as validation of Corning's innovation road map and the value of our capabilities. \u2047 As we look ahead, this only adds to our confidence. \u2047 Shifting to a broader view of our stakeholder base, we are committed to sharing resources and leadership on a range of important issues. \u2047 We continue to support vital human services and emergency relief in our communities around the world. \u2047 Our Office of Racial Equality & Social Unity has made significant strides. \u2047 In North Carolina, we've established a five-year partnership with N.C. A&T, the largest historically black university in the United States to provide scholarships through 2026. \u2047 The funding focuses on enhancing STEM education, helping students become community classroom teachers and boosting the number of graduates in other fields critical to the nation's workforce. \u2047 In New York, we're providing hands-on support on police reform. \u2047 We're also energized around our sustainability efforts. \u2047 EPA has once again named Corning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year. \u2047 Recently, Verizon publicly recognized our sustainable practices. \u2047 And I am pleased to announce that we'll publish our first sustainability report in the coming months. \u2047 On all dimensions, Corning is operating exceptionally well, and our capabilities are vital to progress on multiple fronts. \u2047 We're succeeding at building a stronger, more resilient company. \u2047 And I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. \u2047 I am pleased to reiterate that Corning had another excellent quarter. \u2047 We closed 2020 with strong momentum and built on that momentum by delivering sales, earnings per share and cash flow above our expectations. \u2047 We are off to a great start, and we expect that strong demand and positive momentum to continue throughout the year. \u2047 Now let me walk you through our first"], "gold_summary": ["sees q2 core earnings per share $0.49 to $0.53.  \u2047  q1 core earnings per share $0.45.  \u2047  sees q2 core sales $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion.  \u2047  display technologies, first-quarter sales were $863 million, up 3% sequentially and 15% year over year.  \u2047  optical communications, first-quarter sales were $937 million, up 18% year over year.  \u2047  anticipates strong demand and positive momentum across its businesses to continue throughout 2021.  \u2047  corning - continuing to innovate to reduce cost and speed deployment of 5g, hyperscale data centers, and fiber-to-home.  \u2047  expects freight & logistics costs will normalize longer term and will begin to decline in q2 as co takes mitigating actions."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share $0.45.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share $0.45."]}
