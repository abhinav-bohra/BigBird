{"article": ["As a reminder, before we begin, the Company has a slide deck to accompany the earnings call this quarter. \u2047 Because these statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from the Company's current expectations. \u2047 I'm going to pass it over to Tom to begin. \u2047 So, a pretty exciting quarter here for us at California Water Service Group. \u2047 We get to talk quite a bit about our California General Rate Case and some of the other things that are going on in the quarter. \u2047 And I'm going to begin on Slide 6, which is a slide about the recognition of the 2018 California General Rate Case. \u2047 So, as most everyone knows at this point, on October 14, the California Public Utilities Commission published a proposed decision in our California GRC, that's a delayed GRC that should have been effective on January 1, 2020 and the proposed decision approved the settlement that we had announced back in October of 2019. \u2047 And it also proposed to adopt Cal Water's positions on the disputed financial matters in the case. \u2047 And for the first two quarters of the year, we had been reluctant to record regulatory assets for some of our continuing balancing account mechanisms, such as the WRAM and the MCBA decoupling mechanism, as well as our pension and medical cost balancing accounts, because those accounts we did not know whether they were probable for recovery. \u2047 We have concluded, based upon the proposed decision and a couple of things subsequent to that, that the GRC decision is very probable to award us those accounts on a continuing basis. \u2047 And so, we are recognizing the regulatory assets associated with the water revenue adjustment mechanism, modified cost balancing account and the pension medical cost balancing account regulatory assets, and those will -- those add significantly to our revenue for the quarter and for the year-to-date. \u2047 In addition, the Commission will grant us interim rate recovery. \u2047 And since we now know the proposed decisions take on the revenue requirement, we're able to calculate what is in the interim rate memorandum account. \u2047 And so, we've also booked a regulatory asset for the interim rate memorandum account. \u2047 I did want to talk briefly about the subsequent event that is giving us further confidence in the General Rate Case. \u2047 And that is, that on Tuesday, among other things that happened on Tuesday in the United States, the the Cal PA, the Public Advocates Office issued their comments on the proposed decision. \u2047 And while they gave extensive comments on a variety of areas, they did not comment on the three major areas that we're recovering here. \u2047 In other words, their comments do not take issue with the proposed decisions granting of a continued water revenue adjustment mechanism, modified cost balancing account or pension and medical cost balancing account. \u2047 And so, we feel very strongly that the final decision, which can be rendered by the Commission no earlier than November 19, is going to allow those those balancing accounts for us. \u2047 And so, that's very good news for the Company. \u2047 In addition to those three items, I would mention that as part of this rate case, we are refunding to customers the excess deferred tax associated with the Tax Cut Jobs Act reduction in the federal income tax rate and that refund is being applied. \u2047 It's applied to the customer rates and it's shown up in our income statement as a reduction to our effective tax rate. \u2047 And so, you'll see a lower effective tax rate for the Company on a go-forward basis as we refund those excess deferred taxes. \u2047 I do want to emphasize that these assessments of probability do have some risk associated with them. \u2047 We are dependent upon the CPUC adopting the proposed decision with no material changes. \u2047 But as I say, given the evidence that we have right now, we think that is likely and that's why we've gone ahead and included these in our third quarter estimates -- or rather third quarter earnings results, not estimates. \u2047 And so, turning to Slide 7. \u2047 The result of that determination means that we have a very significant increase in our net income for the third quarter. \u2047 That is going from $42.4 million to $96.4 million as compared to 2019. \u2047 Earnings per share $1.94 for the third quarter as compared to $0.88 in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, on Slide 8, the net income is up, it's up about $30 million to -- so it's $81.3 million, up from $51.8 million in the year-to-date period of 2019. \u2047 And that means, our earnings per share is $1.66 on a year-to-date basis as compared to $1.08 on a year-to-date basis in 2019. \u2047 And then going through Slide 9 and Slide 10, I'll go through very quickly. \u2047 Just the other changes that we have to earnings, revenues and expenses are pretty standard for us. \u2047 The things that we've talked about in prior quarters. \u2047 So, we have increased operating expenses for wages and other things, such as generally increased depreciation, amortization. \u2047 We do have variations from time to time in our unbilled revenue accruals and you'll see that on a couple of these slides as well as the mark-to-market adjustment that we have on some of our retirement plan assets. \u2047 So, there is nothing major either in the quarter or in the year-to-date period in those areas, but those do end up affecting earnings. \u2047 I do want to focus very briefly on Slide 11, the earnings bridge, to emphasize the point about the third quarter earnings. \u2047 And if you're there on Slide 11, you will notice the first bar change is $0.80, which is titled delayed recording of Q1 and Q2 regulatory assets. \u2047 And because we're recording the effect of the General Rate Case through the third quarter, in the third quarter, that $0.80, that's in the first part, represents the earnings that would have been achieved in the first two quarters of the year had the rate case been adopted on time. \u2047 And so, we're putting this -- just highlighting this for you, so that when we get to the third quarter of 2021, there is a recognition that we're probably not going to earn $1.94 again per share in the third quarter of 2021, although obviously that would be nice if we could. \u2047 And then I do want to focus on Slide 13. \u2047 I think just to run through this again as a basis of calculation for analysts and others thinking about the Company stock. \u2047 The earnings power of the Company, and again we're a predominantly regulated utility in all four states. \u2047 And that is -- drives most of our revenues and net income. \u2047 The California Rate Case, if it is a docket, the proposed decision is adopted, actually allows for a specific net income about $76 million in test year 2020 and that reflects the authorized equity return on the equity portion of $1.5 billion in rate base. \u2047 In addition to California, we have about $110 million of rate base in other states that should earn a similar equity return, again, on a normalized test year kind of basis. \u2047 But do remember that our equity returns on the regulated businesses are dependent on our cost being in line with adopted costs. \u2047 And also, in particular, in the other three states, in New Mexico, Washington and Hawaii, our returns are also affected by our water sales. \u2047 And as Paul will talk about in a minute, beginning in 2023, we expect the earnings in California will also be affected by water sales. \u2047 And another point for the quarter and the year to date is to make sure that everyone understands that on an annual basis, we do not anticipate a net income effect from changes in our unbilled revenue accruals or unrealized changes in the value of retirement assets, the mark-to-market that we talk about from time to time. \u2047 Those factors through the third quarter, are adding about $9.6 million to our year-to-date net income. \u2047 And so, just be cognizant of that as we go toward the end of the year, that we expect particularly the unbilled to drop back down to where it was at the end of 2019. \u2047 And then finally, there are a couple of other factors that cause our earnings to be a bit higher than the otherwise core regulated earnings, and those are unregulated activities, operation maintenance contracts, the antenna leases for various things -- various cellular antennas on our facilities, the regulatory asset that we book associated with the equity portion of construction funding, the AFUDC if you will, and then state tax timing differences can play a factor there. \u2047 And so, just wanted everybody to be aware of that, happy to take questions on that as well. \u2047 I want to give everyone a quick operational update with the backdrop of COVID-19. \u2047 But even with COVID-19, it was the worst fire season in California history. \u2047 So, in addition to COVID, we had to deal with a number of fires and then folding in the public safety power shut downs that we had throughout the state at various times during the state, as well as a couple of earthquakes, it's been a very, very busy year for operations. \u2047 We've opened our emergency operations center and totaled 18 times year-to-date. \u2047 I think that's a new record for us. \u2047 The EOC, or emergency operation centers, we basically follow a FEMA type protocol in terms of how we deal with emergency situations. \u2047 And very happy to say that, despite dealing with a number of potential emergencies throughout the year, the Company's operations have gone very, very well and we avoided having any major disruptions of water service or lack of water service, especially during fire season. \u2047 Having said that, we still continue to operate with enhanced safety protocols to protect customers and employees from infections. \u2047 Protecting employees and customers and public health remains our number one priority. \u2047 Very happy to share with everyone, and you may have seen this, we received the Stevie Award, the Silver Stevie Award as Most Valuable Employer for COVID Response. \u2047 That was out of 700-plus companies competing for a Stevie Award. \u2047 So we're very happy to win that award for our work on the COVID response and keeping our employees safe. \u2047 While dealing with the pandemic, we've seen an increase in customer accounts aging from the suspension of collection activities. \u2047 If you recall, early on in the process, Cal Water suspended our collections and shut-offs, and it was further ordered by the governor[Phonetic] to do so, but we had done it prior to any orders of the government, because we recognize the need for water for our customers to help fight the virus. \u2047 So, our over 90 balances has increased to about $5.4 million. \u2047 Only a portion of such amounts are typically uncollectible. \u2047 We continue to monitor that very, very closely. \u2047 We think it's indicative of the hard financial times as the pandemic has hit people, and people have been ordered to shelter in place, and maybe have been on some type of assistance program and not able to meet their ability to pay their bills. \u2047 We've increased our reserve for doubtful accounts by about $1.6 million to $2.7 million, roughly 50% of that balance is reserved for, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move into the four quarter. \u2047 Our incremental expenses dealing with the COVID were less than $100,000 in the third quarter, which we think is good. \u2047 We do have a memo account in California and also a memo type account in Hawaii. \u2047 And as most of you know, a memo account, you expense the cost in the right -- in the period it's incurred, but you track it kind of off the books. \u2047 And when it gets to be a certain amount, you potentially have the ability to go back to the Commission and seek recovery for those costs as they are incremental to what was planned in the business model. \u2047 So, we continue to track costs on our memo accounts associated with COVID in our operations. \u2047 Water sales, in aggregate, have been closer to the adopted levels, or about 95% of adopted sales in California, with the increases in customer usage, obviously, with people being home, using more water and that was offset by lower business in industrial uses during the quarter. \u2047 In terms of liquidity. \u2047 Our liquidity remains strong. \u2047 As of September 30, we had $113 million in cash and additional current capacity of $170 million through a line of credit. \u2047 So, liquidity has remained strong with the Company throughout the pandemic, and we're positioned very well going into the fourth quarter. \u2047 So turning to Slide 15, is the California regulatory update. \u2047 It has been a very busy year for Cal Water on the regulatory front. \u2047 As Tom mentioned, the Company received a proposed decision in October and then the PD, or the proposed decision, the Commission established a new revenue requirement for Cal Water of $698.7 million for test year 2020. \u2047 In the proposed decision, it also authorized $828 million of new capital expenditures or new capital investments across the three years of the rate case cycle. \u2047 Now, we filed a settlement agreement as a part of this rate case and the settlement agreement that we filed resolved the majority of the issues in the General Rate Case. \u2047 However, there were 11 items, 11 litigated items, litigated financial items, which were not part of the settlement agreement that we filed with the Commission. \u2047 In the proposed decision, the judge agreed with Cal Water's position on all 11 of the litigated financial items. \u2047 They were ruled in our favor by the administrative law judge and these included: The continuation of the water revenue adjustment mechanism, WRAM/MCBA; a continuation of the sales reconciliation mechanism, or SRM; the continuation of the pension and healthcare balancing accounts, inclusion of an equity component in our AFUDC calculation; an approval of capital projects for AMI, or advanced meter infrastructure; and for some water quality or water treatment projects down in the Los Angeles area. \u2047 The Commission is set to rule on the proposed decision, at earliest on its November 19 open meeting. \u2047 I will also note on Slide 15 that Cal Water along with the other parties have filed a request for rehearing on the August 27 decision by the Commission, which bars Cal Water and others from continuing to use the WRAM/MCBA, beginning, in our case, in our 2021 Rate Case filing, which will be effective in 2023. \u2047 2021 as I said -- our 2020 has been a busy year. \u2047 2021 will also be a busy year, because, as I just mentioned, we will be filing our 2021 Rate Case next spring and we will also be filing our cost of capital case next spring. \u2047 So"],
