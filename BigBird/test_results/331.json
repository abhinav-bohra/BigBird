{"article": ["Third quarter was highly productive. \u2047 With our strong cash collection results and the meaningful steps we took to further solidify our balance sheet and strengthen our liquidity, we reinforced our position to pursue additional investment growth. \u2047 We were pleased to report cash collections, which exceeded our expectations, driven by the accelerated recovery across our experiential properties. \u2047 We believe that increased vaccination levels and new protocols have translated to increased levels of confidence as people are again going out and seeking memorable experiences. \u2047 Consumers are returning to the theater in a significant way, driven by highly appealing content as studios reestablish a rhythm of releasing major titles and theaters. \u2047 Strong momentum has been established with the box office with pandemic area of records being broken. \u2047 This demand for the theater experience has also provided studios much greater clarity around the economic value that box office contributes. \u2047 We look forward to seeing this momentum continue as studios have committed to exclusive theatrical releases and a strong slate of titles remain in 2021 and going into 2022. \u2047 We are also continuing to see a sustained rebound across our non-theater experiential properties. \u2047 From eat and play to experiential lodging, the common attributes of value and drive two locations provide choice, allowing consumers to spend few hours or a few days outside the home. \u2047 On the capital markets front, we were pleased to once again receive an investment-grade rating with a stable outlook from S&P, while Moody's raised its investment-grade rating to a stable outlook in October, recognizing our meaningful progress. \u2047 Additionally, we further solidified our balance sheet as we completed a new $1 billion credit -- revolving credit facility and $400 million debt issuance. \u2047 These actions have certainly enhanced our liquidity profile and positions us well to reaccelerate our growth. \u2047 Mark will provide greater detail on this. \u2047 All of this progress established a strong backdrop for us to pivot to pursuing growth, and we made progress in reestablishing our investment spending momentum. \u2047 As Greg will speak to, we have reengaged in discussions across many of our experiential property types. \u2047 Lastly, I want to bring to your attention our updated company tag line in logo. \u2047 The new tag line, the diversified experiential REIT highlights diversification as an important attribute that we will continue to build on. \u2047 We believe we are uniquely positioned to capture these opportunities. \u2047 We are seeing ample evidence of consumer demand for experiential properties we have the only team in the industry with proven capabilities across the entire spectrum of experiential concepts. \u2047 With this backdrop of demand, combined with our team and focus we believe we truly offer a unique alternative for investors to gain diversified exposure to experiential real estate and the experiential economy. \u2047 At the end of the third quarter, our total investments were approximately $6.5 billion with 358 properties in service and 96% occupied. \u2047 During the quarter, our investment spending was $39.3 million, bringing the year-to-date total through September 30 to $107.9 million in each case entirely in our experiential portfolio, the spending included in acquisition, build-to-suit development and redevelopment projects. \u2047 Our experiential portfolio comprises 284 properties with 43 operators and accounts for 91% of our total investments or approximately $5.9 billion of the $6.5 billion, and at the end of the quarter was 95% occupied. \u2047 Our education portfolio comprises 74 properties with eight operators, and at the end of the quarter was 100% occupied. \u2047 Now, I'll update you on the operating status of our tenants. \u2047 Q3 theater headlines were extremely positive. \u2047 Q3 total box office was $1.37 billion. \u2047 Major film for release, customers returned to theaters and box office results steadily improved. \u2047 The first $100 million a three-day weekend in the pandemic era wasn't until July. \u2047 Since then, North American box office has exceeded $100 million for a three-day weekend five times. \u2047 Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings put an exclamation point on the quarter, establishing an all-time four-day Labor Day box office record at $94.7 million. \u2047 Venom Let There Be Carnage, delivered the highest grossing opening three-day weekend during the pandemic era at $90 million. \u2047 Box office momentum continues as we roll into Q4. \u2047 North American box office through this past weekend is $3 billion compared to $2.1 billion for all of 2020. \u2047 We believe Q4 performance will deliver around $2 billion. \u2047 An instructive metric to evaluate box office recovery is to compare 2021 monthly grosses to the same month in 2019, which adjusts for the seasonality of the film schedule. \u2047 Q2 box office growth was around 25% of 2019. \u2047 Since then, box office has consistently improved month over month when compared to the 2019 comparable period. \u2047 July was at 45%, August at 50%, September at 53%. \u2047 And when final October numbers are in, we expect grosses will exceed $622 million or around 80% of 2019, the highest monthly gross since February 2020. \u2047 Additionally, the number of films released to exhibition is steadily increasing and should drive continued box office recovery. \u2047 During 2018 and 2019, there were around 560 new titles released to theatrical exhibition annually. \u2047 In 2020, there were 327, a 42% decrease. \u2047 Through September 30, there have been 285. \u2047 We anticipate that number will grow to around 400 by the end of the year. \u2047 The release cadence will continue to grow in 2022. \u2047 Increased product will drive continued box office recovery. \u2047 The remaining Q4 film slate is strong. \u2047 Eternals, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, West Side Story, Spider-Man: No way Home, the Kingsman and Matrix: Resurrections. \u2047 The 2022 film slate is compelling with the potential for 20 titles to gross $100 million or more up approximately 50% from 2021, anchored by two Tom Cruise pictures, Top Gun Maverick and Mission Impossible 7, three Marvel Universe films and several highly anticipated sequels, including Aquaman 2, Avatar 2, John Wick 4, The Batman, and Jurassic World. \u2047 Finally, the impact of premium video on demand and streaming on the theatrical window and exhibition and theatrical exhibition is clearer. \u2047 After the day and date hybrid release of Black Widow, Disney announced the remainder of its 2021 film slate will have an exclusive theatrical release. \u2047 had already committed to an exclusive theatrical release for 2022. \u2047 The results of day in date premium video on-demand and streaming demonstrated the best way for studios to maximize revenue is through a multipronged approach anchored by the theatrical exhibition in an exclusive window. \u2047 The exclusive theatrical window is generally settling around 45 days with some variability for individual titles and exhibitors. \u2047 Historically, the majority of box office gross occurred in the first 45 days. \u2047 The reduction of the exclusive theatrical window will lead to more streaming services releasing more films theatrically. \u2047 More content in theaters is a positive for consumers. \u2047 This is already happening. \u2047 In May, Netflix released Army of the Dead theatrically in select theaters, including 600 Cinemark theaters for one week prior to its availability on Netflix. \u2047 Netflix is continuing its experimentation. \u2047 In Q4, it will release 10 titles to theatrical exhibition before release to streaming. \u2047 It won't be a 45-day window, but Netflix understands the importance of theatrical release for both revenue generation and word-of-mouth marketing. \u2047 This is reinforced by the recent announcement that Netflix will operate the Bay theater in Pacific Palisades. \u2047 Turning now to an update on our other major customer groups. \u2047 We see continued positive performance across all segments of our drive to value-oriented destinations. \u2047 The fewer the COVID restrictions, the better the performance. \u2047 Across all segments, our customers found many ways to improve their profitability despite fewer guests. \u2047 Consumers want to engage in social activities. \u2047 We are seeing excellent performance across eat and play throughout the country with attendance approaching or exceeding 2019 levels and continued margin improvement and profitability. \u2047 We saw recovering demand across our attractions and cultural holdings throughout the summer. \u2047 Attractions with fewer COVID restrictions performed well and several were significantly ahead of 2019 levels. \u2047 Others were negatively impacted by ongoing COVID restrictions with performance improving as restrictions were relaxed and eliminated and the impact of fewer group and school events. \u2047 We anticipate continued growth in demand in 2022, assuming no material COVID restrictions. \u2047 There is high demand across our experiential lodging portfolio with strong occupancy and ADR growth. \u2047 The Cartwright Resort and indoor water park reopened on July 1 and ramped up through the summer. \u2047 We're pleased with our progress. \u2047 The Margaritaville Nashville Hotel in downtown Nashville is benefiting from Nashville's rebound to its typical diverse and robust event calendar, including live performances at the Ryman Auditorium, Tennessee Titans, and Nashville Predators games, and an IndyCar race. \u2047 The RV portion of our Camp Margaritaville RV Resort and lodge in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee opened in June. \u2047 We saw strong demand through the summer and into the fall foliage season, which draws visitors to -- Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the most visited national park in the country with over 12 million visitors in 2020. \u2047 We the lodge will be completed in Q4. \u2047 Despite the impact of reduced cruise business on Alaska, Alyeska Resort benefited from increased airlift and ground tours to Alaska and is performing well. \u2047 Our Nordic Spa will open Q4. \u2047 In St. Petersburg, our repositioned bellwether Beach Resort is completely renovated with all rooms and venues open, driving ADR increases. \u2047 We're completing the second phase of the redevelopment at the beach comer. \u2047 Heading into winter, we expect strong demand for our drive to value oriented ski destinations as evidenced by Vail's increased Epic Pass sales for 2021, '22. \u2047 Vail's recently announced $320 million capital plan will improve four of our properties. \u2047 Our education portfolio continues to perform well. \u2047 After a challenging 16 months, we are returning to growth and actively pursuing deals in all our experiential verticals other than theaters. \u2047 In Q3, we acquired the Jellystone Park Camp Resort in Warren's, Wisconsin, for $25.2 million in an unconsolidated joint venture, of which we own 95%. \u2047 This iconic family campground RV park features numerous experiential amenities, including a water park and a water slide. \u2047 Along with Camp Margaritaville, the Jellystone acquisition demonstrates our belief in the growth opportunities in the experiential RV park space. \u2047 The remainder of the quarterly investing spending was in build-to-suit development and redevelopment projects in our Eaton Play and experiential lodging categories. \u2047 Our primary capital recycling focus remains on our vacant theaters, and we're pleased with the progress. \u2047 Since Q3 2020, we've sold five vacant theaters for various uses, including one that closed yesterday for approximately $6.8 million at a slight gain. \u2047 We have five remaining vacant theaters. \u2047 Three are under executed contracts for sale, and we're marketing the remaining two with multiple expressions of interest. \u2047 In the third quarter, we also completed the sale of two land parcels. \u2047 At the end of October, we sold our WISP and Wintergreen ski resorts to our tenant for $48 million or about a 9% cash cap rate with a gain on sale of $15.4 million. \u2047 This was a strategic decision to improve our portfolio and our credit profile. \u2047 Located in Maryland and Virginia. \u2047 They were the farthest south ski locations in our portfolio. \u2047 And other than Alyeska, they were our only ski resorts not operated by Vail. \u2047 Finally, I want to update you on the status of our cash collections. \u2047 Cash collections continue their upward trajectory. \u2047 Tenants and borrowers paid 90% of contractual cash revenue for the third quarter. \u2047 In addition, we collected a total of $11.3 million of deferred rent and interest during the quarter, as well as $5.3 million on a previously reserved note receivable. \u2047 Through September 30, we have collected a total of $59.5 million of deferred rent and interest from accrual and cash basis customers. \u2047 Mark will provide additional color on revenue recognition and cash collections for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. \u2047 We are excited by the prospect of each metric approaching 100% in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Today, I will discuss our financial performance for the quarter, provide an update on our capital markets activities and strong balance sheet and close by reviewing our increase in 2021 earnings guidance. \u2047 as adjusted for the quarter was $0.86 per share versus a loss of $0.16 in the prior year, and AFFO for the quarter was $0.92 per share compared to $0.04 in the prior year. \u2047 Total revenue for the quarter was $139.6 million versus $3.9 million in the prior year. \u2047 This increase was due primarily to improved collections and revenue from certain tenants, which continue to be recognized on a cash basis or were previously receiving abatements, as well as less receivable write-offs than in prior year. \u2047 I will have more on collections later in my comments. \u2047 Scheduled rent increases, as well as acquisitions and developments completed over the past year also contributed to the increase. \u2047 This increase was partially offset primarily by property dispositions. \u2047 Additionally, we had higher other income and other expense of $7.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively, due primarily to the reopening of the Kartrite Resort and indoor water park after being closed due to COVID restrictions, COVID-19 restrictions, as well as the operations from two theater properties. \u2047 Percentage rents for the quarter totaled $3.1 million versus $1.3 million in the prior year. \u2047 This increase related to higher percentage rents from an early education tenant due to a restructured agreement, as well as stronger performance than expected at two attraction properties and one ski property. \u2047 This was partially offset by the disposition of certain private schools in December of 2020. \u2047 I would like to point out, as I have in recent prior quarters that we are defining percentage rents here as amounts due above base rent and not payments in leaf base rent based on a percentage of revenue. \u2047 Costs associated with loan refinancing or payoff for the quarter of $4.7 million related to the write-off of fees and termination of interest rate swaps related to the repayment of our $400 million unsecured term loan facility during the quarter. \u2047 Interest expense net for the quarter decreased by $5.2 million compared to prior year due to reduced borrowings offset by lower interest income on short-term investments. \u2047 In addition to the repayment of the term loan, we had no balance on our revolving credit facility during the quarter. \u2047 You may recall that in prior year"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly ffoaa per diluted common share $0.86.  \u2047
