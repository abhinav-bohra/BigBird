{"article": ["Kathie will be reviewing our second quarter 2021 financial results and providing investors with an update on our full year outlook. \u2047 Further information can be found in our SEC filings. \u2047 Starting on Slide three, we entered the year with confidence that our second quarter will be a pivotal quarter moving beyond the going to grow revenue. \u2047 I'm pleased to announce that we achieved constant currency net sales growth of 7.8%, with increases in all key product categories. \u2047 Importantly, mobility and seating products rebounded strongly at constant currency net sales growth of nearly 18% in Europe and over 12% in North America. \u2047 By region, net sales in both Europe and North America achieved significant growth that Healthcare has improved in key markets and customers showed strong interest in new products. \u2047 We continue to see increasing demand for all of our products as evidenced by strong order intake in quote rates and higher than normal backlog. \u2047 As a result, in addition to strong sales in the second quarter, demand continues to support elevated order backlog. \u2047 We ended the second quarter with $15 million of higher backlog than normal, similar to the level at the end of the first quarter. \u2047 The continued higher backlog is expected to convert to sales over the next two quarters as we work to fulfill higher demand in the enrolling supply chain disruption. \u2047 On the cost side, we saw a good improvement in gross margin from favorable sales mix and the benefit of prior actions to optimize the business. \u2047 These were more than offset by supply chain-related disruptions as our factories ended more changeovers and shifting production plans to deal with intermittent part shortages and chipping plays, which accounted for 80% of the margin decline. \u2047 Higher material, freight and logistics costs, offset by variable sales is accounted for the other 20%. \u2047 Our operations team is very focused on improving efficiency and costs. \u2047 We view the impact on gross margin is temporary and are taking actions to rectify it. \u2047 Importantly, we expect gross margin to rebound through the remainder of the year. \u2047 [Indecipherable] cash flow to support sales growth during the quarter, usage increased due to higher accounts receivable balances and elevated inventory levels, which Kathie will expand on later. \u2047 We expect working capital to normalize by the end of the year cash is collected and inventory is converted to sales. \u2047 Overall, second quarter results were largely in line with expectations with strong revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially in all major product lines in Europe and North America. \u2047 We're please with the progress we're making year-to-date and look forward to even stronger results in the second half. \u2047 Turning to Slide four, the business environment and access to healthcare continue to improve and remain well positioned to achieve our full year guidance. \u2047 As a reminder, while the economy and in variance of the world continues to reopen, we're still flattish in North America and Europe, where access to our key customers and challenge some of the[Indecipherable]. \u2047 As we experienced this quarter, we anticipate sales will continue in the back half of the year. \u2047 Interest in recently launched products in helping invasive customers to provide end users with even more capable devices. \u2047 Early in the third quarter, we launched a new rear-wheel drive power wheel share in North America, the AvivaSTormRx, which complements our full portfolio of best-in-class seating across all drive segment. \u2047 Our[Indecipherable] wheelchairs allows end users the best in seating and complex control solutions and the best driving front or percent we drive share for their environment. \u2047 In addition, in respiratory, our new T5 NXG visionary oxygen cone is now commercially available in the United States with plans to roll out further in the coming months. \u2047 As we focus on sales growth and increased customer demand, we look forward to meeting our customers with new tools and our expanding IT platform, especially with more modern customer self-service features. \u2047 At the same time, we're very focused on improving operating efficiency by reducing friction and removing costs from our business system. \u2047 While we expect the global supply chain will persist in the near term, we're taking proactive measures to offset them, such as investing in additional inventory, looking and planning freight further into the future to ensure time in receipt and delivery and more precisely planning manufacturing schedules to better match the anticipated reliable component. \u2047 As these mitigation efforts become more effective, we expect gross margin to expand significantly from second quarter results, which, coupled with sales growth should meet profitability. \u2047 All things taken together, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance as we continue to see strong demand across all product categories to convert our excess order backlog into sales with actions to sustain gross margin and leverage SG&A. \u2047 All of these positive indicators support our conviction that Invacare is pivoting to a period of long-term gorwth. \u2047 Turning to Slide six. \u2047 Reported net sales increased 15.1%, with growth in all product categories and in all regions. \u2047 Constant currency net sales increased 7.8% driven by double-digit growth in both mobility and seating and respiratory products. \u2047 We are pleased to have achieved strong sales growth, driven by new orders received during the quarter. \u2047 And for mobility and seating, we are also seeing increased revenue from new products. \u2047 Gross profit increased $4.2 million due to higher revenue and the benefit of favorable sales mix. \u2047 As Matt mentioned, gross margin was significantly impacted by supply chain-related client disruptions and to a lesser extent, higher freight and material costs. \u2047 The company has taken and continues to implement various actions to reduce the impact on the business, including reduced work hours in certain locations, into the anticipated timing of the receipt of components and investing in increased inventory, much of which was received in the latter part of the second quarter. \u2047 SG&A expense returned to a more normalized and was higher than the prior year as the second quarter 2020 benefited from reduced commercial expenses and discretionary spending given the significant impact of the pandemic on the business. \u2047 This year, SG&A expense includes increased funding for sales, marketing and commission programs to support and drive revenue growth. \u2047 As sales strengthened, free cash flow was also impacted higher levels of accounts receivable that we expect to be collected during the second half of the year. \u2047 In addition, as previously disclosed, the company increased inventory levels to mitigate supply chain disruption and to prepare for the expected sequential sales growth in the latter half of the year. \u2047 We anticipate this investment in inventory will convert to cash in the second half 2021 and enable us to achieve our free cash flow guidance. \u2047 Turning to Slide 7. \u2047 Reported net sales in all product lines improved year-over-year despite supply chain challenge, which limited the conversion of orders for shipments and resulted in excess order backlog of $15 million, primarily in Europe. \u2047 Mobility and seating products achieved net sales growth of 15% to strong growth in both Europe and North America, benefiting from the increased adoption of new products introduced over the past 18 months. \u2047 Constant currency net sales increased 2.9% for lifestyle products even compared to a particularly strong Q2 2020 that benefited from pandemic-related bed sales. \u2047 Growth this quarter was led by higher sales of manual welters, hygiene products as well as growth. \u2047 Retinal respiratory products was driven by continued strong demand in North America related to the pandemic. \u2047 Turning to Slide eight. \u2047 Europe constant currency net sales increased 7% driven by an 18% growth in mobility and seating and over 6% increase in lifestyle products, partially offset by lower sales of respiratory products. \u2047 Gross profit increased $507 million due to strong revenue growth and favorable sales mix, offset by supply chain-related plant disruptions and higher freight costs, resulting in flat gross margin. \u2047 Driven by higher net sales, operating income increased by $2.8 million. \u2047 Overall, we are encouraged by the improving healthcare access in key European markets, which helped drive our significant rebound in sales and profitability. \u2047 Turning to Slide nine. \u2047 North America achieved constant currency net sales growth of 10.1%, driven by increased revenues in all product categories. \u2047 Mobility and seating products generating constant currency net sales growth of 12.6% and respiratory products grew by 24%. \u2047 We achieved exceptionally strong growth in the quarter for mobility and seating products, benefiting the increased adoption of new products. \u2047 Gross profit declined $900,000 as favorable sales mix was more than offset by previous mentioned supply chain challenges, driving 150 basis points decline in gross margin. \u2047 Operating income decreased $3.2 million due to reduced gross profit and higher SG&A expense to support revenue growth. \u2047 Turning to Slide 10. \u2047 Constant currency net sales in the Asia Pac region decreased 7.7% due to lower sales in lifestyle and mobility and seating products partially offset by growth in respiratory products. \u2047 While the Asia Pacific region continues to see strong demand, net sales growth was impacted by global shipping issues to stabilate the receive of products. \u2047 Operating loss increased by $1.8 million, primarily due to lower profitability in the Asia Pacific region impacted by lower net sales favorable gross margin and higher SG&A expense. \u2047 Moving to Slide 11. \u2047 As of June 30, 2021, the company had total debt of $322 million excluding financing and operating rate obligations and $78 million of cash on the balance sheet. \u2047 As a result of revenue growth, the company had higher receivable, which led to an increase of 7.4 days in sales outstanding as compared to the end of the first quarter of 2021, impacted by the timing of collections from revenue recognized in the quarter. \u2047 In addition, the company had higher inventory levels to mitigate supply chain challenges and to prepare for the expected sales growth in the second half of the year. \u2047 As discussed, we anticipate both metrics to normalize by the end of the year and drive positive free cash flow for the full year of 2021. \u2047 Turning to Slide 12. \u2047 Based on our visibility into the third quarter, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for 2021, consisting our constant currency net sales growth in the range of 47%, adjusted EBITDA of $45 million and free cash flow of $5 million. \u2047 Constant currency net sales are anticipated to increase sequentially in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. \u2047 Our outlook is supported by positive sales trends such as strengthening order demand, mobility and seating product sales, which historically peak in the summer months, the conversion of excess backlog in the sales, increased adoption of new products and the continuing reopening of key markets and channels. \u2047 In addition, gross margin is expected to improve driven by revenue growth, favorable sales mix and actions to resolve supply chain challenges at our[Indecipherable]. \u2047 Over the next few quarters, we are taking steps to mitigate this impact where possible. \u2047 As a result, improvements in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow could accelerate for the second half of 2021. \u2047 Turning to Slide 13. \u2047 As we enter the second half of the year, I'm incredibly excited about the positive trends in our favor, which bodes well for a strong finish for the year. \u2047 We anticipate the continued easing of healthcare restrictions, combined with strong demand, favorable sales mix and the fulfillment of excess backlog will drive robust revenue growth and profitability. \u2047 As seen in previous years, Invacare has a long history of generating a substantial majority of its adjusted EBITDA in the second year, and this year is expected to be similar. \u2047 Taken together, we have continued confidence in our ability to meet our 2021 goals and to remain focused on executing our long-term growth strategy. \u2047 We'll now take questions. \u2047 "],
