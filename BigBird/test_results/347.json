{"article": ["Second quarter consolidated financial results were strong as Hawaii's economy improved and as we advanced key priorities across our enterprise. \u2047 Our consolidated net income for the quarter was $63.9 million with earnings per share of $0.58, 31% and 29%, respectively, above the same quarter last year. \u2047 This followed a great first quarter, and for the first half of the year, our consolidated net income and earnings per share were up 56% compared to the first half of 2020. \u2047 At the Utility, our year-to-date results have benefited from our focus on cost management and efficiency and from timing items expected to reverse in the balance of the year. \u2047 We expect the Utility to remain within its full-year guidance range announced in February. \u2047 The improved Hawaii economy and strengthened credit quality of our Bank loan portfolio were key drivers of our results year-to-date and, in the second quarter, enabled the Bank to release a portion of its reserves for credit losses resulting in a negative provision for the quarter. \u2047 We are again increasing our full-year Bank and consolidated guidance, which Greg will cover shortly. \u2047 We've seen strengthening in Hawaii's economy with the reopening of our local economy and rebound of tourism. \u2047 However, we are closely monitoring the recent increase in cases due to the delta variant, as well as how our community response. \u2047 More than 60% of Hawaii residents are now fully vaccinated and we expect that that will increase as more employers, including state and county government, are requiring employees to be vaccinated or subject to frequent testing. \u2047 Controlling virus levels will enable Hawaii to continue to be an attractive tourism destination and that will help us as our economy open. \u2047 Daily visitor arrivals have increased strongly over the last couple of months, approaching, and sometimes exceeding, pre-pandemic levels with most of our arrivals continuing to be from the U.S. Mainland. \u2047 In June, arrivals from the U.S. West region were approximately 15% above June 2019 and their spending was 33% higher. \u2047 Unemployment declined to 7.7% in June, the fifth month of improvement. \u2047 Hawaii real estate values and activity remain robust. \u2047 For July, median prices of Oahu's single-family homes were up 22% and sales volume was up 12% over last year. \u2047 For condos, prices were up 8% and sales were up 58%. \u2047 As of the May forecast, UHERO, the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization, expected state GDP to increase 4% in 2021 and 3.1% in 2022. \u2047 While we've seen great progress on the economy, we're still taking a cautiously optimistic approach, particularly with uncertainty due to the delta variant. \u2047 At the Utility, we remain focused on cost efficiencies as we make needed investments to continue to provide affordable, resilient and reliable electricity to reach Hawaii's climate goals. \u2047 The new Performance-Based Regulation or PBR framework is now fully in effect as of June 1, and we've begun returning cost savings to our customers under the management audit savings commitment and customer dividend component of the ARA or Annual Revenue Adjustment mechanism. \u2047 As we've discussed in the past, Performance Incentive Mechanisms or PIMs are an important part of the PBR framework. \u2047 In May, the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission approved the final details of a suite of PBR PIMs which are now in effect. \u2047 The Commission has now started a process to consider and develop additional performance incentives. \u2047 This includes PIMs and shared savings mechanisms relating to grid reliability, retirement of fossil fuel generation, interconnection of large renewable energy projects, and cost control for fuel, purchased power and other non-ARA costs. \u2047 We don't yet know when an additional performance mechanisms would come into effect or what the potential earnings impact could be. \u2047 However, we always expected PBR would be a process of continued refinement, and we look forward to collaborating with stakeholders to develop new ways to align incentives with customer interests. \u2047 As we've always said, reaching our collective clean energy and decarbonization goals must be done in a way that is equitable and involve everyone working together. \u2047 A lot of the progress we're seeing now across Utility scale and distributed renewable energy additions, grid modernization and the electrification of transportation are good examples of this. \u2047 The Powering Past Coal Task Force, convened by our Governor Ige, has brought together a range of stakeholders to ensure Commission-approved projects on Oahu are successfully brought online as we prepare for retirement of Hawaii's only coal plant. \u2047 We're pressing forward on Stage 1 and 2 renewable procurement projects with independent power producers. \u2047 Three Stage 1 projects are now under construction with others slated to start construction this year or early next year. \u2047 Six of 12 Stage 2 projects now have approved PPAs and the remaining six Stage 2 projects are pending approval. \u2047 Last quarter, we sought clarification from the Commission regarding the interconnection docket and the Kapolei Energy Storage battery energy storage project. \u2047 We appreciated the Commission's work to respond quickly in both matters. \u2047 In the interconnection docket, the Commission clarified its intent for us to track costs to customers resulting from changes in project schedules rather than record such costs. \u2047 And the Commission revised the conditions to its approval of the Kapolei Storage project, enabling us to now work with the developer to advance that project. \u2047 We are working to accelerate the addition of more distributed energy resources and are advancing programs to benefit all customers. \u2047 As of this June, we surpassed 90,000 cumulative installed customer-sited solar systems, which comprise most of the nearly 1 gigawatt of solar capacity on our grid. \u2047 And now the Battery Bonus program launched last month incentivizes customers to add storage and benefit the overall system by allowing the Utility to use energy from those systems in the evening hours. \u2047 Grid modernization is also progressing well with advanced meter deployment accelerating with the Commission's approval to shift from an opt-in to an opt-out approach, enabling greater operational efficiencies and more customer options. \u2047 Finally, we are encouraged by recent developments that will accelerate electrification of transportation here in Hawaii and across the country. \u2047 In June, the Commission approved our eBus make-ready Infrastructure pilot project, which is projected to provide savings for bus fleet operators, while decreasing GHG emissions. \u2047 Governor Ige signed into law a bill to replace the state's light duty vehicles with a zero-emission fleet by 2035, consistent with our Utility's own fleet electrification goal and to allocate 3% of oil barrel tax revenues to finance construction of EV charging stations. \u2047 President Biden's recently announced goal of 50% of vehicle sales being electric by 2030 will also help accelerate our electrification efforts, which will benefit our customers, our environment and our clean energy transition. \u2047 Turning to the Bank. \u2047 ASB's strong results reflected the credit-driven reserve release and resulting negative provision for credit losses as the economy and credit quality improved. \u2047 We believe our reserve levels are appropriate, taking into account ongoing pandemic uncertainty. \u2047 The Bank's margin improved compared to the first quarter, benefiting from fees related to ASB CARES or Payment Protection Program, PPP loans, lower amortization of investment premiums and a continued record low cost of funds of 7 basis points. \u2047 We're still seeing margin pressures due to low asset yields and excess liquidity as strong deposit growth continues to outpace lending opportunities at present. \u2047 Even so, earning asset growth is helping us grow net interest income consistent with our expectations and we're starting to see more in the loan pipeline with an uptick in home equity lines of credit, as well as continued strength in residential mortgages and commercial real estate. \u2047 As ASB's digital banking transformation continues, we're focused on strategic investments to keep the franchise strong and competitive, expand service levels and continue to deliver the personal touch that is a hallmark of who we are as a bank. \u2047 Ann and the Bank team are upgrading the Bank's technology, data analytics and operating model to allow our team members to transition away from processing tasks and focus more on customer relationships and satisfaction. \u2047 We're getting great feedback from Bank customers on our digital offerings so far. \u2047 Nearly 50% of consumer deposits are now through our upgraded ATM fleet or mobile platform and customer satisfaction remains high. \u2047 We've opened three digital centers to date with a fourth opening today and are excited to see how this new concept, which merges our digital platforms with our warm in-person presence, performs in the coming months. \u2047 And now, Greg will discuss our financial results and our outlook. \u2047 Turning to our second quarter results. \u2047 Consolidated earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.45 in the same quarter last year, a 29% increase quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Both the Utility and Bank performed well and contributed to our strong consolidated results. \u2047 The Utility delivered stable earnings even as quarterly results reflected higher O&M expenses, driven by an expected uptick in generation overhauls. \u2047 The Bank delivered solid financial performance that was enhanced by the reduction of reserves for credit losses and resulting negative quarterly provision, reflecting underlying improvements to the credit profile of its loan portfolio. \u2047 And the holding company loss has remained in line with expectations. \u2047 Compared to the same time last year, our consolidated trailing 12-month ROE improved over 100 basis points to 10.5% and the Utility realized return on equity increased levels of 100 basis points to 8.9%. \u2047 As you may recall from our Q1 earnings call, we indicated the Utility ROE expectations for the second half of 2021 would be impacted by the management audit savings commitment and customer dividend as O&M reductions that have improved earnings in the first half of 2021 are returned to customers under PBR, starting June 1. \u2047 Also of note, Bank ROE, which we look at on an annualized basis, more than doubled to 16.8%. \u2047 On Slide 8, Utility net income of $41.9 million was comparable with second quarter 2020 results of $42.3 million. \u2047 The most significant variance drivers were $6 million of higher O&M expenses compared to the second quarter of last year. \u2047 The main factors that drove higher O&M included $3 million due to more generating facility overhauls. \u2047 These were largely timing-related as some of the overhauls budgeted for late last year and earlier this year took place on a delayed basis this quarter. \u2047 We also had $2 million from lower bad debt expense in the second quarter of 2020 due to the recording of year-to-date amounts following the Commission's decision allowing deferral of COVID-19-related expenses last year; about $1 million from the write-off of a terminated agreement relating to a combined heat and power unit; and $1 million due to increase in an environmental reserve. \u2047 Of note, O&M increases were partially offset by $1 million from lower staffing levels and efficiency improvements. \u2047 We also had about $1 million higher in depreciation. \u2047 The higher O&M and depreciation were offset by $5 million in higher RAM revenues, Rate Adjustment Mechanism revenues. \u2047 $2 million of this increase related to a change in the timing for revenue recognition within the year with target revenues recognized on an annual basis remaining unchanged; $1 million from lower non-service pension costs due to the reset of pension costs included in rates as part of a final rate case decision; and $1 million lower expense -- lower Enterprise Resource Planning system implementation benefits to be passed on to customers as we have already fully delivered on our commitment to provide customer savings under this program for Hawaiian Electric. \u2047 Turning to the drivers of Utility performance for the rest of the year. \u2047 All PBR PIMs from the December PBR order are now in effect. \u2047 We expect no material upside from the PIMs this year and are now tracking the potential for reliability PIM penalties and expected downside sharing under the fuel cost risk sharing mechanism. \u2047 We saw some reliability impacts related to prolonged repairs at one of our substations, which has been partially restored and full restoration is expected to be completed soon. \u2047 In addition, fuel costs have increased from our January benchmark and thus we expect there will be some downside sharing under the fuel cost risk sharing mechanism. \u2047 We currently have approximately $26 million of COVID-related costs, primarily estimated bad debt expense and deferred regulatory asset account. \u2047 The moratorium on customer disconnections expired on May 31 and we've requested continuation -- continued deferral of COVID-related costs until the end of this year. \u2047 We will file for recovery once we get a better idea of actual bad debt or realized amounts that requires some time so we can see how our work with customers on payment plans and other bill assistance alternatives plays out. \u2047 As mentioned, our O&M expense this quarter was impacted by an increase in overhauls, including some that were previously delayed. \u2047 We expect to incur more overhaul expenses in the second half of the year and those are included in our guidance. \u2047 The Utility's ability to achieve the accelerated management audit savings commitment is an important driver of results this year. \u2047 To date, we've been able to realize savings through increased efficiency and our cost management programs. \u2047 The Utility is on track to achieve savings to meet its annual $6.6 million commitment, which we started returning to customers on June 1. \u2047 Utility capital investments to date have been lower than planned due to productivity improvements and efficiencies that have reduced certain project costs, delay from prolonged repairs of one of our substations limiting work that could be done on other parts of the system, and some supply chain delays due to the pandemic. \u2047 We now expect capex to be in the $310 million to $335 million range for the year compared to our prior capex guidance of $335 million to $355 million. \u2047 While this means our forecasted rate base growth is now 3% to 4% from a 2020 base year, we don't expect this year's lower capex range to impact the long-term earnings growth. \u2047 That's because under PBR, earnings growth comes from three main sources: the Annual Revenue Adjustment mechanism, which covers O&M and baseline capex and our ability to manage our spending within that allowance; separate capex recovery mechanisms, such as EPRM, Exceptional Project Recovery Mechanism and our renewable energy recovery mechanism; and performance incentives. \u2047 We still expect to realize 4% to 5% Utility earnings growth, not including potential upside from PIMs starting in 2022, the first full year of PBR. \u2047 Recovery of electrification of transportation and resilience projects could drive incremental growth from there. \u2047 Turning to the Bank. \u2047 ASB's net income for the quarter was $30.3 million compared to $29.6 million last quarter and $14 million in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 The negative provision for credit losses was the most significant driver of higher income. \u2047 American grew net interest income, while non-interest income was lower compared to the same quarter last year, where we had"], "gold_summary": ["q2 earnings per share $0.58."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share of $0.58.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.58."]}
