{"article": ["On the call today are Blake Krueger, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Brendan Hoffman, our President; and Mike Stornant, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 References to underlying performance reflect the exclusion of the recently acquired Sweaty Betty brand. \u2047 These disclosures were reconciled in attached tables within the body of the release. \u2047 I hope everyone on the call is safe and well. \u2047 Consumer demand for our market-leading brands and product offerings continues to surge and exceeded our expectations in Q3. \u2047 Our strategic focus on a deeper connection with consumers, digital and DTC capabilities and product and design innovation is paying dividends. \u2047 While the supply chain challenges that have been well documented across many industries has limited our ability to fully service this growing demand in the short-term, I have never been so enthusiastic about our future and our outlook for 2022. \u2047 Earlier today, we reported over 29% revenue growth versus 2020 and 11% over 2019. \u2047 Third quarter revenue was approximately $637 million. \u2047 Earnings leverage driven by gross margin increases was very good. \u2047 We estimate that factory closures and logistics delays impacted Q3 by at least $60 million. \u2047 The Wolverine Michigan Group's revenue was up 13% year-over-year and the Wolverine Boston Group's revenue was up over 33%. \u2047 Both groups delivered growth over 2019. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share for the company were $0.62 in line with our expectation despite the shortfall in revenue driven by macro supply chain issues. \u2047 We believe the company is well positioned to deliver accelerated future growth with a number of fundamental elements supporting our enthusiasm. \u2047 Our brand portfolio strategy and international distribution base continue to reduce risk and provide a meaningful strategic benefit in the current environment as the company is not dependent on any single product category, geographic region, consumer group or distribution channel. \u2047 While consumer lifestyle choices have increased demand for performance product, the underlying trends in this category are long-term in nature and are expected to persist. \u2047 Consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness with running, hiking the outdoors and exercise in general, serving as the primary activation to this mindset. \u2047 Participation in running in the U.S. has increased every year over the last five years. \u2047 And a significant majority of new runners today they plan to continue running in the future. \u2047 Participation in all outdoor activities, including hiking, walking and boating has also increased with over 20 million new hikers in the U.S. alone since 2015. \u2047 This past spring and summer, National Park shattered attendance records and new boat purchases and water activities in general reached a 13-year high. \u2047 Consumers' renewed affinity for the outdoors is expected to continue into the future, especially as consumers begin to travel again. \u2047 The work category has also showed strong growth supported by healthy macro industry conditions and work wear fashion tailwinds. \u2047 Warehousing jobs have more than doubled since 2005 and construction companies are expected to hire hundreds of thousands of additional workers over the coming months. \u2047 Looking ahead, the passage of a major infrastructure plan in the U.S. will further boost momentum in this category. \u2047 Across all brands and product categories, we have placed our consumers at the heart of our global strategy, and that has changed how we bring product to market and operate the business. \u2047 This strategic focus led to our recent acquisition of Sweaty Betty, a trend right women's active wear brand that adds a very meaningful DTC business to our portfolio with over 80% of revenue generated through DTC channels. \u2047 Including Sweaty Betty, DTC e-commerce revenue more than doubled in Q3 relative to 2019 and our DTC stores are up over 35% versus that year. \u2047 Our owned online business and the online business of our wholesale customers now account for over 30% of global revenue. \u2047 Together with the DTC businesses operated by our distributor partners around the world, nearly 40% of our global revenue and a larger percentage of our payers is now generated through consumer direct channel, enabling enhanced brand shopping experiences, a wealth of consumer insights and data and a more efficient business model. \u2047 We continue to capitalize on the fundamental consumer trends that are playing out in the market. \u2047 In addition to our strong DTC business, these trends are reflected by continued strength in retail sell-through and a historically high order backlog that now extends into Q3 of 2022. \u2047 We remain bullish on our outlook in light of these trends and the composition of our brand portfolio, which over indexes in trending performance and lifestyle categories. \u2047 We expect strong long-term consumer demand, especially for Saucony, Merrell, Sweaty Betty, our work brands and Sperry, which will launch a line of products in the active sport category next spring. \u2047 For our call today, Brendan Hoffman will provide some additional insight on key brand performance during the quarter. \u2047 Mike Stornant will review our Q3 financial performance and updated outlook in more detail. \u2047 And I'll conclude with some final remarks. \u2047 With this, I'll now hand it over to Brendan. \u2047 In the third quarter, we acquired sweaty Betty, a powerhouse brand that operates in the global addressable active wear market of over $200 billion. \u2047 The brand delivers on our key strategic priorities by delivering a powerful line of industry-leading products, expanding our direct-to-consumer presence and growing our business internationally. \u2047 We plan to leverage these strengths by deploying Sweaty Betty's best practices and apparel expertise across our portfolio. \u2047 The business grew over 50% in the third quarter, ahead of our expectations. \u2047 Less than three months after welcoming Sweaty Betty to the Wolverine family, we are even more excited about the growth potential, product collaborations and operational synergies in front of us. \u2047 Saucony delivered a very strong performance in Q3 with more than 40% growth over 2020 and 60% versus 2019 despite some supply chain challenges. \u2047 saucony.com was up more than 50% and nearly tripled 2019. \u2047 The brand has seen global success with all regions contributing significant growth. \u2047 Outside of the U.S. market, technical running and lifestyle performance in Europe was especially strong, up 30% versus 2020. \u2047 Our Saucony Originals lifestyle business continues to perform well, especially internationally. \u2047 Our performance in Europe continues to accelerate, while the Asia Pacific region is a big opportunity for us moving forward with the brand delivering over 60% growth in Q3. \u2047 Saucony stores and the online business are performing well in China as the brand's joint venture there continues to gain momentum. \u2047 Saucony continues to deliver a consistent flow of powerhouse performance product and trend-right lifestyle product. \u2047 This has translated to consistent robust growth for the brand over the last several quarters, and we expect this to continue into 2022. \u2047 The road running category leads the way, including the recent launches of the new Ride 14, the brand's biggest franchise shoe and Triumph 19. \u2047 Saucony's trail running business also grew by more than 40% in the quarter. \u2047 Let me shift to Merrell. \u2047 The brand continues to experience record demand and great momentum in all global channels. \u2047 During Q3, Merrell was impacted by factory closures in Vietnam, which resulted in missed revenue opportunities of at least $25 million. \u2047 Despite these challenges, Merrell still delivered mid-single-digit growth in the quarter versus 2020. \u2047 Merrell's DTC business grew mid-single-digits in the quarter with merrell.com building on its nearly doubling of the business last year. \u2047 Merrell stores also continued to outperform our expectations, a promising indicator of the strength of the brand and the consumers return to shopping in stores. \u2047 Merrell holds the number one U.S. market share position in the hike category and is the category leader in many key markets across the globe. \u2047 While Merrell continues to successfully optimize its well established and market-leading core product franchises, fresh innovative product offerings are driving brand's heat and new consumer interest. \u2047 The Moab Speed and Moab Flight collections are energizing the performance category. \u2047 These styles represent the brand vision for fast, lightweight footwear for the trail and light hiking and also build on the heritage and success of the world's number one hiker, The Moab. \u2047 This momentum is further fueled by the uptick in organic media placements that bridge both performance and lifestyle. \u2047 For example, Annie Leibovitz used the Moab Speed in the September issue of Vogue for a major photo shoot and style with the Louis Vuitton jacket and skirt. \u2047 Additionally, Merrell was featured on The Today Show during Q3, showcasing the Moab Speed, which aligns well to the brand's Step Further campaign, encouraging increased commitment to the outdoors. \u2047 Both collections have exceeded our expectations, and we are excited about the potential for new performance collections in 2022. \u2047 Merrell's Lifestyle business performed better than the brand's overall growth in Q3. \u2047 We are seeing positive results from our strategic focus on further elevating Merrell as a lifestyle brand. \u2047 Recent brand health research indicates that consumers are incorporating Merrell into their own identity at an increasingly higher degree. \u2047 These trends are manifesting in the strong performance we are seeing in lifestyle product, including the Hydro Moc and the newly launched Cloud all-day casual sneaker collection made with eco-friendly materials. \u2047 As we mentioned on our Q2 call, Merrell introduced its 1TRL capsule collection on merrell.com, which focuses on younger, fashion-forward consumers demanding authentic outdoor influenced style. \u2047 Looking ahead, Merrell possesses a substantial growth opportunity globally, particularly in EMEA, which has seen increasing momentum for several quarters, and in Asia Pacific where the China JV is just beginning to gain momentum. \u2047 Outdoor and performance trends are strong around the world, and Merrell is capitalizing on its heritage and brand positioning. \u2047 In Q3, our work business accounted for nearly 20% of total revenue and the category continued to deliver strong growth with Wolverine, the leader in the U.S. work boot category, up over 16%, Cat Footwear, up nearly 40% and with strong contributions from our smaller brands. \u2047 As Blake indicated, we expect continued strong growth in the work category as we pivot toward 2022. \u2047 Based on the performance of Merrell, Saucony, Sweaty Betty, Wolverine and our other work brands, our performance business developed growth of nearly 30% over 2019 during the third quarter. \u2047 The Sperry brand continued its steady recovery in Q3 with over 40% growth. \u2047 The brand's DTC business was up 25% driven by ongoing e-commerce growth and very good Sperry stores performance. \u2047 All product categories delivered strong double-digit increases in the quarter. \u2047 The overall boat market showed strong growth, particularly in men's, and Sperry gained significant market share growth in this key category. \u2047 From a fashion standpoint, there are clear indications that we are at the forefront of a boat shoe trend with very encouraging demand from key retailers for the first half of 2022. \u2047 I hope you all saw 007 James Bond wearing a pair of our iconic boat shoes in No Time To Die. \u2047 In the coming months, Sperry plans to build on the energy created by recent collaborations with Rowing Blazers and Netflix Outer Banks and product capsules with John Legend and Rebecca Minkoff. \u2047 The brand is also well positioned for the current seasonal women's boot business with strong demand and healthy inventory levels. \u2047 Sperry will also leverage the easy on-off trend during Q4 with the new Moc Sider and the Cozy Float collections. \u2047 In Spring '22, the brand will launch its new Sperry Sport collection through a path into macro consumer trends with more trend-right performance-based product for the water. \u2047 Looking forward, our product lines are robust across the brand portfolio and order demand continues to strengthen. \u2047 We have been flexible and responded quickly to navigate the ongoing macro supply chain challenges to service the increased demand we are seeing in nearly every brand. \u2047 We believe strong product coupled with more precise merchandising and consumer focus as well as healthier inventory positions will drive growth over the next year. \u2047 Our DTC channels remain a top priority and a source of opportunity for the business. \u2047 We have pivoted to a more dynamic e-commerce operating model to enable faster implementation of technical enhancements and new commercial capabilities, which will also help us extend improved online functionality to our global online wholesale customers. \u2047 In addition to our global DTC e-commerce business, we are seeing meaningful wholesale growth with our online retail customers. \u2047 As global economies have reopened, we have seen consumers shift a portion of their spending back to brick and mortar stores. \u2047 About 50% of our footwear is now sold online in the important U.S. market. \u2047 This bodes well for the current brand operating model that we are executing, including a more continuous product flow and best-in-class digital marketing content to benefit all channels. \u2047 We continue to look closely at our store fleet and suspect there may be favorable and profitable opportunities for us to explore as we expand our footprint in key markets starting in 2022. \u2047 I'm now going to hand it off to Mike to review the third quarter financial results and our increased 2021 outlook in more detail. \u2047 Let me start by reviewing the company's strong third quarter financial performance, and then I'll cover our revised outlook for 2021. \u2047 Third quarter revenue of approximately $637 million represents growth of over 29% compared to the prior year and includes $39 million from the recently acquired Sweaty Betty business. \u2047 On a pro forma basis, Sweaty Betty grew over 50% versus 2020. \u2047 Based on increased consumer demand experienced across the portfolio during the quarter, the company was on track to deliver just under $700 million in third quarter revenue. \u2047 But as Blake mentioned, the unprecedented factory closures and other well documented supply chain disruption impeded our ability to service this strong demand. \u2047 Despite these headwinds, Saucony and Sperry each delivered over 40% growth. \u2047 Merrell was impacted most heavily by the factory closures in Southern Vietnam, yet still delivered mid-single-digit growth. \u2047 Our work business also continued to drive meaningful growth at over 20%. \u2047 Adjusted gross margin improved 330 basis points versus the prior year to 44.6% due to the higher average selling prices, favorable product mix and the addition of Sweaty Betty for nearly two months of the quarter. \u2047 Merrell, Saucony and Sperry all well exceeded gross margin expectations in the quarter, a testament to their strong position in the marketplace and robust pipeline of relevant trend-right product. \u2047 Sweaty Betty's premium positioning, distinctive product offering and strong consumer trends are yielding robust gross margins which are accretive to our underlying business in Q3. \u2047 Total air freight costs were approximately $10 million in the quarter, of which $7 million was excluded from our adjusted results. \u2047 Including the full air freight impact, our adjusted"], "gold_summary": ["wolverine world wide sees fy21 adjusted earnings per share to be in
