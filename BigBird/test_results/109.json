{"article": ["Joining us on the call today are members of the media. \u2047 During our question-and-answer session callers will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. \u2047 I want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corporation desires to take advantage of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. \u2047 Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and COO; Mike Lenz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Brie Carere, Executive VP, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer. \u2047 And now, Raj will share his views on the quarter. \u2047 As expected, we are seeing strong levels of volume in our network given unprecedented levels of shopping and shipping this holiday season. \u2047 FedEx Ground had an outstanding Cyber Week, with 100 million packages picked up during the first official week of peak. \u2047 Our ability to handle this influx of packages has been years in the making as we have taken deliberate steps to enhance our unparalleled network to support customers, large and small. \u2047 This includes strategically adding more capacity across our network to support our growing customer base. \u2047 For example, at FedEx Ground, this means adding 14.4 million square feet to our network, the equivalent of 300 football fields since June of this year. \u2047 In Q2 alone, we brought online 24 major expansion projects, with nine of them starting operations in November just weeks before peak. \u2047 While it was important that these facilities were up and running to add to a capacity in time for peak, experience tells us that they will operate with increasing efficiency in the weeks and months ahead. \u2047 As we shared on the Q1 call, overcoming staffing and retention challenges due to the constrained labor market has been a key focus. \u2047 We continued to take bold actions in Q2 to hire and invest in our frontline team members and thus increase network efficiency. \u2047 These actions including pay premiums, increased paid time off and tuition reimbursement. \u2047 I am pleased to share that we have made considerable traction in recruiting frontline positions. \u2047 Last week, we exceeded 111,000 applications, the highest level in FedEx history. \u2047 To put this in perspective, we had 52,000 applications the week of May 8. \u2047 This has led to appropriate staffing levels of peak, including having more than 60,000 frontline team members since we last spoke in September. \u2047 We delivered strong results for the quarter with an 11% increase in adjusted operating income, which exceeded our initial expectations shared during the Q1 call. \u2047 Second quarter results include outstanding performance by our team at FedEx Express, where operating income on an as-adjusted basis exceeded $1 billion for the quarter. \u2047 The ability we have at Express to flex our cost structure and network in response to changing market conditions positions us for long-term sustained profitability. \u2047 FedEx Freight also delivered a strong quarter with an operating margin of 14.7%. \u2047 I am proud of the team as they continue to focus on revenue quality and profitable growth. \u2047 We estimate the effect of labor shortages on our Q2 results was approximately $470 million, in line with our original expectations. \u2047 And consistent with the first quarter, Ground once again, bore the majority of these costs to the tune of $285 million. \u2047 While Ground's results were negatively affected by labor challenges in the first half of the year, we are encouraged by hiring momentum as we look to the second half and are focused on retaining recently hired team members after the peak season concludes. \u2047 We know we have an excellent value proposition for employees, which we are strengthening even further with technology that enables employee-friendly, flexible schedule options, including the ability to pick up extra shifts when convenient or swap shifts with a colleague all from the convenience of an app on their phone or computer. \u2047 All of this to say we anticipate cost pressures from constrained labor markets to partially subside in the second half of the fiscal year. \u2047 Now, it's a good time to focus on what is ahead for FedEx. \u2047 The FedEx business has been built over nearly five decades. \u2047 And during that time, we have built networks and capabilities that are differentiated from our competitors and nearly impossible to replicate. \u2047 Our customers and their customers value these networks and capabilities as we enable global supply chains to stay connected. \u2047 This has never been illustrated more clearly than during the last two years of the global COVID pandemic. \u2047 Our industry has proven to be absolutely critical in delivering during this pandemic, whether it is business-to-business or e-commerce. \u2047 And within this industry, our strategy is unique. \u2047 Our future growth and profitability will be driven by our strategy and we will drive total shareholder value over the immediate mid and long-term. \u2047 There is solid momentum in our base business as we continue to lean into the dynamic growth of e-commerce amid a robust pricing environment. \u2047 In addition, we have other levers for profitable growth, including number one, increasing collaboration and efficiency to optimize our networks and businesses; number two, driving improved results in Europe and international; and number three, unlocking value by digital innovation. \u2047 Our expanded collaboration across operating companies will drive cost benefits, lower delivery and line-haul cost and better utilization of existing assets. \u2047 Said differently, we'll utilize our air and ground networks in a smarter, more calculated manner. \u2047 FedEx Freight trucks have traveled four million miles while operating on behalf of FedEx Ground this year. \u2047 FedEx Freight has also provided FedEx Ground with intermodal containers, which have already been dispatched nearly 50,000 times. \u2047 We will continue to look comprehensively at all assets in our network, including stations, hubs and equipment to put the right package in the right network at the best service for our customers. \u2047 And as I highlighted earlier, the focus on collaboration also extends to our customers as we work to make their supply chains smarter. \u2047 This includes providing integration and common data platform opportunities and planning the best way to leverage our network flexibility for their volume needs. \u2047 The second lever is continuing to improve our international profitability. \u2047 Our international business, particularly Europe, remains one of our biggest opportunities. \u2047 I was in Europe in October, and I was happy to note the excellent progress there as we build upon the success of station integration, which was completed in May 2021. \u2047 We remain on track for the completion of our air network integration in April 2022, which will complete the physical integration of TNT into FedEx Express and enable full physical interoperability of these networks. \u2047 After April 2022, Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport will serve as the main hub for all European and intercontinental flights. \u2047 Liege will connect specific large European markets and ensure we have the flexibility to scale our operations in response to market needs, thus enabling us to focus on international growth. \u2047 Brie, will share more on what this enhanced value proposition means for our customers. \u2047 Finally, we are unlocking value through digital innovation and our accelerated integration of data-driven technologies and enhanced digital capabilities ranging from increased network efficiency to customer experience improvements. \u2047 For example, early package visibility enhances visibility of third-party trailers as improving customer collaboration, information sharing and package prioritization. \u2047 Model-driven estimated delivery date uses machine learning to provide a more accurate estimated delivery day of packages to customers and recipients. \u2047 And trailer load scan automation eliminates the need for a manual scan enabling faster and more efficient loading while significantly reducing package touches. \u2047 These ongoing investments, network capacity, automation and technology, have helped FedEx build the most flexible and most responsive network in the industry, affording us significant competitive advantages. \u2047 In closing, the successful execution of our strategies continues to drive high demand for our differentiated services. \u2047 We remain confident in these strategies for the various reasons outlined. \u2047 Our unparalleled portfolio of services powered by the strength and reach of our global network positions FedEx to deliver superior, sustainable financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come. \u2047 With that, let me turn this floor over to Brie. \u2047 Q2 delivered our second consecutive quarter of 14% revenue growth, demonstrating the strong demand for our differentiated portfolio and our ability to drive revenue quality as a result. \u2047 Constrained capacity has continued to support a favorable pricing environment. \u2047 We are maintaining a brisk pace for repricing contracts, ensuring a high surcharge capture and yield improvements. \u2047 We are working with large customers to identify opportunities, to move their volume from our national network to our regional and local networks, freeing up additional capacity for small business customers. \u2047 Small businesses relied our market-leading transit times in our seven-day a week network to compete. \u2047 They cannot forward deploy inventory at the same scale as large retailers. \u2047 Our domestic yield growth was 9.1% with fuel in Q2. \u2047 Our general rate increase will take place in January and we expect a strong capture rate. \u2047 In January, the Ground Economy peak surcharge will be replaced by the new Ground Economy delivery surcharge at a $1, solidifying the price point for our Economy product. \u2047 And as a reminder, FedEx Ground Economy was formerly FedEx SmartPost. \u2047 The landscape across the industry remains robust and positions us well for continued profitable growth. \u2047 We are forecasting that the U.S. domestic parcel market will reach 134 million pieces a day by calendar year 2026, a remarkable 70% growth from 2020. \u2047 E-commerce is expected to drive 90% of the parcel market growth. \u2047 We have developed a tremendous portfolio of e-commerce solutions and we are very confident that our competitive value proposition will enable us to continue to take share smartly in the addressable e-commerce market. \u2047 As you all know, we have a diversified customer base globally as well as here in the United States. \u2047 And as such, we can confidently grow without the risk of a very large and disruptive customer negotiation. \u2047 The U.S. domestic B2B market is also expected to grow. \u2047 It will grow at a 5% CAGR through 2026. \u2047 We are growing our digital capabilities to provide a range of visibility experiences that will give our B2B customers greater clarity, confidence and control over their deliveries, especially in high-value verticals such as healthcare. \u2047 Turning now to international. \u2047 Our successful commercial and operational execution in response to COVID demonstrates our ability to grow profitably in an uncertain environment. \u2047 Demand out of Asia continues to contribute strong revenue and profit performance and our international economy embargo and peak surcharges are contributing to our yield growth there. \u2047 Q2 Express international export yield grew 12% and volume grew 7.6%, which is outstanding year-over-year growth. \u2047 International export composite yield grew to almost $54 per package, while average daily volume was more than 1.1 million. \u2047 I am very proud of the international revenue quality results, especially given that we also had double-digit e-commerce growth internationally, which, of course, puts downward pressure on our package yield. \u2047 International Priority Freight had a very strong quarter with 34% year-over-year revenue growth year-to-date. \u2047 With new variants of COVID causing uncertainty in the global recovery, we believe that air cargo capacity will remain constrained through calendar year 2022 and a full recovery is not anticipated until at least 2024. \u2047 Export demand in Europe and APAC has fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels and capacity on international lanes remains scarce. \u2047 We anticipate a continued favorable pricing environment and an embargo on our deferred services out of Asia Pacific for the foreseeable future. \u2047 We are targeting both B2B and cross-border e-commerce market share internationally. \u2047 We have identified the target lanes for B2B growth where we have shared growth opportunity, most notably in and out of and across Europe. \u2047 As Raj alluded to, with the launch of our integrated air network in April, we will dramatically enhance our capabilities within and into Europe, creating benefits for customers around the world. \u2047 More European customers will have access to next-day and pre-noon delivery times for their intra-European shipments through our expanded portfolio of services. \u2047 We will be able to offer customers an option of mid-day or end-of-day service in-bound to Europe, giving our customers around the world more choice and flexibility while giving our global sales team more opportunities to pursue. \u2047 These enhancements, along with our intra-Europe road services and industry-leading Europe to U.S. service, position us with a very competitive portfolio. \u2047 As we approach the final stages of physical integration this fiscal year, we are increasing the FedEx brand presence on the road in Europe by approximately 30%, including the rebranding of vehicles and facilities. \u2047 Additionally, intercontinental e-commerce will contribute approximately half of the growth in the parcel market over the next decade. \u2047 FedEx International Connect Plus, which launched across Europe, Asia Pacific and the United States, enables us to compete more effectively in this growing e-commerce market. \u2047 In addition to the improvements in our transportation portfolio, we are very focused on our digital solutions across the customer journey. \u2047 We have launched our new account opening application in eight countries with very great results. \u2047 We are seeing double-digit improvement in account openings and customers opting in for My FedEx Rewards, which, of course, is the only small business loyalty program in the industry. \u2047 We have also launched our new FedEx Ship Manager application in more than 100 countries. \u2047 This is the primary tool for our small business segment to ship with FedEx. \u2047 With the modern, easy-to-use interface, a small business can now create a label and get the package out the door more than a minute faster than they could previously. \u2047 We will launch this new FedEx Ship Manager in the United States in 2022. \u2047 In summary, we are very confident in our commercial strategies for revenue growth and yield improvement. \u2047 Given the historically challenging nature of peak season, along with the continued staffing challenges felt by numerous companies around the world, we are quite pleased with our second quarter consolidated financial results, with adjusted operating income up 11% year-over-year. \u2047 While adjusted earnings per share was unchanged year-over-year, this year's effective tax rate was significantly higher as last year's earnings included a $0.71 per share discrete tax benefit from favorable guidance issued by the IRS. \u2047 As we anticipated, most of the headwinds we experienced in the first quarter persisted through the second quarter, which dampened our Q2 profitability by an estimated $770 million. \u2047 To further unpack our second quarter results, I will highlight several key drivers. \u2047 The difficult labor market once again had the largest effect on our bottom line, representing an estimated $470 million in additional year-over-year costs. \u2047 As I did last quarter, I'll separate the effect of the labor market into two components; higher rates and network inefficiencies resulting from labor shortages. \u2047 Of the $470 million, we estimate $230 million was incurred in higher wage and purchase transportation rates. \u2047 This included higher wage rates and paid premiums for team members and higher rates paid for third-party transportation services. \u2047 We estimate network ineffic"], "gold_summary": ["new $5 billion share repurchase program authorized, including $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.  \u2047  sees fy capital spending of $7.2
