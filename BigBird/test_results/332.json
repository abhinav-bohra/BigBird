{"article": ["On the call today are Donnie King, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stewart Glendinning, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 As many of you know, I've been a Tyson team member for close to four decades. \u2047 And in that time, I've led every business segment. \u2047 We've always believed in our mission and the vision of John W. Tyson, who founded this Company nearly a century ago because he wanted to find a better way to feed a growing country. \u2047 Today, on my first earnings call as CEO, I am incredibly proud to stand alongside our team members to continue that legacy. \u2047 It's an interesting time to be in this industry and we have a leadership team that together can capitalize on the strengths of this Company and the opportunities ahead. \u2047 Let's begin with the view of our overall performance this quarter. \u2047 First, our retail performance. \u2047 12 consecutive quarters of retail share gains in our core business lines is driven by strength of our brands, along with solid execution from our team. \u2047 We are in a market that has demonstrated strong demand for protein and people are reaching most for brands they trust. \u2047 Our $1 billion brands Tyson, Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farms have driven strong share growth with consumers buying more than ever before. \u2047 Second, we saw in the third quarter growing volume in foodservice channel, as reopening and recovery continue. \u2047 We saw an uptick from outlets nationwide reflected in our sales, which we were up $1.3 billion for the quarter. \u2047 Our broad production and distribution network is well positioned to meet this growing demand. \u2047 Third, the diversity of our portfolio demonstrated its value during the quarter, led by Beef, we delivered an exceptional result as the strong US and export demand, coupled with ample cattle supply, supported elevated margins in that business. \u2047 Fourth, we continue to build financial strength. \u2047 This quarter, we used higher operating cash flow to reduce debt. \u2047 The steps we've taken positioned us with a very strong balance sheet and high levels of liquidity. \u2047 And finally, we are investing in future growth across our portfolio. \u2047 We're in the process of bringing 12 new plants online globally to address capacity constraints and growing demand. \u2047 In all, Tyson delivered a strong quarter. \u2047 As we look to the future, we want to build on these strengths. \u2047 Let's look at how we plan to do that. \u2047 First, we have built a solid footing to drive consistent results. \u2047 Our strength include a diverse portfolio, well-known trusted brand, scale in meaningful markets and an exceptionally strong balance sheet. \u2047 Second, labor is our number one challenge. \u2047 So, we have continued our focus on improving our team member experience, without compromising their health and safety. \u2047 We are accelerating efforts to make Tyson the most sought-after place to work because we know how important team members are to our business. \u2047 One of the way that we're doing this is to accelerate our investments in automation and technology. \u2047 This not only helps us to eliminate more difficult, hard-to-fill task, but also reskill our labor profile to enable their contribution to more value-added activities. \u2047 Third, we are actively working to recover volume from pandemic lows. \u2047 And in doing so, improve the reliability we offer our customers. \u2047 Dynamic and evolving channel demand continues to create operational complexities. \u2047 We took steps earlier this year to make our organization more responsive to demand signals and to accelerate our speed to market by getting our sales teams closer to their customers. \u2047 There is more to do, however, and so our work here continues. \u2047 Fourth, our focus on operational excellence and disciplined cost management is especially important during periods of continued market volatility and increasing inflationary pressures. \u2047 As you will hear today, we continue to be laser focused in making progress in restoring the competitiveness of our Chicken segment. \u2047 We are also accelerating actions across our enterprise to become more operationally excellent. \u2047 Finally, we will continue to optimize our balance sheet, which will give us optionality as we prioritize the delivery of shareholder value. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5. \u2047 We improved our sales and earnings performance this quarter. \u2047 The results demonstrate the benefit of our multi-protein, multi-channel portfolio. \u2047 Sales improved 25% in third quarter and 8% year-to-date, reflecting improved volumes, which were up 10% for the quarter and flat year-to-date. \u2047 It also reflects effective pricing strategies in all of our segments during this inflationary environment. \u2047 We delivered strong operating earnings performance, resulting in approximately $1.4 billion in operating income for the quarter. \u2047 This represents an 81% increase compared to prior year and translates to $2.70 in earnings per share. \u2047 Our earnings reflect our three key priorities: one, to be the go-to supplier for customers and consumers; two, to be the most sought-after place to work; and three, to be operationally excellent. \u2047 We want to be the most sought-after place to work. \u2047 This starts with an unrelenting focus on safety, every minute, every shift, every day. \u2047 Health and safety have been and will continue to be our top priority. \u2047 We have a history of using all the tools at our disposal to protect our team members and the vaccine is no different. \u2047 As many of you will have seen, last week we announced that Tyson will require COVID-19 vaccinations for our entire US workforce by November 1. \u2047 We do this now because the Delta variant is more contagious and getting vaccinated is the single most effective thing people can do to protect themselves, their families and their communities. \u2047 We have raised wages in many markets to ensure we're competitive and are exploring other ways to make Tyson the most sought-after a place to work in the communities where we operate. \u2047 For example, we are piloting child care facilities at some of our plants and we have opened medical clinics to make healthcare more accessible to team members and their families. \u2047 Finally, we are accelerating investments in automation and advanced technologies to make team members' jobs easier. \u2047 We look forward to providing more detail on automation and technology roadmap at our upcoming Investor Day. \u2047 We're taking aggressive actions to add new capacity to meet demand, adjust our product mix by plant, and match our portfolio more closely with customer and consumer needs. \u2047 We're listening to our customers and are committed to improving reliability of supply. \u2047 In the third quarter, we improved volume levels across all segments. \u2047 In Prepared Foods, we continue to optimize our product portfolio, remove processing and supply chain complexity and prioritize products with the highest demand resulting in lower cost and better service to our customers. \u2047 In Beef, ample cattle supply, heavier animal weights, and strong demand have driven volumes higher year-to-date. \u2047 In Pork, our volumes are up year-to-date versus pandemic lows. \u2047 We are pleased to have additional capacity coming online at Eagle Mountain in Utah and Columbia, South Carolina, both facilities are expected to grow our pre-packaged Beef and Pork products. \u2047 In Chicken, volume declined year-to-date despite improved foodservice demand led by QSRs. \u2047 We also saw sustained retail demand, including the frozen value-added poultry category, limited capacity and persistent labor challenges have impacted customer fill rates in this segment. \u2047 However, our new plant in Humboldt, Tennessee continues to ramp-up production, including harvest capacity. \u2047 This ramp-up is helping us improve customer fill rates. \u2047 Chicken remains a top priority for me and for our Company. \u2047 We continue to execute against our roadmap to bring operating income margin to at least the 5% to 7% range by mid-fiscal 2022. \u2047 Our goal has not changed and we remain committed to restoring top-tier performance. \u2047 We are making progress. \u2047 The first imperative is to be the most sought-after a place to work. \u2047 I've outlined the investments we're making to enhance our team member experience in my earlier comments. \u2047 The second imperative is to improve operational performance. \u2047 Last quarter, we highlighted the impact of lower hatch rates on our Chicken operations. \u2047 We have begun to deploy new male parent stock, where this stock has been deployed, hatch rates are improving. \u2047 We expect a full rollout of this breeder stock to be complete this fall with harvest capacity improvements occurring by mid-fiscal 2022. \u2047 Our rate of outside meat purchases has declined 25% versus last quarter and will continue to decline as hatch rates and utilization improve. \u2047 We have identified opportunities to reduce mix complexity across our Chicken footprint, which will help us operate more efficiently. \u2047 The final imperative is to service our customers on time and in full. \u2047 We're pleased by the continued share performance of our value-added products like Tyson Chicken Nuggets, Crispy Strips and Air Fried. \u2047 We gained share during the third quarter and the last 52 weeks. \u2047 Looking ahead, we expect further growth and as a result, we're investing in line upgrades and increased capacity drive branded product growth. \u2047 We have increased prices to help offset significant raw material and supply chain cost inflation. \u2047 Pricings improved nearly 16% in the quarter versus the comparable period last year. \u2047 We will staff our plants, service our customers, grow our business and be the best Chicken Company, period. \u2047 Part of being customer-centric means being as efficient as possible and taking cost out where you can, without compromising our ability to execute against our strategic and operational priorities. \u2047 We have ongoing efforts across the business to reduce costs. \u2047 But we must also find new innovative ways to be better and stronger. \u2047 This means investing in advances like automation and artificial intelligence to deliver productivity gains and competitive advantage. \u2047 We have already delivered strong productivity gains in fiscal year 2021. \u2047 Across our business, we are looking to build upon the strength of those actions in the months and years to come, which we will detail at the Investor Day later this year. \u2047 These improvements come at a time when we are investing heavily in capacity expansions across segments to better partner with our customers and meet long-term demand. \u2047 Let me turn first to summary of our total Company financial results. \u2047 Sales were up approximately 25% in the third quarter. \u2047 Volumes were up 9.7%, primarily due to strength in retail and the ongoing foodservice recovery. \u2047 Average sales price was also up about 17%, largely due to strong results in our Beef segment, the mix benefit from retail volume and the partial recovery of raw material inflation in net sales price. \u2047 Operating income was up 81% in the third quarter due to continued strong performance in our Beef business. \u2047 Chicken and Prepared Foods also improved their respective segment earnings, while Pork earnings were down versus the comparable period a year ago. \u2047 Year-to-date, operating income for the total Company improved by 49%. \u2047 Earnings per share grew 93% in the third quarter due largely to strength in operating income, specifically within our Beef segment. \u2047 EPS was up 61% on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 We performed well despite a challenging operating environment that span tough labor availability, significant inflationary pressures on raw material costs, global supply chain challenges and an evolving demand backdrop. \u2047 Slide 11 bridges our total Company sales on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 We delivered growth in the retail channel along all reporting segments, which in aggregate accounted for more than $1 billion in sales improvement over the year-to-date period and more than $300 million in the third quarter versus the respective comparable periods. \u2047 Moving to foodservice, sales improved by approximately $1.3 billion in the third quarter, leading to a year-to-date improvement for the channel of nearly $1 billion compared to the same period last year. \u2047 Exports were up over 18% versus the comparable period, led by Beef, where sales improved by more than $350 million on a year-to-date basis. \u2047 Asia has been a key driver of Beef export strength. \u2047 We've also seen some strength in industrial, particularly in Beef and Pork. \u2047 And finally, year-to-date sales grew $79 million or approximately 6% in our international business. \u2047 This business is a growth priority for Tyson and we continue to invest to develop further capacities and capabilities in new markets to meet growing global consumer demand for protein products. \u2047 Current capacity expansions across seven international locations are expected to dramatically increase our fully cooked production capabilities. \u2047 These investments are fully aligned to our strategic growth priorities and when complete, will enhance our international processing capacity by close to 30% versus fiscal 2020. \u2047 Overall, we're pleased with the Company's top line growth year-to-date. \u2047 We are carefully managing the current inflationary pressures through pricing actions, as well as commercial and operational excellence, with emphasis on productivity and cost. \u2047 We know that our price recovery efforts relative to inflation must be matched by equal aggressiveness on productivity. \u2047 Slide 12 bridges year-to-date operating income. \u2047 Production inefficiencies and low labor availability resulted in total Company volumes roughly flat to the comparable period a year ago. \u2047 However, we are encouraged by the volume improvement we are seeing across our segments in the third quarter. \u2047 Price mix benefited substantially in the year-to-date period from price recovery of raw material cost inflation, improved mix, strong Beef segment performance and continued retail strength across segments. \u2047 Operating income was partially offset by $2.2 billion and increased cost of goods sold for the period, reflecting meaningful inflation in raw material and supply chain costs. \u2047 Feed ingredients, labor, packaging and freight are all key components of this COGS increase, which we're working to mitigate. \u2047 On a comparative basis, SG&A benefited from the $56 million loss in the year-to-date fiscal 2020 period as compared to a $55 million gain in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 associated with the cattle supplier incident. \u2047 This was in addition to certain reductions in trade spend and travel costs. \u2047 Moving into the Chicken segments' results. \u2047 Sales were $3.5 billion for the third quarter, up 12%. \u2047 Volumes were also up in the quarter due to continued strength in retail, improving demand through foodservice and segmentwide operational improvements. \u2047 These were partially offset by COVID-related production inefficiencies. \u2047 Average sales price was up 15% in the quarter due to favorable mix, sustained retail volume and strong supply and demand fundamentals. \u2047 Our reported price improvement also reflects actions we took to cover the inflationary pressure seen from higher grain, labor and freight costs. \u2047 Our conversations with customers on widespread inflationary pressures have been productive. \u2047 And we'll continue to partner with customers to ensure we receive a fair return on our products while working to deliver service levels and fill rates that meet or exceed their expectations. \u2047 Operating income was $27 million in the third quarter and $137 million on a fiscal year-to-date basis, both stronger than comparable periods a year ago. \u2047 This represents an operating margin of 1.3% year-to-"], "gold_summary": ["tyson foods - q3
