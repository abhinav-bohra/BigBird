{"article": ["I'm Rebecca Gardy, Vice President of Investor Relations. \u2047 A transcript of this earnings conference call will be available within 24 hours at investor. \u2047 These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. \u2047 On Slide 4, you will see today's agenda. \u2047 With us on the call today are Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and CEO and Chief Financial Officer, Mick Beekhuizen. \u2047 Mark will share his overall thoughts on our third quarter performance and our end market performance by division. \u2047 Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and review our guidance for the full year fiscal 2021. \u2047 Mark will then make some closing remarks before moving to an analyst Q&A. \u2047 Throughout the last year, we rallied through the pandemic and made decisions focused on prioritizing the safety and well-being of our employees while meeting the needs of our customers and consumers. \u2047 This approach has served us well over the past 15 months as we progressed our strategy in a volatile operating environment. \u2047 Our team pulled together, we executed with excellence, and we delivered strong results. \u2047 However, you will also have seen the continued strength in-market on market shares underpinned by healthy retention of new and younger households and the full recovery of distribution levels. \u2047 We did face a significant inflationary environment in the quarter as well as shorter-term increases in supply chain costs. \u2047 We anticipated the vast majority of these drivers, but in certain areas, the pressures intensified especially around inflation and some of the transitional costs moving out of the COVID-19 environment. \u2047 We are confident that we can address these issues and we have plans and pricing already in place as we exit the fiscal year and enter fiscal 2022. \u2047 Our confidence is further strengthened by our continued in-market momentum and the structural health of our business and brands. \u2047 I will first review our results and then share the context and actions we are taking to address these challenges and the improving trajectory we expect for the rest of the year as we head into fiscal 2022. \u2047 As we outlined during our second quarter earnings call, we expected this would be a challenging quarter and we recognize that there would be headwinds as we lap the peak of COVID-19 demand, manage the volatility of current market dynamics, and continue to navigate our own transformation agenda. \u2047 We delivered sales of $1.98 billion, in line with our expectations as we cycled a 17% organic growth comparison to a year ago. \u2047 Our sales results benefited from the continued momentum of our Snacks power brands and our U.S. retail products in our Meals & Beverage division as well as the early signs of recovery from our foodservice business. \u2047 Importantly, our brands remain strong with nearly three-quarters of our portfolio gaining or holding share in the quarter. \u2047 In our core categories, most of our brands grew at higher rates than pre-pandemic levels and our brand consumption on a two-year comparison grew 9%. \u2047 These results were driven by our decision to invest in supply and service while preserving brand investments with advertising and consumer promotion expense as a percentage of net sales comparable to last year. \u2047 Looking ahead, we expect organic sales in the fourth quarter to decline versus last year as the COVID-19 lap continues. \u2047 We do expect a sequential improvement from the third quarter as the comparison to prior year eases a bit and our foodservice business continues to recover. \u2047 From a margin perspective, our decline versus prior year excluding the net benefit from mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding commodity hedges stemmed from certain headwinds, which are grouped into three main bucket. \u2047 First, external factors were larger than we had anticipated. \u2047 We, like others, face pronounced inflation related primarily to steeply higher transportation costs, some of which was an outcome from the strain of the Texas winter storms on supply chain logistics and the closure of our Paris, Texas facility for two weeks. \u2047 These factors partially offset by our productivity improvements reflect about a third of the gross margin erosion in the third quarter and will continue into fiscal 2022. \u2047 We currently expect the benefit from pricing actions we have put in place across our portfolio and our strong productivity plans to mitigate this inflation pressure in fiscal 2022 while we remain vigilant monitoring the ongoing dynamic nature of the current environment. \u2047 The second bucket I would characterize as transitional items that we are working our way through as we move out of the COVID-19 environment and fully recover on supply. \u2047 This includes areas like lower fixed cost leverage as we lap the year ago elevated levels of demand, sustain labor challenges and added investment in higher cost co-manufacturers to recover fully on supply. \u2047 We had factored these pressures into our plans, but in some cases, they were more significant than anticipated as either the time to recover or the magnitude of the impact were greater than expected. \u2047 These transitional costs reflect about half of our gross margin erosion in the quarter and while we expect the impact of these costs to moderate into the fourth quarter, they will continue to add pressure as we fully cycle the COVID-19 environment. \u2047 The third bucket is execution related to the high degree of transformation we have under way in our Snacks division. \u2047 Throughout my time at Campbell, we have taken significant steps to improve our execution as we have steadily advanced our agenda. \u2047 However, this quarter, the convergence of multiple transformation efforts including systems, logistics, and capacity all put additional executional pressure on the business in a tough third quarter environment. \u2047 We have already taken decisive actions to allocate more resources and better phase projects to address these issues. \u2047 We do not expect these elements will have a material impact on the fourth quarter and more importantly, they do not alter our long-term expectations for the Snacks margin expansion opportunity we highlighted last quarter and will share in greater detail during our Investor Day later this year. \u2047 Although all of these headwinds put pressure on our near-end performance, they do not represent structural issues and we remain confident in our strategic plans. \u2047 As a result of the third quarter pressures on margin, adjusted earnings per share came in lower than we expected at $0.57. \u2047 As Mick will discuss in more depth, we are updating our guidance accordingly. \u2047 Turning to our division performance, let me begin with Meals & Beverages. \u2047 Our net sales decline of 14% and in-market performance of minus 24% in the third quarter reflect lapping the historically high consumption levels that we experienced during the onset of the pandemic last year. \u2047 On a two-year basis, we had net sales momentum in key categories with share gains over prior year in condensed soups, ready-to-serve soups, Swanson broth, Prego, and Pacific Foods. \u2047 Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we delivered strong consumption growth of 9% against organic net sales growth of 3% with the gap driven by our foodservice business, which continued to recover as governments gradually eased on-site dining restrictions in some markets. \u2047 Overall, as we have invested in our service levels, they are stabilizing and we are now in a better position on supply across the division. \u2047 We have restored the shelf in the majority of our categories and our share of total points of distribution is consistent with pre-COVID-19 levels across U.S. soup, Prego, and V8 beverages. \u2047 In-market consumption for soup was strong versus two years ago growing at 9% and gaining dollar share. \u2047 We delivered record share growth in U.S. soup of nearly 2 points driven by condensed soups, Swanson broth, Chunky, and Pacific Foods. \u2047 We also made significant progress on the retention of new households since the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 Soup gained dollar share in all three categories with millennials driving strong growth in condensed cooking, broth, and ready-to-serve soup. \u2047 We are confident that the brand investments made are working as buyers and buy rate remain elevated compared to pre-COVID-19 levels. \u2047 We continue to be encouraged by the sustainment of quick scratch cooking behaviors and in-home eating occasions even as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. \u2047 In fact, condensed delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of dollar share gains growing share nearly 3 points. \u2047 Notably with millennial consumers, condensed grew share by nearly 4 points. \u2047 Within ready-to-serve, Chunky delivered double-digit in-market consumption growth on a two-year basis. \u2047 Pacific Foods continued to be a powerful growth engine within our soup portfolio with in-market consumption growth of nearly 30% on a two-year basis and continued share gains versus prior year, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of share improvement. \u2047 On Swanson broth, as we invested to restore distribution and service, we increased share by nearly 2 points versus prior year. \u2047 On a two-year basis, we grew household penetration by more than a point and saw higher repeat rates on our brand. \u2047 Prego delivered its 24th consecutive month with the Number 1 share position in the Italian sauce category and achieved its strongest share gain in over three years. \u2047 Compared to pre-pandemic levels, we are seeing strong repeat rates and buyer retention on this brand as well as strong resonance with millennial consumers. \u2047 Overall, the Meals & Beverages division delivered a strong in-market quarter against difficult comparisons with share gains in key categories especially among younger consumers, TPD[Phonetic] gains and improved service levels continuing to support our confidence that it will emerge from the pandemic in a stronger position. \u2047 Let's now turn to Snacks where our power brands continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 14% on a two-year basis despite being down 5% year-over-year. \u2047 On a two-year basis, total Snacks consumption grew 10% against organic net sales growth of 3% with the gap driven by the decline in our partner brands and continued pressure in the convenience channels. \u2047 We grew share on many of our power brands over prior year and repeat rates on seven of nine power brands are ahead of pre-COVID-19 levels. \u2047 We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of share growth on Late July Snacks, Kettle Brand potato chips, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps, and Lance sandwich crackers. \u2047 On a two-year comparison within the power brands, our salty snack brands grew in-market consumption nearly 20% and increased household penetration across the majority of these brands. \u2047 Our Pepperidge Farm Farmhouse products also continued to deliver exceptional results with in-market consumption growth of 9% on top of the prior year increase. \u2047 Turning to Goldfish, we returned to share growth, increasing by more than 1 point compared to prior year. \u2047 This was in part due to an improved performance on multi-packs, continued momentum on Flavor Blasted Goldfish, and new broadened digital activation. \u2047 We also exited the quarter with early momentum from the launch of limited edition Frank's RedHot Goldfish. \u2047 Turning to Slide 12, as Mark just shared, our third quarter results were impacted by last year's demand surge related to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the gross margin impact due to pronounced inflation, our transition out of the COVID-19 environment, and some executional pressure as we continued to advance our transformation agenda primarily in our Snacks division. \u2047 During the quarter, organic net sales declined 12% and adjusted EBIT decreased 27% driven by lower sales volume and a lower adjusted gross margin partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased 31% to $0.57 per share primarily reflecting the decrease in adjusted EBIT. \u2047 Year-to-date, our organic net sales increased 1% driven by lower promotional spending in both divisions. \u2047 Meals & Beverages increased 1% mainly driven by growth in U.S. soup and V8 beverage offset by declines in foodservice. \u2047 In Snacks, organic net sales were flat as declines in Lance sandwich crackers and in partner brands within the Snyder's-Lance portfolio were offset by gains in our salty snacks portfolio and our fresh bakery products. \u2047 Year-to-date adjusted EBIT of $1.14 billion was comparable to prior year as a lower adjusted gross margin and increased adjusted administrative expenses were offset by lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses, higher adjusted other income and sales volume gains. \u2047 Within marketing and selling expenses, lower selling and other marketing costs were partially offset by a 3% increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense or A&C. \u2047 Year-to-date, our adjusted EBIT margin was 17.2% compared to 17.3% in the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% to $2.43 per share primarily reflecting lower adjusted net interest expense. \u2047 I'll review in the next couple of slides our third quarter results in more detail and provide revised guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2021 reflecting these results and our expectation for sustained inflationary pressures through the remainder of the year. \u2047 Our organic net sales decreased 12% during the quarter lapping the prior year organic net sales increase of 17% when the demand for at-home consumption surged at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, organic net sales grew 3%. \u2047 Our adjusted gross margin decreased by 290 basis points in the third quarter from 34.7% to 31.8%. \u2047 On the slide, you'll see the various items bridging the year-over-year change in our overall gross margin. \u2047 Now let me tie it back to Mark's earlier comments, which excludes the 250 basis points net benefit from mark-to-market adjustments on outstanding commodity hedges included in inflation and other in the bridge. \u2047 First, external factors led to about one-third of the year-over-year decrease in margin. \u2047 These external factors included approximately 290 basis points of inflation and some temporary disruption from the Texas storm back in February, both reflected in inflation and other in the bridge. \u2047 Cost inflation was approximately 4% on a rate basis, which was higher than anticipated largely driven by freight rates. \u2047 Partially offsetting these headwinds was our ongoing supply chain productivity program, which contributed 150 basis points to gross margin and included initiatives among others within procurement and logistics optimization. \u2047 Second, headwinds related to our transition into the post COVID-19 operating environment represented about half of the gross margin decline as we transitioned from last year's demand surge, mix, and operating leverage. \u2047 Each had an approximate 110 basis point negative impact on gross margin in the third quarter. \u2047 Net pricing drove a positive 30 basis point improvement. \u2047 The remainder were incremental other supply chain costs within inflation and other such as increased costs associated with co-manufacturing to support supply and distribution recovery. \u2047 Third, executional challenges, which represented the remainder of the decline were mostly incremental other supply chain costs within inflation and other. \u2047 These costs were mainly related"], "gold_summary": ["compname says q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.57 from continuing operations excluding items.
