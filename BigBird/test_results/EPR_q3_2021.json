{"article": ["This is Michael Haack. \u2047 Let me start today by acknowledging that we had another solid quarter of increasing earnings, and while shaping up to be an exceptional fiscal year for Eagle Materials. \u2047 Our results reflect that we are entering into a cyclical phase for our businesses, where the demand for all of our products are strong. \u2047 There are two overreaching reasons for this. \u2047 One relates to market conditions, which are on an improving trajectory in most respects. \u2047 The second relates to Eagle's high-performing, well thought geographically advantaged operations that can take advantage of these market opportunities. \u2047 Let me start with some foundational comments about market conditions. \u2047 Housing construction is an important driver for both sides of our business, and single-family starts are especially important for Gypsum Wallboard. \u2047 There are positive short-term, mid-term, and long-term dimensions to the robust housing-related demand for our materials. \u2047 As for the short term, Wallboard is installed on walls and ceilings in the later phase of the building construction process after framing has occurred. \u2047 This means that the recent increase in starts and permits will have the greatest impact in the months ahead. \u2047 Pandemic has resulted in a surge in home buying, and that demand that has been swelling over more than a decade of under-building is now being realized. \u2047 What is more remarkable is, even with the improved rate of home construction, we as a nation, still do not have a balanced supply and demand picture for housing. \u2047 Home inventories on the market remain at all time lows. \u2047 We believe the annual housing supply demand imbalance is unlikely to be rectified by new construction before 2022. \u2047 This is in part due to the pace of what is possible for homebuilders to get into production. \u2047 This supply demand pressure will challenge housing affordability, but given the Fed's commitment to keep interest rates low for an extended period, this should translate into a multi-year construct -- a continuation of favorable mortgage rates environment. \u2047 Another important end-use segment for us is repair and remodeling. \u2047 Research shows that purchasers of existing homes spend money on remodeling materials in the wake of their home purchase, to make the home their own and more fully conform to their needs and tastes. \u2047 Longer-term trends also favor our geographic positioning. \u2047 The exodus from states such as California, New York, and New Jersey to states in the Sunbelt, from Carolina to Arizona and in the U.S. Heartland, including Texas and Colorado, is expected to continue. \u2047 This migration aligns well with our network of facilities within Eagle Materials. \u2047 We have the in-place capacity to flex with the demand growth for Wallboard without additional capital investment. \u2047 We expect to benefit from higher volumes, higher margins, and restrain cost due to our ownership positions in adjusting[Phonetic] raw materials and paper. \u2047 Now let me turn to the market outlook, as it relates to the Heavy side. \u2047 Infrastructure spend drives about half the U.S. cement demand, with residential being the next most important driver. \u2047 State budgets have been the lion's share of infrastructure spend for many years. \u2047 We do not want to minimize the pressure that some state budgets are experiencing. \u2047 But our analysis of the sources of state revenue, including sales taxes, property taxes, income taxes, and corporate taxes suggest to us that many states and cities would not be as severely affected as some might fear. \u2047 This is especially relevant for many of the states in which we operate. \u2047 What our analysis shows is that income and sales tax which account for more than half of the state and the local revenues fell in calendar Q2, but states developed pre-COVID levels in Q3. \u2047 The states still have choices on what to do with this money. \u2047 But we maintain our expectation that even without federal support to states and cities, trend demand for cement will be sustained in low single-digits across much of our footprint. \u2047 Of course, state DOT's could receive further federal support with the new administration, and this would provide an uplift to infrastructure construction activity. \u2047 To be clear, that activity, that multi-year federal funding bills generate generally takes years to materialize, hence demand for our products. \u2047 Non-residential is the smallest end-use segment for Heavy, and we continue to see short-term pressure. \u2047 Non-residential construction continues to be depressed by the potential dangers posed by many indoor activities. \u2047 The pipeline for office projects has been significantly and involves a very geographic-dependent. \u2047 Spending on manufacturing buildings is beginning to see some improvement, and warehouse construction trends to be strong in many of our geographies. \u2047 Now let me address the second factor mentioned, which is the high-performing low-cost network of plants we have created to take advantage of the market opportunities that are presenting themselves to us. \u2047 Opportunities which we do see[Phonetic] in our view should continue for some time. \u2047 The only limitations in our ability to capture these opportunities are in cement. \u2047 We are operating at very high levels of capacity utilization today, and we are facing a tightening cycle that would challenge our resourcefulness to squeeze out every bit of production through optimization of grinding, seasonal storage, and market selection. \u2047 Whereas in Wallboard, we have headroom for earnings expansion through volume and price growth. \u2047 Going forward, we expect price will be the most important earnings growth lever for us in cement. \u2047 Against this positive backdrop, uncertainties abound. \u2047 The most important of these relate to the pandemic and getting it under control. \u2047 Because of this, I do not have an update today on timing for the spin, and I won't until there are some increased visibility that we are past the potentially more disruptive effects of this pandemic. \u2047 We are hopeful that vaccines will be a game changer. \u2047 The optimist and we believe that risks for the business talk to the upside, and that the best is yet to come. \u2047 Eagle's third quarter revenue was $405 million, an increase of 18% from the prior year. \u2047 This increase primarily reflects contribution from the Kosmos Cement business we acquired in March. \u2047 And adjusting for the acquisition in the sale of our Northern California Concrete and Aggregates business, organic revenue improved 7%, reflecting increased cement and Wallboard sales volume and price. \u2047 Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.94, an improvement of 87%. \u2047 Excluding the non-routine charge, third quarter earnings per share increased 28%. \u2047 Turning now to segment performance, let's look at Heavy Materials results for the quarter highlighted on the next page. \u2047 The Heavy Materials sector includes our Cement, Concrete, and Aggregates segments. \u2047 Revenue in this sector increased 21%, driven primarily by the contribution from the Kosmos Cement business. \u2047 Organic cement sales prices improved 4%, and sales volume was flat with our facilities continuing to operate at very high utilization rates. \u2047 Operating revenues increased 31%, again reflecting the addition of the Kosmos Cement business. \u2047 And organic operating earnings increased 8%, reflecting primarily higher net cement sales prices. \u2047 Our Concrete and Aggregates business continued to benefit from higher organic sales volume and lower diesel fuel costs, with the margins improving significantly from the prior year. \u2047 Moving to the Light Materials sector on the next slide. \u2047 Third quarter revenue in our Wallboard and Paperboard business was up 8%, reflecting record third quarter Wallboard sales volume and a 1% increase in Wallboard sales prices. \u2047 For a perspective, the December average price was[Indecipherable] per thousand square feet versus the quarterly average of $148. \u2047 Quarterly operating earnings in the sector increased 1% to $48 million, reflecting the increased Wallboard sales volume and prices, partially offset by higher input costs, namely recycled fiber costs. \u2047 Looking now on our cash flow, which remained strong. \u2047 During the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow increased 69%, reflect the earnings growth, disciplined working capital management, and the receipt of our IRS refund. \u2047 Capital spending declined to $46 million. \u2047 Finally, a look at our capital structure. \u2047 During the quarter, we continued to prioritize debt reduction as a primary use of cash, providing us significant financial flexibility in the light of pandemic-related uncertainties and potential opportunities. \u2047 At December 31, 2020, our net debt-to-cap ratio was 41%, down from 60% at the end of our fiscal year. \u2047 And our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio was well below 2 times. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $143 million of cash on hand, and total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $888 million, and we have no near-term debt maturities. \u2047 We'll now move to the question-and-answer session. \u2047 "],
