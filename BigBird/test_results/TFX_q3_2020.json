{"article": ["We hope you and your families are continuing to stay safe and well. \u2047 Before we get started, I want to let you know that we're making some changes to how we present our results. \u2047 Today, Linda will start by providing some overall key takeaways for the year. \u2047 Next, I'll follow up with some highlights from each of our segments. \u2047 Kevin will then address our financial results as well as our outlook for fiscal year '22. \u2047 And finally, Linda will return to offer her perspective, and we'll close with Q&A. \u2047 Now a few reminders before we go into results. \u2047 These statements are based on management's current expectations but may differ from actual results or outcomes. \u2047 In addition, we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Fiscal '21 was an extraordinary year for Clorox, with the pandemic putting us through the ultimate test of volatility, including rapid changes in consumer demand and significant cost inflation, which was reflected in our Q4 results. \u2047 Despite the complexities we faced, we delivered 9% sales growth for the fiscal year on a reported and organic basis, reflecting growth in all four reportable segments. \u2047 This was on top of the reported 8% increase we delivered in fiscal '20. \u2047 On a two-year stack basis, we delivered 17% sales growth. \u2047 With rising cost pressures, we experienced declines in gross margin, particularly in Q4, resulting in a decrease of 200 basis points for the fiscal year, which we will discuss in more detail. \u2047 Fiscal year '21 adjusted earnings per share decreased 2% to $7.25. \u2047 Recognizing the immediate priorities before us, I would like to reinforce what matters most: long-term profitable growth. \u2047 With a business that's significantly larger than before the pandemic and a portfolio of trusted brands exposed to more tailwinds, we have clarity in our strategic imperatives, and I have every confidence in our ability to continue delivering long-term value creation for our shareholders. \u2047 When I look at fiscal '21, our performance has shown the strength of our people, brands and products as well as the resilience of our category as we work tirelessly to supply consumers with products across our portfolio. \u2047 As a result, we experienced significant growth in demand and strengthened our position among global consumers, with strong household penetration, supported by higher repeat rates across new and existing users. \u2047 The last 12 months have also demonstrated the need to accelerate our IGNITE Strategy to address near-term headwinds and capitalize on long-term opportunities. \u2047 The industry environment remains dynamic, with significant inflationary pressure and continuing uncertainty. \u2047 In the face of these conditions, our top priority is strong execution to mitigate the impact of elevated cost headwinds and continue to improve market share. \u2047 The pandemic has also highlighted areas where additional investments can help us be as agile as possible in the future. \u2047 We are clear on the opportunities ahead of us to differentiate Clorox and build a stronger, more resilient and more profitable company. \u2047 This includes driving our growth runways and making investments to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, which I will discuss shortly. \u2047 We are confident that strong execution of our IGNITE Strategy will enable us to achieve our 3% to 5% long-term sales target and deliver long-term shareholder value. \u2047 For Q4, faster-than-expected moderating demand for cleaning and disinfecting products had a pronounced impact on sales growth as we moved through the peak of the pandemic and lapped the unprecedented demand we experienced last year. \u2047 The magnitude of this quarter's gross margin contraction was a result of faster-than-expected sales moderation, acceleration of inflationary headwinds and improvements in supply, which led to broader product assortment, including the reintroduction of value packs. \u2047 I'll discuss shortly the actions we're taking to address these headwinds. \u2047 Now let me share a few highlights of our progress on our IGNITE Strategy. \u2047 First, with fuel growth being a critical focus to help address elevated cost pressures and ensure the long-term health of our brands, I'm pleased we delivered over $120 million in cost savings in the fiscal year, surpassing our annual target. \u2047 Second, we made strong progress on our 2025 goal to know 100 million people, crossing the halfway mark to our goal this fiscal year. \u2047 Our higher investment in personalization has led to significantly improved ROI. \u2047 It has been one of the contributors to increasingly strong payouts, driving our confidence in continued investments in our brands. \u2047 Third, with innovation at the heart of our strategy, we doubled our innovation investments in fiscal '21, and new products were a bigger contributor to our top line, which we expect to continue in fiscal '22. \u2047 Next, as consumers have increased their digital usage during the pandemic, we leaned into digital marketing and commerce, resulting in our e-commerce business nearly doubling in the last two years, which today represents about 13% of total company sales. \u2047 Finally, we continue to make progress on our ESG goals. \u2047 For example, we advanced our commitment to climate action and submitted our proposal on science-based targets for our operations and Scope three emissions to the Science Based Targets initiative in June. \u2047 And as a people-centric company, we continue to focus on the wellbeing of our teammates and our values-based inclusive culture. \u2047 I'm particularly proud that during this trying year, we achieved our best safety score in recorded history, with a recordable incident rate of 0.26, significantly lower than the 3.3 industry average. \u2047 I'm also pleased that in fiscal '21, we continued to have high employee engagement of 87%, putting us at the top quartile of Fortune 500 companies. \u2047 Now let me turn to fiscal '22. \u2047 We expect inflationary pressure to persist, along with continued moderating demand as we lap COVID-19-related demand surges in the first half of fiscal '21. \u2047 While this is reflected in our fiscal '22 outlook, which Kevin will discuss, by the second half of the year, we expect to be within the lower end of the range of our long-term sales targets. \u2047 Like others in our industry and beyond, we are experiencing significant increases in input and transportation costs across all categories in our portfolio, which have accelerated since Q3. \u2047 And we're holistically and dynamically managing this with a laser focus on rebuilding margin. \u2047 We implemented pricing on Glad and announced actions on our Food, Cleaning and International businesses. \u2047 This represents about 50% of our portfolio. \u2047 We're also pursuing pricing in additional parts of our portfolio, which we'll communicate at the right time. \u2047 Based on the constructive conversations we're having with our retail partners and importantly, the strength of our brands, we feel confident about our ability to execute our pricing plans. \u2047 In addition, we will continue to drive our hallmark cost savings program. \u2047 We expect sequential gross margin improvements as we progress through fiscal '22, with our assumption for gross margin expansion by Q4. \u2047 In terms of market share, as we've discussed previously, we have experienced some declines due to supply challenges, but have made notable progress. \u2047 With strong investments in internal and external production capacity, including additional manufacturing lines and a significant expansion of our production team, in June, we achieved our highest case fill rate since the start of the pandemic. \u2047 I'm pleased to see that in the latest 13-week data, ending July 17, we saw market share gains in seven out of nine businesses. \u2047 Certainly, we recognize there's more work to do in parts of the portfolio, such as Glad Trash, and we have adjusted our plans to drive market share improvements over time. \u2047 Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain focused on our long-term priorities rooted in our IGNITE Strategy to deliver our long-term growth aspirations. \u2047 While some pandemic-related behaviors may revert over the next 12 months, we continue to believe there's been a shift in behaviors that will advantage Clorox longer-term, including a focus on health, wellness and hygiene, more time at home as well as increased adoption of e-commerce and digital platforms. \u2047 The pandemic also revealed the urgency to upgrade our digital infrastructure and capabilities. \u2047 Last year, I brought in Chief Information and Enterprise Analytics Officer, Chau Banks, who has extensive experience in business-driven digital transformation, to conduct a fresh assessment of our own program that was already underway before the pandemic. \u2047 With that assessment now complete, we are accelerating our transformation through planned investments of about $500 million over the next five years to enhance our digital capabilities and drive productivity improvements, including replacing our ERP. \u2047 This will enhance our supply chain to better position Clorox to meet customer needs, yield efficiencies and support our digital commerce, innovation and brand-building efforts. \u2047 Prior to the pandemic, we were already adapting our business to differentiate Clorox from a digital perspective. \u2047 We'll continue to invest in e-commerce and digital marketing across our portfolio, leveraging data-driven insights to engage with consumers in more relevant ways. \u2047 Innovation continues to be a key focus area for me and our new Chief Growth Officer, Tony Matta, who joined last October. \u2047 Tony has more than 20 years of brand-building experience with leading consumer companies. \u2047 Ensuring we have stickier innovation delivering multiyear value, we're driving lasting new product platforms, such as Fresh Step Clean Paws and Scentiva, which continue to grow. \u2047 In addition, we're extending innovation by leveraging external partners to create new revenue streams. \u2047 We're continuing to support our brands, especially margin-accretive innovation, with disciplined high-ROI advertising and sales promotion investments to build and strengthen consumer loyalty. \u2047 We also remain very focused on driving our growth runways to build Clorox into a global cleaning and disinfecting brand. \u2047 We are still in the early stages of a multiyear journey, but continue to believe they can become a meaningful contributor to growth longer-term. \u2047 And as we execute on all these initiatives, we will continue to drive the strategic link between our societal impacts and long-term value creation as we live our purpose and keep our ESG commitments front and center in our decision-making every day. \u2047 Now turning to our segment results. \u2047 In Health and Wellness, Q4 sales decreased 17% for the quarter, while full year sales were up 8%, with growth across all businesses. \u2047 On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 16% and full year sales grew 22%. \u2047 In Cleaning, sales were down by double digits compared to double-digit growth in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the deceleration of demand across various cleaning and disinfecting products. \u2047 On a full year basis, Cleaning sales grew behind a strong front half performance. \u2047 While demand fell faster than anticipated, it remains higher than it was pre-pandemic, with strong repeat rates among new buyers. \u2047 Importantly, our supply and product assortment are almost fully restored, which is reflected in our market share improvement, especially in wipes and sprays. \u2047 As consumer demand migrated to more preferred forms and value packs, we also saw a negative impact to price mix, which we expect to continue over the next few quarters. \u2047 Going forward, we'll be focused on strengthening our merchandising activities, especially for the back-to-school period. \u2047 Sales in Professional Products were down by double digits versus year ago period, when we experienced double-digit growth. \u2047 For the full year, Professional Products sales were up by double digits, fueled by an exceptional front half performance. \u2047 Demand started moderating in Q3 and continued into Q4 as customers worked through high inventory levels, especially of Clorox T 360 electrostatic sprayers. \u2047 In the short term, we expect results will continue to be volatile as we lap periods with unprecedented demand. \u2047 Longer-term, this business continues to be a strategic growth area for the company. \u2047 As part of our initiative to expand into new channels, we continue to add to our roster of out-of-home partnerships, including Live Nation, the world's leading live events company. \u2047 Lastly, within the Health and Wellness segment, our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements business increased by double digits this quarter after lapping a double-digit decrease caused by a supply disruption related to COVID-19. \u2047 For the full year, sales were up as well. \u2047 Sales growth for the quarter was driven by a strong performance in the food, drug and mass channel and e-commerce. \u2047 Turning to the Household segment. \u2047 Q4 sales were down 8%. \u2047 Full year sales grew 10%, with growth across all three businesses. \u2047 On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 8% and full year sales grew 12%. \u2047 Glad sales decreased by double digits in Q4, lapping strong double-digit growth in the year ago quarter, which was impacted by initial stockpiling. \u2047 For the full year, sales were up. \u2047 Our efforts going forward are focused on managing base with the strong inflationary headwinds we're facing. \u2047 And as Linda mentioned, we still have more work to do in this business to restore market share. \u2047 Grilling sales decreased by double digits in Q4 as demand started moderating after four consecutive quarters of strong double-digit growth. \u2047 For the full year, sales grew by double digits, fueled by very strong consumption overall. \u2047 Our focus on expanding distribution of our latest innovation, Kingsford Pellets, continued with a nationwide launch, building on the product's initial success, while we're also introducing signature flavors made with 100% real spices that will be available in select retailers before Labor Day as we gear up for the 2022 grilling season. \u2047 This innovation is intended to help our business continue building consumption among multicultural millennials and other heavy grillers. \u2047 Cat Litter sales grew by double digits in Q4 driven by continued strong consumption. \u2047 For the full year, Litter sales also grew. \u2047 The result reflected strength in e-commerce, with Fresh Step becoming the number one brand online for the first time and positive overall category trends, boosted by record pet adoptions during the pandemic. \u2047 In our Lifestyle segment, sales were down 3% and full year sales grew 6%. \u2047 On a two-year stack basis, Q4 sales grew 13% and full year sales grew 16%. \u2047 Brita sales were down as demand continued to moderate from an extended period of elevated consumption. \u2047 Full year sales grew on top of double-digit growth in the prior year. \u2047 Despite the deceleration in Q4, business fundamentals are strong, especially now that our supply is mostly restored. \u2047 We're excited about the strong merchandising program we've put in place this year, including the largest back-to-college event ever for the brand. \u2047 The Food business was down"], "gold_summary": ["sees
