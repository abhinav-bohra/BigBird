{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Dale Gibbons and Tim Bruckner, our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Credit Officer. \u2047 I will first provide an overview of our quarterly results and how we are managing the business in this current economic environment, and then Dale will walk you through the Bank's financial performance. \u2047 I would like to focus on three trends that were present this quarter and will continue throughout the year: PPNR strength, credit provisioning expense and balance sheet growth. \u2047 Combined, these trends will support earnings and capital growth and dividend distribution throughout 2020 and 2021. \u2047 Starting with our second quarter results, Western Alliance generated net income of $93.3 million and earnings per share of $0.93, which was up 12% over the previous quarter. \u2047 Tangible book value per share of $27.84 was an increase of 4.2% over the previous quarter and 12.9% year-over-year. \u2047 Driving these results was record operating pre-provision net revenue of $194.7 million, up 27.7% year-over-year and 19.1% quarter-over-quarter, with strong operating PPNR ROA growth of 18 basis points to 2.56%, which benefited from a recognition of $13.9 million in Payment Protection Program net fees. \u2047 These results demonstrate that the long-term earnings power of Western Alliance's core business remained strong amid the current economic and market volatility and will support significant ongoing capital accumulation, provide financial flexibility to fund balance sheet growth and accommodate changes to the allowance for credit losses or revisions to the economic outlook. \u2047 In the quarter, we recorded provision for credit losses of $92 million versus $51.2 million in Q1, which was primarily attributable to changes in macroeconomic forecast assumptions and net charge-offs of $5.5 million. \u2047 Dale will go into more detail in a bit on the specific drivers of our provisions, but our total loan ACL to funded loan ratio now stands at 1.39% or $347 million. \u2047 Continuing our strong balance sheet momentum from 2019, loans increased $1.9 billion this quarter to $25 billion and deposits grew $2.7 billion to $27.5 billion. \u2047 Without the inclusion of PPP, loans grew a more modest $117 million and deposits demonstrated strong growth of approximately $1.6 billion. \u2047 The lower adjusted loan growth reflects muted demand, for which we held back our marketing activities and directed our focus to low-loss, high-quality loan segments, in addition to assisting our clients with their PPP applications. \u2047 We are encouraged by our pipeline and our opportunity to continue to grow in low-risk asset classes. \u2047 Throughout the crisis, we have continued to attract new high-quality relationships to our bank at pricing and terms that would not have been available to us in other circumstances. \u2047 Furthermore, this quarter's positive operating leverage supported our expanding PPNR, as our strong efficiency ratio improved sharply to 36.3% compared to prior year. \u2047 Becoming more efficient during this economic uncertainty provides the incremental flexibility to maintain PPNR. \u2047 Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in new product offerings and infrastructure to maintain operational efficiency, but Q2 levels are temporary and will eventually rise back to a sustainable level in the low-40s. \u2047 However, our branch-light business model and our National Business Lines strategy continue to give us a competitive advantage. \u2047 Finally, supported by our healthy PPNR generation, Western Alliance remains well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 10.2%, which puts us in a position of strength, uniquely prepared to address what's ahead in this uncertain environment. \u2047 Now, let's take a moment to provide an update on Western Alliance's response to the COVID pandemic. \u2047 We continue to follow CDC protocol and state-by-state return to work guidance, as our organization returns to the office. \u2047 As I initially described on our Q1 earnings call, WAL's unique credit risk management strategy is focused on establishing individual borrower level strategies and direct customer dialog to develop long-term financial plans. \u2047 Our approach to payment deferral requests is to look for resourceful ways to partner with our clients, along with assessing their willingness and capacity to support their business interests. \u2047 We asked our clients to work hand in hand with us, whereby our clients contribute liquidity, capital or equity as an integral component to modify payment plans. \u2047 Our approach collectively uses the resources of the borrower[Phonetic], government and bank's balance sheet to develop solutions that extend beyond the six-month window provided for in the CARES Act. \u2047 Since April 1, WAL has funded $1.9 billion in PPP loans, which provided expedient liquidity to over 4,700 clients and benefited more than 150,000 employees. \u2047 At quarter end, $2.9 billion or 11.5% of loans had been modified with the bulk of these loans receiving principal and interest deferrals. \u2047 Excluding the Hotel Franchise Finance segment, in which we executed a unique sector deferral strategy, the Bankwide deferral rate is approximately 5%. \u2047 The vast majority of our borrowers elect to utilize their own resources or PPP funds to bridge their business through the COVID crisis. \u2047 I will provide an update on the portfolios most impacted by COVID later on, but I did want to highlight, in our Hotel Franchise Finance portfolio, our sophisticated hotel sponsors continue to see value in and support their properties with 92% of deferrals achieved by posting additional liquidity as a component of future payment deferrals. \u2047 Our differentiated deferral strategy provides our customers the runway to resolve their liquidity issues and allow the appropriate time to recover. \u2047 Unlike the cookie-cutter big bank approach, we established the expectation that the burden of responsibility of solving the long-term cash flow problems remains with our client base. \u2047 In our Gaming book, all borrowers continued to make interest payments as 90-day principle-only deferrals were approved for 37% of the portfolio. \u2047 Today, 95% of our clients are open for business and are experiencing a strong rebound of demand. \u2047 These facts and the daily conversations with our people and clients help me feel confident that our credit mitigation strategy and early approach to proactively managing our risk segments is bearing fruit and puts Western Alliance in a strong position to come out on the other side of the pandemic in better shape than our peers. \u2047 Dale will now take you through our financial performance. \u2047 Over the last three months, Western Alliance generated net income of $93.3 million or $0.93 per share. \u2047 As mentioned, net income was impacted by elevated provision expense for credit losses, driven by the adoption of CECL in Q1 and changes in the economic outlook during the quarter. \u2047 Net interest income increased $29.4 million, primarily as a result of loan growth and lower rates on liabilities, as interest expense was cut in half. \u2047 Operating non-interest income fell $5.2 million to $11.1 million from the prior quarter as lower levels of financial activity generated lower -- fewer fees. \u2047 We also benefited from several non-operating items during the period, including a recovery of approximately 40% or $4.4 million of the mark-to-market loss on preferred stock holdings we recognized in Q1. \u2047 Additionally, bank owned life insurance was restructured, resulting in an increase of $5.6 million as we surrendered and reinvested lower-yielding policies. \u2047 In addition to this gain, this should moderately increase BOLI revenue prospectively. \u2047 Finally, non-interest expense declined $5.7 million, primarily from an increase in deferred compensation expense of $3.3 million related to PPP loan originations, plus a 52% decrease in deposit costs and a 64% decline in business development and travel expenses. \u2047 Strong ongoing balance sheet momentum, coupled with diligent expense management, drove operating pre-provision net revenue of $194.7 million, which was up 27.7% year-over-year. \u2047 We believe this is the most relevant metric to evaluate the ongoing earnings power of the Bank. \u2047 Our strong PPNR covered an 80% increase in provision costs from Q1 to $92 million, while driving earnings per share up 12% to $0.93 on a linked quarter basis. \u2047 Turning now to our interest drivers, investment yields increased 4 basis points from the prior quarter to 3.02%. \u2047 However, the overall quarterly portfolio yield decreased by 32 basis points from the prior year due to the lower rate environment. \u2047 Loan yields decreased 45 basis points, following declines across most loan types, mainly driven by the 83 basis point reduction in one-month LIBOR during the quarter. \u2047 Yield reductions were partly offset by an average yield on our PPP loans of 5.02%. \u2047 Prospectively, we expect loan yields to trend toward the end-of-quarter spot rate shown of 4.66%. \u2047 Interest-bearing deposit costs fell by 50 basis points in Q2 to 40 basis points, as this quarter received the full benefit of our proactive steps taken to reduce deposit rates immediately after the FOMC cut rates twice in March. \u2047 The spot rate of total deposits at quarter end was 20 basis points. \u2047 Total funding costs declined by 34 basis points when all of the Company's funding sources are considered, including non-interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. \u2047 The spot rate on total funding costs of 31 basis points is higher than the quarterly average due to the issuance of subordinated debt mid-quarter at 5.25%. \u2047 We expect funding costs to have stabilized at these levels as no further Fed actions are anticipated. \u2047 Demonstrating the flexibility of our business model, despite a transition to a substantially lower rate environment during the quarter, net interest income rose 10.9% or $29 million during Q1[Phonetic] to $298.4 million, up 17% year-over-year. \u2047 Our origination of PPP loans, coupled with strong balance sheet growth and immediate steps taken to reduce the cost of interest bearing deposits, counteracted the decline in prime and LIBOR. \u2047 PPP lending supported our net interest margin during Q2 as SBA fees were recognized, resulting in a loan yield of 5.02% in this sector. \u2047 We estimate most of PPP loans will be forgiven within eight months from origination. \u2047 Of the $43 million in triple PPP loan fees we received from the SBA net of origination costs, one-third or $13.9 million was recognized in the second quarter. \u2047 Net interest margin contracted 3 basis points to 4.19% during the quarter, as our earning asset yield fell 34 basis points, but was offset by an equal improvement in funding costs. \u2047 Our outsized deposit growth and mounting cash reserves will continue to place downward pressure on the NIM until the excess liquidity can be deployed, which we expect will take two to three quarters. \u2047 With regards with our asset sensitivity, our rate risk profile has declined notably over the last year, and we are now asymmetrically positioned to benefit from any future rate increases as 70% of our loan portfolio is behaving as a fixed rate since floors on variable-rate loans have largely been triggered. \u2047 Our estimated net change of net interest income in a 100 basis point parallel shock higher is 4.2% over the next year, and we now project zero net interest income at risk if rates move lower. \u2047 Turning now to operating efficiency, on a linked quarter basis, our efficiency ratio improved 550 basis points to 36.3%, which continues to demonstrate our industry-leading operating leverage. \u2047 As mentioned earlier, the non-interest expense improvement is related to an increase in deferred compensation expense of $3.3 million unrelated PPP loan originations, plus a 52% reduction in deposit costs and a 64% decrease in development and travel costs. \u2047 Normalizing for PPP net loan fees and interest, the efficiency ratio for Q2 would have been 38.4%. \u2047 Additionally, our branch-light model has given us the flexibility to identify two locations that we are transitioning from full service offices to loan production facilities. \u2047 Our core underlying earning power remained strong as pre-provision net revenue ROA increased 18 basis points from the prior quarter to 2.56% and return on assets was flat at 1.22%. \u2047 While we expect the 2.56% is a high watermark as elevated liquidity will hold down the margin, we believe we will continue to maintain industry-leading performance. \u2047 This provides a significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth, capital management actions or any credit demand. \u2047 Our balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans increased $1.9 billion to $25 billion, and deposit growth of $2.7 billion brought our deposit balances to $27.5 billion at quarter end. \u2047 The loan to deposit ratio fell to 90.9% from 93.3% in Q1, as our strong liquidity position continues to provide us with balance sheet capacity to meet all funding needs. \u2047 Our cash position increased to $1.5 billion as deposit growth continues to outpace credit expansion. \u2047 While this impairs the margin near term, we believe it provides us with inventory for good credit growth as demand resumes. \u2047 Of note, during the quarter, we issued $225 million of bank level subordinated debt to ensure ample capacity to support our growth trajectory by bolstering our total capital ratio. \u2047 Finally, tangible book value per share increased $1.11 over the prior quarter to $27.84, an increase of $3.19 or 13% over the prior year. \u2047 The vast majority of the $1.9 billion in loan growth was driven by increases in C&I loans of $1.6 billion, residential loans of $154 million and construction loans of $138 million. \u2047 Residential and consumer loans now comprise 9.8% of our loan portfolio, while our construction loan concentration continues to trend downward and is now at 8.8% of total loans. \u2047 Excluding PPP loans, loan growth was $117 million, which was affected by line paydowns from draws during Q1 and offset by growth in residential and construction. \u2047 Highlighting our continued focus on growth in low-risk assets, tech and innovation loans were flat in total, while within the category, capital call and subscription lines grew $35 million, mortgage warehouse loans grew $325 million and residential mortgages grew $165 million. \u2047 Corporate finance loans decreased $233 million compared to the increase we saw in Q1 as borrowers repaid their line draws, reducing utilization rates down from 38% to 17%. \u2047 And all loan growth was fully funded by deposit growth. \u2047 We continue to believe our ability to profitably grow deposits is both a key differentiator and a core value driver to our firm's long-term value creation. \u2047 Notably, year-to-date deposit growth of $6.1 billion is higher than the annual deposit growth of the Company in any"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share $0.93.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $0.93.  \u2047  company does not anticipate any need for
