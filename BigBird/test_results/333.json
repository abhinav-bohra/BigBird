{"article": ["Today's call will begin with Chris discussing business trends experienced during the first quarter of 2021, views of what's to come and context around our progress toward an unwavering commitment to achieving Vision 2025. \u2047 Bob will discuss the financial details of Carlisle's first quarter performance and current financial position. \u2047 Those considering investing in Carlisle should read these statements carefully and review reports we file with the SEC before making an investment decision. \u2047 And we've also have historically provided in supplemental tables, which are available on our website. \u2047 With that, I introduce Chris Koch, Chairman, President and CEO of Carlisle. \u2047 I hope all of you, your families, co-workers and friends are staying safe and healthy as we collectively manage through what is hopefully the beginning of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Reflecting on the last 12 months of uncertainty, I take great pride in how roughly one year ago the Carlisle team handled the immediate threats born out of the pandemic. \u2047 Our first actions were to ensure our teams at Carlisle were taking the steps necessary to provide a safe work environment. \u2047 We ensured that our team members had access to healthcare, continue to be paid, and had company support for the difficult situations many were facing. \u2047 We enacted strict health and safety protocols based on the CDC, World Health Organization and best-in-class peer actions and recommendations, which contributed to a low infection rate at Carlisle across the globe. \u2047 Our next steps were to support our highly engaged and flexible workforce as they took very proactive measures to ensure we supported our customers that were providing essential services to the economy. \u2047 We wanted to ensure that they can count on Carlisle to be there to provide the right product to the right place at the right time or what we've come to call, the Carlisle experience. \u2047 Turning to Slide 3 now. \u2047 Throughout 2020 an essential part of leadership's job was to cut through the confusion, misinformation and complexity present in our daily lives and communicated a clear, direct and simple strategic vision for the organization that would inform our priorities, educate our collective mission and guide our everyday actions of work. \u2047 At Carlisle we call this Vision 2025. \u2047 This compelling strategic framework gave us clear direction and consistency emission during the tumultuous past year and will continue to guide our efforts as we accelerate into the recovery in 2021. \u2047 During the past 12 months Carlisle again proved its ability to navigate varying economic cycles with steadiness and focus, while delivering strong financial performance reconfirming our conviction in Vision 2025 and it's key strategies. \u2047 The first quarter of 2021 continues to validate the hard work, effort and commitment by all Carlisle employees to our stakeholders and signals that operational momentum is building across our platforms. \u2047 Moving to Slide 4. \u2047 Due to the strength in our CCM, CFT and CBF businesses, our revenue was flat year-over-year despite a very tough comparison to quarter 1 of 2020. \u2047 The well-understood impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial aerospace markets continued to weigh on CIT results and it had a significant negative impact on the first quarter of this year. \u2047 More than offsetting this was outstanding performance at CCM where our team delivered 6.3% year-over-year revenue growth. \u2047 A tremendous achievement when considering the first quarter of 2020 was 1% higher than 2019 and Q1 of '19 was 12% higher than 2018. \u2047 Additionally, we are encouraged by CBF's rebound from a multi-year sector decline in demand for off-highway vehicles. \u2047 And lastly, CFT continues to build on its second half 2020 performance and we're encouraged with CFT's global end market strengthening. \u2047 Our strong results and rapid recovery from the initial shock of the early stages of the pandemic reinforce our confidence in the Carlisle team's ability to achieve Vision 2025. \u2047 The first quarter results highlight how we continue to execute on our long-term strategies including maintaining the highest standards in providing the Carlisle experience to our customers, investing in high return capital projects to drive organic growth across our core platforms, working an active pipeline of acquisition targets, returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, continuing on our ESG journey and demonstrating the exceptional and sustainable earnings power of the Carlisle business model. \u2047 It is our history of innovation, investment and continuous improvements that supports more conviction than ever in Carlisle's future success. \u2047 The first quarter of 2021 continue to demonstrate the strength of the CCM franchise and reaffirms our commitment to reinvesting in this, our highest returning business. \u2047 Our pivot to CCM that began with the introduction of Vision 2025 several years ago was to us an obvious strategic choice after more than two decades of exceptional returns on capital, strong organic growth and solid financial performance. \u2047 This is further bolstered by the now well-understood value of the Carlisle experience. \u2047 By the Carlisle experience we mean ensuring delivery of the right product at the right place at the right time. \u2047 We mean industry-leading investment in production facilities and R&D capabilities, best-in-class education for channel partners on the latest roofing products and installation best-practices, an award-winning customer service team, continuing to innovate and provide value-added products that ensure quicker, easier and safer installation of our building envelope systems and solutions in an increasingly labor and material constrained environment. \u2047 And finally, and maybe most importantly, contributing products that provide a better environment for all stakeholders. \u2047 Taken in whole, the Carlisle experience is how CCM has become a manufacturing, engineering and commercial leader in the construction products industry. \u2047 Further evidence of our commitment to the Carlisle experience into investing in our highest-returning businesses, earlier this week Carlisle announced plans to invest more than $60 million to build an innovative, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Sikeston, Missouri. \u2047 This investment will support our organic growth initiatives and also create jobs for the city of Sikeston and surrounding communities. \u2047 The building and its surrounding footprint will incorporate the latest advances in lead building technologies and highest standards of sustainability. \u2047 The insulation materials manufactured here not only lower energy cost for building owners and operators, but also help reduce a buildings GHG emissions. \u2047 Additionally, this site's central location will reduce the carbon footprint of CCM's supply chain and improve material lead times for customers in the region. \u2047 Demand continues to grow for our insulation solutions given the strong reroofing cycle under way in the U.S. as well as the growing needs to improve the energy performance of commercial buildings. \u2047 With that in mind, we felt this was the right time to expand our capacity and enhance the Carlisle experience for our customers in the Midwest. \u2047 Please turn now to Slide 6. \u2047 illustrated are some specifics on our first quarter results where CCM exhibited the remarkarble the strength of its business model. \u2047 CCM organic sales grew nearly 6% year-over-year reflecting strong demand for our sustainable building envelope solutions and underscoring the importance of the Carlisle experience. \u2047 March volumes were particularly strong more than offsetting significant weather-induced softness in February. \u2047 And additionally, bookings entering the second quarter are at record levels. \u2047 Fortunately, our conviction in a strong 2021 meant that we anticipated the market needs and drove elevated production levels during the latter part of 2020 and into the winter months as others in the industry cast out on underlying demand. \u2047 We did this is a commitment to our customers to ensure their needs will be met and continue to earn our place as a supplier of choice for their building envelope solutions. \u2047 CCM continues to benefit from the strong reroofing cycle in the United States. \u2047 Our products and solutions for non-residential buildings are non-discretionary and can only be deferred for so long. \u2047 We believe CCM volumes in 2021 should benefit from work postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic. \u2047 But we maintain our conviction in the sustainability of the reroofing demand in the U.S. where we continue to expect the market to grow from $6 billion to $8 billion in the next decade. \u2047 Additionally, CCM is meeting head-on the challenges from the significant acceleration in raw material and logistics cost inflation during the quarter. \u2047 Coming into the year we were expecting an inflationary environment, coupled with strong demand and thus had prioritized selling price increases across most product categories at CCM to ensure we can continue to invest in and provide world-class customer service to our customers. \u2047 Our procurement and supply chain teams are doing a great job in navigating a volatile and extremely tight marketplace. \u2047 Again with the goal of providing the best-in-class Carlisle experience to our customers. \u2047 The first quarter results were in line with subdued expectations given the ongoing disruption in the commercial aerospace market. \u2047 Improving leading indicators, which include the expanding vaccine rollout, increasing numbers of domestic travelers, growing aircraft manufacturer backlogs, and improvements in CIT's order books give us confidence that CIT is positioned for a sequential improvement going forward. \u2047 CFT delivered improved revenue and profitability performance in the first quarter driven by its reenergized commitment to new product innovation, improved operational efficiencies, price discipline and integration of our newer platforms. \u2047 We are especially pleased that new products accounted for over half of the volume growth in this quarter. \u2047 At CBF the significant actions taken to improve the business over the past few years are yielding expected results combined with demand for off-highway vehicles and equipment especially in Ag and construction is driving very strong volumes. \u2047 CBF is delivering positive and accelerated earnings growth in what looks to be a significant inflection year for this business. \u2047 Our ESG efforts also continue to gain momentum under Dave Smith, our recently appointed Vice President of Sustainability. \u2047 In early April, we published our 2020 sustainability report in conjunction with the launch of a new award-winning ESG-focused website. \u2047 These launches collectively share details of Carlisle's century-long journey and provide a deeper look into the socially responsible approach we undertake to create value for all stakeholders of the company. \u2047 I'd also like to highlight how important the Carlisle operating system was to Carlisle throughout the past year and will continue to be as we drive to deliver Vision 2025. \u2047 During the pandemic year of 2020 and the 13th year of our COS journey, our teams leaned heavily on COS to navigate through significant uncertainty. \u2047 The first quarter again demonstrated the value of COS as we delivered 1.2% savings as a percent of sales well within our target of 1% to 2% annually. \u2047 Moving to Slide 8. \u2047 Before Bob updates you on our financial performance, I wanted to give you a quick update on capital deployment. \u2047 We continue to seek synergistic acquisitions that are currently working a robust pipeline. \u2047 For years we remained active on share repurchases buying back $150 million worth of shares during the first quarter and we paid $28 million worth of dividends. \u2047 We remain opportunistic in share repurchases and will continue to balance our cash position with the opportunities within the robust M&A pipeline. \u2047 We believe the strong performance in the first quarter across all platforms at Carlisle is a product of staying the course on our strategies. \u2047 I'm proud of how the team met the challenges in the past year. \u2047 I believe Carlisle is at a solid position to accelerate through the recovery. \u2047 Bob will now provide operational and financial detail about the first quarter and review our balance sheet and cash flow. \u2047 Starting with this quarterly call when referencing profitability I'll be speaking to adjusted EBITDA margins and adjusted earnings. \u2047 Revenue was flat in the first quarter driven by CCM, CFT and CBF offset by the well-documented commercial aerospace decline in CIT. \u2047 Organic revenue declined 1.4%. \u2047 CCM, CFT and CBF all delivered greater than 5% organic growth in the quarter. \u2047 Acquisitions contributed 0.4% sales growth for the quarter and FX was a 90 basis point tailwind. \u2047 Turning to our adjusted EBITDA margin bridge on Slide 10. \u2047 Q1 adjusted EBITDA margin declined 180 basis points to 14.4%. \u2047 Pricing and volume headwinds combined for a 150 basis point decline is driven by CIT. \u2047 Acquisitions were a 10 basis point headwind. \u2047 Freight, labor, raw material and other operating costs netted to a 140 basis point decline. \u2047 COS benefits added 120 basis points. \u2047 On Slide 11, we have provided adjusted earnings per share bridge where you can see the first quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.47, which compares to $1.67 last year. \u2047 Volume, price and mix combined were $0.24 year-over-year decline. \u2047 Raw material, freight and labor costs were a $0.25 headwind. \u2047 Interest and tax together were a $0.01 headwind. \u2047 Partially offsetting the decline, share repurchases contributed 5%, COS contributed $0.16, and lower opex was a $0.09 benefit year-over-year. \u2047 While COVID-related volumes declines at CIT clearly represented the most significant headwind during the quarter, our CIT team did a commendable job managing costs, leveraging COS to improve efficiencies and taking actions to position Carlisle for recovery while mitigating the pandemic's impact on earnings. \u2047 At CCM, the team has again delivered outstanding results with revenues increasing 6.3% driven by volume and 60 basis points of foreign currency translation tailwind. \u2047 CCM continued to exhibit its resilience with solid U.S. commercial roofing performance despite continued COVID-related restrictions in some areas and severe weather in February. \u2047 Our European and architectural metal teams were solid contributors to the quarter's revenue performance. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin at CCM was 20.1% in the first quarter, a 50 basis point improvement over last year, driven by the higher volumes, COS savings and cost management partially offset by wage and raw material inflation. \u2047 CIT revenue declined 30.6% in the first quarter. \u2047 As has been well-publicized this decline was driven by the pandemic's impact on commercial aerospace markets. \u2047 While recovery in aerospace could be prolonged we are confident that there will be a resumption of growth with the continued rollout of the COVID vaccine and airlines returning to profitability. \u2047 In our medical platform where sales were up nicely in the quarter year-over-year, we continue to expect sequential improvement from pent-up demand as the impacts of COVID on hospital capex in postponement of elective surgeries ease. \u2047 Additionally, our project pipeline is robust and our backlog's improving. \u2047 CIT's adjusted EBITDA margin declined year-over-year to 7.1% driven by commercial aerospace softly -- partly offset by savings from COS and lower expenses. \u2047 While the actions taken by CIT in 2020 to"], "gold_summary": ["sees fy sales for carlisle brake & friction up more than 30%.  \u2047  q1 adjusted earnings per share $1.47."], "pred_summary": ["q1 adjusted earnings per share $1.47.  \u2047  q1 adjusted earnings
