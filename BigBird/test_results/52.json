{"article": ["Please note for those of you listening by phone, you may experience a time delay in slide movement. \u2047 When referring to operating margins, that is based on operating income and sales, excluding surcharge. \u2047 Let's begin on Slide four and a review of our safety performance. \u2047 Our fiscal year-to-date total case incident rate, or TCIR, is 0.6. \u2047 We have now demonstrated three consecutive quarters of sub-1.0 TCIR performance as an organization, which is exceptional safety performance. \u2047 However, we do not take these accomplishments for granted and continue to enhance the fundamentals of our program in areas such as hand safety, human performance, leadership development, ergonomics, employee engagement activities and at-home safety programs. \u2047 I look forward to achieving our next safety performance milestone as we pursue safety excellence on our path to 0. \u2047 Our third quarter results were largely in line with our expectations as near-term volume headwinds related to COVID-19 continue to pressure our financial performance. \u2047 Both our SAO and PEP segments delivered results that were consistent with the guidance we provided on our second quarter earnings call. \u2047 We have maintained a focus on our key strategic priorities during this challenging period. \u2047 First, ensure the safety of our employees. \u2047 Second, drive cash flow generation and strengthen our liquidity profile. \u2047 Over the last four quarters, we have generated $189 million in free cash flow and ended the third quarter with total liquidity of $539 million, including $244 million of cash and no near-term financial obligations. \u2047 And third, focus on the long-term relationships with our customers. \u2047 During the quarter, we continued to expand our relationships across our customer base and then cover additional areas of value creation. \u2047 As evidenced, we completed several contract extensions, primarily in our medical, transportation and aerospace and defense end-use markets. \u2047 In the aerospace market, customers fully understand that capacity was limited prior to the pandemic and supply of aerospace materials will be constrained again when build rates return to normalized levels. \u2047 As you know, Carpenter Technology is the only company in our space that has invested in capacity, namely the Athens facility. \u2047 Qualification efforts have continued through the pandemic as we received a meaningful provisional approval during the quarter. \u2047 Lastly, the investment made in our hot strip mill on our Reading campus is currently in its final commissioning stages. \u2047 This advanced mill is a significant addition to our soft magnetics solutions and capabilities portfolio and positions us to benefit from the growing trend of electrification. \u2047 Now let's move to Slide six and the end-use market update. \u2047 Our customers and markets have been heavily impacted by COVID-19, particularly aerospace and defense, our largest market. \u2047 We have been successful in mitigating a portion of the near-term impact of the aerospace downturn by capitalizing on growing demand for our solutions in transportation and industrial and consumer end-use markets, namely our semicon business. \u2047 Recently, all of our end-use markets have experienced positive inflections and have moved past their pandemic decline trajectories. \u2047 All of our end-use markets are in demand recovery, albeit at different rates. \u2047 We believe the worst is behind us, and we expect to see improving conditions over the coming quarters. \u2047 Let's get into some more detail starting with the aerospace and defense end-use market where sales were down both year over year and sequentially. \u2047 In the third quarter, customer inventories continued to decrease, and we saw some initial replenishment activity. \u2047 As a reminder, in our recent second quarter, we talked about a variety of onetime customer contract-related items, which represented a positive. \u2047 When you remove the impact of those items, aerospace results would be relatively flat sequentially. \u2047 While visibility remains limited, overall sentiment points to incremental improvement through the balance of calendar year 2021 and then accelerate activity in calendar year 2022 and beyond. \u2047 In addition, future industry capacity and lead time continues to be a focus during conversations with customers as most recall the situation the supply chain was in prior to COVID-19 where lead times were significantly extended. \u2047 Activity in the defense submarket remains solid, and we continue to see increased demand on select programs. \u2047 In our medical end-use market, sales were up 7% sequentially. \u2047 Elective procedure volumes increased compared to the second quarter as patient sentiment and hospital capacity improved. \u2047 The recovery of elective surgery volume is expected to continue into the second half of calendar year 2021 as vaccination levels rise to support increased confidence. \u2047 Based on current conditions, we expect activity levels in the medical end-use market to show further improvement in the fourth quarter as our customers look to support an increase in elective surgeries. \u2047 As many of you recall, the medical end-use market was one of our fastest growing markets prior to the pandemic. \u2047 Today, we remain well positioned to continue supporting the medical end-use market given our expanded OEM relationships, leading advanced materials portfolio and ability to develop new materials solutions that address complex and unmet market needs. \u2047 In the transportation end-use market, sales were up both sequentially and year-over-year. \u2047 On a sequential basis, sales increased across all of our submarkets. \u2047 Demand in the light vehicle market remains solid driven by North America and China. \u2047 While the heavy-duty truck market has largely recovered and is expected to grow through calendar year 2022. \u2047 Overall, we are winning share in both the light vehicle and heavy-duty truck submarkets due to the value of our high-temp, high-resistance turbocharger and valve exhaust solutions. \u2047 Now moving to the energy end-use market. \u2047 Conditions in the oil and gas submarket remained challenged and activity levels remain low in the U.S., while international markets have shown some improvement. \u2047 Keep in mind, that prior year third quarter results included our Amega West business that was divested during the first quarter of this fiscal year. \u2047 In our power generation submarket, we continue to work with customers as the current maintenance upgrade cycle continues. \u2047 Lastly, for the industrial and consumer end-use market, sales were down year-over-year and sequentially. \u2047 The slight sequential decline was a function of order flow between the last two quarters as we continue to experience demand pickup, consistent with the general manufacturing recovery. \u2047 I'll start on Slide 8, the income statement summary. \u2047 Net sales in the third quarter were $351.9 million and sales, excluding surcharge, totaled $298.1 million. \u2047 Sales, excluding surcharge, were effectively flat sequentially on 5% lower volume. \u2047 Compared to the third quarter a year ago, sales decreased 40% on 39% lower volume. \u2047 As Tony covered in his review of the end-use markets, the year-over-year decline is attributable to the ongoing demand headwinds in our key end-use markets of aerospace and defense and medical as a result of the global pandemic. \u2047 As expected, the demand was similar to our recent Q2 levels. \u2047 Given the current demand environment, we continue to actively manage our production schedules and focus on executing against our targeted inventory reduction program. \u2047 As we have said on prior calls, while the reduction in inventory drives near-term cash flow generation, as evidenced by our liquidity position, it negatively impacts our operating income performance. \u2047 SG&A expenses were $47.8 million in the third quarter, down $3 million from the same period a year ago, reflecting the actions we took to reduce costs, including the elimination of about 20% of our global salaried positions late last fiscal year, managing discretionary spend closely as well as the impacts of remote working conditions that reduced certain administrative costs such as travel and entertainment. \u2047 Sequentially, SG&A costs were higher by $5.6 million, reflecting incremental costs in the quarter associated with going live with our new ERP implementation as well as the incremental depreciation costs associated with the ERP system. \u2047 The current quarter's operating results include $7.6 million of restructuring and asset impairment charges, including inventory writedowns, associated with our ongoing actions to reduce cost and narrow focus in our additive business unit within our PEP segment. \u2047 In addition, our results for the third quarter include $2.7 million in COVID-19-related costs, which are down slightly from the $3.9 million of COVID-19 costs incurred in our recent second quarter. \u2047 As a reminder, these costs include direct incremental operating costs, including outside services to execute enhanced cleaning protocols, isolation pay for employees potentially exposed to COVID-19 and additional personal protective equipment and other operating supplies necessary to maintain the operations while keeping employees safe against possible exposure. \u2047 The operating loss was $40 million in the current quarter when excluding the impact of the special items, namely the restructuring and asset impairment charges and the COVID-19 costs. \u2047 Adjusted operating loss was $29.7 million compared to operating income of $58.7 million in the prior year period and adjusted operating loss of $32.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. \u2047 Again, the current quarter's results were largely in line with the expectations we set at the beginning of the quarter and reflect the impact of significantly lower volume compared to the prior year combined with a targeted inventory reduction, partially offset by the cost reduction efforts. \u2047 Although not shown on the slide, in the current quarter, other expense net includes an $8.9 million noncash pension settlement charge related to our largest qualified pension plan. \u2047 In addition to recording the charge in the current quarter, we were also required to remeasure the plan's net pension liabilities. \u2047 As a result of the remeasurement, we expect pension expense to be lower by about $3 million for the full fiscal year versus what we had anticipated. \u2047 For clarity, this reduction in net pension expense does not impact operating income. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.2%. \u2047 For the balance of the year, we currently expect the tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 30%. \u2047 Earnings per share for the quarter was a loss of $0.84 per share. \u2047 When excluding the impacts of the special items, adjusted earnings per share was a loss of $0.54 per share. \u2047 Now turning to Slide nine and our SAO segment results. \u2047 Net sales for the quarter were $299.6 million or $246.5 million, excluding surcharge. \u2047 Compared to the third quarter last year, sales, excluding surcharge, decreased 38% on 37% lower volume. \u2047 Sequentially, sales, excluding surcharge, were essentially flat on 3% lower volume. \u2047 These sequential results reflect similar weakened demand conditions in our largest end-use market of aerospace and defense as the supply chain continues to deal with near-term reductions in OEM build rates. \u2047 This was partially offset by stronger shipments in transportation as North American light vehicle production continues to drive strong demand conditions for our materials. \u2047 SAO reported an operating loss of $9.9 million for the current quarter. \u2047 The same quarter a year ago, SAO's operating income was $76.4 million. \u2047 And in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, SAO reported an operating loss of $11.6 million. \u2047 The year-over-year reduction in operating income primarily reflects the impacts of lower volume as well as the negative income statement impacts of reducing inventory, partially offset by the actions taken to reduce operating costs. \u2047 During the current quarter, SAO reduced inventory by approximately $15 million and, year-to-date, has reduced inventory by $146 million. \u2047 Sequentially, the lower operating loss is principally the result of lower volume, offset by a favorable product mix and a less pronounced impact of the inventory reduction relative to the second quarter due in part to rising raw material prices. \u2047 In addition, the current quarter's results reflect approximately $2.1 million of direct incremental costs associated with our efforts to protect our facilities and employees in light of COVID-19. \u2047 This compares with $3.2 million in COVID-19 costs in our recent second quarter. \u2047 Looking ahead, we expect demand conditions across most end-use markets will stabilize and begin to gradually recover beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. \u2047 Based on current expectations, we anticipate SAO will generate an operating loss of approximately $5 million to $7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. \u2047 For clarity, I want to highlight a couple of key points in this guidance. \u2047 First, this estimate includes similar sequential COVID-19-related costs in the upcoming fourth quarter. \u2047 And second, as we continue to reduce inventory, we expect that we will be required to record a noncash LIFO decrement charge in our upcoming fourth quarter. \u2047 Given the significant inventory reductions we expect to generate for the full fiscal year, we are liquidating LIFO layers that include inventory costs that are higher than the fiscal year 2021 cost and, as such, a noncash charge will be recorded to the income statement. \u2047 The guidance we provided excludes the impact of any noncash LIFO decrement charges. \u2047 Now turning to Slide 10 and our PEP segment results. \u2047 Net sales, excluding surcharge, were $64.9 million, which were down 39% from the same quarter a year ago and up 20% sequentially. \u2047 The year-over-year decline in sales was driven by market headwinds, largely due to the global pandemic. \u2047 Additionally, sales in the energy end-use market declined as a result of our exit of the Amega West oil and gas business in the first quarter of this fiscal year. \u2047 The sequential increase in sales reflects increasing demand for titanium materials used in the aerospace and defense and medical end-use markets. \u2047 In addition, our distribution business drove higher sales due to growing demand related to the strong activity in the automotive supply chain. \u2047 Lastly, our additive business saw a modest increase in sales as demand improved. \u2047 In the current quarter, PEP reported an operating loss of $3.3 million. \u2047 This compares to an operating loss of $7.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 and an operating loss of $0.3 million in the same quarter last year. \u2047 The sequential operating results reflect the favorable impacts of higher volumes across all the PEP business units. \u2047 As we look ahead, we believe that demand conditions will gradually begin to improve in the coming quarters, and we currently anticipate PEP will generate an operating loss of $0 million to $1 million in our upcoming fourth quarter. \u2047 Also, as I mentioned for SAO, the PEP guidance includes COVID-19 costs in line with the recent quarter but excludes any noncash LIFO decrement charges. \u2047 Now turning to Slide 11 and a review of free cash flow. \u2047 In the current quarter, we generated $4 million of cash from operating activities. \u2047 As"], "gold_summary": ["carpenter technology q3
