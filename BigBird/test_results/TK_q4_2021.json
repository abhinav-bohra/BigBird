{"article": ["These factors are detailed in the company's financial reports. \u2047 You should also note that we'll be discussing our consolidated results using core performance measures unless we specifically indicate our comments relate to GAAP data. \u2047 Our core performance measures are non-GAAP measures used by management to analyze the business. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, the largest differences between our GAAP and core results stem from noncash mark-to-market gains associated with the company's currency hedging contracts and noncash impairment charges. \u2047 With respect to mark-to-market adjustments, GAAP accounting requires earnings translation hedge contracts and foreign debt settling in future periods to be marked to market and recorded at current value at the end of each quarter, even though those contracts will not be settled in the current quarter. \u2047 For us, this increased GAAP earnings in Q4 by $86 million. \u2047 To be clear, this mark-to-market accounting has no impact on our cash flow. \u2047 Our currency hedges protect us economically from foreign exchange rate fluctuations and provide higher certainty for our earnings and cash flow, our ability to invest for growth, and our future shareholder distributions. \u2047 Our non-GAAP or core results provide additional transparency into operations by using constant-currency rates aligned with the economics of our underlying transactions. \u2047 We're very pleased with our hedging program and the economic certainty it provides. \u2047 We've received more than $1.8 billion in cash under our hedge contracts since their inception more than five years ago. \u2047 A reconciliation of core results to the comparable GAAP value can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at corning.com. \u2047 You may also access core results on our website with downloadable financials in the Interactive Analyst Center. \u2047 We encourage you to follow along. \u2047 They're also available on our website for downloading. \u2047 Today, we reported fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. \u2047 We delivered another strong quarter of year-over-year growth. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, sales were $3.7 billion, up 12% year over year. \u2047 We generated earnings per share of $0.54 and free cash flow of $425 million. \u2047 For the full year, sales were $14.1 billion, up 23% year over year. \u2047 We generated earnings per share of $2.07, up 49% year over year. \u2047 And we nearly doubled free cash flow. \u2047 In addition, we achieved double-digit ROIC, we expanded our operating margin by 230 basis points, we increased our dividend by 9% and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5% through the resumption of share repurchases. \u2047 By leveraging our fundamental capabilities and our More Corning strategy, we are capturing a compelling set of short- and long-term opportunities across our portfolio. \u2047 We are performing well in a challenging environment, and we have momentum entering the year. \u2047 Now, all of that said, our gross margin is simply not where it should be. \u2047 As we said last quarter, throughout the pandemic, we had prioritized protecting our people and delivering for our customers in a complex, inflationary environment. \u2047 And it has come at a cost. \u2047 Over the last several months, we have negotiated with customers to increase prices in our long-term contracts to more appropriately share the increased cost we are experiencing. \u2047 We are focused on expanding our gross. \u2047 We are focused on expanding our gross margin and expect improvement in 2022 as our sales grow and our price actions take hold throughout the year. \u2047 Last quarter, we also discussed our expectations for our Display business. \u2047 I am pleased to report we had another strong quarter of Display revenues and profits in Quarter 4. \u2047 Display glass pricing is expected to be flat sequentially in the first quarter. \u2047 The supply demand balance for display glass is tight. \u2047 In 2022, we expect overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable. \u2047 Then Tony and Ed will discuss our results, as well as our plan to enhance our profitability and overall financial strength. \u2047 So, let's dive in. \u2047 We've been delivering consistent growth. \u2047 Sales have been up for six quarters in a row. \u2047 Since 2019, we've grown sales by 21% and earnings per share by 18% with more balanced and consistent contributions across our businesses. \u2047 Everything begins with our cohesive portfolio. \u2047 We're the world leader in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics along with our four proprietary manufacturing and engineering platforms. \u2047 We focus our strategy on capturing synergies among these capabilities and applying them to create disruptive innovations. \u2047 Across multiple industries, we work closely with many of the most influential and successful companies to bring our world-leading capabilities to bear on their toughest challenges. \u2047 In the process, we help move the world forward. \u2047 As we partner with our customers to advance their visions, our probability of success increases as we combine our capabilities, reapply our talent, and repurpose existing assets. \u2047 This provides a powerful value creation lever by unlocking new ways to integrate more of our content into our customers' ecosystems. \u2047 We aren't exclusively relying on people buying more stuff. \u2047 We're driving more Corning content into the products they're already buying. \u2047 Our progress in 2021 illustrates the effectiveness of our approach, and it gives us confidence that we're building on a strong foundation for additional growth in 2022. \u2047 In Optical Communications, we've returned to growth with sales up 22% in 2021. \u2047 And we expect strong growth to continue. \u2047 Operators are expanding network capacity, capability, and access. \u2047 The pace of data center construction is accelerating as more applications move to the cloud and data creation continues to soar. \u2047 And fiber-rich wireless deployments are underway. \u2047 Meanwhile, governments around the world are initiating plans to extend the reach of broadband to more people in more places as network access is increasingly viewed as a human right. \u2047 For example, the recently passed U.S. infrastructure bill allocates $65 billion in new spending for broadband infrastructure, including $42 billion for new network builds. \u2047 Our customers are stating their preferences for fiber to build these networks. \u2047 As the only large-scale end-to-end manufacturer of optical solutions, Corning plays a vital role in driving the continued expansion of connectivity. \u2047 We're working even more closely with industry players at the regional and national levels, including expanding our longtime collaboration with AT&T. \u2047 Stepping back, we're at the beginning of a large, multiyear wave of growth for passive optical networks. \u2047 Project momentum is strong across our customer base. \u2047 infrastructure plans roll out, it could add as much as $1 billion a year to the market for four years starting as early as 2023. \u2047 We believe private carrier and public infrastructure investments will push the market into double-digit growth over the next few years. \u2047 In Life Sciences, we're delivering growth on multiple fronts with sales up 24% in 2021. \u2047 We're seeing ongoing demand in support of a global pandemic response. \u2047 Our inventions are also helping the industry advance the transition to cell- and gene-based therapies. \u2047 And we're making progress on our multibillion-dollar content opportunity in our pharmaceutical packaging business. \u2047 After introducing Valor Glass vials in 2017, we recently introduced Velocity Vials. \u2047 These vials are helping industry-leading drugmakers increase efficiency and throughput to drive faster manufacturing of vaccines to help meet global demand. \u2047 Velocity joins Valor and our glass tubing business as we build a comprehensive end-to-end pharmaceutical packaging portfolio. \u2047 In fact, our portfolio has enabled the delivery of nearly 5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines so far. \u2047 And earlier this week, West Pharmaceutical Services, a global leader in injectable drug administration, announced a long-term supply agreement and technology investment in Corning to enhance injectable drug packaging systems. \u2047 In automotive, 2021 sales in our Environmental Technologies segment increased 16% to reach an all-time high $1.6 billion despite weakness in the automotive market related to chip shortages. \u2047 We're pursuing a $100-per-car content opportunity driven by trends that are reshaping the auto industry and reimagining the car. \u2047 We delivered multiple proof points in 2021. \u2047 Daimler launched the Hyperscreen dashboard display in the Mercedes-Benz EQS. \u2047 The display features a Gorilla Glass cover nearly five feet wide. \u2047 Building on this momentum, we entered a new automotive product category with our Curved Mirror Solutions. \u2047 This innovation is enabling the augmented reality head-up display in Hyundai's electric crossover, the IONIQ 5. \u2047 And Jeep announced a product that brings our tough technical glass into their iconic vehicles. \u2047 The new Jeep performance parts windshield featuring Gorilla Glass is now a factory-installed option on the Wrangler and Gladiator. \u2047 Additionally, tighter emissions regulations continue to provide a strong content opportunity for our environmental solutions. \u2047 Our newest generation of gasoline particulate filters help vehicles, including hybrids, achieve even lower levels of fine particulate tailpipe emissions. \u2047 The contributions of our GPF business provide a strong illustration of our More Corning strategy in action. \u2047 Since 2017, Environmental Technologies sales have increased more than 40% while global car sales had decreased by 20%. \u2047 Let's turn to mobile consumer electronics, where 2021 sales increased 7%, and we surpassed the $2 billion in sales for the first time. \u2047 Since 2016, Specialty Materials has added nearly $900 million on a base of $1.1 billion in a smartphone market that has been flat to down. \u2047 As we help our customers deliver new value to their users, more of our content is deployed in each device sold. \u2047 That is another great illustration of More Corning in action. \u2047 Our industry-leading innovations continue to garner widespread accolades. \u2047 In fact, Fast Company named Corning the most innovative company in the consumer electronics category for 2021, touting Ceramic Shield, the world's first transparent and color-free glass-ceramic, as \"virtually indestructible\" and recognizing Gorilla Glass Victus as the toughest Gorilla Glass yet. \u2047 We continue to see strong demand for both of these premium products. \u2047 In 2021, more than 125 devices, including smartphones, wearables, tablets, and laptops, launched featuring Gorilla Glass. \u2047 And we expanded our capabilities into a new category by introducing Gorilla Glass with DX and DX+ to optimize mobile phone cameras. \u2047 These composite products create an attractive opportunity to increase our revenue per device. \u2047 Finally, in 2021, Apple awarded Corning an additional $45 million from its Advanced Manufacturing Fund. \u2047 To date, Corning has received $495 million in total from Apple's fund. \u2047 We're investing in multiple new inventions and innovations for mobile consumer electronics, and we're excited about the potential in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 Our leadership in large glass puts us in a position of strength. \u2047 2021 sales grew 17% to $3.7 billion. \u2047 Our volume exceeded glass market growth as we ramped Gen 10.5 facilities that supply glass for large-sized TVs, which are expected to grow at a high-teens compound annual growth rate over the next several years. \u2047 In 2022, we expect overall glass supply to remain tight to balanced and the pricing environment to remain favorable. \u2047 We continue to believe the retail market will grow, led by higher TV unit sales and growth in average screen size. \u2047 Across our markets, long-term growth drivers are strong, and our role is clear. \u2047 We lead in capabilities that are vital to progress. \u2047 Our approach provides exciting opportunities for Corning inventions to make a positive impact on the world. \u2047 And it underscores our commitment to moving the world forward in everything that we do. \u2047 Now, let me give you some examples outside of the operational context. \u2047 In 2021, we hosted COVID-19 vaccination clinics at Corning sites around the world. \u2047 In Reynosa, Mexico, for example, we helped administer more than 100,000 doses of vaccines and boosters to employees and community members. \u2047 And we provided more than 200,000 diagnostic tests for employees around the world. \u2047 We kicked off a five-year, $5.5 million partnership with the nation's largest historically black university, North Carolina A&T. \u2047 Our work will prepare students for STEM careers. \u2047 We engaged our board of directors to provide guidance and resources to our Office of Racial Equality and Social Unity, utilizing our members' diverse experience, gender, age, and ethnicity to advance this new initiative. \u2047 We achieved gender pay equity globally for all salaried employees, and we expanded the reach of our DE&I office with regional business councils. \u2047 And finally, we committed to greenhouse gas goals that align with the Paris Agreement. \u2047 And we signed solar contracts at Hemlock that will help the world address its renewable energy goals. \u2047 I feel very good about our efforts to bolster equality inside and outside the company and our progress on our sustainability initiatives. \u2047 Overall, we continue to build a stronger, more resilient company. \u2047 We're in the early innings of exciting industry transformations, and key trends are converging around our capabilities. \u2047 You can see it in our results, you can see it in our outlook for 2022 and advancement of new businesses toward significant commercial sales over the next few years. \u2047 Of course, to keep advancing during Corning's next 170 years, we must focus on growing and developing our leaders. \u2047 We have a new generation who are stepping up to guide this company through a very exciting phase of its history into the future, and I'm working closely with each of them. \u2047 To that end, I want to recognize Tony as he prepares to hand over the reins to Ed in just a few weeks. \u2047 The strong position we're in today certainly reflects the many contributions he has made throughout more than three decades of excellent service to Corning. \u2047 Ed has long played a key role in the growth and financial strength of our company. \u2047 Tony and I have worked closely with him during that time, and I look forward to the important contributions he will make in this new position. \u2047 Our growth initiatives are succeeding, and we delivered another quarter of excellent year-over-year growth that capped off a truly exceptional year. \u2047 For the full year, sales increased 23% and earnings per share was up 49%. \u2047 All of our segments grew with four out of five increasing sales by a double-digit percentage. \u2047 It was a strong year even compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Since 2019, we have grown sales by 21% and earnings per share by 18%. \u2047 We nearly doubled free cash flow to $1.8 billion, which is a conversion rate of 97% for the year. \u2047 We achieved double-digit ROIC, and we utilized our strong cash generation to reward shareholders. \u2047 We increased our dividend 9%, and we reduced our outstanding shares by 5% through the resumption of share repurchases. \u2047 On so many dimensions, we are feeling great. \u2047 That said, as you heard from Wendell"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly optical communications sales grew 24% yoy to $1.21 billion.  \u2047  sees q1 core earnings
