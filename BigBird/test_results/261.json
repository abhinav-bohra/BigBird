{"article": ["On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher. \u2047 Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties. \u2047 Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 The second quarter was another quarter of solid progress as revenues grew 24.4% and EBITDA grew 12.6%. \u2047 Organic revenue growth accelerated to 2.8%, fueled by low double-digit growth in international and low single-digit growth in North America. \u2047 The sequential improvement in organic growth was driven by new logo wins, increased cross-sell, continued strong retention, and the lessening of previously communicated headwinds. \u2047 We also saw strong sales in the building pipeline for our new solutions, both domestically and internationally, as businesses look to leverage more of our solutions to support their post-pandemic operating models. \u2047 We expect to see a continued ramp in the third and fourth quarters as we execute against our near-term growth strategy and have continued to strengthen the business for the long term with new talent, data assets, partnerships, and solutions that continue to bolster our offerings and provide our clients differentiated insights that help them grow revenues, lower operating costs, and improve the risk and compliance profile. \u2047 Before we jump to our normal business and operations update, I wanted to touch on a few announcements we made in the quarter. \u2047 As Dun & Bradstreet's chief product officer, Ginny comes to us from TransUnion and has over 20 years of experience driving innovation and leading product organizations. \u2047 She manages the overall product strategy for our global portfolio and is focused on driving rapid innovation and developing solutions at scale that enable our clients' success. \u2047 Mike is our chief technology officer and brings more than 25 years of experience and deep technological insight to Dun & Bradstreet. \u2047 Mike joined us from Fiserv and brings with him a proven track record of modernizing and scaling existing platforms for companies such as AOL, Microsoft, and First Data. \u2047 We also established a new location in Jacksonville, Florida, which will serve as our global headquarters. \u2047 We look to leverage this strategic location to help us to continue to innovate and grow, as well as benefit from substantial state and local financial incentives that made this move an easy one. \u2047 And finally, before I move on to the business update, I wanted to share a very special milestone here at Dun & Bradstreet. \u2047 On July 20, we celebrated our 180th year anniversary, which is a testament to the long-standing value D&B has and continues to provide to businesses throughout the world. \u2047 Now, let's move on to our business update. \u2047 On our first-quarter call, we discussed our key priorities for 2021, which are to continue to grow our share of wallet with our strategic customers; to approach and monetize the SMB space in new and innovative ways; to launch new products domestically to localize new and existing products globally; and lastly, to integrate the Bisnode acquisition. \u2047 Throughout the second quarter, our team has made great strides toward executing on these priorities. \u2047 We're pleased with the ongoing success we're having with our strategic clients, which included renewal rates at near 100% and the addition of some exciting new logos. \u2047 In North America, we signed a multiyear deal with Ceridian, a global human capital management software company for Analytics Studio and various sales and marketing products, including the new Rev. \u2047 Up ABX and digital targeting solutions. \u2047 Ceridian was looking to support their growth strategies and, in particular, the ability to connect and activate the offline view of customers and prospects through digital insights. \u2047 They're also focused on strategic global expansion and leveraging our world-based file to better understand addressable markets by region to support growth in target markets. \u2047 Leveraging the investments we've made in nontraditional data and our sales and marketing solutions, we signed additional business with one of the largest online retailers who will be using our data and analytics to support their efforts in growing a new business line that needed help targeting specific retailers in high foot traffic areas such as airports and sports stadiums. \u2047 Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu also entered into a multiyear agreement with us to assist with their client engagement, customer relationship management, and overall master data program. \u2047 Their global data management team was tasked with creating a global master data warehouse that could be used across all markets and will be the central hub for global applications, as well as local markets. \u2047 The team selected our D&B Direct+ API to be the central point for company information, hierarchies, and connections, including our full Family Tree. \u2047 Along with the master data use case, they're also using our insights to inform their investment to drive a more diverse workforce pipeline and, in particular, underrepresented minorities to the public accounting profession. \u2047 We will deliver a microsite with downloadable learning modules and coupled with a multichannel marketing campaign. \u2047 We're proud to support Deloitte in ensuring the success of this fantastic program. \u2047 We also signed a deal with Vintro, an online networking platform, who will be using our comprehensive B2B data, as well as our insights and AI-driven platforms to enable their clients to accelerate global opportunity and innovation. \u2047 In addition to the direct sale, we're also partnering with Vintro on a new platform to enhance the supply chain ecosystem through enhanced access to SMBs. \u2047 Turning to our international segment. \u2047 We're making strong progress on the Global 500 account program we rolled out in the first quarter, demonstrated by several wins in the second quarter. \u2047 One of these was a significant expansion of our long-standing relationship with Barclays through a multiyear enterprisewide agreement supporting their global master client data and insight strategy. \u2047 Barclays will be using D&B's comprehensive global data cloud for a multitude of use cases. \u2047 Globally consistent and identifiable by the DUNS number, our data will enable a broader and deeper view of every customer and prospect from intent data to financial and regulatory information. \u2047 Barclays was looking for an end-to-end global solution, and we stood alone in our ability to deliver such an outcome. \u2047 In D&B Europe, our newly acquired Bisnode region, we signed several deals with Global 500 companies as our strategy to become the provider of choice in Central Europe has begun to bear fruit. \u2047 Bayer, a life science company with more than 150-year history and core competencies in the areas of healthcare and agriculture, signed a three-year global contract for D&B data by multiple delivery platforms. \u2047 This deal will support Bayer in organizing and managing their third-party records across various software platforms. \u2047 Deutsche Bank signed a new contract to use our local German database to support their sales efforts. \u2047 After various data and usability comparisons, they chose D&B over their previous provider, a large international competitor. \u2047 We continue to build and grow relationships with Global 500 companies. \u2047 At the end of the second quarter, nearly three-quarters of the Global 500 companies are clients of ours, a significant increase from year-end 2019 that was closer to two-thirds. \u2047 While we continue to deepen relationships with our strategic clients, we're also seeing positive trends in the small and midsized markets. \u2047 As it relates to our second priority, addressing the SMB market in new and innovative ways, we started with the build-out of our D&B product and data marketplaces. \u2047 The D&B product marketplace was created to provide a curated set of our solutions, as well as partner solutions designed for small business. \u2047 It now has 20 partners, the newest of which are Brex and LendingTree along with other major brands such as Microsoft, Comcast Business, AT&T Business, Mastercard, and Symantec. \u2047 The D&B Data Marketplace where users can now buy a broader range of prematched, independent data sets from alternative data providers, now includes data sets such as commercial real estate, job postings, shipping, healthcare, and U.S. agricultural data. \u2047 We currently have 36 partner data sets as of the end of the second quarter, up from 22 at the end of the first quarter. \u2047 Now turning to our e-commerce strategy. \u2047 We continue to see more and more attention in our digital assets. \u2047 In the second quarter, we saw dnb.com site visits continue to grow with over 46 million visits in Q2, an 84% increase over prior Q2. \u2047 While the vast majority of customers are coming for CreditSignal and monitoring services, we're also beginning to see increased demand for our sales and marketing solutions. \u2047 Overall, we hit more than $2 million in e-commerce sales in Q2, up 73% from prior-year quarter, and are forecasting sales to double again by the end of the third quarter. \u2047 This, combined with our D&B Marketplaces, are expected to drive nearly $10 million in incremental annual recurring revenues by year-end, and we look forward to updating you in the coming quarters on our progress. \u2047 Our third priority is launching new products and use cases. \u2047 Last quarter, we announced D&B Rev. \u2047 Up ABX, a solution that simplifies and automates marketing and sales workflows for our clients. \u2047 Since its launch, we closed six deals with ACV of nearly $2 million and with a strong and growing pipeline as awareness spreads and further enhancements are added to the platform. \u2047 We're excited to now take the Rev. \u2047 Up capabilities to the SMB marketplace with the launch of D&B Rev. \u2047 Up Now brings enterprise digital marketing technology, once only available to large-size businesses, to SMBs so that they can find and engage their best customers without having the cost and complexity of an in-house analytics department. \u2047 We're also bolstering our sales and marketing solutions through our alliance with Zeta Global. \u2047 We are bringing together trusted consumer and private business data into a single, highly secured data cloud that contains profiles on over 220 million individuals in the United States. \u2047 The Data Cloud combines Zeta's business-to-consumer data, including individuals' intent, behavioral, transactional, and location-based signals with Dun & Bradstreet's business-to-business data, including employer data such as companies, titles, and emails, to power a new market sector we refer to as business-to-person or B2P, which will enable businesses to unlock the buying power of decision-makers through this uniquely combined data set offering, a true 360-degree view of an individual and the ability to reach them through both business and consumer-based activation channels. \u2047 And last but not least, I'm excited to announce the launch of D&B ESG Intelligence, which delivers a standardized score and analytics built from the Dun & Bradstreet Data Cloud and established sustainability standards. \u2047 Our ESG rankings cover 12 ESG themes and 32 topic-specific categories to help our clients best understand specific risks and opportunities. \u2047 We believe this is another great example of how we can leverage the power of our Data Cloud and the DUNS number to create consistent and comprehensive rankings for businesses of all sizes throughout the globe. \u2047 This deep coverage and breakdown of specific ESG topic rankings helps compliance and procurement teams track and report on specific ESG factors that increase growth and reduce risk. \u2047 Similar to how PAYDEX established the de facto commercial credit score, we see the opportunity to set a standardized commercial ESG score that will help underwriters procurement organizations, investors, and many other areas quickly analyze and action new customers, vendors, suppliers, investments, and partners in an accurate and efficient manner. \u2047 In our international segment, we continue to focus on rolling out localized solutions across our owned and partner markets. \u2047 In the second quarter, we delivered 14 product launches across Europe, Greater China, and the Worldwide Network partner markets. \u2047 including important new solutions, D&B Finance Analytics, D&B Risk Analytics, and Data Blocks. \u2047 We also expanded distribution of D&B Onboard and Direct+ across the slew of worldwide network partners. \u2047 In D&B Europe, we continue to see good traction from existing D&B products, like D&B Credit, Direct+ and D&B Onboard, while also introducing new products, including D&B Finance Analytics and Risk Analytics in the Nordic markets, Optimizer in the Nordics and Southeast Europe, and Data Blocks in Central Europe. \u2047 These solutions will enable us to execute our strategy of migrating customers off legacy offerings onto modern digital platforms, as well as attract new customers. \u2047 These solutions, along with the many we have discussed over the past few quarters, are allowing us to create a significant amount of new product revenue. \u2047 For North America and international combined, the New Product Vitality Index, or the percentage of revenues from new products, was 6% in Q2. \u2047 For context, we began measuring this stat in Q1 of 2019, and it's up already from 0.2% in Q2 of 2019. \u2047 We will continue to drive more and more new solutions into our markets around the world and look forward to updating you on our progress through the coming quarters. \u2047 I'm pleased to report that integration is going as planned with top-line performance in line and synergy realization coming in slightly ahead of expectations. \u2047 We've executed more than $25 million in annualized savings from actions taken through Q2. \u2047 Savings are being driven by the consolidation of functions across our global team, as well as executing a broad real estate strategy, including vacating, reducing the footprint of 14 office locations. \u2047 On the Bisnode operations side, we implemented a new global data framework across D&B Europe markets to ensure consistent monitoring and enhancement of database breadth and quality. \u2047 We have already made key data improvements, including the failure scores in Nordic markets in Germany, growing the database of nonregistered companies in Central Europe, and increasing financial statement data in Switzerland. \u2047 These initiatives are intended to improve retention, to enhance customer satisfaction, as well as demand for data from our global customers. \u2047 Overall, I'm pleased with our continued transformation, and I'm excited about the progress we continue to make, laying the foundation for accelerated sustainable growth throughout the remainder of 2021 and into 2022. \u2047 Today, I will discuss our second-quarter 2021 results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, second-quarter revenues were $521 million, an increase of 24% or 23% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter. \u2047 This includes the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $2 million. \u2047 Net loss for the second quarter on a GAAP basis was $52 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.12, compared to a net loss of $208 million for the prior-year quarter. \u2047 The improvement was primarily driven by higher prior-year expenses related to the retirement of debt as part of the"], "gold_summary": ["q2
