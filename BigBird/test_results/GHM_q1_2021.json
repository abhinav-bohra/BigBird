{"article": ["Certain risk factors inherent in our business are set forth in filings with the SEC, including our most recent 10-K and subsequent filings. \u2047 We caution you not to place undue reliance on these statements. \u2047 Some of the comments made refer to non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted net revenue, adjusted operating margin and adjusted earnings per share, which we believe are more reflective of our ongoing performance. \u2047 Joining me on the call are Jeff Sloan, CEO; Cameron Bready, President and COO; and Paul Todd, Senior Executive Vice President and CFO. \u2047 We delivered record third quarter results, despite the incremental challenges that emerged during the period from COVID-19. \u2047 Highlighting the resiliency of our business model and our ongoing track record of execution across market cycles. \u2047 We also surpassed $2 billion of quarterly adjusted net revenue for the first time in our history with record margins and produced all-time high quarterly adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow. \u2047 As we detailed at our investor conference just a short time ago on September 8th. \u2047 The trend toward accelerated digitization coming out of the pandemic has benefited our business by reinforcing that mode of competition, and this quarter provided further proof points of the wisdom of our approach to drive differentiated growth across the four pillars of our strategy. \u2047 First, we extended long-standing relationships with both CITI and CIBC, as a reflection of our promise as a top quartile software-as-a-service or SaaS technology company with unmatched worldwide payments expertise. \u2047 Our durable partnerships with some of the most sophisticated and complex institutions globally speak to our competitiveness, well into the remainder of this decade. \u2047 Starting with CITI, we are delighted to have furthered our relationship with one of our largest commercial card customers for another eight years. \u2047 This agreement highlights a key element of what is already today a successful B2B business at scale. \u2047 More on this new pillars to our strategy in a moment. \u2047 We're also pleased to have renewed our issuer relationship with CIBC a top 10 customer in North America that spans both its consumer credit and debit portfolios for an extended term. \u2047 As we discussed in September, we also continue to build our pipelines with AWS to include additional fintechs, neobanks and embedded finance players spanning multiple geographies. \u2047 We now have 25 active prospects in our issuer pipeline with AWS, up from 20 last quarter and four at the end of 2020. \u2047 We also currently have 10 letters of intent with institutions worldwide, six of which are competitive takeaways; two of our recent LOI's have gone to contract. \u2047 We're also excited to announce that together with AWS, we signed an agreement with London based 10x to integrate its cloud native, core banking platform with TSYS is payments as service capabilities. \u2047 Allowing us to collaborate on modern core banking and issuing solutions for neobank and traditional financial institution customers. \u2047 As we announced at our Investor Conference, we now have a terrific partner in Virgin Money for our first use case combining issuing and acquiring capabilities to offer transaction stream optimization solutions. \u2047 It's worth noting that Virgin Money is also a significant competitive takeaway for us. \u2047 Simply put, we're winning in our Issuer Solutions business, because we are selling more market-leading technologies to more distinctive and defensible distribution channels in more markets than we ever have previously. \u2047 And our vertical markets businesses where we lead with SaaS at top of the funnel, we were delighted to announce our new partnership with Mercedes-Benz Stadium in September. \u2047 As we highlighted, we believe that we were successful, because of our ability to seamlessly and uniquely combine software, hardware and payments across in-person mobile and online channels. \u2047 We expect to facilitate a best-in-class fan experience through market leading commerce enablement solutions. \u2047 We're now in pilot with Mercedes-Benz Stadium and we expect to be fully live early in 2022. \u2047 We're gratified that after combating the payments landscape an extensive RFP, including with a full spectrum of new markets entrance. \u2047 This sophisticated institution terminated their existing relationships and chose us for our software and payment technologies with a commitment well into the back half of this decade. \u2047 Further across our merchant technology enabled businesses, our POS software solutions generated revenue growth of nearly 70%, compared to 2019 in the third quarter. \u2047 And our central education business in Australia grew over 50% versus 2019, despite lockdowns in that market. \u2047 In addition to the key win at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, our GO[Phonetic] business delivered record bookings in the third quarter and also had notable successes with Subway, Whataburger, Bojangles, RBI and Wendy's. \u2047 Spanning software, hardware payments and data and analytics. \u2047 These results highlight the benefits we're seeing from the accelerated digitization in our markets. \u2047 Our e-commerce and omnichannel businesses drove growth in excess of 20% again this quarter. \u2047 This business is another example of pandemic induced accelerate digitization benefiting us with current growth rates one-third faster than pre-COVID-19 levels. \u2047 A few examples of durable success here this quarter: we broadened our relationship with Uber and Uber Eats into an additional market in Asia Pacific beyond Taiwan. \u2047 We expanded our long-standing relationship with the Swatch Group to now include e-commerce alongside the solutions we provide in-store today across North America and Asia Pacific. \u2047 And we went live with Google as a merchant in multiple markets in Asia Pacific exactly as we said we would. \u2047 We remain on track to launch Google run and grow my business this quarter. \u2047 And we're already working on the launch of the next phase to help our merchants grow faster by connecting additional Google services, including online ordering, retail inventory and reservation to our digital platform. \u2047 These solutions will over time drive more consumers to our merchants and dramatically expand our value proposition with one of the leading technology players worldwide. \u2047 We are also very pleased to announce today that we have extended and expanded the scope of our relationship with PayPal, one of the most sophisticated payments companies globally. \u2047 This multi-year partnership leverages our unparalleled e-commerce technology footprint across cross-border in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. \u2047 And it will dramatically expand our target addressable markets over its term. \u2047 We've added new geographies additional verticals and support crypto currencies for the first time. \u2047 Together with CITI, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Virgin Money and CIBC, what better testament to our current and future competitiveness. \u2047 As we said in September, we continue to benefit from ongoing innovation in our ecosystem, including Buy Now Pay Later or BNPL Technologies. \u2047 We expect to enable more than 1.5 billion BNPL transactions this year alone and we anticipate issuing more than 15 million virtual cards with more than $23 billion in volume. \u2047 It's a market we know well, because it's a market that we've been serving for decades globally. \u2047 As BNPL continues to grow, we believe we're well positioned given our presence worldwide and our unique offerings the benefit. \u2047 Examples of our exposure include through network initiatives, traditional issuers, private label or charge card and program management, virtual card issuance, non-traditional issuers, including fintech, start-ups and neobanks, unique collaborations with AWS and Google, large existing scale players looking to expand BNPL globally into new markets and with added functionality. \u2047 And of course the acceptance from our unmatched virtual and physical footprint with BNPL is just one of the many services at the point of sale in our commerce enablement ecosystem. \u2047 At the end of the day, the entity is cash and check and further digitization including BNPL is the mode of competition. \u2047 Our ability throughout the pandemic to sustainably expand our rates of growth relative to our markets has been indicative of our technology leadership. \u2047 This quarter was no exception with our global merchant acquiring businesses delivering 900 basis points of outperformance relative to the credit trends reported by the card networks last week. \u2047 Our consistent track record of share gains during the pandemic is something we highlighted at our Investor Conference. \u2047 I'm also delayed to report that we have successfully closed our acquisition of MineralTree in October. \u2047 After having announced our formal entry into the B2B market in September. \u2047 As we highlighted, then we have many of the elements of a B2B offering post our merger with TSYS in 2019. \u2047 And in addition at MineralTree's digitize payable solutions serves to enhance our B2B product suite and expands our opportunity set in one of the largest and most under penetrated markets in software and payments. \u2047 We intend to further scale our business rapidly. \u2047 In addition to MineralTree and the extension of our commercial partnership with CITI, we had several other notable B2B achievements in the third quarter. \u2047 These include a new relationship with WeatherTech in our Heartland business for B2B, as well as B2C acceptance. \u2047 Near 50% payroll solutions growth in the third quarter, compared to 2019. \u2047 And a 10-fold increase in the number of customer locations using our Tips solution from our business and consumer segment for disbursement, since the beginning of the pandemic. \u2047 We continue to have tremendous firepower to conduct strategic transactions with billions of available capacity. \u2047 Of course this is on top of the $2.5 billion we have already invested over the last year. \u2047 During the pandemic in acquisitions consistent with our strategic focus, including our emphasis on faster growth geographies. \u2047 And it's in addition to the nearly $2 billion, we've returned to shareholders over the last year. \u2047 To that end, we are pleased to have now closed our acquisition of Bankia's merchant acquiring business together with our partners at CaixaBank last month, deepening our presence in one of the most attractive markets in Europe. \u2047 And through our Erste joint venture, we also very recently closed the acquisition of Worldline's PayOne Austrian POS acquiring assets, enabling us to bring our distinctive distribution and market leading technologies at scale to get another attractive market. \u2047 And our pipeline remains full, despite the investments we have already made over the last 12-months. \u2047 The majority of which has been in software assets in furtherance of our long-standing technology enablement thesis. \u2047 Our financial performance in the third quarter of 2021 exceeded our expectations, despite incremental headwinds from COVID-19 and the delta variant during the period. \u2047 Specifically, we delivered record quarterly adjusted net revenue of just over $2 billion representing 15% growth, compared to the prior year and 10% growth, compared to 2019. \u2047 Adjusted operating margin for the third quarter was a record 42.8%, a 170 basis point improvement from the prior year and a 420 basis point improvement relative to 2019. \u2047 The net result was record quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $2.18, an increase of 28%, compared to the same period for both the prior year and 2019. \u2047 Taking a closer look at our performance by segment. \u2047 Merchant Solutions achieved adjusted net revenue of $1.36 billion for the third quarter, a 21% improvement from the prior year and a 13% improvement, compared to 2019. \u2047 We are also pleased that our acquiring business is globally generated 22% and 19% adjusted net revenue growth, compared to the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 respectively. \u2047 This was led by continued strength in the US, while we also benefited from improving trends in international markets, including Spain, Central Europe and Greater China. \u2047 Focusing on our technology enabled portfolio, we continue to see consistent growth in our Global Payments Integrated business as we deliver a vertically fluent suite of commerce enablement solutions across dozens of vertical markets. \u2047 As we highlighted at the Investor Conference, a number of our businesses, including our integrated business have grown right through COVID-19 and are now at levels that we would have otherwise expected them to achieve, absent the downturn. \u2047 Our worldwide e-commerce and omnichannel solutions delivered growth in excess of 20% year-on-year, once again this quarter as we continue to benefit from our unique ability to seamlessly blend that difficult and virtual worlds and create frictionless experiences for our customers on a global basis. \u2047 As far, our own software businesses in the US, we are pleased that the overall portfolio delivered strong sequential improvement as the recovery begins to take root in some of the more impacted vertical markets. \u2047 Given the positive booking trends we have seen throughout the pandemic, including this quarter we are confident that the business is most impacted by COVID-19 in this portfolio remain on a path to recovery. \u2047 We delivered an adjusted operating margin of 49.3% in the Merchant Solutions segment, an increase of 200 basis points from the same period in 2020, as we continue to benefit from the underlying strength of our business mix and the realization of cost synergies related to the merger. \u2047 Moving to Issuer Solutions, we are pleased to have delivered $458 million in adjusted net revenue, a 6% improvement from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 This performance was driven by the continued recovery in transaction volumes, as well as growth in accounts on file, while non-volume based revenue increased mid single-digits during the period, including low double-digit growth in or out with services business again this quarter. \u2047 Issuer adjusted operating margins of 43.4% were up slightly from the prior year. \u2047 As you may recall Issuer Solutions achieved margin expansion of 500 basis points in the third quarter of 2020 over 2019, fueled by our focus on driving efficiencies in the business. \u2047 We are also pleased that our Issuer team signed five long-term contract extensions during the quarter, and our strong pipeline, including the growing list of opportunities we have in collaboration with AWS continues to bode well for our future performance. \u2047 Finally our Business and Consumer Solutions segment delivered adjusted net revenue of $208 million, representing growth of 2% on a reported basis for the third quarter. \u2047 Adjusting for the stimulus benefits and higher unemployment volumes last year, our adjusted net revenue growth was in line with our targeted growth range for the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted operating margin for Business and Consumer Solutions was consistent with the prior year at 25.6% after expanding more than 700 basis points during the third quarter of 2020, as a direct result of our efforts to streamline costs and drive greater operational efficiencies at Netspend. \u2047 Further, we are pleased with the early progress we are making on our strategic partnership we announced last quarter with AWS in this business. \u2047 While we also launched and began selling our earned wage access solution to existing B2B clients and into new vertical markets during the period. \u2047 The outstanding performance we delivered across our businesses this quarter serves as a further proof point that we continue to gain share and that our four-pillared strategy positions us well to capitalize on the accelerating digital trend coming out of the pandemic. \u2047 From a cash flow standpoint, we generated roughly $850 million during the third quarter and remain on track with our"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $2.18.  \u2047  provides updated outlook for 2021.  \u2047  sees fy adjusted earnings per share $8.10 to $8.20.  \u2047  sees fy
