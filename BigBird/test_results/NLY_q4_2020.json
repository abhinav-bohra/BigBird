any obligation to update or revise this information. \u2047 As a reminder, Annaly routinely posts important information for investors on the company's website, www. \u2047 Please also note this event is being recorded. \u2047 Today, I'll provide an update on the broader market, our capital allocation trends, including credit activity, and our outlook. \u2047 Ilker Ertas, our head of securitized products will follow-up with specific commentary on our agency and hedging activity, and Serena will review our financial results. \u2047 And as Sean noted, our other business heads are also present to provide additional context during Q&A. \u2047 The primary themes, the dominated markets in the fourth quarter are largely consistent with our third-quarter narrative. \u2047 The Fed's monetary policy accommodation provided considerable support for risk assets and contained interest rate volatility. \u2047 This backdrop, coupled with active portfolio management, drove our strong performance to close out the year as we delivered an economic return of 5.1% for the quarter, ensuring a positive return for our shareholders for 2020 which is particularly notable given the historic disruption we all faced in March. \u2047 Now turning to the macro environment. \u2047 The yield curve bears steepened in the fourth quarter in light of optimism about the post-COVID economic recovery which outweighed the negative developments of record virus cases and the resulting lackluster economic growth to end the year. \u2047 We have seen a continuation of this rate move into 2021 largely due to the results of the January runoff election and democratic control of each branch of government, leading to greater prospects' further stimulus. \u2047 witnesses a meaningful recovery in labor markets and higher inflation readings. \u2047 Thus, the Fed is expected to continue purchasing assets at their current pace through 2021 while forward guidance will keep the front end anchored. \u2047 We do think the shift to higher longer-term rates will be gradual. \u2047 Nonetheless, it remains prudent to hedge the tail risk of a spike in rates as we'll discuss shortly. \u2047 Now to address how this landscape influences our positioning and capital allocation, monetary policy tailwinds maintain agency as the primary vehicle for reinvestment of portfolio runoff. \u2047 And we remain comfortable with the agency market for reasons Ilker will discuss, but the continued spread tightening does leave us cautious on higher levels of leverage. \u2047 Fiscal stimulus should ensure healthy consumer spending once the economy reopens more broadly and service consumption can resume which should be a constructive backdrop for credit. \u2047 Our allocation to credit marginally increased to 22%, as we began the fourth quarter at the lower end of our range. \u2047 And targeted opportunities, largely in residential credit and middle market lending modestly tilted the relative value equation back toward certain pockets of credit. \u2047 It should be noted, however, that risk assets continue to see strong sponsorship and associated spread contraction, given liquidity in the system, and optimism for a cyclical recovery which necessitates a very disciplined approach to asset selection as our investment teams consistently employed. \u2047 With respect to our residential credit business specifically, we found the unrated NPL and RPL securities sector attractive, as we discussed last quarter which drove much of the $400 million growth in our residential securities portfolio during the quarter. \u2047 Within the CRT universe, we have rotated our investments up the capital structure with a focus on very short spread duration assets that have strong deleveraging profiles in light of elevated prepayment speeds. \u2047 Spreads on our non-agency securities purchased in the fourth quarter have rallied over 100 basis points, given the strength of the market to date this year. \u2047 Although securities remain an important part of our portfolio as they provide opportunistic relative value, we were encouraged to see volumes once again gained traction within the non-QM loan market. \u2047 Our expanded prime whole loan effort continues to be a priority and we are focused on new strategic relationships to grow our sourcing capabilities which builds further optionality for us within residential finance. \u2047 Turning to middle market lending. \u2047 Activity picked up in the fourth quarter as liquidity reentered the sector and we were able to grow our portfolio nearly 10% to $2.2 billion. \u2047 Of the nearly $400 million of gross activity in the quarter, 80% was first lien and included both new and existing borrowers. \u2047 As discussed on recent earnings calls, our targeted investment strategy continues to differentiate our portfolio relative to our peers, and our middle market lending group's disciplined credit focus has proven itself out through strong fundamentals with underlying borrower LTM EBITDA, increasing by 14% on average since initial close. \u2047 We continue to maintain an active dialogue with our borrowers and sponsors, and our watch list performance improved by 43% this quarter, underscoring the health of our portfolio. \u2047 Our commercial real estate portfolio decreased somewhat quarter over quarter. \u2047 While we were able to resume origination activity this past fall, volume did not offset the $108 million in pay downs, as well as, an opportunistic sale in our healthcare portfolio. \u2047 The $150 million sale price for a portion of our skilled nursing facilities which closed in the fourth quarter, resulted in an IRR of 35% for the portfolio and then nearly 2 times equity multiple. \u2047 Now shifting to the financing of our portfolio which Serena will discuss in greater detail, I would just like to note that borrowing conditions that exist today are the best we've seen during the company's two-plus decade history. \u2047 The liquidity in the system has shifted the market advantage to the borrower, much more so than in past periods of monetary accommodation. \u2047 It's not just the absolute low level of rates, but also the flat term structure of the repo curve which signals the persistence of an ample borrowing capacity and also affords us the ability to fund agency MBS out a year inside of a mere 20 basis points. \u2047 Additionally, on the financing front, securitization markets have rebounded substantially, resulting in execution inside of pre pandemic levels. \u2047 This continued momentum provides attractive nonrecourse term financing to bolster our asset generation strategy and diversify funding for our whole loan business. \u2047 Now prevailing financing and securitization dynamics have made both balance sheet and structural leverage more attractive than capital structure leverage in the current environment as evidenced by our recent preferred stock redemption which was prudent from both the capital management and efficiency standpoint and follows a series of transactions since 2017 to reduce our cost of capital and preferred equity. \u2047 We have differentiated ourselves from others in the REIT sector by growing capital structure leverage more slowly and maintaining a relatively stable amount of total leverage on common equity which is important as we've seen a higher portion of capital structure leverage lead to higher volatility in returns, if not well managed. \u2047 Annaly is unique in that our size, expense ratio, and liquidity afford us the flexibility to manage our capital exclusively in an accretive fashion. \u2047 Proactive capital management remains a priority and we renewed our common stock repurchase program authorization following $209 million in repurchases in 2020. \u2047 Lastly, despite the attractiveness of balance sheet leverage and funding, we remain disciplined with respect to our overall leverage profile. \u2047 We've reduced leverage in each quarter since the end of 2019 through last year and maintained leverage at 6.2 times quarter over quarter, the lowest we've had since the first quarter of 2017. \u2047 We strive to deliver the highest risk-adjusted return for our shareholders and I'm confident our current risk construct is appropriate to yield book value and earnings stability going forward. \u2047 Now with that, I'll hand it over to Ilker to dive deeper into our agency portfolio activity. \u2047 As David mentioned, the agency portfolio had a strong quarter, supported by healthy investor demand, both low in-flight and realized interest rate volatility, and steepening yield curve. \u2047 Lower coupon TBAs were the strongest performing part of the agency market as they benefited directly from Fed purchases. \u2047 However, in contrast to prior episodes of QE, specified pools have also demonstrated solid performance. \u2047 Given the current elevated prepayment environment, the desire for more cash flow certainty and a strong bid for longer duration mortgage assets, we are seeing the level of pay-ups which stand higher rates and steeper curve experienced over the quarter and into 2021. \u2047 Apart from Fed, Agency MBS demand remains robust, led by notable appetite from commercial bank community. \u2047 In the current environment, banks are seeing strong deposit growth while C&I loan growth remains muted. \u2047 In fact, the loan-to-deposit ratio for the sector is the lowest we have seen in the past 50 years. \u2047 With deposits continuing to rise, banks have chosen to grow their securities portfolios which directly benefits MBS valuations and strengthens the specified pool market. \u2047 Looking at 2020 data, banks[Inaudible] set net bought over $1 trillion MBS in aggregate which was more than twice the available net agency supply last year. \u2047 Turning to composition of our MBS portfolio. \u2047 Our lower coupon holdings remain largely in TBAs while our higher coupons are predominantly improved. \u2047 This barbell approach maximizes liquidity and benefits from high levels of nominal care in the dollar roll market while providing cash flow stability across diverse interest rate environments from our pools. \u2047 Approximately, 86% of our pool portfolio consists of higher coupon quality specified pools which provides us with improved convexity and prepayment protection, while the remainder is mainly concentrated in seasoned pools, which are beginning to experience prepayment burnout. \u2047 The value of our asset selection is evidenced by the prepayment speeds on our portfolio of just under 25 CPR or roughly 10 CPRs slower than the MBS universe over the quarter. \u2047 In terms of portfolio activity, portfolio runoff was reinvested in lower coupon TBAs and we also rotated out of some of our higher coupon TBAs into specified pools. \u2047 On the hedging side, we added to our treasury features and swaption positions, mostly in the 10-year part of the yield curve which benefited from the steepening in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Hedging costs remain relatively inexpensive in this low rate and low volatility environment. \u2047 We also want to be positioned for further rising yields under the scenario, where optimism on the economic recovery leads to higher long end interest rates in the medium-term. \u2047 Given how well risk assets have performed since the second half of 2020, the agency reinvestment landscape is somewhat less attractive than earlier in the year. \u2047 However, our outlook for agency MBS remains constructive due to a number of factors. \u2047 First, the availability of attractive funding in the repo and dollar roll markets. \u2047 David addressed the repo market. \u2047 And as for rolls, as we forecasted on the last call, gross specialness has moderated somewhat with market being repopulated with new collateral beyond that, which has been delivered to Fed. \u2047 We still achieved a net negative financing cost for our TBAs over the quarter and we expect current production coupon rolls will remain modestly special over the near-term. \u2047 Secondly, we expect the technical backdrop of strong demand for agency MBS to persist over the course of this year given nominal carry and continued bank demand. \u2047 And finally, there is a -- there is potential for improved prepayment profile, resulting from steeper yield curve and very early signs of burnout in prepayments. \u2047 To expand on that point, we observed from recent data that the primary secondary spread is narrowing despite more than 75% of the universe having greater than 50 basis points of refinancing incentive. \u2047 In addition, average time to refinance loans has steadily increased from 40 days this past spring to almost 60 days as of late. \u2047 This suggests that[Inaudible] of easily refinanced target is decreasing for originators, requiring incremental efforts to find eligible borrowers. \u2047 So for the first time since last spring, the prepayment environment may not be as big of a headwind for higher coupon MBS. \u2047 As a final point, we note that we cannot look at Agency MBS in isolation. \u2047 During previous QEs, other risk assets like the MBS tightening and gave private investors opportunity to rotate into these asset classes. \u2047 In contrast, during the current QE, nearly all spread products tightened in line, if not more than agency MBS. \u2047 As a result, we remain constructive on the outlook for agency MBS. \u2047 Before I get started with the numbers, I just wanted to comment that December 2020 marks my first year with the company as CFO. \u2047 Over the year, the company performed exceptionally well given the challenges we faced. \u2047 Our results and performance during 2020 reinforced the reasons I was compelled to join the Annaly team which include our human capital, differentiated risk culture, and robust infrastructure built around the businesses in terms of finance, legal, technology, and other support functions. \u2047 During 2020, Annaly demonstrated a 23-year old company's steadfast nature while exhibiting an adept industry leaders agility. \u2047 So with that as a backdrop, today I'll provide brief financial highlights for the quarter ended December 31st, 2020 and discuss select year-to-date metrics. \u2047 As David mentioned earlier, the primary drivers of performance were an extension of themes from last quarter. \u2047 We took advantage of the interest rate and financing environment to generate strong results while prudently managing leverage. \u2047 To set the stage with some summary information, our book value per share was $8.92 for Q4, a 2.5% increase from Q3. \u2047 Book value increased on GAAP net income, partially offset by the aggregate common and preferred dividends of $344 million or $0.25 per share and other comprehensive loss of $215 million or $0.16 per share. \u2047 We generated core earnings per share, excluding PAA, of $0.30, a decrease of 6% or $0.02 per share from the prior quarter. \u2047 Our core earnings also represent 140% of our dividend and we saw back-to-back quarters of 13% plus of core ROE. \u2047 Combining our book value performance for the $0.22 common dividend we declared during Q4, our quarterly economic return was 5.1%. \u2047 We generated a full-year economic return of 1.76% and a total shareholder return of 2.43%. \u2047 While down compared to prior years, we are proud of our positive 2020 return given the unprecedented market conditions we faced earlier this year. \u2047 Delving deeper into the GAAP results, we generated GAAP net income of $879 million or $0.60 per common share for Q4, down from $1 billion or $0.70 per common share in the prior quarter. \u2047 GAAP net income decreased primarily due to lower realized gains on investments resulting from fewer agency MBS sales in Q4 versus Q3. \u2047 However, GAAP net income benefited from higher unrealized gains on interest rate swaps driven by higher rates. \u2047 Additionally, we recorded higher gains on other derivatives, largely futures, offset by lower gains in fair value option loans and securities, and lower interest expense on lower average repo rate, down to 35 basis"], "gold_summary": ["q4 gaap earnings per share $0.60.  \u2047  core earnings (excluding paa) of $0.30 per average common share for quarter."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q4 earnings per share $0.60.  \u2047  q4 earnings per share $0.60."]}
