{"article": ["Speaking on the call will be Ocwen's chief executive officer, Glen Messina; and Chief Financial Officer June Campbell. \u2047 You should bear this uncertainty in mind when considering such statements and should not place undue reliance on such statements. \u2047 We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a useful supplement to discussions and analysis of our financial condition and an alternate way to view certain aspects of our business that is instructed. \u2047 Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for the company's reported results under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. \u2047 So we'll get started with some highlights for the third quarter. \u2047 I'm really proud of what our team has accomplished and really appreciate all their hard work. \u2047 We delivered strong GAAP net income and adjusted pre-tax income, and our ROE exceeded guidance largely due to strong top-line performance. \u2047 I believe this demonstrates the strong operating leverage we have in our business. \u2047 This was our eighth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted pre-tax income. \u2047 Our team continues to execute well against our operating objectives, strong originations growth and servicing additions, solid operational execution, and performance. \u2047 Cost reduction is tracking ahead of targets. \u2047 We also closed our planned call rights transaction for the third quarter and have deployed more than 50% of MAM's investment commitment. \u2047 October as well, we had some milestones. \u2047 So in October, we closed our acquisition of the RMS reverse mortgage servicing platform. \u2047 And also in October, I'm pleased to announce that we exceeded our recapture rate objective. \u2047 We continue to make solid progress on our actions to expand our addressable market. \u2047 We're growing in higher-margin channels, services, and products giving us strong momentum, and the RMS platform acquisition gives us access to a potential $86 billion reverse mortgage subservicing market, which is an exciting new growth opportunity for us. \u2047 And finally, we continue to navigate a volatile and unpredictable environment, and I'll talk a bit more about that later. \u2047 Originations again delivered really solid performance against our operating objectives. \u2047 We closed $20 billion in total servicing additions in the third quarter with very strong performance in subservicing additions. \u2047 With the closing of the TCB acquisition, correspondent volume doubled versus last quarter. \u2047 The TCB team is off to a really strong start, and I'm so glad to have them with us and appreciate the contributions they're making to the business. \u2047 We're seeing great results from our actions to grow subservicing. \u2047 We secured $20 billion in new awards and expect this volume to commence boarding in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our subservicing pipeline has never been more robust. \u2047 Our top 10 prospects represent roughly $63 billion in opportunity, and our total prospect pipeline has grown to slightly over $200 billion. \u2047 We're excited about this activity level and believe we have a very compelling value proposition. \u2047 I'll spend a little bit more time on our subservicing value prop a little bit later. \u2047 Our enterprise sales approach and the TCP acquisition have allowed us to grow our base of sellers to 700 at the end of Q3. \u2047 That's roughly 2.5 times over third quarter last year, and we're continuing to grow. \u2047 Nondelegated and Best Efforts delivery services were rolled out as expected, and we're seeing steady adoption as well. \u2047 Our Ginnie Mae product mix is improving. \u2047 It's up to about 10% of total originations, excluding co-issue, we're still well below industry mix in Ginnie Mae. \u2047 So I believe we have room for improvement here. \u2047 We recently attended the MBA, Mortgage Bankers Association Annual Convention and client attendance at our meeting room exceeded our expectations, and the response to the quality of our team and operating execution was very positive. \u2047 We look forward to serving them and supporting new clients as we expand our addressable market. \u2047 Our Consumer Direct team continues to improve recapture performance. \u2047 We did see a little bit of slippage in the third quarter versus the second quarter due to accelerated runoff in select client portfolios versus Q2. \u2047 That said, we saw a very strong recovery in October with refinance recapture rate achievement of 36%, which is a milestone for us and a huge congratulations to our recapture team. \u2047 We believe we're on track to meet our 30% refinance recapture rate objectives in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Overall, our originations team is making terrific progress against their objectives for this year, and they're energized for the fourth quarter and for 2022. \u2047 The team continues to make strong progress growing higher-margin products, channels, and services. \u2047 These actions do help us expand our addressable market, as well as deflect margin pressure, as industry buying mobiles contract. \u2047 Year over year, consumer direct volume in both forward and reverse is up 61%, both forward and reverse delivered record retail funding and lock volumes in October. \u2047 The marketing eligible population for our forward recapture business increased about 43% from the second quarter to the third quarter. \u2047 And we now have roughly 174,000 loans where borrowers could save $100 or more per month by refinancing, and our team will be focused on trying to help these borrowers. \u2047 Total reverse originations were up 86% year over year. \u2047 Team is executing very well. \u2047 Our reverse market share is up from 6.5% in third quarter 2020 to 7% in third quarter 2021, and this compares to about 4.2% in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 So great progress by the team, growing our share and our business. \u2047 In forward correspondent, we have meaningful opportunity to grow our best efforts and non-delegated delivery services. \u2047 Our team is focused there, and we've launched those recently. \u2047 Today, these services are just a fraction of the levels we see across the industry generally. \u2047 Our long-term goal is to get best efforts in non-delegated to roughly 25% to 30% of volume and about 40% to 50% of our gain on sale revenues. \u2047 In servicing, continuing to improve cost and customer experience are the key objectives for us, and the team is performing really well. \u2047 To achieve these objectives, we're focused on moving the needle in four key areas: technology, process simplification, scale, and portfolio composition. \u2047 The results have been good so far. \u2047 Overall, servicing operating costs are down roughly 25% from third quarter 2020 levels, and we've already achieved our full year target for 2021. \u2047 Technology is a big driver for us, and our technology agenda has a three-part focus. \u2047 That's reduce cost, improve execution and improve the customer experience. \u2047 We believe our actions to improve client borrower and investor experience are critical elements to support our growth and recapture rate objectives over the long run. \u2047 And with technology as the enabler, we can reduce cost and improve execution at the same time. \u2047 In terms of scale, we've increased our total servicing UPB about 33% versus the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 And our percentage of prime servicing is now 70% of our total servicing UPB. \u2047 In terms of portfolio composition, increasing the percentage of agency loans is helping to increase average loan balance and decrease delinquencies, both of these trends will improve our ratio of operating expenses as a percent of UPB. \u2047 We believe we have tremendous operating leverage in our servicing platform, and we're focused on increasing scale by growing our own servicing and subservicing. \u2047 Again, here, the team continues to perform very well in several areas. \u2047 Average beat of answer and call abandonment rate continued to outperform the industry average as reported by the MBA. \u2047 Our average speed of answer is just a fraction of the MBA average, and abandonment rates are roughly half the industry average. \u2047 We continue to be laser-focused on supporting borrowers who are exiting forbearance and helping them understand their options. \u2047 We believe the best path for the homeowner and the investor is to find what works within investor guidelines to keep the consumer in their home. \u2047 In this regard, we outperformed the industry as reported by the MBA, relating to the percentage of borrowers with an agency loan who exit forbearance with the reinstatement or loss mitigation solution in place. \u2047 Between September 2020 and June 2021, roughly 93% of our borrowers who exited forbearance had a reinstatement or loss mitigation plan in place, and that compares to the industry average of 83%. \u2047 And what that means is about 7% of our borrowers on forbearance have exited without a reinstatement plan or a loss mitigation solution versus over 17% for the industry. \u2047 Based on the MBA data, we're delivering 20% more loss mitigation solutions for homeowners versus the industry average. \u2047 And again, I believe this demonstrates how our servicing capabilities deliver superior performance for homeowners and investors. \u2047 NPS is up 6 points over third quarter 2020, and that's even with the impact of boarding over 280,000 loans in the third quarter onto our servicing platform and helping over 4,700 borrowers exit forbearance. \u2047 Also worth noting, Moody's and S&P upgraded our servicer quality assessment as Master servicer, along with Fitch -- and along with Fitch, all three affirmed our servicer ratings. \u2047 Some of the key strengths noted by the agencies were our reporting and remitting processes, proactive servicer oversight in master servicing, management and organization, industry experience, multiple levels of internal controls, and our diligent response to the pandemic, as well as our enterprisewide risk and compliance management framework. \u2047 We've put significant effort into diversifying our servicing revenue streams over the last two years. \u2047 Our focus has been on growing own servicing, growing our subservicing, and taking advantage of ancillary or intrinsic revenue streams in our business, Ginnie Mae EBO gains at call right opportunities. \u2047 These efforts have paid off as the percentage of our servicing revenue derived from the NRZ subservicing agreement has been reduced by more than 50%. \u2047 It's now just 17% of our revenues. \u2047 From a loan count perspective, the NRZ loans are down to 33% of the total as, compared to 54% in third quarter of last year, and the NRZ loans also comprise about two-thirds, 67% of our total nonperforming loans as of the third quarter of 2021. \u2047 EBOs and call rights continue to be an opportunity for us. \u2047 We settled our planned call rights transaction in the third quarter, involving seven deals, and we're pleased with the results. \u2047 As of the third quarter of 2021, our call rights, our owned call rights were approximately 121 deals. \u2047 And we estimate the near-term opportunity for call rights that could potentially be actionable is about 30 to 40 deals. \u2047 Market appetite for seasoned non-agency loans remain strong, and there is sustained activity from other legacy non-agency servicers. \u2047 With respect to our previously announced fourth quarter transaction, we received a request from the trustee Deutsche Bank asking us to pause the cleanup calls. \u2047 They wanted to confirm the call price, met the requirements of underlying PSAs. \u2047 We believe the call price we've calculated is consistent with the applicable PSAs in our course of conduct with Deutsche Bank and relevant third parties and with established industry practice. \u2047 We intend to work with Deutsche Bank in their analysis, including if Deutsche Bank chooses to seek input from a court of competent jurisdiction. \u2047 Meanwhile, we have agreed to pause our calls to allow that analysis to take place. \u2047 Regarding EBOs, we realized $12.3 million in EBO gains year-to-date third quarter with loans now emerging from forbearance, we expect to see an increase in EBO activity as loans are modified throughout 2022. \u2047 We believe we've built a best-in-class servicing platform for performing and special servicing with capacity for growth that can offer a compelling value proposition to existing and prospective clients. \u2047 During 2020 and 2021, we performed an end-to-end review of our platform and capabilities against what we believe are client expectations. \u2047 Based on this review, we believe our platform delivers best-practice performance levels for clients across six C's of performance. \u2047 These include competency, putting the client first, customer centricity, technology-enabled capabilities, a well-staffed bank-grade risk, and compliance model and a strong value-based culture that underpins everything we do. \u2047 We've made several investments in bar and client-facing technology to address the needs of clients and consumers and to streamline our business and improve the ability for consumer and client self-service. \u2047 We can offer swift onboarding, responsive service to our clients and consumers. \u2047 And as we covered on Pages 7 and 8, industry-leading operating performance. \u2047 We believe our operations can deliver superior total cost and service-level performance versus our peers. \u2047 And we've been rewarded for the investments we've made in our platform. \u2047 We've secured $28 billion of subservicing additions in the last 12 months. \u2047 We secured $20 billion in new awards in the third quarter, and we have a $63 billion opportunity with our top 10 prospects and a potential prospect pipeline of $200 billion and growing. \u2047 With the closing of RMS as well, we are positioned to enter the $86 billion reverse mortgage servicing market once the integration is complete. \u2047 So while these opportunities do have a longer sales cycle, I'm nonetheless very excited about the opportunity we have here. \u2047 Generally, this year, industry volume levels continue to be very robust, certainly as compared to historic levels of both forward and reverse. \u2047 We continue to deal with incredible interest rate volatility in August. \u2047 The 10-year treasury rate was trading at 117 basis points. \u2047 By quarter end, it was 153. \u2047 It's now in the high 140s. \u2047 So it's been volatile. \u2047 We are seeing non parallel interest rate movements, as well as mortgage to treasury spread compression, and discount margin volatility in reverse as well. \u2047 These risks are not covered by our hedging program, and we did feel the effects of this in the third quarter. \u2047 June will talk a little bit more about that later. \u2047 Consensus industry forecast is for rising rates and about a 28% average reduction in industry origination volumes. \u2047 This is based upon the consensus of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and MBA forecast. \u2047 That said, 2022 projected volume levels are still relatively high compared to historic levels, especially in the 2018, 2019 time frame. \u2047 Reverse mortgage endorsement volume remained strong and is expected to remain strong compared to last year. \u2047 In a contracting market, we would expect some continued pressure on originations margins until capacity -- excess capacity in industry could be eliminated. \u2047 That said, margins were roughly stable in the third quarter. \u2047 With rising rates, we would expect increased servicing profitability and MSR values as payoffs and runoff -- portfolio runoff decreases. \u2047 And we also expect perhaps some M&A and bulk purchase opportunities may emerge as market participants"], "gold_summary": ["ocwen financial q3 earnings per share $2.35.  \u2047  compname says subservicing sales pipeline grew to more than $200 billion in
