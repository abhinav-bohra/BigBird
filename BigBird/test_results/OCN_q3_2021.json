{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. \u2047 During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Today, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to two years ago. \u2047 Against a still evolving backdrop, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things to support our customer's technology needs in knowledgeable, fast, and convenient ways. \u2047 Our omnichannel capabilities and our ability to inspire and support across all of technology in a way no one else can means we are uniquely positioned to seize the opportunity in this environment and in the future. \u2047 We continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook, and connect at home. \u2047 And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year. \u2047 From a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater, and mobile phones. \u2047 Product availability continued to improve throughout quarter. \u2047 We have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming, and mobile phones. \u2047 Similar to last quarter, however, we do not believe this materially limited our overall sales growth. \u2047 While we have faced and continue to face supply chain challenges, including delays and higher costs, we are proactively navigating a situation that we have been dealing with for several quarters, as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since early in the pandemic. \u2047 Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to set us up well heading into holiday. \u2047 And we are resourcefully adapting to the constantly evolving environment with actions like pulling up product flow, adjusting store assortment based on availability, and acquiring additional alternative transportation. \u2047 We have deep, long-standing relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, and they have been incredibly supportive as we navigate. \u2047 In addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. \u2047 We have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different. \u2047 But we entered Q4 with 15% more inventory year over year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday. \u2047 As expected, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. \u2047 When compared to two years ago, we still saw a less promotional environment during Q3. \u2047 From a sales channel perspective, results were similar to last quarter. \u2047 Customers are returning to stores, and they are also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than pre-pandemic. \u2047 Online sales were 31% of domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal '20, growing by more than $2 billion during that time. \u2047 Our app saw a 19% increase in unique visitors versus last year, and phone and chat sales continued to climb versus last year and two years ago. \u2047 We continue to be an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. \u2047 During the third quarter, we reached our fastest small product delivery times ever. \u2047 Compared to last year, same-day delivery was up 400%, and we nearly doubled the percent of products delivered within one day. \u2047 Based on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we are the leader in one-day-or-less published shipping time across a sample of higher-volume ZIP codes and higher-demand items. \u2047 In addition to partnering with a diversified set of delivery partners, we also thoughtfully used our employee delivery capability, as we now have more than 400 stores doing employee deliveries, with almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of an employee delivery location. \u2047 We also have an industry-leading in-store pickup experience. \u2047 We have, by far, the broadest assortment of CE products available for pickup, and the process is incredibly fast. \u2047 In Q3, more than 90% of online orders that were available for product pickup were ready in less than 30 minutes of the order being placed. \u2047 Customers clearly find value in coming to our stores to pick up their products as the percent of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with one-third of our store-pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option. \u2047 And our customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 was up versus last year and two years ago. \u2047 In fact, in the last year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in store at least once. \u2047 These strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our amazing associates across the company and the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people, and technology. \u2047 Clearly, our business has changed dramatically in the last two years, with digital sales more than double pre-pandemic levels and phone, chat, and in-home sales growing. \u2047 Customers are starting their research and shopping online and then branching out from there to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs. \u2047 Stores are crucial to our customer experience, and they need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations. \u2047 For example, we know customers sometimes seek out in-person help to answer questions. \u2047 And other times, they would rather use digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores. \u2047 We have made the right investment decisions to position us as a leader in omnichannel retailing. \u2047 While we are proud of our progress, there are even more opportunities ahead of us. \u2047 And it is more important than ever to build on our position of strength and truly become a customer-obsessed company. \u2047 This means we put the customer at the heart of all we do by anticipating their needs, listening, learning, and applying those insights to create long-term relationships and seamless experiences. \u2047 That led us to launch Best Buy Totaltech last month. \u2047 Totaltech is a bold new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support, and product repair, unique capabilities that customer's value and no one else can match. \u2047 Our membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection, and many other benefits. \u2047 Let me provide a tangible example of how the offer can come to life. \u2047 A Totaltech member purchases a 65-inch TV and gets a $150 member discount. \u2047 She gets the TV delivered and mounted on the wall in her living room. \u2047 The next month, she buys a new iPhone for her daughter. \u2047 As long as she keeps up her membership, she gets two years of product protection on the TV she bought and two years of AppleCare+ protection for the phone. \u2047 A few weeks later, she can't get her laptop to connect to her printer, so she hops on a dedicated chat line with Geek Squad who fixes the problem by remoting into her computer so she can get on with a productive day of working from home. \u2047 As a member, she received all those benefits for $199 per year. \u2047 As you can see, not only do members receive significant savings, they can also be confident that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help. \u2047 The goal is to create an experience that makes it inconceivable for members to purchase their tech from anyone else, driving a larger share of consumer electronic spend to Best Buy. \u2047 We successfully rolled out the program nationally and online and converted more than 3 million former tech support members. \u2047 It is very early as we just launched last month. \u2047 But so far, we continue to see behaviors that we intend to drive and that we saw in the pilot, including more frequent interaction and higher incremental spend than non-members. \u2047 Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics, and our new members are skewing younger than our former Total Tech Support membership program. \u2047 NPS numbers across all channels are higher than for non-members as well. \u2047 And importantly, our employees believe in and love articulating the value of membership to our customers. \u2047 As we've discussed in previous calls, we are in the midst of multiple store pilots and tests. \u2047 Of course, we are always piloting concepts. \u2047 But right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer that's focused foremost on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us. \u2047 I will provide a few updates on our progress. \u2047 We launched phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month. \u2047 For this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor. \u2047 It has no physical customers. \u2047 Instead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video, and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays, and physical products. \u2047 It is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet. \u2047 But initial results are showing much higher conversion rates, as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions. \u2047 In Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, in outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. \u2047 We launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and remodeled eight stores. \u2047 And in Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year. \u2047 These are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company. \u2047 From Northern California to Houston to The Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model. \u2047 At the same time, we are piloting and evolving our labor models in other markets to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors. \u2047 That means leveraging technology in stores that don't have as much labor and developing a much more flexible workforce. \u2047 This is a workforce that can not only provide expert help across product categories, both in-store and virtually, but also flex into other activities like curbside fulfillment, and it empowers employees to flexibly pick up shifts at other stores or at our distribution centers. \u2047 I also want to highlight our unique ability to both inspire and support our customers through our consultation and our Geek Squad services. \u2047 We have almost 3,000 consultants and designers to provide free consultations across customers' homes, in-stores, and virtually. \u2047 These consultations represent one of our highest NPS experiences, consistently over 80. \u2047 Importantly, they also lead to longer-term and stickier customer relationships as more than 85% of customers who use the program stated they intend to continue shopping with their consultants. \u2047 Turning to the product support we provide, as many of you likely know, when something goes wrong with your products or delivery or installation, it is a highly unplanned and often emotional event. \u2047 Not surprisingly, our customer research tells us that customers value quick response times and demand transparency, fast repair times, and quality repairs from a trusted provider. \u2047 Our Geek Squad has an industry-leading set of capabilities that garner market-leading NPS and also drive additional revenue for Best Buy in the moment and over time. \u2047 Around 20% of our phone and computer repair customers purchase additional products the day they receive the repair. \u2047 Additionally, our data shows that customers who have phone or computer repairs are far more likely to make a purchase in the following 12 months. \u2047 Over time, we have also been evolving our partnerships with our vendors in response to changing customer shopping behavior. \u2047 Our in-store vendor experiences are crucial to our customer experience and remain a significant source of competitive advantage. \u2047 We have extended many of these in-store experiences to digital experiences. \u2047 Our vendors partner with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers. \u2047 And importantly, our vendors are increasingly sending sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers. \u2047 We are also leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our partnerships with our vendors. \u2047 We are already the nation's largest physical destination for Apple-authorized repair services, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as one-third of these Apple repair customers are new or reengaged customers for Best Buy. \u2047 In October, we launched Samsung-authorized phone repair service nationally. \u2047 Roughly 30% of our stores will offer same-day, in-store repairs completed by Samsung-certified Geek Squad agents using Samsung parts, diagnostics, and tools. \u2047 Phone repair is a universal need for customers, and this expansion gives Best Buy the capability to repair the overwhelming majority of phones in the marketplace. \u2047 In addition, we are also starting to leverage our industry-leading and convenient buy-online-pick-up-in-store experience in partnerships with our vendors. \u2047 Customers purchasing select items on samsung.com now have the option to pick up their products at their local Best Buy store. \u2047 And shoppers purchasing Insignia, Toshiba, and Pioneer Fire TVs on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at their local Best Buy stores. \u2047 For many of our vendors, we use our considerable supply chain expertise to transport their product often from the country of origin to our distribution centers. \u2047 In addition to helping our vendors, it allows us to increase our level of visibility into incoming inventory and to garner greater scale. \u2047 And finally, we have been investing in our long-standing advertising business, building new capabilities to help vendors effectively reach our customers. \u2047 Best Buy's relevance, customer relationship, and first-party data have grown along with customer's technology needs and our ability to meet those needs. \u2047 These are all great examples of value we can provide to our vendor partners that many other retailers cannot. \u2047 In addition to focusing our performance on our core CE and appliance categories, we are continuing to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. \u2047 For example, we created a robust online experience and assortment for electric transportation. \u2047 And during Q3, our sales in the category more than doubled. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 profit of $2 per share.  \u2047  q3 non-gaap earnings per share $2.08."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3 earnings
