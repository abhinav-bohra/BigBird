{"article": ["2020 was an extraordinary year, and the consistent execution of AMG's long-term strategy resulted in strong business performance and growth. \u2047 Complex operating conditions in volatile markets accelerated transition across the investment management industry with a number of our peers and competitors pursuing scale while others look to divest or exit businesses altogether. \u2047 Throughout this period, AMG remained committed to our fundamental principles. \u2047 That investment performance is about skill, not scale. \u2047 That investment alpha is best generated by differentiated active managers and that the entrepreneurial investment-centric cultures of independent partner-owned firms offer clients the greatest opportunity for alpha. \u2047 As a result, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy with excellence and discipline. \u2047 Our affiliates built on their strong long-term performance records, demonstrating their ability to distinguish themselves across market cycles, including during volatile periods like 2020. \u2047 Today, approximately three-quarters of our products are outperforming their long-term benchmarks on an EBITDA basis. \u2047 Our affiliates also continue to evolve and enhance their product offerings, often in collaboration with AMG, expanding their abilities to meet long-term client needs. \u2047 Overall, AMG emerged from the unprecedented events of 2020 in an even stronger position than we entered the year. \u2047 And we entered 2021 with significant momentum across our business and substantial capacity and flexibility to generate meaningful additional earnings growth and shareholder value. \u2047 Turning to our results. \u2047 Since the second quarter of 2020, the earnings power of our business has increased considerably driven by the strong and improving performance from the large majority of our affiliates, combined with the impact of strategic investments and actions we have taken to reposition our business over the past 18 months. \u2047 These collective actions contributed to year-over-year growth in EBITDA of 27% in the fourth quarter, driven by growth in management fees and performance fees, as well as operational efficiency. \u2047 We also capitalized on the market environment in 2020 to strengthen our balance sheet and improve flexibility for the benefit of our shareholders. \u2047 With our enhanced capital position and substantial free cash flow, we deployed more than $800 million across the combination of growth investments and share repurchases, including new partnerships with Comvest, Jackson Square and Boston Common while simultaneously repurchasing 10% of our shares over the course of the year. \u2047 AMG had a strong finish to 2020 but the results do not fully capture the magnitude of the earnings power heading into 2021, during which significant market, business performance and new investment tailwinds will further contribute to our earnings growth. \u2047 In the second half of 2020, business activity and client flows in private markets, wealth management and specialty fixed income were particularly strong. \u2047 These areas collectively account for more than one-third of our EBITDA and are becoming a more significant contributor to our overall growth profile. \u2047 Our fundamental equity and liquid alternative strategies are better positioned today given their improved track records, increased performance fee opportunity and enhanced potential to generate organic growth. \u2047 In addition to the building momentum of our existing affiliates. \u2047 The incremental earnings contribution of our 2020 new investments will be fully realized in our 2021 results given the timing of these investments over the course of the year. \u2047 And finally, given our substantial liquidity and cash flow generation, we expect to continue to deploy significant capital in 2021 across both our new investment pipeline and additional share repurchases. \u2047 For all of these reasons, as we enter this year, we are confident in AMG's forward prospects and our ability to generate meaningful growth in economic earnings per share. \u2047 As you know, AMG is a leader in partnering with independent asset management firms. \u2047 We have continued to evolve our approach to meet the ongoing needs of our affiliates as they grow their businesses over time. \u2047 Today, we offer a uniquely broad set of partnership solutions for independent firms, including growth capital, distribution support, minority investments and long-term succession planning. \u2047 Our differentiated approach continues to resonate with the highest quality independent firms as evidenced by our new investments over the course of 2020, which included Comvest Partners, a premier middle market private equity and private credit firm, which is an area of high client demand and increasing allocations; Jackson Square Partners, a leader in global equities with an outstanding reputation and track record for managing high conviction portfolios, and Boston Common Asset Management, a woman-owned innovator in global, sustainable and impact investing, which has significant organic growth prospects given their long record of success in ESG investing. \u2047 Together, these new investments evidence the power and breadth of AMG solution set. \u2047 And all three firms have joined our global distribution platform to expand their client reach across channels and geographies. \u2047 Individually, each new partnership underscores AMG's focus on investing in high-quality, growing businesses at disciplined valuations through customized structures designed to deliver returns across a range of outcomes. \u2047 With our unique competitive position and proprietary relationships, our new investment activity remains high. \u2047 Across a broader universe of firms around the world, prospective affiliates are increasingly engaging with us. \u2047 Notably, Boston Common is our second partnership with a specialist in sustainable investing following inclusive capital last year. \u2047 Client appetite for responsible and impact investing is steadily increasing, and this is an important moment in time for the asset management industry to address long-term sustainability through capital allocation. \u2047 We and our affiliates are increasingly focused on this imperative. \u2047 We are closely collaborating to support affiliates' increased engagement and participation in responsible capitalism, particularly with respect to their product offerings. \u2047 For example, we are providing capital resources to Artemis as they launch a dedicated sustainable global equity strategy. \u2047 And similarly, we supported GW&K in building out a suite of sustainable fixed income strategies, which AMG is now distributing. \u2047 More broadly, our global sales teams are bringing client insight to other affiliates with respect to integrating ESG into investment processes. \u2047 Ultimately, we believe that independent active managers are best positioned to generate investment alpha as clients grow their allocations to ESG investing, and our affiliates are increasingly participating in this growth area. \u2047 In its most fundamental way, sustainability, from the perspective of long-termism and the preservation of a firm's ability to build and create value over time, has been at the very heart of AMG's business purpose since our inception in 1993. \u2047 AMG's foundational principles support enhances the long-term duration of independent firms through succession planning. \u2047 We help partner-owned firms to manage their greatest asset and their greatest risk, human capital, and to preserve and enhance partner alignment with their most important stakeholder, their clients. \u2047 In addition to human capital, AMG also offers capabilities to assist affiliates in addressing other long-term risks, including operational, regulatory and reputational support. \u2047 In helping our affiliates to manage long-term risk and enhance their ability to grow over time, AMG has focused on sustainability of independent partner-owned firms for nearly 30 years. \u2047 And as we build upon our three decades of successful partnerships and position ourselves for the future, the impact of the strategic and growth investments that we have made over the past two years are beginning to materialize in our results as they did in the fourth quarter and will more fully manifest in the years ahead. \u2047 Over this period, we have invested in four new affiliates. \u2047 We have invested in the growth of our existing affiliates. \u2047 We broadened our partnership solution offering. \u2047 We enhanced our strategic capabilities. \u2047 We realigned our distribution platforms with the greatest opportunities, and we significantly enhanced our capital position. \u2047 We have achieved all of this while reinvigorating AMG's entrepreneurial culture and reestablishing an ownership mindset across the entire organization. \u2047 Looking ahead to 2021. \u2047 We have significant momentum in our business and heightened conviction in our strategy. \u2047 As we continue to generate increasing levels of free cash flow, and we invest that capital into our growth initiatives while returning excess capital through share repurchases, AMG's long-term opportunity to compound earnings is clear and positions us to deliver significant shareholder value over time. \u2047 As Jay discussed, strategic changes taking place in our industry are creating significant disruption, and that disruption is highlighting AMG's long-standing belief in the value proposition of independent partner-owned firms and their unique alignment with their clients. \u2047 At the same time, focused execution against our strategy is producing results in both our quarterly earnings and our expectations for future growth. \u2047 We entered 2021 with significant momentum across our business, increasing earnings power and a stronger and more flexible balance sheet to execute on the considerable opportunities ahead of us to generate shareholder value. \u2047 Turning to the quarter. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA of $255 million grew 27% year over year, driven by strength in both management and performance fees, and economic earnings per share of $4.22 benefited from an enhanced level of share repurchase activity. \u2047 AMG delivered strong earnings growth despite net client cash outflows of $15.8 billion that were driven by certain quantitative strategies and seasonal client redemptions. \u2047 Quantitative strategies accounted for 95% of outflows in the quarter while contributing approximately 3% of run rate EBITDA. \u2047 Away from quant and taking into account seasonality, our underlying organic growth trends continued to improve, and client flows were positive in the quarter. \u2047 Strong investment performance and an increasingly attractive environment for allocating to active managers drove further stabilization in fundamental equities. \u2047 And affiliate strategies across illiquid alternatives, wealth management and specialty fixed income generated significant positive net flows and continued to contribute an increasing proportion of our earnings. \u2047 Turning to our asset class breakdown and excluding challenged quantitative strategies. \u2047 In alternatives, we reported net inflows of $700 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting ongoing momentum across our illiquid alternative affiliates. \u2047 Strength in private markets was partially offset by $2 billion in seasonal redemptions in certain liquid alternative strategies with fourth-quarter liquidity windows. \u2047 Fundraising remains strong at Pantheon, Baring, EIG and Comvest as clients continue to steadily increase private market allocations globally. \u2047 Performance in this category has been excellent as our affiliates have been deploying dry powder into attractive return opportunities, including across Asia private equity, global secondaries, co-investments and credit funds. \u2047 Overall, our private markets book remains a significant source of earnings growth, accounting for nearly 20% of management fee EBITDA and continues to build future carried interest potential. \u2047 Within liquid alternatives, our affiliates continue to post strong performance across relative value fixed income and concentrated long-only strategies, which collectively generated the majority of our performance fees in 2020. \u2047 Garda and ValueAct, among others, produced very strong returns in 2020, and our liquid alternative strategies enter 2021 well positioned to deliver for clients. \u2047 Moving to fundamental equities. \u2047 We reported net outflows of $2.3 billion in global equities and $1.1 billion in U.S. equities, partly due to the impact of retail seasonality. \u2047 We continue to generate positive organic growth in areas where client demand for active converges with top quartile performance, including at Harding Loevner, Veritas and GW&K. \u2047 Our investment performance across our fundamental equity strategies continues to be very strong with approximately 80% of fundamental equity AUM above benchmark for the five-year period, significantly outpacing the 62% level of two years ago. \u2047 And with that strong performance, coupled with a more favorable macro environment for active investing, we are well positioned for future organic growth. \u2047 In particular, we are seeing increasing momentum in client conversations regarding value strategies, where overall industry dynamics have improved and our affiliates continued to deliver strong relative investment performance. \u2047 Multi-asset and fixed income strategies posted another strong quarter of organic growth, generating $1.9 billion of net inflows driven by muni bond strategies and broader wealth solutions at GW&K and Baker Street. \u2047 This area of our business continues to deliver steady, long duration inflows, and we anticipate ongoing client demand trends to support future growth. \u2047 In aggregate, AMG is well positioned to generate positive flows over time given our Affiliates' participation in areas supported by long-term client demand trends and their differentiated ability to deliver superior outcomes for clients. \u2047 Now, turning to financials. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $255 million grew 27% year over year, driven by strong investment performance, higher markets, lower corporate expenses and the impact of growth investments in both existing and new affiliates, including affiliate equity purchases. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA included $60 million of performance fees, driven by strong investment performance across a broad array of alpha-oriented strategies. \u2047 Economic earnings per share of $4.22 and further benefited from an elevated level of share repurchase activity, which I'll expand on in a moment. \u2047 For the full year, performance fees of $86 million represented approximately 11% of our earnings. \u2047 With a diverse and growing performance fee opportunity, we are entering 2021 well positioned for continued strength in this area. \u2047 Now, moving to specific modeling items for the first quarter. \u2047 We expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 240 to 250 million based on current AUM levels, reflecting our market blend, which was up 2.5% as of Friday. \u2047 Our estimate includes a performance fee range of 35 to 45 million, reflecting normal seasonality and strong performance at our liquid alternative managers. \u2047 Our share of interest expense was 27 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of our hybrid debt offering. \u2047 We expect interest expense to remain at a similar level for the first quarter. \u2047 Controlling interest depreciation was 2 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect a consistent level for the first quarter. \u2047 Our share of reported amortization and impairments was 87 million for the fourth quarter. \u2047 In the first quarter, we expect this line item to be approximately 40 million. \u2047 Our effective GAAP and cash tax rates were 24 and 25% for the fourth quarter. \u2047 For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP and cash tax rates to be approximately 25 and 19%, respectively, for the first quarter. \u2047 Intangible-related deferred taxes were negative 3 million in the fourth quarter, and we expect intangible related deferred taxes to be 9 million in the first quarter. \u2047 Other economic items were negative 8 million and included the mark to market impact on GP and seed capital investments. \u2047 In the first quarter, for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items, excluding any mark-to-market impact on GP and seed to be 1 million. \u2047 Our adjusted weighted average share count for the fourth quarter was 45.3 million, and we expect share count to be approximately 43 million for the first quarter. \u2047 Turning to the balance sheet and capital allocation. \u2047 Over the course of 2020, we continue to position the company for growth, taking advantage of the historically attractive financing environment to enhance our capital position by building additional liquidity and flexibility. \u2047 We doubled the duration of our debt to 15 years while keeping our cost of debt unchanged, enhanced our capital flexibility by issuing junior hybrid debt and significantly improved our liquidity position, including the repurposing of our dividend"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports earnings per share of $2.54, economic earnings per share of $4.22 in fourth quarter."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q4 adjusted earnings per share $4.22.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $4.22.  \u2047  q4 adjusted earnings per share $4.22."]}
