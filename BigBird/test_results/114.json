{"article": ["Today, I'm joined by Brian Tyler, our chief executive officer; and Britt Vitalone, our chief financial officer. \u2047 Brian will lead off, followed by Britt, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session. \u2047 Today, we reported third quarter fiscal 2022 results, another quarter with double-digit adjusted operating profit growth in all four segments, reflecting strength in the fundamentals across our businesses. \u2047 Our focus and execution against our company priorities positions us to consistently generate strong financial results despite fluidity we continue to see in the macroeconomic environment. \u2047 Before I discuss the business performance, I would like to just quickly remind everyone of our company priorities. \u2047 We have been sharing with you our strategic transformation to a diversified healthcare services company centered around a set of four enterprise priorities. \u2047 We believe the execution against these priorities is critical to our ability to generate long-term sustainable growth, and we want to reiterate our focus and commitment to each one of them. \u2047 Our first priority is our people, our teams and our culture. \u2047 Through our diversified portfolio of assets and operations, we as a company touch and impact many aspects of health and the healthcare system, including patients. \u2047 Embedded in our daily operations is our purpose: advancing health outcomes for all and our mission of building an impact-driven organization. \u2047 We have been focused on enabling change in three areas: improving access to healthcare, advancing health equity and protecting our environment. \u2047 In the past year, our employees came together and shared countless moments of impact, finding new ways to get involved and to contribute. \u2047 In 2021 alone, we completed more than 26,500 volunteer hours and supported nearly 1,500 charities. \u2047 I couldn't be more proud of what we have achieved so far, and I'm confident in our ability to build a brighter future that, in fact, offers greater health outcomes for all. \u2047 Part of our focus on culture is our continued improvement in diversity and inclusion. \u2047 We put a particular focus on hiring, developing and promoting what we call a best talent strategy at McKesson. \u2047 Recently, we were recognized as one of the best places to work for LGBTQ equality, the ninth year in a row we've received this honor. \u2047 Our commitments to diversity and refreshment includes our board of directors. \u2047 Both James and Kathleen have served in multiple senior leadership roles within the healthcare industry. \u2047 Currently, Jim serves as an operating partner for the private equity firm, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stone. \u2047 And prior to that, he held the role of chief executive officer at Baylor Scott & White Health. \u2047 And Kathleen most recently held the role of executive vice president and global chief human resource officer at Walgreens Boots Alliance, where she led the human capital strategy, including merger integration and HR transformation through digitization. \u2047 Additionally, we announced today that Don Knauss has been elected as the next independent chairman of our board, which will go into effect on April 1, following a planned transition led by our current independent Chair, Edward Mueller. \u2047 He brings deep leadership expertise and shares McKesson values, culture, strategy and vision, including his commitment to board diversity. \u2047 We look forward to his leadership and stewardship. \u2047 Our next priority is to drive sustainable growth in our core pharmaceutical and medical distribution businesses. \u2047 We have a vast scale distribution network and deep expertise in global supply chain management, which have been a critical and foundational part of our long history. \u2047 We're proud of our operational excellence and our ability to capture efficiency and deliver consistent and high-quality service to our customers while optimizing operating margin. \u2047 Building off of this core capability, we've been very successful in expanding into new product categories and new adjacent markets, like our lab solutions and our government partnership strategies. \u2047 Our scaled assets and capabilities also enable us to play an integral role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 We're proud to serve as the centralized distributor of vaccines and ancillary supplies for the U.S. government. \u2047 We've also been working closely with our partners, suppliers and manufacturers to navigate the complex supply chain system. \u2047 These relationships have allowed us to continue to provide stability of supply and low cost for our customers. \u2047 And as a result, we've been able to manage through some of the challenges that the market has been seeing. \u2047 Our third priority is to streamline the business, which includes initiatives like the split off of Change Healthcare and our strategic intent to fully exit the European region. \u2047 We recently announced the sale of our Austrian business, which was completed on January 31, and we have agreements to sell 10 of the 12 countries where we operate. \u2047 As a reminder, Norway and Denmark remain the only countries that we have not entered into an agreement to sell. \u2047 We continue to work toward the closing of the other pending divestitures. \u2047 These transactions are the result of our intentional effort to evaluate and assess our portfolio for strategic alignment. \u2047 We believe that by fully exiting the Europe region, we'll be able to better focus our human and financial capital into higher-growth and higher-margin areas, which leads me naturally to our next company priority. \u2047 The last company priority is our strategic growth pillars, oncology and biopharma services. \u2047 Over the past few years, we set out to accelerate the growth in these two areas and build out what we refer to as ecosystems. \u2047 As we shared at our Investor Day in December, these are both large and growing markets that have significant unmet needs and opportunities, and we are tackling some of the most complex problems in the healthcare system with the goal to bring efficiency and benefits to all stakeholders across these ecosystems. \u2047 With the reach of over 1,400 physicians, The US Oncology Network treats 15% of all new cancer patients in the U.S. at one of its 500 sites of service. \u2047 One of The US Oncology Network's important initiatives is its participation in the oncology care model, which is a five-year experimental payment model with the goal of bringing down the cost of cancer. \u2047 Based on the latest results, The US Oncology Network practices participating in the program achieved high marks on quality metrics and provided significant cost savings to Medicare. \u2047 By representing approximately one-fourth of all providers participating in the program, The US Oncology Network demonstrated its leadership role in transitioning healthcare to a more value-based approach. \u2047 Building upon our deep reach in the community oncology space, we're creating an oncology ecosystem with multifaceted service offerings that are all interconnected. \u2047 At the center of this connectivity is Ontada, an oncology, technology and insights business dedicated to help advance cancer research and advance patient care. \u2047 We recently highlighted this business at our Investor Day. \u2047 Since its launch in December of 2020, the team has made great progress transforming ideas into realities. \u2047 Ontada signed two agreements with strategic partners to improve patient outcome and quality of patient care, and it was instrumental in the launch of the MYLUNG Consortium, which through real-world research and study provides critical information to improve the patient's journey. \u2047 Within our biopharma ecosystem, we've built a set of differentiated assets and capabilities, including businesses like RelayHealth Pharmacy, CoverMyMeds and RxCrossroads. \u2047 They're combined under the Prescription Solutions business with a shared goal to improve access, adherence and affordability of medicines. \u2047 One of the key customers of our business is biopharma companies. \u2047 Through our scaled and interconnected technology network, we provide biopharma a range of commercialization services and by automating and simplifying the process of prior authorization, we reduced prescription abandonment and provide biopharma access to new patients. \u2047 Our unique technology capabilities also generate insights into patients' needs and challenges, enabling greater ability to impact patient actions and get better outcomes. \u2047 We support over 650 brands today, covering 94% of the therapeutic areas, and we're connected to all the major insurance companies and most of the regional payers in the United States. \u2047 The reach of our network is deep and broad, which is why it's the foundation of our biopharma ecosystem, and we are incredibly excited about the market opportunities it brings. \u2047 Our progress with each of the company priorities has been truly outstanding, and we see the strategy is working. \u2047 The strong conviction in these priorities will be our North Star as we seek to advance and win in the marketplaces as a diversified healthcare service company and to drive long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. \u2047 Now before I turn to our third quarter results, I want to provide a brief update on the progress made toward the broad resolution of governmental opioid-related claims. \u2047 To date, 46 states, all five U.S. territories and Washington, D.C., have joined the proposed settlement. \u2047 The sign-on period for political subdivisions in participating states to join the previously announced proposed opioid settlement agreement ended on January 26. \u2047 We have now entered into the evaluation period. \u2047 The deadline for our decision is February 25, 2022. \u2047 We continue to work with all parties to bring meaningful relief to affected communities and toward resolutions, which will allow us to further focus on the strategic priorities of our business. \u2047 Now let me get to the results. \u2047 We're pleased to report a strong third quarter with total company revenues of $68.6 billion and an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $6.15, ahead of our expectations. \u2047 As a result of our performance in the underlying business and the contribution from COVID-19-related items, we are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to $23.55 to $23.95. \u2047 This is from the previous range of $22.35 to $22.95. \u2047 The third quarter was another example of the nonlinear nature of the recovery from the pandemic. \u2047 At the beginning of the quarter, volume and utilization trends were recovering as COVID-19 cases continued to decline across the country. \u2047 Although we expected a nonlinear recovery trend, the emergence in the spread of the Omicron variant in December was unexpected. \u2047 Since then, we've been closely monitoring its impact. \u2047 One thing we've learned in the past two years is the resilience of our business and our communities. \u2047 Regardless of the trajectory of the pandemic, we're confident about our ability to adjust and adapt to support our customers and their patients in these challenging times. \u2047 Let's turn to the U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. \u2047 Pharmaceutical segment saw 12% adjusted operating profit growth, which was underpinned by the contribution from COVID-19 vaccine distribution and increased specialty volume. \u2047 Through the third quarter and into January, branded pharmaceutical pricing has tracked in line with our original expectations and consistent with our experience over the past several years. \u2047 For generics, we continue to benefit from the success and strength of our sourcing operation with ClarusONE. \u2047 We have not only the scale but the procurement expertise to consistently source products at low cost while protecting the integrity and the safety of the supply chain. \u2047 We are also proud of our role in supporting the U.S. government's pandemic response effort as the vaccine and booster recommendations for various age groups continues to expand and evolve. \u2047 government's international donation mission. \u2047 In January, the U.S. government extended the existing COVID-19 vaccine distribution contract through July of 2022, which is roughly in line with the first quarter of our fiscal 2023. \u2047 In Prescription Technology Solutions, the segment had excellent momentum and delivered an 11% increase to segment adjusted operating profit in the third quarter. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, we offer a range of commercial services primarily to biopharma companies. \u2047 And this quarter, the growth was led by third-party logistics services and our access adherence and affordability solutions, including our access for more patients product. \u2047 This segment aligns with our focus on developing the biopharma services ecosystem. \u2047 The market that we're focused on presents many exciting opportunities, and we estimate the total addressable market to be around $15 billion with good growth potential and an attractive margin profile. \u2047 We are pleased with the financial performance and expect to continue to drive growth and innovation for McKesson. \u2047 In Medical-Surgical, we're navigating a dynamic market while growing the business. \u2047 With surging demand and a complex supply chain, our employees are working tirelessly to secure and deliver key products, playing an important role in the fight against the pandemic. \u2047 The dedicated team in MedSurg is the foundation to our business growth, and we continue to invest to ensure operational continuity and excellence. \u2047 As it relates to our International segment, we continue to benefit from COVID-19-related programs in our European operations and Canada. \u2047 Through December, we've distributed over 81 million vaccines to administration sites in select markets across our international geographies. \u2047 As we look forward to fiscal 2023, I'm most excited about the progress on the four company priorities. \u2047 Since the rollout of these multiyear strategic initiatives in our fiscal 2019, we've been very focused on execution, making impact and delivering results. \u2047 While the pandemic continues to present unknowns, what is certain is that fiscal 2023 will be another year in which we focused on strong execution and strategic advancement. \u2047 Our continued progress toward these four priorities will be a key driver to our sustainable profit growth, strong cash flow and shareholder value creation. \u2047 We continue to focus on the things that matter most, most to our customers, to our patients, to our employees and to our shareholders. \u2047 In closing, we continue to be excited about our future growth prospects as we meet the opportunity as a diversified healthcare services company. \u2047 We have unique and differentiated assets in oncology and biopharma services with unmatched scale and connectivity, and we're strategically positioned to win in these growing markets. \u2047 We share a mission to improve healthcare in every setting, and that will be achieved only with the dedication and the commitment from our people. \u2047 And for the opportunity to work alongside this amazing team, I continue to be humbled and deeply grateful. \u2047 Britt, I'll toss it to you. \u2047 I'm pleased to be here today to discuss our fiscal third quarter results, which reflect another quarter of strong performance across the business driven by operational execution against our growth strategies. \u2047 In the third quarter, we delivered overall growth compared to the prior year results across each of our segments, including growth over the prior year when excluding COVID-19-related programs. \u2047 Let me start with an update on Europe. \u2047 We remain committed to fully exit the European region, and the progress of our exit activities are on track. \u2047 Today, we announced that the transactions to sell our Austrian business to Quadrifolia Management and the sale of McKesson's remaining share of our German joint ventures to Walgreens Boots Alliance closed on January 31, 2022. \u2047 The assets involved in the Austrian transaction contributed approximately $1.5 billion in revenue and $50 million in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2021. \u2047 The earnings related"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports qtrly total revenues of $68.6 bln, up 10%.  \u2047  qtrly total revenues of $68.6 billion increased 10%.  \u2047  qtrly adjusted earnings per
