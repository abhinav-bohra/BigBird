{"article": ["If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. \u2047 On our call today is Jim Snee, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Sheehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Jim Snee will provide a review of the Company's current and future operating conditions, commentary regarding each segment's performance for the quarter and a perspective on the balance of fiscal 2021. \u2047 Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results and commentary regarding the Company's current and future financial condition. \u2047 As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. \u2047 It will also be posted on our website and archived for one year. \u2047 Before we get started, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. \u2047 It can be accessed on our website. \u2047 Once again this quarter, I want to recognize the heroic work of our production team members. \u2047 This team deserves much of the credit for our record sales results this quarter as they continued working to produce safe high-quality food for millions of consumers and customers. \u2047 Our number one priority has been to keep our team members safe and our cross-functional COVID-19 leadership team is ensuring we are on the leading edge of the country's vaccination efforts. \u2047 To date, we have fully vaccinated over 51% of our domestic workforce, which is well ahead of the country's vaccination rate. \u2047 We are encouraged by the rapid decline in cases in our communities. \u2047 From a top-line perspective, our balanced business model has again proven to be a winning formula as our team delivered record sales for the second quarter and first half. \u2047 In total, sales for the quarter increased 8% compared to last year, and the sales increased over 5% for the first half of the year. \u2047 A key driver of our sales performance is the rebound in our foodservice business. \u2047 As expected our foodservice team experienced a strong recovery and took numerous actions to properly position our organization to capitalize on the industry recovery. \u2047 For the quarter, foodservice sales increased 28%. \u2047 This reflects an increase of 1% over 2019 pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 This is a significant accomplishment, especially knowing where the industry was just a few short months ago. \u2047 Since the beginning of the pandemic, our foodservice teams have been doing their part to support the industry. \u2047 Within days of the crisis, we worked closely with our distributor and operator partners to assist their businesses in many different ways; whether it was a rebate program to offset food costs, extending payment leniency, helping adjust to the new takeout delivery and pickup environment or simply being available to personally check in with the restaurant tour to see how they're doing. \u2047 Our confidence in the industry recovery never wavered. \u2047 We know these actions benefited our distributor and operator partners and are playing a part in our outperformance of the broader industry trends. \u2047 During this difficult labor environment, our experienced and tenured direct sales force is helping operators meet their accelerating demand with products that simplify their food preparation, save time and minimize labor, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to a menu item. \u2047 Products like Hormel Fire Braised meats, Sadler's authentic smoke barbecue, Fontanini authentic Italian meat, Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Wholly Guacamole and Jennie-O Turkey are uniquely positioned to meet this need. \u2047 The brightest spot in our foodservice portfolio has been our pizza toppings business. \u2047 Prior to the pandemic, we capitalized on the continued growth in this category, especially for premium products and invested heavily in capacity to meet future demand. \u2047 We've also been investing in plant-based offerings and are seeing growth from our plant-based pepperoni and crumbles products. \u2047 We are excited to leverage our expertise in the pizza toppings category to drive growth in plant-based toppings. \u2047 With our new capacity expansion effort and with additional pepperoni capacity set to open at the beginning of fiscal 2022, we are set up nicely to meet the consistent growth we have seen in this space. \u2047 With the foodservice industry recovery well under way, we will continue to strengthen our relationships with our valued partners, invest in our direct sales team and support the industry's return to growth with innovative, convenience and flavorful product solutions. \u2047 In addition to foodservice growth, our retail and deli businesses also remained healthy with demand elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Total retail sales this quarter were flat to last year as we lapped the months when consumers were stocking their pantries in anticipation of the pandemic. \u2047 Sales finished up 16% compared to the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 And we continued to see strength from our leading brands such as SPAM, Applegate, Jennie-O, Black Label, Herdez and Wholly. \u2047 As a reminder, we experienced an immediate and sustained demand surge for our shelf-stable products in the Grocery Products segment at the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 The second wave of demand that impacted our perishable and refrigerated items happened weeks later in the third fiscal quarter. \u2047 Sales in the deli channel increased 4% this quarter and are up 9% over pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Hormel Gatherings party trays delivered strong growth as consumers started to spend more time with family and friends, and consequently, are purchasing more products to entertain their guests. \u2047 The Columbus brand remains a cornerstone for our deli business, and it is now benefiting from the opening of our new plant in Omaha, which is providing much needed capacity. \u2047 Columbus is a leader in charcuterie, and we now have the capacity to continue expanding distribution. \u2047 Across the retail and deli space, our consumer takeaway metrics continue to be positive according to IRI. \u2047 Many of our brands have made large gains in household penetration, overall buy rates are improving and we are seeing an expansion in cross purchasing across our brands. \u2047 E-commerce sales grew double-digits in the last 12 weeks, according to IRI, and we are gaining share in important categories. \u2047 We will continue to increase our investment in this important channel. \u2047 Throughout the quarter, our supply chain continued to improve as we were able to increase production levels through a combination of gaining efficiencies, increasing capacities and leveraging our strategic supply chain partners. \u2047 Another area we have made great strides is in our distribution network. \u2047 Over the last year, we have opened a new Grocery Products distribution center, and, in recent weeks, have opened a Refrigerated distribution center serving the West Coast. \u2047 These strategic investments will reduce overall freight miles and costs, improve our customer service levels, support growth for our value-added businesses and reduce greenhouse emissions. \u2047 From a bottom-line perspective, operating income showed a slight decline. \u2047 We saw raw material and feed prices rapidly increase throughout the quarter. \u2047 We have taken pricing actions in many categories, but did not see the full benefit of these actions during the quarter. \u2047 As we have previously discussed, in volatile market conditions, pricing will lag the markets, which will shift profits to subsequent quarters. \u2047 Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were flat to last year. \u2047 A higher tax rate negatively impacted earnings by $0.01 per share compared to last year. \u2047 Turning to the segments. \u2047 Refrigerated Foods volume increased 3% and sales increased 17%, with growth coming from almost every division. \u2047 Value added sales increased 18%, driven by a significant recovery in the foodservice businesses. \u2047 As anticipated, we saw a rapid increase in foodservice demand as the quarter progressed. \u2047 Almost all categories within the foodservice grew sales, led by our pizza toppings portfolio and brands such as Fontanini and Bacon 1. \u2047 In fact, pepperoni, pizza toppings, Bacon 1 and Fontanini authentic Italian meats all showed growth compared to the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 We also experienced a recovery in the premium breakfast portfolio, with growth from our Old Smokehouse brand. \u2047 Additionally, we saw excellent growth from our premium prepared proteins, which include brands such as Austin Blues, Fire Braised, Cafe H and Sadler's. \u2047 These items are key to our pre-strategy, items that are pre-marinated, pre-cooked, pre-sliced and fully prepared. \u2047 As the industry recovery accelerates into the summer and labor remains the predominant challenge for most operators, our line of products offer convenient, safe, versatile and flavorful solutions. \u2047 Our retail and deli teams delivered a strong quarter on the top line, with growth coming from products such as Black Label bacon, Hormel Gatherings, Applegate, Lloyd's Barbeque, Hormel Pepperoni and Columbus prepared foods items. \u2047 Refrigerated Foods segment profit increased 32% due to higher foodservice sales, higher retail fresh pork profitability and decreased operational expenses due to abating COVID-19 cost pressures. \u2047 International delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth, with sales increasing 17% and segment profit increasing 6%. \u2047 The performance of the team in China remains impressive. \u2047 Foodservice volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels, driven by growth from SKIPPY, pizza toppings, and bacon items. \u2047 Retail demand for the SPAM and SKIPPY brands has also been outstanding. \u2047 The Company's innovative offerings including beef jerky, SKIPPY snacking items and two new SPAM varieties are providing additional avenues for growth, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for our China business. \u2047 Branded exports also grew with growth coming from the SKIPPY and SPAM brands, higher foodservice sales and improved margins on the fresh pork items. \u2047 In addition, our partners in the Philippines, South Korea and Europe continued to experience elevated demand for shelf-stable products. \u2047 Grocery Products results were strong given the difficult comparison to last year due to the extremely high levels of demand experienced at the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 Even though volume declined 14%, sales declined 8% and segment profit declined 23%, we are encouraged by the segment's performance as we have seen sustained consumer demand for many of our brands compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Sales for center store brands such as SPAM, Hormel Chili, Compleats and Mary Kitchen hash were all over 20% higher compared to our second quarter of 2019. \u2047 We will continue to support our leading brands including SKIPPY, SPAM, Compleats, Herdez, Wholly, Justin's and Hormel Chili, and we're resuming promotional activity as inventory levels normalize. \u2047 Our MegaMex joint venture performed well, as equity and earnings increased 26%. \u2047 Both Herdez and Wholly brands grew as consumers looked for authentic and convenient Mexican products to enhance their at-home eating occasions. \u2047 The Herdez brand continues to outperform the salsa category. \u2047 This brand has grown households by 3 million since the start of the pandemic and has introduced industry leading innovation to the marketplace in recent years. \u2047 Following the highly successful performance of Herdez's Guacamole Salsa, we continue to expand distribution and grow share with two new product lines: Herdez Taqueria Street Sauces and Herdez Salsa Cremosas. \u2047 Recently, Herdez also entered the hot sauce market with the introduction of Herdez Avocado Hot Sauce, another versatile offering that can enhance any meal. \u2047 The Wholly brand had a strong quarter as well, as it continues to target consumers looking for convenient solutions to enjoy avocado offerings. \u2047 Our recent innovations, including Wholly Smashed and Wholly Diced Avocado products solve for that consumer need. \u2047 And as we saw across many of our refrigerated foodservice businesses, demand for avocado products in the channel started to return during the quarter. \u2047 Jennie-O volume decreased 3% and sales increased 2%, a recovery in the foodservice business and higher whole bird sales drove the sales increase. \u2047 Foodservice volumes were up double digits compared to last year. \u2047 Demand for Jennie-O retail products such as Lean Ground Turkey remained above pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 54% due to the impact from higher feed costs. \u2047 Grain prices continued to increase significantly during the quarter, while pricing action had yet to be fully reflected in the marketplace. \u2047 Jim Sheehan will provide further commentary on the actions we have taken to manage higher corn and soybean meal costs. \u2047 Looking to the balance of the year, we are increasing our full year sales guidance range to $10.2 billion to $10.8 billion, and reaffirming our earnings per share guidance range of $1.70 to $1.82 per share. \u2047 As a reminder, this guidance range does not include the estimated impact of the pending acquisition of the Planters snacks nuts business. \u2047 Our diversified and balanced business model gives us confidence we can perform well in many different economic scenarios and market conditions. \u2047 We have a very positive outlook on the foodservice business as we head into the second half of the year. \u2047 We are well positioned from an inventory and capacity standpoint to meet the demand from our distributor partners and operators, and are confident in our ability to gain share throughout the recovery. \u2047 Additionally, we are increasingly confident that K-12 schools and colleges and universities will open and operate in a more traditional manner this fall. \u2047 This should benefit both Refrigerated Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store. \u2047 We continue to see elevated demand in the retail, deli and international channels. \u2047 We expect to further benefit from pricing actions, increased capacities on key product lines and continued improvements in our supply chain. \u2047 This year, we have seen rapid increases in key input costs across our businesses, and we expect to operate in a high-cost environment for the remainder of the year. \u2047 Our experienced management team has a proven ability to navigate and grow our business in volatile and inflationary market conditions. \u2047 And once again, we will be leveraging our direct sales force to partner with our customers to mutually grow our businesses. \u2047 As a reminder, our operations were heavily impacted by plant shutdowns, supply shortages and lower production throughput caused by the effects of the pandemic in the back half of fiscal 2020. \u2047 This ultimately led to lower levels of inventory, which negatively affected the third and fourth quarters. \u2047 Through the strategic actions we have taken to improve all facets of our operations and based on our record first half performance, we expect to benefit from more normalized operations in the back half of fiscal 2021. \u2047 I am confident in our ability to continue growing and I'm looking forward to closing the acquisition of Planters next month. \u2047 Record sales for the second quarter were $2.6 billion, an increase of 8%. \u2047 First half sales increased 5% to $5.1 billion, also a record. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["hormel foods reaffirming fy earnings per share outlook range of
