teams continue to manage through the COVID-19 pandemic as critical essential infrastructure providers, they also successfully overcame the challenges of Winter Storm Uri during first quarter, maintaining their focus on safety while still delivering on all of our core operational and financial objectives. \u2047 Though 2020 was a challenging year for our industry, it also brought with it opportunity. \u2047 And Marathon Oil chose to leverage the supply demand crisis to further optimize and enhance our business model. \u2047 We high-graded and focused our capital program. \u2047 We lowered our cost structure, and we further improved our financial strength and flexibility. \u2047 As a result, we have dramatically enhanced the resilience of our company, driving our free cash flow breakevens consistently below $35 per barrel WTI and building on a multiyear trend of sustainable free cash flow and getting that cash back in the hands of our investors. \u2047 And we have dramatically enhanced our ability to sustainably deliver robust financial outcomes. \u2047 Financial outcomes that can compete with any sector in the S&P 500 and do so across a much broader and lower range of commodity prices. \u2047 We recognize that given the inherent volatility of our commodity business that we must offer outsized free cash flow generation, coupled with investor-friendly actions to make a compelling investment case. \u2047 To that end, first-quarter '21 results are a testament to the strength of our business model and how we have positioned our company for success. \u2047 During first quarter, we generated over $440 million of free cash flow. \u2047 Despite the challenges associated with Winter Storm Uri, production volumes were in line with the midpoint of our full-year 2021 guidance, and we are fully on track to meet the annual production, capex, and cost guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. \u2047 And we are on track to exceed our free cash flow objectives. \u2047 For $1 billion of capital spending, we now expect to generate $1.6 billion of free cash flow at $60 per barrel WTI, up from the prior guidance of around $1.5 billion. \u2047 This corresponds to a free cash flow yield approaching 20% and a sub 40% reinvestment rate. \u2047 All at an assumed oil price that is below the current forward curve. \u2047 We remain committed to our $1 billion capital program. \u2047 There will be no change to our capital budget even if oil prices continue to strengthen. \u2047 We will simply generate more free cash flow and further solidify our standing as an industry leader when it comes to capital discipline, a hard-earned reputation we have established over multiple years. \u2047 We have accelerated our balance sheet and return of capital objectives, the specifics of which Dane will cover in just a few minutes. \u2047 Importantly, everything that we are doing is sustainable. \u2047 Our peer-leading capital efficiency, our outsized free cash flow generation, our competitive cost structure, our investment-grade balance sheet, and our rising return of capital profile. \u2047 The proof point for this sustainability is our five-year benchmark maintenance scenario that can deliver around $5 billion of free cash flow from 2021 to 2025 and a flat $50 per barrel WTI price environment or closer to $7 billion of free cash flow at the current forward curve, along with a corporate free cash flow breakeven of less than $35 per barrel throughout the period. \u2047 And the foundation for these differentiated financial outcomes is our multi-basin U.S. portfolio with well over a decade of high-return inventory, complemented by our integrated gas position in EG. \u2047 Finally, we are leading the way in our approach to ESG excellence and are committed to continually enhancing all elements of our company's ESG performance. \u2047 Safety remains our top priority, we are building on the record safety performance we delivered last year with a very strong start to 2021, as measured by total recordable incident rate. \u2047 Best-in-class governance remains at the forefront of everything we do. \u2047 We have appointed two new directors to the board this year and remain committed to ongoing refreshment, independence, and diversity. \u2047 We also reduced and redesigned executive and board compensation for improved alignment with investors, as I highlighted early this year. \u2047 And last but not least, we remain committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions intensity. \u2047 We made tremendous strides during 2020, reducing our overall GHG intensity by approximately 25%. \u2047 We are hard at work to achieve our GHG intensity-reduction target of 30% in 2021, a metric hardwired into our compensation scorecard, as well as our goal for a 50% reduction by 2025, both relative to our 2019 baseline. \u2047 And we have included $100 million of investment over the five years of the benchmark scenario to support this goal. \u2047 At the center of our capital allocation and reinvestment rate framework is our objective to return at least 30% of our cash flow from operations back to our investors. \u2047 Our capital return strategy prioritizes balance sheet enhancement through gross debt reduction and direct return of capital to equity holders through our base dividend and over time, likely through other return vehicles as well. \u2047 We have a strong track record of generating free cash flow and directing that cash back to our investors, are fully committed to this model, and are well-positioned to meaningfully beat our objectives in 2021. \u2047 When considering our updated debt-reduction target on recent base dividend increase, we're actually on track to return well over 40% of our cash flow back to investors this year. \u2047 First, we accelerated our 2021 gross debt-reduction objective of $500 million, fully retiring our next significant maturity and we're now targeting at least another $500 million of gross debt reduction, bringing our total 2021 debt-reduction target to $1 billion. \u2047 Reducing our gross debt is entirely consistent with our goal to further enhance our balance sheet, our investment-grade credit rating. \u2047 More specifically, our goal has been to reduce our net debt-to-EBITDA to below 1.5 times, assuming more of a mid-cycle $45 to $50 per barrel WTI environment. \u2047 We're making rapid progress toward achieving this milestone by the end of the year. \u2047 And in parallel, our aim is to significantly reduce our gross debt moving toward a $4 billion gross debt level. \u2047 Beyond the obvious benefit to our financial flexibility, the interest expense reductions associated with the structural gross debt reduction have the added potential to fund future dividend increases at no incremental cost to the company, thereby preserving our very competitive post-dividend corporate free cash flow breakeven. \u2047 Along with reducing our gross debt, we also raised our quarterly base dividend by 33%. \u2047 Our objective is to pay a base dividend that is both competitive relative to our peer group in the S&P 500 and sustainable throughout commodity price cycles. \u2047 Our decision to raise our dividend is a sign of our confidence in the strength and sustainability of our financial performance, and we see potential for disciplined, sustainable, and competitive base dividend growth over time. \u2047 We're targeting up to 10% of our cash flow from operations toward the base dividend, assuming $45 to $50 price environment, and we currently have ample headroom to progress under this framework. \u2047 And to ensure sustainability through the price cycle, we're focused on maintaining our post-dividend breakeven well below $40 a barrel WTI. \u2047 In fact, even with the recent dividend increase, our post-dividend free cash flow breakeven currently sits around $35 per barrel of WTI. \u2047 In summary, we are well-positioned this year to return over 40% of our cash flow to investors through gross debt reduction and our base dividend, our top near-term priorities. \u2047 As we make significant progress toward our $4 billion gross debt objective, we will likely take the balance of 2021 to accomplish. \u2047 And as we continue to advance further base dividend growth in line with our framework, we'll look to transition toward simply retiring debt as it matures and focusing more on alternative shareholder return mechanisms, including share buybacks or variable dividends, all funded through sustainable free cash flow generation. \u2047 We are not a cash taxpayer in the U.S. this year. \u2047 cash federal income taxes until the latter part of this decade. \u2047 This holds true even if the tax rules for intangible drilling costs or IDCs are changed or if the corporate tax rate has increased. \u2047 We have significant tax attributes in the form of net operating losses, approximately $8.4 billion on a gross basis, in addition to foreign tax credits of over $600 million. \u2047 These attributes will be used to offset future taxes. \u2047 Neither of these items is energy sector-specific, so we don't expect any new tax legislation to threaten them. \u2047 The bottom line is we don't expect to be a U.S. cash taxpayer until the latter part of this decade. \u2047 My key message today is that we're on track to achieve all of our 2021 operational objectives that we set at the beginning of the year, including our $1 billion capital program, and that we are on track to exceed the free cash flow objectives. \u2047 Our strong performance is due to tremendous execution from our asset teams during first quarter, despite the significant challenges associated with Winter Storm Uri. \u2047 Flat quarter on quarter, total oil production of 172,000 barrels per day was quite an accomplishment in light of the operational challenges we experienced and the impact to production you've seen reported by peer companies. \u2047 Our teams did an exceptional job keeping our volumes online and delivering much-needed production at a time when utilities and households were in critical need. \u2047 Our success began with extensive preplanning efforts and continued with a hands-on approach to managing our operations throughout the storm. \u2047 We did not proactively shut in our volumes as a preventative measure, rather we fully leveraged our digital infrastructure to prioritize protecting our highest volume, highest rate wells, intelligently routing operators to our highest-priority locations. \u2047 All the while, we kept the safety of our people as our top priority. \u2047 Our hands-on approach clearly paid off, and our operational and financial results speak for themselves. \u2047 Our capital spending during 1Q came in slightly below expectations, reflecting solid well-cost execution but also the shift in timing of some capital from first to second quarter largely due to storm-driven delays. \u2047 Looking ahead to 2Q, we expect a slight sequential decline in our oil production, the result of fewer wells to sales in the first quarter, particularly in the Bakken. \u2047 This is simply a function of the timing of our wells to sales, reflecting a natural level of quarter-to-quarter variability. \u2047 We will continue to prioritize maximizing our capital efficiency and free cash flow generation sustainably over time, not the production output of any individual quarter. \u2047 We do expect the significant increase in our second-quarter wells to sales to translate to an improving production trend as we move into third quarter. \u2047 With the increase in wells to sales and shifting capital from 1Q to 2Q, we expect 2Q capex to rise to the $300 million range, likely representing the peak capex quarter for the year. \u2047 Still, our capital program is fairly well-balanced and ratable, split almost 50-50 between the first half and second half of the year. \u2047 More importantly, our full-year capital spending and production guidance remain unchanged. \u2047 As the most capital-efficient basins across the Lower 48, the Bakken and Eagle Ford will still receive approximately 90% of our capital this year. \u2047 However, both our Oklahoma and Permian assets have high-return opportunities that can effectively compete for capital today. \u2047 Both assets provide capital allocation optionality, commodity diversification, and incremental high-quality inventory. \u2047 Consistent with what we previously disclosed in our five-year maintenance case and our plan entering the year, our objective is to reintroduce a disciplined level of steady-state activity back into Oklahoma and the Permian by 2022 at 20% to 30% of the total capital budget. \u2047 When we do, our expectation is that both assets will support accretive corporate returns and incremental free cash flow to the enterprise. \u2047 I will now pass it back to Lee, who will provide a few more comments before we move to Q&A. \u2047 I would like to briefly put the 2021 capital program, Mike just discussed, into context by comparing our capital efficiency, our cost structure, and our free cash flow generation to peer disclosures from the fourth-quarter earnings season. \u2047 As highlighted by Slide 10 in our earnings deck, our 2021 capital program is among the most capital-efficient and free cash flow generative of any company in our peer space. \u2047 The top two graphics summarize peer reinvestment rate normalized to a $50 and $60 WTI price environment. \u2047 As you can see, our reinvestment rate, which is a reasonable proxy for both operating and capital efficiency in a maintenance or flat production scenario is among the lowest in our peer group. \u2047 For every dollar of capital we are spending, we are delivering more cash flow than virtually any of our peers. \u2047 Similarly, our 2021 capex per barrel of production on either an oil or oil equivalent basis is among the lowest in our space. \u2047 In the current more disciplined environment, operating and capital efficiency are paramount and, in fact, represent our competitive differentiators. \u2047 Most importantly, as shown by the bottom right graphic, our free cash flow generation relative to our current valuation remains compelling and outsized against our peers and the broader market with a free cash flow yield approaching 20%. \u2047 We continue to believe that we must deliver outsized free cash flow generation relative to the S&P 500 to effectively compete for investor capital. \u2047 This is why we remain so focused on sustainably reducing our corporate free cash flow breakeven, now an integral part of our compensation scorecard, and continuing to optimize our cost structure. \u2047 With a free cash flow breakeven comfortably below $35 per barrel, we can generate free cash flow yield competitive with the S&P 500, assuming an annual oil price down to approximately $40 per barrel WTI. \u2047 We never rest when it comes to our structure. \u2047 In a commodity business, the low-cost producer wins, and Slide 11 provides additional details around our ongoing efforts and reinforces our multiyear track record of cash cost reductions. \u2047 We have opted to use an all-in cost basis that normalizes peer-reported data and avoids the challenges of how each operator categorizes their respective cost. \u2047 As you can see from the data, our all-in 2020 unit cash costs are well below the peer average. \u2047 On a more apples-to-apples comparison basis, our all-in unit cost are top-quartile among our direct multi-basin peers. \u2047 Specific cost-reduction actions already taken this year are broad-based, including a 25% reduction to CEO and board compensation, a"], "gold_summary": ["q1 oil production of 172,000 net bopd and q1 oil-equivalent production of 345,000 net boed.  \u2047  no change to 2021
