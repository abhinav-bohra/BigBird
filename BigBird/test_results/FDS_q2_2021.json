{"article": ["We continue to be in various remote locations today. \u2047 We may have some audio quality issues and we really appreciate your patience should we experience a disruption. \u2047 A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website. \u2047 To be fair to everyone, please limit yourself to one question plus one follow-up. \u2047 I'd now like to turn the discussion over to Phil Snow. \u2047 I'm pleased with our solid second quarter and overall first half results. \u2047 And the investments we've made to further advance our offerings in both content and workflow solutions are resonating. \u2047 Over the past 12 months, we've proven our resilience and our ability to strengthen our value to clients and we begin the second half of this fiscal year with good momentum, greater visibility and continued confidence in our ability to execute. \u2047 Our investments in content and technology are progressing at pace and we see market validation of our strategy with some key wins this quarter. \u2047 Our content advances particularly in deep sector being well received by clients, especially across the sell-side, supporting workstation growth. \u2047 And our focus on digital transformation allows us to offer more personalized solutions and an increasing number of ways to deliver value to clients. \u2047 The market is looking for solutions that are both easy to integrate and unite the front, middle and back office and we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend. \u2047 Our shift to the public cloud is progressing according to plan with the majority of our new storage and collection centers successfully migrated. \u2047 This quarter, we are particularly pleased to see growth in our core workstation offering. \u2047 The efforts we've made through our investment strategy are starting to drive our top-line and we delivered a strong first half due to our ability to execute on our pipeline with continued discipline. \u2047 In our second quarter, our organic ASV plus professional services growth rate accelerated to 5.5%. \u2047 This acceleration was led by our sales team effectively growing wallet share with existing clients as well as capturing a higher price increase in the Americas. \u2047 This was partially offset by cancellations largely across asset management firms. \u2047 We are pleased that our performance resulted in increased adjusted operating margin and EPS, we have good momentum going into our second half. \u2047 We have reaffirmed our ability to deliver results within our guidance of fiscal '21 and are raising the lower end of our full-year organic ASV growth range to $70 million from $55 million. \u2047 Helen will explain in more detail shortly. \u2047 Turning now to the performance in our regions. \u2047 The Americas growth accelerated to 6%, driven by strong sales of workstations and research and wealth solutions and data feeds in CTS solutions. \u2047 Our research solutions had a particularly good quarter supported by our digital transformation and the expansion of our deep sector content offering. \u2047 This was evident from wins with our large existing banking clients who benefited from our tailored workflows, which allow them a more connected and personalized experience. \u2047 CTS also had a successful quarter as clients bought more of our core and premium data feeds. \u2047 And in wealth, we're extremely pleased with the RBC win. \u2047 This was an entirely virtual roll out and I'm proud of how quickly and seamlessly our team integrated our Adviser Dashboard workflow and CRM solutions for RBC's entire wealth management team. \u2047 Asia-Pac accelerated its growth rate to 9% due to strong performance in Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia. \u2047 We saw wins at institutional asset managers and data providers with our research and CTS solutions. \u2047 EMEA's growth remained at 4% with wins across the region, most notably in France and the Nordics. \u2047 The region benefited from increased sales of CTS and wealth solutions to asset owners and institutional asset managers as well as accelerating new business. \u2047 Our diversifying client base continues to seek mission-critical data and we see strong demand for our growing content offering. \u2047 We're pleased with the progress we are making in the ESG market as we further integrate our ESG products into clients' everyday workflows. \u2047 We've already expanded our ESG content suite with the launch of Truvalue's UN Sustainable Development Goals Monitor. \u2047 This is in addition to a new joint offering with Ping An Insurance Group, which offers ESG metrics on companies incorporated in mainland China. \u2047 Overall, we see a long runway for growth as we execute more enterprisewide deals and believe that every touchpoint with clients today represents an opportunity to cross-sell in the future. \u2047 The conversations we are having combined with our sales team's execution make us optimistic that we will continue to grow our market share long-term. \u2047 In summary, our focus continues to be on achieving higher growth and providing clients with effective and efficient solutions across the entire investment workflow. \u2047 We remain committed to our investment strategy and to living our purpose, which is to drive the investment community to see more, think bigger and do the best work. \u2047 And we are starting to see the rewards of the efforts we are making. \u2047 We continue to push ourselves to be a more diverse, inclusive and impactful organization. \u2047 To that end, I am pleased to say we recently hired our first Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer as part of our strategy to strengthen our organizational accountability, increase diversity across all levels of our company and ensure workforce equity. \u2047 We know we have more work to do and remain committed to furthering our efforts. \u2047 I'm pleased with our progress as we strive to be the best place to work and give our employees the flexibility they need to thrive in the new normal. \u2047 I'm proud of the ways in which we are showing up for one another and for our clients every day. \u2047 With that, I'll now turn things over to Helen, who will take you through the specifics of our second quarter and first-half 2021 performance. \u2047 I hope that you and your loved ones continue to be safe and healthy. \u2047 I am proud of the FactSet team for finding new ways this past year to support both our clients and each other. \u2047 Today, I will share more details on our performance to-date and to provide an update to our annual outlook. \u2047 For the first half of fiscal 2021, we grew our revenue by 6%, expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points and increased our adjusted earnings per share by 9% year-over-year. \u2047 Our multi-year investment plan is on track and beginning to materialize in top-line growth. \u2047 I am pleased to report that the integration of the team and of the ESG and technology assets is largely complete. \u2047 As with our previous acquisitions, we will exclude any revenue and ASV[Phonetic] associated with TVL while reporting out on organic related metrics for the fiscal year 2021. \u2047 As Phil stated earlier, we grew organic ASV plus professional services at 5.5%, an acceleration from the first quarter that reflects the diligent execution of our pipeline, powered by healthy demand for workstations and data feeds. \u2047 Ongoing investments in our core solutions continue to resonate with clients as reflected in our annual Americas price increase, which totaled $14 million, $2 million more than the prior year. \u2047 As with previous years, our annual price increase is a contributor to ASV and again this year, further accelerating our growth rate. \u2047 For the second quarter, GAAP revenue increased by 6% to $392 million, while organic revenue, which excludes any impact from foreign exchange, acquisitions and deferred revenue amortization increased 5% to $389 million. \u2047 Growth was driven primarily by our Analytics and CTS solutions. \u2047 For our geographic segments, revenue growth for the Americas was at 7%, EMEA at 3% and Asia-Pacific at 10%. \u2047 All regions primarily benefited from increases in our Analytics and CTS solutions. \u2047 GAAP operating expenses grew 5% in the second quarter to $276 million, impacted by a higher cost of sales. \u2047 Compared to the previous year, our GAAP operating margin expanded by 90 basis points to 30% and our adjusted operating margin increased by 80 basis points to 33%. \u2047 These improvements are largely due to net savings from continued productivity through workforce mix and a reduction in discretionary expenses, including those related to travel, office and professional services. \u2047 These benefits were partially offset by higher spend in both compensation and technology. \u2047 As a percentage of revenue, our cost of sales was 230 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and 170 basis points higher on an adjusted basis. \u2047 This increase is driven by higher technology spend related to our shift to the public cloud and increased compensation expense for existing employees as well as new talent to support our multi-year investment plan. \u2047 When expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A improved year-over-year by 320 basis points on a GAAP basis and 250 basis points on an adjusted basis. \u2047 The primary drivers include materially lower travel and entertainment costs and reduced spend due to office closures, offset in part by higher compensation costs. \u2047 These results are in line with our expectations as noted in our full year guidance. \u2047 As discussed on previous calls, we planned for an incremental investment spend of $15 million each year starting in 2020 through 2022. \u2047 While realizing some benefits from productivity and a delayed ramp up in hiring last year, we are on track to spend around $26 million in our fiscal FY '21. \u2047 As noted on last quarter's call, we're also using a portion of the pandemic savings to invest further in both sales and new product development. \u2047 Moving on, our tax rate for the quarter was 16% compared to last year's rate of 14%, primarily due to lower tax benefits realized from stock option exercises this quarter. \u2047 GAAP earnings per share increased 9% to $2.50 this quarter versus $2.30 in the prior year. \u2047 The adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 7% to $2.72. \u2047 Both earnings per share figures were largely driven by improved operating results, partially offset by a higher tax rate. \u2047 Free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending was $130 million for the quarter, an increase of 75% over the same period last year. \u2047 This increase is primarily due to the timing of certain tax payments and lower capital expenditures as we have completed the majority of our office build-outs. \u2047 For the first quarter, our ASV retention continued to be above 95%. \u2047 We grew our total number of clients by 7% compared to the prior year, reaching over 6,000 clients for the first time in our history. \u2047 This growth reflects the addition of more wealth and corporate clients as well as data providers and asset owners, an ongoing trend as we continue to diversify our client base. \u2047 Our client retention improved to 90% year-over-year, which speaks both to the mission criticality of our solutions and the solid efforts of our sales teams. \u2047 Our user count grew 12% year-over-year and crossed the total of 150,000, largely due to additional wealth and research workstation users. \u2047 For the second quarter, we repurchased over 221,000 shares of our common stock for a total of $72 million at an average share price of $322. \u2047 Our Board of Directors recently authorized an additional $206 million to our share repurchase program, bringing the total size to $350 million, in line with recent years. \u2047 We remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. \u2047 Given our solid first half performance and improved visibility for the rest of the year, we are bringing up the lower end of our organic ASV plus professional services growth guidance range from $55 million to $70 million, so our full range is now $70 million to $85 million. \u2047 This raises our mid-point from when what we first set this guidance six months ago. \u2047 Client demand for our enhanced solutions, alongside the momentum built by our sales team, gives us greater conviction in our second half pipeline. \u2047 Based on the first half results, we are encouraged by the client response to our enhanced product suite reflected in both growth in new clients as well as increased expansion with existing clients. \u2047 We do remain in an uncertain environment as different parts of the world begin to recover from this pandemic. \u2047 Our full year views take into account that clients continue to perform in current market conditions and that additional delays in decision making and tightening client budgets could impact our short-term performance. \u2047 The global environment will continue to present challenges, but we believe we are well positioned for the longer-term. \u2047 I'll turn this over to Jerald. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports qtrly adjusted diluted earnings per share
