{"article": ["Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those that are described in Item 1A in Kohl's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as may be supplemented from time to time in Kohl's other filings with the SEC, all of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference. \u2047 2021 was a pivotal year for the company. \u2047 We achieved record earnings per share and successfully launched several key strategic initiatives that position us to drive growth for years to come. \u2047 I am proud of how our team has remained agile and focused in a challenging environment during the past couple of years. \u2047 We've proven that Kohl's is an incredibly strong and resilient company and has a very bright future. \u2047 During today's call, I want to leave you with three things. \u2047 First, we have fundamentally restructured our business to be more profitable. \u2047 In 2021, we delivered an all-time record adjusted earnings per share of $7.33, eclipsing our previous high of $5.60 in 2018. \u2047 And our operating margin of 8.6% exceeded our goal of 7% to 8% two years ahead of plan. \u2047 Second, our strategy is building momentum. \u2047 Sephora is driving impressive results, which gives us a lot of confidence as we expand the partnership to more than half of our store base this year. \u2047 We are also pleased with the ongoing strength in our active business, which grew more than 40% relative to last year. \u2047 And third, we are returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. \u2047 We continue to see a lot of value in our company and are reinforcing our commitment to driving shareholder value in 2022. \u2047 The board has approved a 100% increase in our dividend, which equates to an annual dividend of $2 per share. \u2047 In addition, the board has authorized a $3 billion share repurchase program, and we plan to repurchase at least $1 billion this year, of which $500 million is expected to be repurchased through open market transactions or an accelerated share repurchase program executed in Q2 2022. \u2047 In addition, we are focused on running our business the right way. \u2047 We have a long-standing commitment to ESG stewardship, including a strong environmental platform, diversity and inclusion strategy and focus on giving back to communities. \u2047 We continue to raise the bar in all of these areas and look forward to releasing our 2021 ESG Report in the spring, which will include details on our ESG goals, progress to date and SASB and TCFD reporting. \u2047 We remain extremely confident in driving profitable future growth and cash flow generation, and we look to build on this past year's success in 2022 and beyond. \u2047 I'll start by adding more color to our Q4 results. \u2047 We drove strong margin improvement and delivered fourth-quarter earnings per share ahead of expectations. \u2047 Following a strong sales start to the quarter, we experienced significant additional inventory receipt delays and were unable to fulfill all of the customer demand during this critical holiday time. \u2047 We estimate that our sales growth was impacted by approximately 400 basis points as a result of the worsening of supply chain disruption to our business. \u2047 We also experienced a softening in-store traffic in January due to omicron. \u2047 Our ability to navigate these challenges and still report strong earnings is a testament to how we fundamentally restructured our business to be more profitable, with an assortment that has a higher margin profile and an expense structure that is more efficient. \u2047 In terms of the top line, Q4 sales increased 6% to last year, led by a double-digit increase in-store sales. \u2047 We saw the best performance in categories where we had sufficient inventory, such as active, and conversely, weaker results in areas with inventory challenges, like women's. \u2047 This gives us confidence that as we improve our inventory position in 2022, we will be able to better capture customer demand and drive sales growth. \u2047 Stores remain extremely important to our business. \u2047 The vast majority of our customers shop our stores, and the stores play a central role in our omnichannel model. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, more than 40% of digital sales were fulfilled by stores. \u2047 As it relates to digital, sales increased 21% to the same period in 2019 and were down 1% to 2020. \u2047 As a percentage of total sales, digital sales were 39% in the quarter. \u2047 For the year, relative to 2019, digital sales increased 30% and accounted for 32% of total sales. \u2047 From a category perspective in Q4, active continues to be a key growth driver of our business, with sales increasing more than 25% to both last year and on a two-year basis. \u2047 Kohl's continues to assert itself as a leading destination for the overall active category, including performance, athleisure and outdoor, through its differentiated portfolio of national and private brands. \u2047 We saw strength across all active categories in Q4: women's, men's, and children's apparel as well as in footwear. \u2047 From a brand perspective, our key active national brands of Nike, Under Armour, adidas, and Champion all experienced exceptional growth. \u2047 In addition, our national brands of Levi's, Vans, Ninja, Koolaburra by UGG, LEGO, and Hurley also outperformed. \u2047 From a private brand standpoint, we saw strength in brands like Tek Gear, Sonoma and SO. \u2047 Jill will share more color on the quarter in a moment. \u2047 Let me now provide an update on our strategy and key 2022 initiatives. \u2047 We made important progress in our pursuit of becoming a leading destination for the active and casual lifestyle in 2021. \u2047 Core to this strategy is our product, building a meaningful beauty business, continuing to grow our active category, improving women's and introducing iconic relevant brands to further differentiate our brand portfolio. \u2047 Many of these major initiatives were launched late in 2021 and are just starting to scale, with most of the upside opportunity still ahead of us. \u2047 Let me start with our game-changing partnership with Sephora. \u2047 As we've shared before, this introduction will propel Kohl's into a leading beauty destination. \u2047 It also is a great example of how we are investing in profitable future growth by elevating our product assortment and the overall experience. \u2047 Sephora drove significant beauty sales in its first holiday season at Kohl's. \u2047 We are continuing to see increased levels of traffic and a mid-single-digit sales lift in the first 200 stores that have Sephora as compared to the balance of the chain. \u2047 We continue to see strong new customer acquisition in our Sephora stores who are younger and more diverse. \u2047 New customers represent more than 25% of Sephora at Kohl's shoppers. \u2047 Customers are shopping across a wide range of price points and categories such as makeup, skincare, and fragrance. \u2047 Some of the top-selling brands during the holiday season included Sephora Collection, Fenty, Too Faced, Charlotte Tilbury, OLAPLEX, and tarte. \u2047 Sephora at Kohl's customers are also shopping across the store. \u2047 More than half are attaching at least one other category in their purchase, with women's, accessories, and active being the most prevalent. \u2047 The frequency of customer return trips is also building the longer the Sephora shops have been opened. \u2047 Sephora will be a key driver of our growth in 2022 with the opening of another 400 new shops, reaching half of our store base. \u2047 And in 2023, we will open another 250 Sephora shops. \u2047 We are working closely with Sephora to test and launch additional opportunities to grow our collective business. \u2047 We look forward to highlighting some of these at next week's Investor Day. \u2047 In conjunction with the Sephora openings, we are also investing to elevate the overall store environment. \u2047 We are repositioning categories to deliver against our new strategy, such as moving active to the front of the store. \u2047 We continue to improve our merchandising efforts and offer an ongoing pipeline of newness and discovery. \u2047 By the end of 2022, more than half of our store base will have Sephora and the new elevated experience, which is an important milestone in our evolution. \u2047 In addition to moving active to the front of the store, we will be driving growth through further expansion in our assortment and elevated merchandising across all of our key national brands. \u2047 We're also growing our outdoor business. \u2047 Following the successful launch of Eddie Bauer, we will expand the brand offering from 500 stores to all stores in 2022. \u2047 We will also increase distribution of Under Armour Outdoor from 400 stores to all stores and remain committed to growing our business with Columbia and Lands' End. \u2047 And we're focused on further growing our plus size and big and tall businesses, which continue to resonate with our customers. \u2047 In addition to Sephora and active, let me share some of our other key initiatives, starting with men's. \u2047 Our men's business has continued to be a strong performer and benefit from our recent brand introductions of Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, and Hurley. \u2047 We look to build on this momentum in 2022 by dedicating more space and expanding each of these brands. \u2047 Let me now turn to women's, which is an important business for Kohl's. \u2047 As you know, we have taken a number of steps to reposition the women's business. \u2047 We entered 2021 with a conservative plan given the uncertainty of the year ahead and the significant transformation of that business. \u2047 As the macro environment improved, we were challenged to sufficiently replenish our inventory levels given the worsening supply chain disruption. \u2047 As a result, the core women's business operated with an average inventory down nearly 45% to 2019 during the fourth quarter. \u2047 While 2021 included many challenges, the women's business delivered multiyear highs for sell-through, turn, and margins. \u2047 You'll hear more about our women's strategy at next week's Investor Day. \u2047 We are also focused on other initiatives across the business. \u2047 We will inject more discovery into our stores with more frequent use of capsules such as: Draper James RSVP, a collection from the brand founded by Reese Witherspoon; and a premium denim offering, including Buffalo and Levi's SilverTab. \u2047 Leveraging the reach of our strong omnichannel platform, we will also be introducing dozens of emerging products and brands on a rotating basis, including brands such as Colors for Good and Love Your Melon that have a philanthropic mission. \u2047 Let me now provide a quick preview of what to expect at next week's Investor Day event. \u2047 We are looking forward to sharing with you how we are evolving Kohl's into a focused lifestyle concept with a clear mandate on driving profitable growth. \u2047 In addition to Jill and I, several other members of our executive leadership team will join us to discuss key initiatives across merchandising, marketing and technology. \u2047 We will also review our long-term financial plan and highlight our ESG efforts. \u2047 Before I hand it off to Jill, let me briefly summarize my comments today. \u2047 2021 was an important and pivotal year for Kohl's. \u2047 We accomplished a great deal strategically and financially as we've highlighted today. \u2047 Given the strong growth initiatives in front of us, we have great confidence in the future. \u2047 We are focused on driving shareholder value and are reinforcing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. \u2047 We are doubling our dividend, and our Board has approved a $3 billion share repurchase authorization, with a plan to repurchase at least $1 billion in shares in 2022. \u2047 As we close out this important year for the company, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to all of our associates across the country for their tremendous commitment and hard work. \u2047 It has been an extraordinary couple of years, and this team continues to foster a strong culture, deliver exceptional service to our customers and create a bright future for Kohl's. \u2047 I want to start by reiterating the three key takeaways from today's call: one, we have fundamentally restructured our business to be more profitable, and this is showcased by a record year of EPS; two, our strategy is building momentum, and this will continue in 2022; and three, we are reinforcing our commitment to driving shareholder value, doubling our dividend and planning to repurchase at least $1 billion in shares in 2022. \u2047 For today's call, I'm going to review our fourth-quarter results, discuss our capital allocation plans and then provide details on our 2022 guidance outlook. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, net sales increased 6% to last year, and other revenue, which is primarily credit revenue, also increased 6%. \u2047 As Michelle indicated, following a strong start to the quarter, the sales trend worsened due to inventory receipt delays and the spread of omicron. \u2047 We estimate that our sales were impacted by approximately 400 basis points in the fourth quarter as a result of supply chain challenges. \u2047 Turning to gross margin. \u2047 Q4 gross margin was 33.2%, up 124 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher inventory turns and regular price selling, reduced sourcing costs, and pricing and promotion optimization strategies. \u2047 This was partially offset by higher transportation costs as freight expense was more than 140 basis point headwind to gross margin in Q4 and was $40 million higher than we expected. \u2047 Now let me discuss SG&A. \u2047 In Q4, SG&A expenses increased 5% to $1.7 billion, driven principally by our top-line growth. \u2047 As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses leveraged by 15 basis points to last year, with improved store labor productivity and lower technology expenses more than offsetting increased wage investments across our stores and fulfillment centers. \u2047 Depreciation expense of $207 million was $11 million lower than last year due to lower capital spend. \u2047 In total, our Q4 operating margin was 6.9%, representing an increase of 172 basis points to last year. \u2047 Last, let me touch on some additional financial items. \u2047 Interest expense was $5 million lower than last year due to lower average debt outstanding during the quarter based on steps we took in 2021 to return our balance sheet to its healthy prepandemic debt structure. \u2047 Net income for the quarter was $299 million, and earnings per diluted share was $2.20. \u2047 This compares with last year's adjusted earnings per share of $2.22, which included $1.15 of tax benefits. \u2047 As evident in our performance during 2021, our strategic actions over the past 18 months to enhance our gross margin and improve the efficiency within our expense structure are working. \u2047 For the full year, we achieved a gross margin of 38.1%, which exceeded our 36% target, and we have managed expenses tightly, lowering marketing and technology spend each by more than $100 million since 2019. \u2047 These were key drivers in our ability to deliver an operating margin of 8"], "gold_summary": ["q4 earnings per
