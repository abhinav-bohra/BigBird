{"article": ["We all appreciate what a difficult year this has been. \u2047 Even in the face of this incredible adversity, Stride has been able to thrive. \u2047 We've only been able to do so because of the commitment of our thousands of team members. \u2047 These folks have been dedicated to our customers and the families that need an alternative approach to education, now more than ever before. \u2047 This is also a year in which the country and the world took notice of online and distance learning in a mainstream way, but the experience is not always positive. \u2047 Across the country, many schools struggled with uncertainty and inconsistency for students and families, as they vacillated between online and in-person instruction. \u2047 Our teachers, platforms, content and curriculum are all developed to meet this need. \u2047 [Technical Issues] many have not embraced it. \u2047 Others realize its potential if done the right way. \u2047 We stand-alone, having served millions of students in our online bundle. \u2047 And while many schools struggled with learning loss and deteriorating test scores, our result outpaced them in the phase of on-boarding a record number of families for our programs. \u2047 I will get to how we are turning to this formula. \u2047 First, I am going to review some of our fiscal 2021 accomplishment. \u2047 By almost any measure, we had a record year, by a long-shot. \u2047 We helped over a quarter of a million full-time learners and millions of other users became interested in our programs. \u2047 Learning loss became the norm, except in the schools we managed. \u2047 No wonder the national data showed an overall enrollment decline of [Technical Issues]. \u2047 We published our first ever ESG report backed by a number of key initiatives. \u2047 A new partnership with National Association of Black Male Educators designed to increase the diversity of teachers across the country. \u2047 A program with Teach for America to share practical online experience to student and teachers. \u2047 Our We Stand Together College Scholarship, a $10 million multi-year commitment to support underrepresented students. \u2047 But we are not relying on the tailwinds of the pandemic to set our long-term path forward. \u2047 We rebranded our company from K12 to Stride to ensure that our name better reflects the commitment to providing educational opportunities for learners of all levels. \u2047 We acquired two high growth, higher margin companies to expand our adult Career Learning offers. \u2047 We held an Investor Day to outline our strategy and growth trajectory through fiscal year 2025, a trajectory that I believe we are well on track to hit and we raised almost $360 million through a convertible note offering to facilitate further investment in both organic and inorganic growth. \u2047 In our General Education business, we saw student enrollment increase by almost 50%. \u2047 With all the uncertainty this past year, we saw dramatic improvements in retention, in both our General Education as well as our Career Education business. \u2047 And we did not see the mass withdrawal of students in the second half of the school year, as many states began to reopen their brick and mortar schools. \u2047 This is a testament to the stickiness and value propositions of our programs. \u2047 As we've mentioned previously, students who enrolled in our Career Learning programs tend to retain at a higher level than our General Education students and we believe this trend will continue. \u2047 We also had a record number of reregistration families, indicating that they will be returning for the fall. \u2047 Our Career Learning business finished the year with over $250 million in revenue. \u2047 This is an increase from less than $10 million just four years ago, a 150% compounded annual growth. \u2047 This year, we saw a growth of over 125% to almost 30,000 students. \u2047 These programs offer a career path without the need for expensive college degree. \u2047 And we're increasing the programs from our MedCerts acquisition that we will offer the high school students the certificates in the healthcare industry. \u2047 Both our MedCerts and Tech Elevator acquisitions continue to grow and contribute to the bottom line and are exceeding our expectations from when we purchased. \u2047 They are high growth, high margin market opportunity platforms for us that we will continue to leverage into other areas of our business, particularly our high school programs. \u2047 We will continue our focus on IT and healthcare training because these industries are projected to add more than 2.5 million new positions in the US by 2029. \u2047 On the other hand, our Galvanize acquisition has not performed according to our plan. \u2047 We've restructured this business and believe we now have a glide path to both renewed growth and profitability heading into next year. \u2047 We will also look for ways to invest behind and expand our adult learning offerings with a lens for making Career Learning a $1 billion plus business. \u2047 In June, we released our inaugural ESG initiatives report. \u2047 As an Education and Career Learning company, we have a significant opportunity to help achieve global education, workforce and diversity and inclusion goals. \u2047 All of our ESG initiatives are based on the four cornerstones; extending lifelong learning for today's competitive workforce; supporting racial and socio-economic equity and inclusion; fostering transparent leadership, governance and professional development; and contributing to a more sustainable world. \u2047 For me, our focus on learning outcomes is the most important aspect of all our ESG efforts. \u2047 Stride is in a unique position to influence the lives of millions of students of all ages. \u2047 Not many of our companies have that kind of impact or carry that responsibility. \u2047 We don't take that responsibility lightly. \u2047 By now, everyone is aware of the significant shortages impacting the workforce. \u2047 Stride is well-positioned to help alleviate that shortage. \u2047 To that end, we have set 10-year goals that are driven by learner outcomes. \u2047 So by 2030, our goals are to graduate over 100,000 students from our Stride career high school program, to graduate hundreds of thousands of students from our adult programs, and to achieve leading graduation of learning growth rates for over a million students. \u2047 Our report contains a lot more specific information on our ESG efforts. \u2047 I encourage everyone to read it. \u2047 Now I want to turn to fiscal year '22. \u2047 The long-term trends, prospects for our General Education and Career Learning businesses, both remain tremendous. \u2047 The COVID-19 pandemic has raised consumer awareness around the need for and the benefits of online education in grades K through 12 and in adult learning. \u2047 While it doesn't work for everyone, many students and families have realized that online learning and the flexibility it provides is a preferred alternative. \u2047 Increased awareness and openness to different options to meet educational needs fundamentally provides for a long-term tailwind for all aspects of our business. \u2047 As we do every year, we will try to provide formal fiscal '22 guidance during our first quarter earnings call in October. \u2047 So while we're not providing guidance right now, I do want to provide some insights into how the current enrollment season is trending. \u2047 Even now in August, we're still less than halfway through the volume of our typical enrollment season. \u2047 And this means that these trends could shift in the coming weeks. \u2047 Additionally, the pandemic has increased uncertainty around all these metrics, so please do not extrapolate what I am about to say. \u2047 We have not seen the massive return to brick and mortar school [Technical Issues]. \u2047 We are currently exceeding the number of reregistrations that we saw during fiscal '21 and in previous years. \u2047 Right now, we're well ahead of where we would be normally in enrollments versus pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Awareness for our offerings is at an all-time high, the pandemic helped to drive awareness [Technical Issues] and now they just need to choose. \u2047 Conversion rates from our new leads are an all-time high. \u2047 So when families seek us out, they're more likely to enroll. \u2047 We believe that health and safety continue to be top priority for families and we're seeing that and we're seeing even stronger demand in states where the Delta variant has surged. \u2047 Our goal is clear, is to grow every year and importantly, we remain on track to achieving the long-term revenue and profitability targets that we outlined during the Investor Day last fall. \u2047 We still anticipate achieving revenue of $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion, adjusted operating income of $250 million to $350 million by the year 2025. \u2047 Now I'll hand the call over to Tim to discuss our full year 2021 results. \u2047 First, let me recap our reported results. \u2047 Revenue for the full fiscal year 2021 was $1.54 billion, an increase of 48% over the prior fiscal year. \u2047 Adjusted operating income was $161.4 million, up 160% compared to the prior year. \u2047 Capital expenditures were $52.3 million, an increase of $7.3 million over last year. \u2047 In each case, these results met or beat the expectations we provided in our guidance last quarter. \u2047 The outperformance was primarily driven by favorable revenue for enrollment and retention. \u2047 Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, it is still too early to confidently forecast our current date enrollments for the reasons James just outlined. \u2047 Given where we are in the process, there remains variability around two key factors; firstly, ongoing reregistration and new enrollments and secondly, the retention of these enrollments once school starts and through the month of September. \u2047 Now here's what I can say today about fiscal year 2022. \u2047 We expect to grow adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA year-over-year compared to our strong fiscal year 2021 results. \u2047 Furthermore, we believe that the increased awareness and acceptance of online and hybrid education accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic has sustainably reset the baseline for the General Education business. \u2047 Therefore, we are confident that General Education revenue in fiscal year 2022 will be significantly larger than it was in fiscal year 2020. \u2047 As we have done in the past, we will refrain from providing guidance until we report our first quarter fiscal 2022 results in October. \u2047 By that time, we will have much greater visibility into enrollments for the new school year. \u2047 Returning to our results for fiscal year 2021. \u2047 Revenue from our General Education business increased $346 million or 37% to $1.28 billion. \u2047 This is due primarily to higher enrollments, partially offset by lower revenue per enrollment. \u2047 General ed enrollments rose 45% year-over-year to more than 156,000, while revenue per enrollment declined 5%. \u2047 The decline in revenue per enrollment was due primarily to state budgetary pressures, resulting from COVID-19 and a higher mix of lower funded states. \u2047 As we stated last quarter, we expect revenue per enrollment to improve next year, given what we know today about state budgets and policy. \u2047 Career Learning revenue rose to $256.6 million in FY '21, an increase of 140%. \u2047 This growth was driven by significantly higher volumes in our Stride Career Prep Programs, as well as organic growth and new acquisitions in our adult learning businesses. \u2047 We expect to continue growing our Stride Career Prep Programs in FY '22 with plans to open four new programs and expand eight existing programs in FY '22. \u2047 Gross margins were 34.8%, up 140 basis points compared to fiscal 2020, driven by an increased contribution from the higher margin adult learning businesses and lower costs from efficiencies and automation initiatives. \u2047 We expect margin improvement to continue into fiscal 2022. \u2047 We are confident that we will achieve our 36% to 39% gross margin targets much sooner than fiscal 2025, which was our original target communicated during our November 2020 Investor Day. \u2047 Selling, general and administrative expenses were $424.4 million, up 35% from fiscal 2020. \u2047 The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by higher costs associated with our enrollment growth and increase in stock-based compensation expense and the annualization of expenses for our adult learning businesses. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA of $239.9 million reflects an increase of 87% over FY '20. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 400 basis points from 12% of revenue in FY '20 to 16% in FY '21. \u2047 The margin improvement and growth in adjusted EBITDA are driven by higher revenue and improved operating leverage. \u2047 Stock-based compensation expense came in at $39.3 million, up 67% year-over-year, driven by the timing of certain stock-based grants tied to our Career Learning business. \u2047 We currently expect stock-based compensation expense to decline to a range of $30 million to $34 million in FY '22. \u2047 Interest expense totaled $18 million for fiscal 2021, in line with the expectations we provided last quarter. \u2047 This consisted of approximately $5 million in cash interest and $13 million in non-cash amortization of the discount in fees on our convertible senior notes. \u2047 In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we early adopted new accounting guidance related to our convertible notes. \u2047 This will result in the elimination of the non-cash debt discount expense among other impacts. \u2047 As such, we expect our interest expense in FY '22 to be materially lower and more in line with the cash interest we recognized in FY '21. \u2047 Our full year tax rate for FY '21 was 26%, below the guidance range we provided last quarter. \u2047 We had some positive tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and had the effect of lowering our tax rate for the year. \u2047 In FY '22, we anticipate an increase in non-deductible compensation that will cause our tax rate to be closer to the 28% to 30% range. \u2047 Capital expenditures for the year totaled $52.3 million, up 16% from the prior year, due mainly to higher capitalized software development costs associated with adult learning, automation and improvements to our platforms. \u2047 Capex, as a percent of revenue was 3.4% and that is lower than our historical average of approximately 4% to 5% over the past few years. \u2047 Free cash flow defined as cash from operations less capex totaled $81.9 million for FY 2021. \u2047 This was approximately $45 million below the expectations provided at Investor Day last November due entirely to the timing of receipts, which drove lower than expected cash from operations. \u2047 Some of the timing issues were associated with our growth in states that regularly pay in the following year and some were related to delayed payments due to COVID. \u2047 In fiscal 2022, we expect to have significantly higher free cash flow, reflecting these timing issues from fiscal 2021. \u2047 Finally, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $386.1 million, an increase of $173.8 million compared to the same period a year ago. \u2047 We believe that our strong free cash flow generation and liquidity will continue to provide the financial flexibility to fund our existing operations and pursue strategic acquisitions. \u2047 To summarize, fiscal 2021 was a landmark year for Stride. \u2047 We saw record enrollments in both our General Ed and Career"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts career learning revenue of over $250 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 revenue $1.54 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $1.28 billion.  \u2047  q1 revenue $1.54 billion versus $1.28 billion."]}
