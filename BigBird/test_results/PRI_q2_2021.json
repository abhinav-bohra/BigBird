Report on Form 8-K, which are available at the SEC website www. \u2047 Let me make a quick few remarks about the -- what we're seeing in our market before we get into our results. \u2047 Florida seemed to be in -- caught up in it more than probably any other state. \u2047 And there was a lot of concern as to whether that will impact the economy and to what extent. \u2047 I'm happy to report three months into it now, Delta seems fairly in the rearview mirror. \u2047 I think they have come down to even lower than they were three months back. \u2047 So we're happy about that. \u2047 But what we were most happy about is also that does not actually have the same kind of impact that previous surges have had on the economy. \u2047 I think the economy is learning to deliver these surges at when they happen. \u2047 Hopefully, there won't be anymore, but at least over the last three months, we did not see a significant impact to the local economy here or in other parts of the country where we do business. \u2047 But it's good to see Delta behind us obviously with a fair amount of pain that we wanted to of the healthcare side. \u2047 We -- the Delta surge did put our plans about return to office on hold a little bit. \u2047 We have started bringing people back in, in the summer. \u2047 We have to take a pause. \u2047 Later today, I will be making a call internally and we will be talking about how we're going to restart that process. \u2047 Our expectation is that by January -- first week of January, we will be in the new normal, and typically now that slowly started bringing people back. \u2047 We will start that but not even for Board meetings, we've not had in-person Board meeting since the start of the pandemic. \u2047 Yesterday, the Board met telephonically and decided it was time to -- to start meeting in person. \u2047 Our first in-person Board meeting, which will be over two days in the middle of November. \u2047 So I'm excited about that, too. \u2047 Overall, the economy here in Florida is doing well. \u2047 There are obviously widespread labor shortages and supply chain disruptions that everyone has talked about. \u2047 We are seeing that. \u2047 Our customers are feeling it. \u2047 Indirectly, we're feeling that as well. \u2047 But it's hard for me to say when those will resolve themselves. \u2047 But that is the challenges we're dealing with. \u2047 I look at this -- the biggest economic crisis of our lifetime that we went through. \u2047 It's 18 months into it. \u2047 If all we're dealing with the supply chain issues and labor shortages, I think that's a pretty good place to be. \u2047 This could happen a lot worse. \u2047 So I take this as actually a victory that these are the issues. \u2047 This could happen a lot worse. \u2047 Quickly getting into our quarter, we posted net income of $87 million or $0.94 a share. \u2047 This compares to $104 million we posted last quarter, which was $1.11 per share. \u2047 The annualized returns so far for the 9 months so far -- our return on equity is 12.4% and return on assets of 1.09%. \u2047 Net interest income declined slightly to $195 million from $198 million last quarter, but it was up compared to the third quarter of last year, which I think at that time, it was $188 million. \u2047 The net contracted 2.33% from 2.37%, mostly because of lower asset yields and less than expected commercial loan growth. \u2047 Also, less PPP impact this quarter versus last quarter was also a large reason for that contraction. \u2047 Cost of deposits, as we've been telling you, has -- continues to come down. \u2047 We dropped at 20 basis points this quarter. \u2047 It was 25 last quarters so 5 basis point reduction in the cost of deposits. \u2047 On a spot basis, we're actually at 19 basis points and I checked last night, we're down another basis points so like 18 basis points as of yesterday. \u2047 So the story on the deposit side continues. \u2047 We also had decent growth in deposits especially DDA -- non-interest DDA grew by $324 million. \u2047 But we did that very meaningfully -- we're not trying to grow the balance sheet. \u2047 Growing the balance sheet and hanging things up in liquidity does not really create value for anyone. \u2047 Instead, this quarter we decided not to grow the balance sheet. \u2047 We shrank it, freed up capital and bought back stock quite strongly. \u2047 In fact one of the things the Board did yesterday when we met is approved another $150 million buyback given that we are going to wind down the authorization that we have based on how quickly we bought stock this quarter. \u2047 Also, the fact that the stock was around $40 or so makes it very easy in my -- from my perspective given where our book value is we're trading at such a low multiple so easy. \u2047 It doesn't take much of rocket science to figure out, but it's a good buy. \u2047 So we've been aggressive and buying back and we've gone through much of that -- much of the authorization. \u2047 Loans -- Total loans excluding PPP runoff, they grew by $74 million. \u2047 Residential business remained strong as has been the case for the last several quarters. \u2047 Commercial segments, the payoffs outpaced production. \u2047 On the production side, actually we were pretty happy. \u2047 Our production -- we try to go back and say, let's see what we were doing pre-pandemic and we compared the production this quarter to the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 Production was actually higher this quarter. \u2047 But it's the -- it's two things that we can control, one being payoffs and the other line utilization. \u2047 Those have been disappointed[Phonetic] this quarter, which is why it all adds up to only about $74 million of growth in the loan portfolio. \u2047 What else, credit, I would say nothing but good news on the credit front. \u2047 I know these days, credit is not on people's mind or should always be on everyone's mind, that's the primary risk we take as a bank. \u2047 So I'm happy to report on the credit front criticized classified assets declined by $240 million. \u2047 Loans under temporary deferral or modified under the CARES Act also declined to $285 million. \u2047 They were $497 million I believe at end of last quarter, so almost cut in half. \u2047 NPL ratio also got better. \u2047 It was 1.21% this quarter. \u2047 Last quarter, it was 1.28%. \u2047 By the way, that includes the guaranteed portion of SBA loans. \u2047 So if you exclude that NPL ratio, it's actually 99 basis points. \u2047 The $69 million large commercial loan that we spoke to you about last quarter, it's the resolution of that is moving forward. \u2047 We're pretty happy with how we reserve for it and feel very comfortable in that level of reserve. \u2047 Net charge-offs annualized was 19 basis points. \u2047 Last year, I think we were at about 26 basis points. \u2047 So good news on the net charge-offs front as well. \u2047 Capital, book value has grown to $34.39, tangible is at $33.53. \u2047 Before I hand this over to Tom, just let me say, sort of what are the top in my mind in terms of what we're trying to achieve in the short to medium term sales is basically loan growth but not reaching for loan growth as getting caught up in that and going outside of the risk, that's not acceptable but loan growth restarting the growth engine on the left of the balance sheet is a top priority, continue to improve deposits, while we've made a lot of progress on that. \u2047 I think there is more work to be done there, especially in light of the fact that actually it will rise, maybe nine months, maybe less, maybe a little more but some -- on great environment that we have to be ready for it. \u2047 And we are basically working our deposit business to be -- that. \u2047 In the very short-term is to return to office safely is another priority and then launching in new markets. \u2047 The new markets we've talked about last time to you, we don't really have much to share yet because it's not going to ready for primetime, but we have been working for the last three months on finalizing and hopefully over the -- over the course of next threemonths, we will make some announcements and launch one or two new markets. \u2047 So I wanted to spend a little time first on deposits, give you a little bit more detail and perspective on some of the things that we're working on and what we achieved in the quarter. \u2047 So as Raj said, average non-interest bearing deposits grew by $749 million for the quarter and $2.7 billion compared to the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Period-end non-interest bearing DDA grew by $324 million, while total deposits shrank by $493 million. \u2047 So we break down a little bit the $324 million of NII DDA growth for the quarter, it was again broad spread across all geographies, across all business units and very heavily focused on new client acquisition. \u2047 I'd also spend a little bit of time working on the deposit portfolio, the work that Raj is talking about is, has been a daily level of kind of bruising work that's not that glamorous but we're working very hard on new account operating relationships, cross-selling within the book, ensuring the ECR rates are set at appropriate levels really working hard on kind of the building blocks of this and I think the two places that you see it, number one, are the continued NII DDA growth obviously in the $324 million, but also secondarily, if you look at service charges, deposit fees on accounts was up 33% for this quarter compared to the same period last year. \u2047 So we're really starting to see excellent kind of cadence in the rhythm in both continued NII DDA growth, continued opening of new operating account business, which is really our central focus as a strategy and continuing for a surging in the level of service charge revenue that we have from these accounts. \u2047 So all of that is -- is a big part of what Raj talks about when we're talking about the entire deposit mix and the quality of the deposit book. \u2047 A little further down, money market accounts declined by $1.1 billion this quarter as we continue to execute the strategy of the quality of the base. \u2047 We have looked hard at accounts that we think are highly susceptible to increases in rates once we get into a different interest rate environment and we've taken a lot of steps to ensure that we're moving out deposit accounts right now on a proactive basis as we continue to grow the operating account business and take advantage of that entire dynamic to have just an overall better quality book. \u2047 Switching to the loan side, as Raj said, excluding PPP loans, the total portfolio grew by $74 million in the third quarter. \u2047 Residential continued to be strong, reflecting the strength in the housing market and the rate environment. \u2047 The overall resi portfolio grew by $751 million for the quarter. \u2047 Of that, the EBL segment was $50 million and the pure residential correspondent portfolio grew by $701 million. \u2047 In the mortgage warehousing business, which is also benefited from a strong housing market, there we saw a decline of $141 million for the quarter. \u2047 Most of that is starting to see some normalization in this segment. \u2047 This refi activity begins to moderate. \u2047 And we see a little bit lower line utilization in this area. \u2047 Although we continue to be interested in growing commitments and expect our commitment book to grow in the short-term. \u2047 For the C&I business, it was up $13 million for the quarter, including owner occupied CRE loans and I'll talk a little bit more about what we see in that the segment. \u2047 The remaining commercial portfolio declined for the quarter. \u2047 The largest decline was in CRE including multifamily, which was down by an aggregate of $317 million for the quarter. \u2047 The New York multifamily portfolio, which you have been following now with us for a number of years, declined by $76 million for the quarter. \u2047 But at this point, we believe that, that's stabilizing. \u2047 That's the lowest level of run-off that we have seen in a number of quarters. \u2047 And we're actually starting to see some positives in the multifamily market in New York. \u2047 I'm sure you all have followed it. \u2047 We're starting to see rent increases in the market. \u2047 We're starting to see people return back to the New York City. \u2047 Multifamily market schools are reopening and things are happening that are driving people returning to the city. \u2047 There's been an awful lot of data out in the last couple of months about rent -- rent levels even with concessions improving back to sort of pre-pandemic levels, and we are looking at new opportunities now in the multifamily space within the New York market. \u2047 So we're feeling better. \u2047 We're feeling good about the portfolio we have today at the current level that it's had and we're feeling better about the short-term growth opportunities within multifamily in New York. \u2047 I'd land a little bit more on Raj's comments about production. \u2047 When we looked at production across the commercial lines especially C&I, CRE and small business areas, it was better than pre-pandemic levels for the same quarter. \u2047 We are seeing a reasonable return of pipeline particularly in the C&I area where we have a large pipeline heading into the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. \u2047 So we're seeing clients investing more. \u2047 We are still fighting through kind of low utilization rates and even really of the accounts that we're bringing on from an NII DDA perspective that have lines of credit with them even those lines are coming in at pretty low utilization rates, but we think ultimately that patience will pay off for us and as people start making more capex expenditures and growing more solidly in 2022, we believe these relationships including existing ones we have, we'll start to see improvements in these areas. \u2047 But actually overall production and pipeline build, we feel pretty optimistic about right now heading into the fourth quarter and heading into -- into 2022. \u2047 Yeah, line utilization bottomed out in the first quarter. \u2047 It's starting to improve all through the second quarter. \u2047 So we were pretty optimistic because we're seeing a very steady trend of improvement. \u2047 But in the third quarter, it's really stagnated so it haven't gone down, but it really hasn"], "gold_summary": ["compname posts q3 earnings per share $0.94.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $0.94."],
