{"article": ["Leading today's discussion are Vince McMahon, WWE's Chairman and CEO; Nick Khan, WWE's President and Chief Revenue Officer; Stephanie McMahon, WWE's Chief Brand Officer; and Kristina Salen, WWE's Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Their remarks will be followed by a Q&A session. \u2047 Actual results may differ materially and undue reliance should not be placed on them. \u2047 Additionally, the matters we will be discussing today may include non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 You should note that all comparisons are versus the year-ago quarter, unless otherwise described. \u2047 Like every other form of entertainment, we're sports. \u2047 We're coming out of COVID. \u2047 At first, we were in survival mode, but we found a way. \u2047 Once we felt secure, we then saw this as an opportunity too. \u2047 We think the way we do business and open what, I call, a WWE treasure chest, the only way to do that the best management team in WWE history. \u2047 We have that team, a team that's innovative, drives revenue and as we organize our company in a far more efficient way to take advantage of new revenue streams, new online platforms, new consumer products, new content creation and new opportunities to expand our media rights portfolio on a global basis, I'm always excited about our business. \u2047 I don't think I've ever been as excited as I am now. \u2047 This is Nick Khan. \u2047 It's going to be nice to speak with all of you again. \u2047 Since our last earnings call, there have been significant developments in the media industry. \u2047 We'd like to discuss them and how the economics of these deals signal to us, a marketplace that continues to put premium on live content. \u2047 Additionally, we'd like to outline a number of new revenue streams we've identified in the recent corner -- quarter, excuse me. \u2047 I will end by providing an update on our expanding original programing slate, as well as giving you an update on our return to live events and touring. \u2047 Recent developments in media have been highlighted by the completion of new content distribution deals. \u2047 First, as we discussed last earnings call, Amazon grabbed the Thursday Night NFL package. \u2047 So we have no inside knowledge of this, we wouldn't be shocked if Amazon was negotiating now, as we speak, to get that package on its air exclusively early. \u2047 In terms of leads, both the NFL and NHL realized substantial increases in the rights fees for their license programs, demonstrating the continuing value of live content. \u2047 The NFL saw a media rights increase of 79% even as linear ratings went down a little bit in recent season. \u2047 The NHL has already doubled its media rights AAV, having sold just over half of its package. \u2047 In the case of the NHL, linear ratings are down about 25%. \u2047 In this context, the NHL received tremendous credit for already doubling its AAV from $200 million to $400 million, with another package still available for sale in the marketplace. \u2047 Our bet is that part of the package goes to a new suitor. \u2047 These deals are indicative of where the media rights marketplace is and where it continues to head. \u2047 One of the big takeaways to us, if you look at these packages, is that the overwhelming majority of the media networks are paying to license both the linear rights as well as streaming rights. \u2047 The days of splitting those rights appear to be over for the moment. \u2047 Look at the NFL, which often sets the standard in media rights negotiations. \u2047 Each media partner outside of Amazon paid a multiple of what they were previously paying for the rights to show the games on linear or digital or both. \u2047 It's clear to us that these companies view live rights as meaningful subscription and retention programing for their OTT services. \u2047 We are confident that our robust marketplace with interested buyers across broadcast cable and OTT positions our rights portfolio for long-term growth. \u2047 We had an early case study in WWE delivering audiences for our partners' streaming services a little over two weeks ago, when our premiere event, WrestleMania, was distributed for the first time exclusively on Peacock in the United States. \u2047 We were thrilled with the result and our partners at Peacock were even happier. \u2047 Stephanie will provide a more thorough update on these achievements from WrestleMania momentarily, but we couldn't be more pleased with the first event. \u2047 The promotion from our partners at Fox and NBCU leading into it and the number of conversations we have engaged in subsequent for the Peacock partnership announcement. \u2047 And coming off of the subscriber and viewership success of WrestleMania that was delivered to Peacock, we're excited about possibly replicating the licensing of WWE's network to potential streaming partners in key international territories. \u2047 It's a story we're sharing with the international community as we introduced WWE Network to potential partners across the globe. \u2047 If you look at the success that we're having with our Tencent deal in China, we've seen a 30 times increase in views across all platforms in China, since striking this deal, with 30% of that coming from the viewership on Tencent. \u2047 We look at the success we continue to have in India and the United Kingdom, we're excited to replicate that and to grow it further. \u2047 Of course, content rights are not our only revenue focus, we're always looking at new streams of revenue. \u2047 On April 10, our first day of WrestleMania, we dropped our first NFT, featuring iconic moments from the Undertaker's legendary WWE career. \u2047 Many of these sold out in seconds. \u2047 We were thrilled with our first foray into this space. \u2047 Considering our vast library of wholly owned intellectual property, look for more NFTs from us in the near future. \u2047 In this quarter, we also made a key deal in the gambling space. \u2047 Stephanie is going to provide background on that deal later as well. \u2047 As we continue to expand WWE's brand beyond the ring, we remain focused on developing the slate of original programing from our WWE Studio. \u2047 We've sold a multi-episode animated series to Crunchyroll, which, as all of you know, is now owned by Sony, Young rock, which we've talked about previously, chronicles the real life journey of Dwayne Johnson from childhood to WWE legend and beyond. \u2047 They debuted on NBC and it's doing significant business on NBC and with rears on USA and Peacock. \u2047 And last Sunday, the Stone Cold Steve Austin documentary was the highest-rated biography in 16 years on A&E. \u2047 Our other show on A&E that night, WWE's Most Wanted Treasures retained 79% of that lead end audience. \u2047 There are seven more biographies featuring our superstars each Sunday for the next seven weeks. \u2047 Again, all of these projects from sitcoms to unscripted to documentary to animate are produced or co-produced by us via our Studio. \u2047 Last, as I mentioned earlier, stay tuned for our announcement showcasing our full-time return to live event touring. \u2047 This year's WrestleMania was historic for many reasons, attracting more than 50,000 fans, representing full capacity for the two-night event. \u2047 I would be remiss if I didn't mention how amazing it felt to have the opportunity to stand on the stage, look out at the faces in the audience and hear their cheers. \u2047 From the superstars next to me to the people in the crowd to even maybe my father Vince McMahon, there wasn't a dry eye as we all celebrated something much bigger than ourselves, the power of the lion. \u2047 Last year's WrestleMania with no fans at our performance centers went back to Raymond James Stadium with a full circle moment, providing a sense of hope for the future and where our signature then, now, forever became then, now, forever together. \u2047 It is because of this powerful fan base, what we call the WWE Universe that we were able to achieve record-breaking performances across all of our platforms, including reaching new audiences through our domestic streaming partner, NBCU's Peacock. \u2047 And a world went 52 days, we successfully launched our partnership with Peacock with cross-functional task forces responsible for assimilating meta data, transporting and formatting our most viewed content and creating marketing direct to consumer campaigns and one of the most comprehensive publicity plans we have ever had for WrestleMania. \u2047 One executive at Peacock described our process as a best-in-class example for how partnerships should work. \u2047 The results with the most viewed live events in Peacock's young history. \u2047 The launch was supported by two integrated media campaigns executed across the Comcast, NBCU, Peacock and WWE portfolio. \u2047 WrestleMania media coverage increased 25% with over 500 individual new stories, representing 1.2 billion media impressions. \u2047 Creatively, everything kicked off the Friday before with the WrestleMania addition of SmackDown on FOX, where Jey Uso won the esteemed Andre the Giant Battle Royal. \u2047 Sasha Banks and Bianca Belair became the first African-American female superstars to main event WrestleMania. \u2047 Pop star, Bebe Rexha, saying the national anthem and hip-hop star, Wale, rapped Big E down to the ring. \u2047 Grammy award winning artist Bad Bunny and YouTube influencer Logan Paul found themselves getting in on the action inside the ring. \u2047 Bad Bunny's performance received praise from ESPN, counting it as one of, if not, the most impressive showings by a celebrity in the ring. \u2047 And apparently, a lot of people enjoyed seeing YouTube influencer Logan Paul gets stunned as he trended number two on Twitter and generated nearly 100 million impressions on social media alone. \u2047 WWE also secured a record 14 new and returning blue chip partners for WrestleMania, including Snickers as the presenting partner for the sixth consecutive year and presenting partner of the main event. \u2047 Papa John's Cricket Wireless, P&G's Old Spice, Credit One Bank and DraftKings. \u2047 DraftKings is now an official gaming partner of WWE, focusing on their signature free-to-play pools, which included placing some fun bets on main event matches in both nights of WrestleMania. \u2047 Video views during WrestleMania week across digital and social platforms, including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, hit 1.1 billion and 32 million hours of content were consumed, representing a 14% and 9% increase, respectively. \u2047 WWE related content saw 115 million engagements and WrestleMania was also the world's most social program, both nights of the weekend, delivering 71 Twitter trends. \u2047 As Nick mentioned, for the first time, we launched a series of NFTs, featuring the Undertaker at record-breaking WrestleMania weekend e-commerce sales and record merchandise per capita sales in stadiums. \u2047 We also held more than 10 community activations throughout the week, including collaborating with the Mayor's Office to customize our vaccination messaging for the local market, recognizing local community champions, teaming with FOX Sports to donate equipment to Special Olympics, Florida, and working with various organizations, including Feeding Tampa Bay to combat food and nutrition and security. \u2047 On USA Network, the following Night Raw delivered its best performance in the 18 to 49 demo in over a year and NXT's debut on its New Night on Tuesday was up 29% in the 18 to 49 demo year-over-year. \u2047 As we move toward our next streaming special, WrestleMania Backlash on Sunday, May 16, we are excited to build on our recent success, grow our audience through Peacock's enhanced reach, align with Iconic franchises, such as the Olympics and the Super Bowl and continue to leverage Peacock sales and promotional teams. \u2047 Additionally, key brand metrics in the first quarter are as follows. \u2047 TV viewership continued to remain stable, maintaining a trend that began when we transitioned out of the performance center and invested in WWE ThunderDome at the end of August. \u2047 From that time to the end of this quarter, Raw ratings have held steady and SmackDown ratings increased 9%. \u2047 Notably, all Raw appearances featuring Bad Bunny showed an increase of 31% in the Hispanic persons 18 to 34 demo. \u2047 And Bad Bunny's total social impressions during the time of his story lines equaled nearly 700 million. \u2047 Digital consumption increased 7% to 367 million hours. \u2047 WWE's flagship YouTube channel crossed 75 million subscribers and is now the fourth most viewed YouTube channel in the world. \u2047 WWE sales and sponsorship revenue increased 19%, excluding the loss of a large scale international event. \u2047 As I mentioned on our last call, brands are looking for unique ways to reach their consumers. \u2047 WWE is perfectly positioned to do just that with the ability to create customized content experiences and utilize WWE superstars that resonate with target audiences. \u2047 For example, the creation of our digital content series, Grit & Glory, for GM's Chevy Silverado brand and the creation of a new superstar, the Night Panther and a first-ever campaign integration across multiple platforms to market the new scent from Old Spice. \u2047 In our view, WWE is well positioned to continue to elevate our brand, grow our business and engage new and existing consumers across all media platforms. \u2047 As Vince, Nick and Stephanie highlighted, transitioning WWE Network to Peacock, while launching WrestleMania with a live audience of 50,000 fans in attendance is a major accomplishment. \u2047 I would add by the flexibility, speed and sheer brute force of will demonstrated by the WWE team, the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit on display was as strong as I've seen in my 25-plus years prior in the tech industry. \u2047 Today, I'll discuss WWE's financial performance, which underscores that spirit. \u2047 As a reminder, all comparisons are versus the year ago quarter, unless I say otherwise. \u2047 In the first quarter, WWE continued to manage a challenging environment. \u2047 Total WWE revenue was $263.5 million, a decline of 9% due to the cancellation of live events, including a large scale international event and the associated loss of merchandise sales, all due to COVID-19. \u2047 Despite this decline, adjusted OIBDA grew 9% to $83.9 million, reflecting the upfront recognition related to WWE's licensing agreement and the decline in operating expenses that resulted from the absence of live events. \u2047 Looking at the WWE media segment, adjusted OIBDA was $107 million, growing 4% as increased revenue and profit from WWE's licensing agreement with Peacock, as well as increased revenue from the escalation of domestic core content rights fees more than offset the absence of a large scale international event. \u2047 During the quarter, we continue to produce Raw and SmackDown in our state-of-the-art environment, WWE ThunderDome, at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. \u2047 Our operating results continue to be impacted by the year-over-year increase in production costs associated with bringing nearly 1,000 live virtual fans into our show, surrounded by pyrotechnics, laser displays and drone cameras, we did achieve some efficiency quarter"], "gold_summary": ["q1 revenue fell 9 percent to $263.5 million.  \u2047  not changing full year guidance at this time.  \u2047  q1 2021 results were up, largely
