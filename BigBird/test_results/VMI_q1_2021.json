{"article": ["Avner will review our financial performance and provide trends and key assumptions for the second quarter and full year 2021, with closing remarks from Steve. \u2047 This will be followed by Q&A. \u2047 A replay of today's call will be available for the next seven days. \u2047 I would now like to call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Kaniewski. \u2047 Before we recap our first quarter results, I would like to share some opening comments. \u2047 On March 8th, we recognized our 75th anniversary as a company. \u2047 We've come a long way since 1946, when our Founder, Robert B. Daugherty, a young marine coming home after World War II, started a fabrication shop in the small community of Valley in Nebraska. \u2047 Our business has certainly evolved over the past 75 years, but over this time we have remained centered on serving our customers and delivering value through our focus on execution, and our commitment to conserving resources and improving lives. \u2047 As we reflect on our history, we're very proud of the impact we've had on the lives of employees, customers, suppliers, business partners, communities and all those we have touched. \u2047 As we look forward, we are energized by the opportunity to continue expanding this impact long into the future. \u2047 We are also excited to host our Virtual Investor Day coming up in May, where we will share more about our strategic vision for the company, and have several of our business leaders provide greater insight into their businesses and markets. \u2047 Our disciplined and deliberate strategy to be the price leader in all our markets, enabled by our strong product portfolio has served us well in this unprecedented inflationary environment. \u2047 I also want to recognize our operations teams who have been working hard since the onset of the pandemic, and redoubled their efforts this past quarter to secure our supply chain. \u2047 Through these diligent and focused efforts, we were able to avoid material disruptions in our operations, and deliver solid operating income growth for the company. \u2047 Net sales of $774.9 million, increased $100.7 million or 14.9% compared to last year, due to significantly higher sales in the Irrigation and Utility Support Structure segments. \u2047 Sales of $253.1 million grew $27.7 million or 12.3% compared to last year. \u2047 Strong demand for renewable energy generation and utilities increasing investments in grid hardening and resiliency continue to drive sales growth. \u2047 Moving to Engineered Support Structures. \u2047 Sales of $222.3 million decreased $8.4 million or 3.6% compared to last year. \u2047 Favorable pricing, growth in wireless communication sales, and favorable currency impacts were more than offset by anticipated lower transportation market volumes, as delays in the FAST Act approval during 2020, and the impacts from COVID-19 continued to affect the timing of road and construction projects. \u2047 Wireless communication structures and components sales grew 20.6% compared to last year. \u2047 Strong demand was led by carriers increasing their capital spending in support of 5G build-outs, as evidenced by significantly higher sales of our new small cell product offering and existing component sales. \u2047 Favorable pricing in all regions also contributed to sales growth. \u2047 Sales of $93.3 million, grew $5.1 million or 5.9% compared to last year, and improved sequentially from last quarter, primarily from more favorable pricing and improving end market demand. \u2047 In Irrigation, sales of $229.7 million, grew $72.9 million or 46.5% compared to last year, with growth across most global regions, including 34% growth in our technology sales this quarter. \u2047 In North America sales grew 15% year-over-year. \u2047 Farmer sentiment has improved significantly, and the positive market drivers we mentioned last quarter are generating strong order flow. \u2047 Agricultural commodity prices remain at multi-year highs, and net farm income levels are expected to remain elevated. \u2047 Overall, world market demand for ethanol and very low feed and protein stocks in the U.S. and China are driving significantly higher demand for grain exports. \u2047 International sales growth more than doubled compared to last year, and was led by higher sales in the Middle East, European markets and in Brazil, where we recognized another record quarter of sales in local currency. \u2047 Deliveries of the multi-year project in Egypt continued during the quarter, and the project is tracking well. \u2047 Sales in this segment were slightly below the range that we guided to last quarter, mainly due to a series of supply constraints of certain irrigation components. \u2047 The strength of our global supply chain, and the agility of our global footprint helped mitigate the impact and others across our businesses. \u2047 And these constraints have improved as we've entered the second quarter. \u2047 This is just timing and we expect these sales to be recognized in the second quarter. \u2047 Scalability is one of the benefits of our portfolio, enabling us to purchase mill direct steel and minimizing disruption in the procurement of steel, zinc and other metals to meet customer order commitments. \u2047 Turning to Slide 5. \u2047 Last month, President Biden revealed the American Jobs Plan, valued at more than $2 trillion. \u2047 This multi-year stimulus package includes approximately $620 billion to modernize roads, bridges and highways. \u2047 A $100 billion allocated to electrical grid investments and $100 billion focused on high-speed broadband investments. \u2047 We recognize that additional details and approvals must be worked through, so the timing of these benefits are uncertain. \u2047 However, we believe the administration's increased emphasis on upgrading aging infrastructure on our nation's roads and highways, reducing traffic congestion and carbon emissions, hardening the electrical grid, and increasing access to wireless connectivity across the country, will provide longer-term funding, stability that will have a positive impact on our infrastructure businesses. \u2047 Moving to Slide 6. \u2047 Last month, we released our Annual Sustainability Report, highlighting the contributions of our products and services to conserve resources, improve life and build a more sustainable world. \u2047 I'm proud to have also announced our 2025 sustainability goals for carbon intensity, global electricity and global combustion fuel, along with setting water standards across the enterprise within this report. \u2047 Later today, as a part of our Earth Day activities, we will commemorate the installation of our 1-megawatt solar field at our Valley, Nebraska campus. \u2047 We are proud to be operating the largest, privately owned, behind-the-grid solar field in the State of Nebraska. \u2047 Covering more than four acres, it will provide our campus with 6% of its electricity needs. \u2047 I want to congratulate our team and our business partners who work diligently on this project. \u2047 Strengthening our commitment to innovation with sustainability in mind. \u2047 We look forward to providing more updates on our ESG initiatives at our Virtual Investor Day and throughout the year. \u2047 Turning to slide eight and first quarter results, operating income of $77.2 million or 10% of sales was similar in quality of earnings to last year, driven by higher volumes in irrigation in utility, favorable pricing, which helped offset the impact of rapid raw material cost inflation and improved operational efficiencies. \u2047 First quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.57, grew 29.1% compared to last year, driven by higher operating income and a more favorable tax rate of 21.9%, which was primarily due to a one-time incremental tax benefit associated with employee stock option exercises. \u2047 Turning to the segments. \u2047 On Slide 9, in Utility Support Structures, operating income of $21.7 million, or 8.6% of sales, decreased 380 basis points compared to last year. \u2047 Strong volumes and improved operational performance were more than offset by the impact of rapidly rising raw material costs, which could not yet be recovered through pricing. \u2047 Moving to Slide 10. \u2047 In Engineered Support Structures, operating income of $19.9 million, or 9% of sales, increased 210 basis points over last year. \u2047 Overall, we were very pleased with the results from the actions we took to improve performance through proactive pricing strategies and reduce SG&A expense to offset inflation and the lower volume. \u2047 Turning to Slide 11. \u2047 In the Coatings segment, operating income of $12.9 million, or 13.8% of sales, was 130 basis points higher compared to last year. \u2047 Favorable pricing offset lower external volumes due to COVID impacts and end markets and a one-time natural gas expense of approximately $800,000 related to the February winter weather event in Texas. \u2047 Moving to Slide 12. \u2047 In the Irrigation segment, operating income of $38.7 million or 16.9% of sales, was 180 basis points higher compared to last year. \u2047 Strong volumes and improved operational efficiency were partially offset by higher R&D expense for strategic technology growth investments. \u2047 Turning to cash flow on Slide 13. \u2047 We are focused on inventory optimization and overall improvement of a cash conversion cycle across our businesses. \u2047 These efforts helped us deliver operating cash flow of $33.2 million and positive free cash flow this quarter, despite extraordinary inflationary pressures. \u2047 Inventory levels are expected to remain elevated this year due to higher steel costs. \u2047 Turning to Slide 14, for a summary of capital deployment. \u2047 Capital spending in first quarter was approximately $28 million and we returned $21 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $391.5 million of cash. \u2047 We continued to have an active acquisition pipeline and are prioritizing strategic investments in technology, especially in irrigation, higher-growth products and markets, and business solution that align with ESG principles while meeting our return on invested capital goals. \u2047 Moving now to Slide 15. \u2047 Our balance sheet remains strong with no significant long-term debt maturities until 2044. \u2047 Our leverage ratio of total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 2.1 times remains within our desired range of 1.5 to 2.5 times and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is at 1 times. \u2047 For the second quarter, we estimate net sales to be between $805 million and $830 million, and operating income margins between 9.5% to 10.5% of net sales. \u2047 The tax rate for second quarter is expected to be between 23% and 24% due to the execution of certain U.S. tax strategies. \u2047 We are also reaffirming our outlook for the full year. \u2047 Net sales are estimated to grow 9% to 14% year-over-year, which assumes a foreign currency translation benefit of 2% of net sales. \u2047 Earnings per share is estimated to be between $9 and $9.70, excluding any restructuring activities. \u2047 As mentioned last quarter with unprecedented raw material cost increases and higher freight costs, we continue to take quick and deliberate steps to implement pricing actions across all our segments, including multiple increases since the beginning of 2021, and are maintaining these strategies across our served markets. \u2047 We are already seeing the benefit in most of our businesses with an improvement in Utility Support Structure expected in the second half of the year. \u2047 Turning to our segment outlook on Slide 17. \u2047 In Utility Support Structures, our record global backlog is providing good visibility for 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Although steel costs remain at elevated levels, we believe the biggest challenges are behind us. \u2047 We expect the quality of earnings to improve beginning in the second quarter. \u2047 Contractual increases in selling prices will begin offsetting steel cost inflation and we expect a meaningful improvement in gross profit margin to accelerate in the second half of the year as higher steel cost indices are reflected in selling prices. \u2047 Moving to Engineered Support Structures. \u2047 We continue to expect some short-term softness in transportation markets as projects have been delayed due to the delays in 2020 FAST Act. \u2047 extension approvals and continued COVID-19 impacts, especially in France and India. \u2047 Demand for wireless communication structures and components remains strong. \u2047 We believe sales will grow 15% to 20% in 2021, in line with market expectations, as carriers investment in 5G are expected to accelerate throughout this year. \u2047 Moving to Coatings, end-market demand tends to correlate closely to industrial production levels. \u2047 We expect to see modest sequential growth as the economy continues to improve and benefit from government stimulus initiatives in certain international markets, including Australia. \u2047 Moving to irrigation, we expect favorable comparisons based on the estimated timing of deliveries of the large Egypt project, strong net farm income driving positive farmer sentiment, and a robust Brazilian market. \u2047 We expect another quarter of positive free cash flow, driven by our emphasis and improving the cash conversion cycle and strategic inventory management. \u2047 Raw material inflation can create short-term impacts on cash flows, and as previously mentioned, we have enacted strategies to manage these impacts, including certain raw material financial hedges to cover backlogs. \u2047 Moving to Slide 18. \u2047 We are off to a great start in 2021 across all end markets. \u2047 As evidenced by our record $1.3 billion backlogs at the end of the first quarter. \u2047 In Utility, our record backlog -- global backlog of nearly $720 million demonstrates the ongoing demand and necessity for renewable energy solutions, grid hardening and expanding ESG focus within the utility industry. \u2047 We are very pleased to announce that in the first quarter, we were awarded the third and fourth purchase orders, totaling $220 million for the large project in the Southeast U.S., extending our backlog through the beginning of 2023 with that project and reconfirming our customers' confidence in our performance. \u2047 We continue to strengthen key alliances with utility customers, and with our broad portfolio of products and manufacturing capabilities, we are well positioned to be the preferred strategic partner with utilities and developers, for their renewable energy and grid hardening goals. \u2047 In Engineered Support Structures, we expect a solid year with some short-term softness in transportation, but the longer-term market trends, especially for road construction and single-family housing support future growth. \u2047 Further, the critical need for infrastructure investment globally gives us confidence that these trends will remain strong. \u2047 We expect demand for wireless communication structures and components to accelerate throughout 2021. \u2047 Bringing reliable, high-speed broadband connectivity to people around the world is vital to elevating standards of living, safety and opportunity. \u2047 Our broad portfolio of towers and components positions us well to support world broadband connectivity initiatives, working with groups such as the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association and the American Connection Broadband Project Coalition to help bridge the the digital divide. \u2047 We're encouraged that both current and proposed legislation has allocated funding to support these efforts. \u2047 Our Coatings business closely follows industrial production trends, and general economic activity. \u2047 The drivers remain solid and the preservation of critical infrastructure and extending the life of steel fits well within our ESG principles. \u2047 And in irrigation, recent improvements in net farm income have improved grower sentiment, and tighter ending feed and protein stocks are keeping grain prices at sustained"], "gold_summary":
