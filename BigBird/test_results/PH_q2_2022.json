{"article": ["As Jonathan said, this is Todd Leombruno, chief financial officer speaking. \u2047 I'd like to direct you to Slide No. \u2047 Reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures are included in today's materials. \u2047 As usual, today, Tom is going to begin with highlights of the quarter and a few comments on the company's transformation. \u2047 Two comments before we begin today. \u2047 First, as a reminder, regarding the pending Meggitt acquisition, we are still bound by the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code in respect to discussing certain transaction details. \u2047 And secondly, we are announcing a date and time change to our upcoming virtual investor day due to a scheduling conflict with another company's investor day. \u2047 Our meeting will now be held on Tuesday, March 8 from 9 am to 12 pm Eastern. \u2047 It will be a virtual event. \u2047 And among the topics that we'll cover will be the release of our new long-term financial targets. \u2047 I want to start with the title of this slide, which is exceptional execution in a challenging environment. \u2047 When you look at the performance of the company in aggregate, safety, sales growth, the margin expansion, EPS, it was an extremely strong quarter. \u2047 This is against arguably one of the most difficult operating environments that we've all faced in our careers when you add up the cumulative effect of inflation, supply chain challenges and the Omicron virus. \u2047 Let's start with the first bullet. \u2047 Focus on safety continues. \u2047 It is our No. \u2047 We're leveraging our high-performance teams, the combination of the natural work teams that we have in our plants and warehouses as well as the Star Point teams and Kaizen. \u2047 And it's really this combination, this team structure plus Kaizen, that is driving an ownership culture within the company. \u2047 So ownership of safety, but also ownership of quality, cost, delivery and engagement. \u2047 Sales growth was 12% year over year. \u2047 Organic growth was 13%. \u2047 It was nice across all the external reporting segments as well as every region participating. \u2047 Total sales was a second quarter record as well as total segment operating margin. \u2047 EBITDA margin was 18.2% as reported or 22.7% adjusted. \u2047 It was 180 basis points. \u2047 It's a big move versus prior year. \u2047 Robust demand environment continues. \u2047 We had over 90% of our end markets in the growth phase, which we're very excited about. \u2047 And this execution, what you're seeing, is really the cumulative effect of win strategy 2.0 and 3.0 driving this kind of performance. \u2047 When you add the strategy changes on top of the portfolio, things we've done, adding those great acquisitions that we've done over the last number of years and the powerful secular trends that I'm going to talk about here momentarily, we see the future has much longer cycle and more resilient and faster growing. \u2047 So if you go to the next slide, Slide 4, I've touched on this before. \u2047 This kind of frames all of our thinking and our strategies for the company to around trying to achieve these three key drivers. \u2047 Living up to our purpose, that higher calling, that North Star that we're driving for, to be great generators and deployers of cash, to be a top quartile performer versus our proxy peers. \u2047 If you go to Slide 5, which is the little expression that a picture is worth a thousand words, this kind of sums up how the company has changed over the last number of years. \u2047 We've updated this slide for FY '22 numbers. \u2047 And I'm going to just reframe this slide for you. \u2047 On the left-hand side is adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and on the right-hand side is adjusted EBITDA margin. \u2047 So if you look on the left and you go to FY '16, so we worked real hard as a company for 100 years to get to $6.99 EPS. \u2047 And then the last six years, we've grown it by 2.5x to a little over $18 in our current guide. \u2047 If you just look at the gain that we've had since the pandemic, FY '20 to FY '22 guide, it's almost another $6 just in those two years. \u2047 It happens to be and I don't think it's coincidental, that we launched win strategy 3.0 at the beginning of FY '20. \u2047 And you can see what it's done to propel performance. \u2047 If you look on the right-hand side and we don't guide on EBITDA margin, but we put in our EBITDA margin year to date to 22.4%. \u2047 If you look at that from FY '16 to that, it's 770 basis points improvement, just remarkable improvement. \u2047 Really the how behind these results, it's been our people, portfolio changes that we've done and has been, again, a cumulative effect of win strategy 2.0, 3.0. \u2047 So if you go to the next slide, give you a quick update on the Meggitt transaction. \u2047 We continue to make progress. \u2047 There's really four main work streams that we're working. \u2047 There's two, the economic and national security review that we're working on with the U.K. government. \u2047 I would characterize those as constructive and positive and on track. \u2047 And then the antitrust and FDI filings are proceeding as we had anticipated. \u2047 We're still anticipating a Q3 calendar 2022 close and we're really excited about this. \u2047 This is obviously a compelling combination. \u2047 It doubles the size of our aerospace business, highly complementary technologies. \u2047 And we're at the beginning of a commercial aerospace recovery with great synergies as we put these two companies together. \u2047 Again, coming -- bringing this on with everything else we've been doing, a much longer cycle, less cyclical, faster growing company. \u2047 And then on Slide 7, in addition to the strategic acquisitions that we've been making, we are uniquely positioned with our eight motion and control technologies to benefit from the four secular trends that you see on this page. \u2047 Now I touched on aerospace and the recovery and momentum of Meggitt plus Parker. \u2047 But if you look at electrification, ESG, digitization, what you have here are long-term multiyear growth enablers and content growth for us is going to grow, both onboard as well as infrastructure. \u2047 And we're excited that this is going to be a big part of what we'll talk about at investor day and we look forward to sharing more about these secular trends on March 8 with you. \u2047 I'll ask everyone to move to Slide 9 and I'll start with our FY '22 Q2 results. \u2047 As Tom mentioned, this was just an outstanding quarter. \u2047 Just another reminder that our operations leaders are really driving the company to significantly higher levels of performance. \u2047 Our sales increased 12% versus the prior year. \u2047 We did hit a record level of $3.8 billion. \u2047 Tom mentioned this, but organic sales were very healthy at 13%. \u2047 Currency was about a one point drag on sales. \u2047 That's how we got to the 12% reported sales increase. \u2047 Demand just remains robust. \u2047 Our backlogs are healthy. \u2047 Growth remains very broad-based across all of our industrial businesses. \u2047 If you look into the aerospace business, commercial demand continues to trend positive. \u2047 And we talked about this before, but the acquisitions of CLARCOR, LORD and Exotic continue to outperform our expectations. \u2047 When you look at the segment operating margins, it's a Q2 record on an adjusted basis. \u2047 We did 21.6% segment operating margin. \u2047 That's 120 basis points improvement from prior year. \u2047 And our teams are really managing through the well documented supply chain issues, the inflationary environment. \u2047 I really just want to commend them on our team's swift actions to manage these costs and inflationary actions, still while achieving record sales in the quarter. \u2047 Tom mentioned this, but adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.7%. \u2047 That's up 180 basis points from last year. \u2047 Both our adjusted net income and our adjusted earnings per share has improved by 29% versus prior year. \u2047 Net income is $582 million or 15.2% return on sales. \u2047 And adjusted earnings per share was $4.46. \u2047 That's $1.01 increase versus the prior year of $3.45, just a really solid quarter. \u2047 If we jump to Slide 10. \u2047 This is just a bridge on adjusted earnings per share and I'll just detail some of the components that generated the $1.01 increase in EPS. \u2047 And as you can see really, operating execution is the major driver in this increase. \u2047 Adjusted segment operating income did increase by $132 million. \u2047 That's 19% greater than prior year. \u2047 And that really accounts for 80% of the increase in our earnings per share this quarter. \u2047 We did have some other favorable items that was $0.19 favorable. \u2047 There were some currency gains that were favorable. \u2047 We did sell a few facilities that we restructured. \u2047 Those closed in the quarter. \u2047 And we do have reduced pension expense versus prior year. \u2047 All of that added up to $0.19. \u2047 And then you could see the other items on the slide that all netted to $0.04 favorable. \u2047 But really, the story here is just a very strong operating quarter. \u2047 If we go to Slide 11, I'll make a few comments on our segment performance. \u2047 Tom mentioned those secular trends. \u2047 We are seeing growth from those trends across our segments. \u2047 Every single one of the segments has a record adjusted segment operating margin this quarter. \u2047 We did maintain a cost-price neutral position. \u2047 We're very proud of that. \u2047 Incrementals were 32% versus prior year. \u2047 And I just want to remind everybody, that is against a headwind of $65 million of discretionary savings that we had in the prior year. \u2047 If you exclude those discretionary savings, our incrementals were 48%. \u2047 So really fantastic performance across the board from our teams. \u2047 It really highlights the power of the win strategy and really demonstrates our ability to perform through this current climate. \u2047 If you look at orders, orders are plus 12 and really the demand continues to be robust across our businesses. \u2047 Just a little color on Diversified Industrial North America, sales reached $1.8 billion. \u2047 Organic growth in that segment was 15% versus prior year. \u2047 And listen, we're really pleased with the performance in this region. \u2047 We've talked a lot -- I've read -- I know everyone is familiar with the well documented supply chain issues. \u2047 Tom mentioned the Omicron spike. \u2047 We are not immune to that. \u2047 But we did keep operating margins at a very high level of 21.3% in this segment and we're proud of that. \u2047 Order rates continued to be very high at plus 17. \u2047 Our backlog is strong. \u2047 And Tom mentioned this, 91% of our markets are in growth mode. \u2047 So great things in the North American businesses. \u2047 Industrial international is a great story. \u2047 Sales are $1.4 billion. \u2047 Organic growth is up 14% in this segment. \u2047 And I want to note that across all the regions within our International segment, organic growth was mid-teen positive in every region. \u2047 So really robust activity there. \u2047 Maybe more impressive is the adjusted operating margins, 22.4%. \u2047 This is an increase of 210 basis points versus the prior year. \u2047 And certainly, we have volume. \u2047 We've talked a lot about our growth in distribution internationally. \u2047 We are benefiting from some product mix. \u2047 And really, the team is doing a great job controlling cost. \u2047 And this has been a really long-term effort over a long period of time from that team. \u2047 So I'm really happy that they're able to put up these continued high level of margin performance. \u2047 Order rates there were plus 14%, ample backlog and really solid international performance. \u2047 If we look at aerospace systems, really continued signs of a rebound there. \u2047 Sale were $618 million. \u2047 Organic sales are positive at almost 6%. \u2047 And we did see very strong demand in our commercial OEM and MRO markets. \u2047 Great margin performance here as well. \u2047 Operating margins have increased 270 basis points that finished the quarter at 20.7%. \u2047 And again, I just want to remind everyone that, that is still at pre-COVID volume levels. \u2047 So great margin performance from our aerospace team. \u2047 Aerospace orders on a 12-month rolling rate did decline 7%. \u2047 But one item I want to make clear for everybody is we did have a few large multiyear military orders in the prior period that really created a tough comp just in aerospace. \u2047 If we exclude those orders, aerospace orders would be plus mid-teens positive. \u2047 So we're seeing continued signs of steady improvement in aerospace. \u2047 Our order dollars in aerospace in the quarter were at the highest level they've been in the last three quarters. \u2047 So great quarter out of aerospace. \u2047 But if you really look at the segments, it's really outstanding operating performance. \u2047 We've got positive growth, strong order dollars, robust backlogs, record margins and really just solid execution across the board. \u2047 So great segment performance. \u2047 If I take you to Slide 12 and talk about cash flow on a year-to-date basis, we did exceed $1 billion in cash flow from operations. \u2047 That is 13.3% of sales. \u2047 Free cash flow is $900 million or almost 12% of sales. \u2047 And conversion on a year-to-date basis is now 107%. \u2047 We still continue to diligently manage working capital across the company. \u2047 We really are just responding to these increased demand levels that we have. \u2047 The working capital change did improve in the quarter as we forecasted. \u2047 In the quarter, it was a 1.9% use of cash. \u2047 Versus last year, it was a 4.1% source of cash. \u2047 So for the full year, I just want to reiterate, we continue to forecast mid-teens cash flow from operations and free cash flow for the full year will exceed 100%. \u2047 If we go to Slide 13 now, I just want to make a few comments on our capital deployment activity. \u2047 I'm sure many people have seen this, but last week, our board approved a dividend declaration of $1.03 per share. \u2047 That is fully supportive of our long-standing 65-year record of increasing dividends paid. \u2047 And I want to give an update on the Meggitt financing. \u2047 We continue to make progress on our financing plan. \u2047 Our plan is"], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted earnings per share $4.46.  \u2047  q2 sales rose 12 percent to $3.82 billion.  \u2047  qtrly orders increased 12% for total parker.  \u2047  fy22 guidance assumes organic sales growth of approximately 10% to 12% compared with prior year.  \u2047  for remainder of this fiscal year, we expect positive demand trends to continue."], "pred_summary":
