{"article": ["Our featured speakers today are Mark Parrell, our President and CEO; Michael Manelis, our Chief Operating Officer and Bob Garechana, our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Your commitment and hard work got the company through 2020, and I know you are ready to drive our recovery in 2021. \u2047 Turning to the business, we are encouraged by the recovery in demand in all of our markets, and especially in our urban sub-markets. \u2047 In real estate demand is the unsolvable problem, without it no other economic factor matters, and in our business both urban and suburban, we see plenty of it. \u2047 This positive trend in spite of a worsening pandemic, and renewed shutdowns in our markets gives us even more of a cause for optimism. \u2047 If demand is this strong now, we think that when the vaccines are more fully distributed, and cities reopen our business will really hum. \u2047 The fact that this is likely to coincide with our traditional leasing season with its higher seasonal demand, positions us especially well. \u2047 Admittedly though, pricing remains weak, but there are signs of the beginnings of improvement. \u2047 We also see declining forward concessions. \u2047 With occupancy firming and strong demand going into our busiest time of the year, we believe that we can recover considerable ground on the pricing side as 2021 plays out. \u2047 While we see signs of recovery, our current results reflect the still challenging climate in many of our markets. \u2047 You may remember that on prior calls, I made clear that the impact of lower rents and higher concessions in 2020, and currently will take some time to fully manifest itself in our reported numbers. \u2047 That impact arrived in the form of our fourth quarter 2020 same store revenue results, as we continue entering into new leases, and renewing existing leases at lower rents, reflecting the post-pandemic leasing climate, as well as amortizing concessions from leases written in 2020. \u2047 But just as our reported results lagged our actual operating environment on the way down, they will also lag it on the way up. \u2047 So you should expect relatively weak same store revenue results in the first half of 2021, with a marked improvement in our revenue numbers in the second half of the year, as we benefit from improving pricing, higher occupancy, and lower concessions, plus easier post-pandemic comparable periods. \u2047 The interplay of our expectations of increasing occupancy, pricing that is improving, but will be lower than last year's pricing until mid-year or so and the amortization of 2020 and '21 concessions, creates considerable modeling complexity for us, and for our investors and analysts. \u2047 Because of this more complex picture than usual, we thought it was particularly important that we reinstate guidance to give investors a better idea of management's view of the year. \u2047 Our guidance is at the wider than usual range to account for the multitude of factors, both positive and negative, that may impact our business in 2021. \u2047 All of this is of course premised on the continuing progress in controlling the virus, and an assumption that other general economic conditions remain supportive. \u2047 Turning to the long term, we believe that the fundamental factors that have long made Equity Residential an attractive place to invest your capital remain just as true now as before the pandemic. \u2047 First, our capital is invested in markets that will continue to be the centers of the knowledge economy, that drives the growth of this country, centers of Innovation and Technology, Finance, Entertainment, Medicine and Life Sciences. \u2047 Even in the pandemic, we have seen announcements of new high quality jobs in our urban centers like Amazon's announcement that it's putting 3,000 new technology and software development jobs in the Seaport District of Boston, and with the recent commencement of construction on Disney's new building in Hudson Square in New York, that will lead to a significant influx of new content creation and technology jobs. \u2047 And while the remote work trend may change the number of days that we are in the office we are by our nature social animals. \u2047 Our need to interact with each other, to create, to share ideas, to manage our businesses and to start new ones is not being met by meetings on a video screen. \u2047 Second, we believe that the entertainment, cultural, and social attractions that fill the great urban centers in which we operate, will soon reopen, and will again prove to be magnets for affluent renters. \u2047 We believe that many renters desire both the work proximity I just mentioned, as well as easy access to the amazing entertainment, cultural and social opportunities our cities will provide once they are reopened, not to mention the ability to live in an exciting, dynamic, and diverse community. \u2047 Our residents that live in our more urban properties do so because they value the lifestyle of our country's great urban centers. \u2047 Third, we have a highly skilled, affluent customer base able to afford our rent and to accept future rent increases as conditions improve. \u2047 Our residents are well-employed in growing industries like technology, biotech and new media. \u2047 Industries that we also think are less susceptible over time the job loss, from increasing waves of automation, and offshoring. \u2047 In the pandemic period overall unemployment rose to almost 15% and is now around 6%, while job losses for those with the Bachelor's degree or better, which is our target demographic peaked at 8.4% and is now gone down to 3.8%. \u2047 Our resident base proved its quality again in the fourth quarter, as we collected 97% of our expected residential revenues. \u2047 We think the quality of our customer base is over the long haul one of our greatest strengths. \u2047 Fourth, the superior location and quality of our portfolio makes our properties attractive places for our residents to live, and also makes our properties attractive places for private investors to invest their capital. \u2047 This makes our properties liquid, and appreciating over the long-term. \u2047 Capital has long been drawn to the higher quality properties we own, and that will continue to be the case, even in markets like New York and San Francisco, once the pandemic abates. \u2047 We also believe that the lower long-term capital spending required to maintain our properties and income stream compares favorably with that of older lower quality apartment buildings. \u2047 But our portfolio can always be improved and you should expect us to be more active recyclers of capital over the next few years. \u2047 As I have said on prior calls, even before the pandemic, in order to create the most stable and growing cash flow stream possible for our investors, we are inclined to further diversify our portfolio in the higher-end suburban locations in our current markets, as well as into a few select new markets with favorable long-term supply and demand characteristics, and a growing affluent renter base. \u2047 These affluent renters are found in abundance in our existing markets, but there are also increasing concentrations of them in denser suburbs near city centers of our existing markets, and in places like Denver, which is a market we reentered in 2016. \u2047 You've seen us do this over the last few years, as we have acquired properties in suburban Seattle in Washington, D.C. with strong resident demographics. \u2047 We are looking hard at several other suburban assets, as well as development and acquisition opportunities in Denver, that we find appealing long term. \u2047 We will fund this by lowering our concentration of assets in city centers in our existing markets, and by exiting assets elsewhere that do not meet our return parameters. \u2047 To close, we have the best team in the business, ready to maximize results as the pandemic ends, and a sturdy balance sheet that gives us ample flexibility. \u2047 We are tremendously optimistic about our company's future, because we believe that the markets in which we operate will thrive when we get to the other side of this pandemic, and with the rollout of vaccines we are on our way. \u2047 So 2020 has been the most challenging year that we have faced in our business. \u2047 Working together we got through 2020 by serving our customers, taking care of each other, and driving the best results possible given the circumstances. \u2047 Despite the challenges we are excited that 2020 is behind us and optimistic that 2021 will be a year of recovery. \u2047 As Mark mentioned, we have begun to see improvement in both Physical Occupancy and pricing. \u2047 Notably, this is the first time this has occurred since the beginning of the pandemic. \u2047 We continue to test price sensitivity in many markets by reducing both the value and quantity of concessions being granted, and beginning to raise rates. \u2047 In November, concessions averaged just over six weeks free on about 45% of our applications and recent weeks concessions have averaged just under six weeks and only about a third of our applications. \u2047 All that said, it will take some time to fully recover from the unprecedented events that have occurred, particularly in our hardest hit markets. \u2047 While we are optimistic about the recovery, it is hard to handicap its pace, especially in New York and San Francisco, our hardest hit cities. \u2047 Demand continues to be robust and has carried us through much of the winter season with increased move-in activity, well above seasonal norms. \u2047 Application count exceeded 2019 levels by 25% in the fourth quarter and we were able to generate sufficient front door activity that have move-in, outpace move-out despite higher turnover compared to the 2019 record low level. \u2047 We haven't seen this net gain and move-ins since the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 Applications have remained robust in January albeit below December's levels but that isn't surprising since improved occupancy has allowed us to start testing pricing and we have fewer units available to sell. \u2047 The chart on pricing trend, which includes the impact on concessions is a good indicator of where rents are headed and it has been improving across both the urban and suburban markets for the last eight weeks or so. \u2047 Blended rates, which combines new lease changes and renewal rates achieved, will continue to be negative for some time as this metric compares new leases written or renewed with those that were before the pandemic began. \u2047 That said, the rate of change of Blended rates has flattened and for the first time, we have seen modest sequential improvement in new lease rates which is helpful. \u2047 We continue to experience negotiation pressure on renewal rates and we are still renewing residents who signed leases pre-pandemic. \u2047 We have found some stability in the percent of residents renewing, which stands at approximately 52% in January, we expect that to improve to around 54% for February and March, which is still below our usual retention rates for this time of year. \u2047 Before moving to market commentary, I want to summarise that while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to see good demand for our product and we are starting to see early signs of pricing improvement. \u2047 We have a long way to go, but recovery is in sight. \u2047 Now let me provide some brief market commentary. \u2047 Starting with Boston, strong application volume and improved retention through the fourth quarter resulted in steady gains in occupancy to position us to 95.5% today. \u2047 This market has been dialing back concession use and raising rates consecutively for the past four weeks. \u2047 At present concessions are being used on about 25% to 30% of our applications and averaging right at six weeks, which is compared to 50% use back in November. \u2047 Long-term demand drivers remain positive with a very bullish outlook for biotech and pharma space fueling job creation. \u2047 At this point, it is hard to forecast exactly how some of the traditional demand drivers associated with Boston play out, notably students, both domestic and international and the jobs that support that infrastructure. \u2047 We expect to have a better view on these by late spring, early summer before the fall semester. \u2047 Anecdotally, I will tell you that January did see a few applications from foreign addresses, which we haven't seen for several months. \u2047 Boston will have its challenges in '21 but its performance over the last two months has definitely improved. \u2047 In 2021, we look to regain more occupancy, which will allow us to then recapture some of the rate we lost last year. \u2047 New York continues to feel the outsized impact from the pandemic, but there are early signs of recovery. \u2047 We recently had our best traffic week in the last 12 months and our best leasing weeks since August. \u2047 Leasing activity is still driven by deal seekers and interest city movers, which is running about 10 points higher than normal. \u2047 We still see move-outs to the suburbs in New Jersey and Connecticut, but that number is normalizing. \u2047 Occupancy has improved in the market and is just above 91.5%, which is the first time we have been over 90% since September of 2020. \u2047 Some additional color on recent traffic includes that we are just now starting to have former residents reaching out to our property teams contemplating moving back to the city. \u2047 Like in Boston, we are seeing the first signs of international students and specific to New York, UN workers looking to come back. \u2047 And finally, we saw a few roommate type prospects emerging from their parents basements. \u2047 Many of these prospects are looking for late spring or early summer time frames in anticipation of their offices opening back up. \u2047 We still see a good amount o f deal hoppers and upgraders as well as prospects from the outer boroughs who can now afford to live in Manhattan and many of them are telling our on-site teams they think the market bottom is near and they don't want to miss out. \u2047 Concessions remain prevalent in this market was 70% of the applications receiving about two months free. \u2047 Rates are beginning to show signs of improvement and we are just starting to gradually dial back concessions. \u2047 For 2021, our focus in New York will be recapturing as much of the occupancy rate as possible while lowering and possibly eliminating the use of concessions. \u2047 While the market will still produce a negative decline for the year, New York has upside potential given the dramatic declines we saw in 2020. \u2047 Recovery in this market will be fueled by a lack of competitive new supply, the return to office and the continued growth of the big tech employers in the market. \u2047 Moving to D.C. which has been our most resilient market on the East Coast, occupancy remained solid at 95.5%, but the market continues to feel the impact from the delivery of Class A multifamily product, which is not being absorbed as efficiently in previous years. \u2047 Federal government employment has grown, but the overall job growth has declined. \u2047 Concession use was up in the quarter with the largest amount focused in the district. \u2047 The good news, however, is that as fast as concessions came into the market during the fourth quarter, they have now been greatly reduced. \u2047 Since mid-December we are only using concessions on 15% of the applications and they've been averaging just below one month. \u2047 2021 will be focused on balancing occupancy and rate as we faced supply pressure from yet another 12,000 units being delivered into the market. \u2047 Recent signs of improvement provide us more confidence in the market's"], "gold_summary": ["sees full year 2021 normalized ffo per share of $2.60 to
