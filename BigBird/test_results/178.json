limit their time today to one question and one follow-up. \u2047 I hope that you and your families are staying safe and healthy. \u2047 I will provide an update on our business transformation and I'll share some highlights of our preparation for the pending business environment recovery. \u2047 As we have discussed during prior calls, Sysco has taken swift and decisive action throughout the pandemic to help our customers succeed during a time of disruption. \u2047 We have carefully managed our associate productivity, inventory productivity, and business investments. \u2047 To that end, we initiated a bold business transformation to strategically transform our company for long-term success. \u2047 I am pleased to confirm that our business transformation remains on track and we are confident that the strategic initiatives will enable profitable future growth and will differentiate Sysco from our competitors. \u2047 The COVID environment has placed substantial restrictions upon the customers we serve in the food-away-from-home sector and has disrupted our marketplace. \u2047 In light of those realities, we are pleased with the financial results that we delivered in the first half of fiscal 2021, and for the second quarter, we performed generally in line with our expectations adjusted for the environment. \u2047 While our second quarter financial results were down compared to prior year, we delivered a profitable quarter despite 23% decline in our top line sales and funded investments to enable our transformation. \u2047 Our customers experienced increasingly restrictive conditions on their operations during the second quarter, which were most notable in December when restaurant traffic and sales declined. \u2047 Additionally, our international segment has been hard hit due to tougher restrictions in the countries in which we operate. \u2047 At Sysco, we are not taking the restrictions on customers as a gravity issue. \u2047 We are doing more than ever before to help our customers navigate this challenging environment. \u2047 I am pleased to report that during the second quarter Sysco gained overall market share versus the rest of the industry, reflecting the early progress of our transformation and the success we're having in winning new business, We continue to win meaningful business in the national account space and signed an incremental $200 million of net new business in the quarter, which totals more than $1.5 billion of net new contracted business since the start of the pandemic. \u2047 Additionally, throughout the second quarter, we began making investments in preparation for the business recovery that we believe will begin in calendar year 2021. \u2047 Those investments will increase in the third fiscal quarter and Aaron will speak more to this in a moment. \u2047 Examples of investments during the second quarter include investments in our customers, in our people, in our working capital, and in our technology. \u2047 I'd like to highlight some examples of each of these purposeful choices. \u2047 Investments in our customers, including our new Restaurants Rising campaign, which makes it easier for restaurants to succeed and strengthen their business for the future. \u2047 Most notably, we announced in November that we are eliminating minimum delivery requirements for regularly scheduled delivery days, which provides operators significant flexibility in managing their business and makes it easier to order what they need when they need it. \u2047 In addition, we are not eliminating delivery service days during the second wave of COVID, a practice we know select competition is currently doing. \u2047 We see the light at the end of the tunnel and as such, we are prioritizing customer service. \u2047 A little incremental expense right now is a small price to pay for customer loyalty and partnership. \u2047 Our sales consultants are leveraging the restaurants rising program to retain current customers and help Sysco attract and serve new ones. \u2047 In addition to the no order minimums commitment, Sysco's sales consultants are assisting their customers with setting up touchless menus, optimizing delivery and takeout operations, and helping with marketing programs to create awareness of our customers' operations, just to name a few of our value-added services. \u2047 I'm proud to report that our Net Promoter Score increased by more than 1,000 basis points in the quarter due in large part to the connections with our customers generated by the Restaurants Rising program. \u2047 The NPS increase was our largest quarterly increase in our company's history. \u2047 Importantly, as you can see on page seven in our slides, the incremental closure rate of Sysco's customers is 50% below the industry average. \u2047 And lastly, we onboarded more new local customers in Q2 than in any single quarter in the last five years. \u2047 In addition to investing in our customers, we are making investments in our people. \u2047 We are intentionally retaining drivers despite the volume decline in December to ensure we have them available for our pending volume recovery. \u2047 Drivers are in short supply across the country and while this investment will drive some incremental transportation expense in the short term, over the long term, it will help ensure that Sysco is able to maximize our share gains during the upcoming business recovery. \u2047 As you know, we made changes to our sales organization and sales compensation during the summer. \u2047 Our associate retention has improved compared to historical retention rates and our improved retention will help with sales productivity metrics in the future. \u2047 We are beginning to make investments in working capital to position the right products in the right locations in preparation for the upcoming business recovery. \u2047 Sysco has the broadest inventory assortment in the industry. \u2047 Our ability to ship product on time and in full during the upcoming period of volume recovery is a core element of what makes Sysco the strongest broadline distributor in the industry. \u2047 We have the financial strength and capacity to invest in products and in inventory, while other foodservice distributors may struggle with sufficient cash flow to make similar investments in the coming quarters. \u2047 We are also offering payment plans in partnership with our customers to ensure their continuity. \u2047 Lastly, we are making strategic investments in our technology to improve the customer experience. \u2047 This includes our Sysco Shop technology, our new pricing software and improvements we are making in our supply chain systems. \u2047 Sysco's ability to invest in our customers, our people, our inventory and our technology while delivering a profitable quarter during this pandemic is a testament to the strength of our balance sheet and our leadership team. \u2047 I'd like to turn now to providing an update on our business transformation. \u2047 First, as we have shared previously, we are focused on advancing our customer-facing digital tools to improve the customers' experience with Sysco and drive incremental sales. \u2047 Priority number one is improving our mobile ordering platform Sysco Shop. \u2047 Notably, we are now onboarding new customers in less than 24 hours, a step change improvement. \u2047 The number of customer orders placed through Sysco Shop continues to meaningfully increase throughout the quarter. \u2047 Additionally, our new pricing software is now live in our first test region. \u2047 We are learning a lot through this regional pilot and we remain on track to roll out the pricing system across the country. \u2047 The goal of this effort is to improve pricing transparency with our customers and drive incremental sales in gross profit growth by optimizing prices at the customer item level. \u2047 Additionally, by automating customer level pricing, we will free up time for our valued sales consultants to spend with customers on value-added activities, such as menu design, Sysco brand penetration, and other drivers of sales and margin. \u2047 Second, we are improving our go-to-market selling strategy by transforming our sales process. \u2047 Through our sales transformation, we have an improved more customer-centric organizational structure. \u2047 Our sales transformation is progressing well and the team-based selling approach is gaining traction. \u2047 We have created and built new specialist selling positions. \u2047 We have implemented a sales quarterback position that helps guide the collective sales teams across a given geography. \u2047 As I mentioned on our last call, we have launched our first cuisine segment go-to-market selling strategy and we are seeing initial signs of success with that customer segment through incremental market share gains. \u2047 We will roll out this program to additional cuisine segments in calendar 2021. \u2047 Lastly, Sysco completed the regionalization of our field leadership structure at the start of our second quarter. \u2047 I am pleased to report that our new regional presidents are in place and are finding quick wins to improve our business. \u2047 The average tenure of our market and regional leaders is over 20 years and these experienced and talented leaders are highly capable of driving top performance within Sysco. \u2047 Examples of quick wins include optimizing our inventory assortment across multiple physical sites and optimizing the servicing of key customers by ensuring the most efficient physical location services each customer location. \u2047 To be a great company, you need to have a world-class leadership team. \u2047 I am pleased that during the quarter, we made important progress in strengthening our leadership team. \u2047 Aaron Alt joined Sysco as our Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Aaron is a proven finance leader with over 20 years of experience in foodservice and retail leadership positions. \u2047 He has a track record of transformation and value creation at large organizations in multiple industries. \u2047 Additionally, Tom Peck has joined Sysco as Chief Information and Digital Officer. \u2047 Tom has experience leading enterprise information technology strategy, services, operations risk, and cybersecurity for large global enterprises. \u2047 In his most recent role, he worked great global B2B distributor in the electronics industry, experience that is directly applicable to the transformational journey at Sysco. \u2047 Additionally, Tim Orting has officially started his position leading our International division. \u2047 Tim will be based in our London offices and will be responsible for driving profitable growth and operational excellence across our international geographies. \u2047 With Tim joining Sysco, I was able to reduce the number of my direct reports by four, which allows me to focus more of my time and energy on managing the strategy development and execution of the company. \u2047 Joel Grade has begun his new role leading business development and is actively engaged in identifying new sources of growth for Sysco. \u2047 I am pleased to say that the transition of Sysco's leadership team is now complete. \u2047 We have a strong management team that balances Sysco and foodservice industry expertise with best-in-class experience from other industries. \u2047 Our new leaders join a talented and experienced Sysco leadership team. \u2047 Greg Bertrand, the leader of our U.S. business has over 35 years of industry experience and 30 years specific with Sysco. \u2047 Greg's expertise and steady hand in running our largest business during the COVID disruption has been invaluable. \u2047 I appreciate his leadership and the strong impact he has on our results. \u2047 Great leadership teams work as a team on a common agenda. \u2047 Our transformation strategy has galvanized this leadership team around a common purpose, and I am honored to work with them to set the standard for foodservice distribution for many years to come. \u2047 I report to you today with strong confidence that a pending business recovery sits before us. \u2047 As vaccine administration mixed progress across the globe, the restrictions currently placed upon our customers will begin to ease. \u2047 We can see in our performance data that once those restrictions ease, consumers are ready and willing to eat away from home. \u2047 At Sysco, we are working to maximize our opportunity to recover faster than the industry. \u2047 We have an opportunity to gain market share, given our financial strength and our compelling business transformation. \u2047 We are prepared to do more than any other foodservice distributor in the industry to ensure the success of our customers. \u2047 And our customer success will generate business growth for Sysco. \u2047 Our industry-leading sales force has been inspired by the Restaurants Rising campaign to support our customers at levels higher than any point in our proud history. \u2047 Our warehouse and delivery associates are the best in the business, working hard every day to ensure we ship to our customers what they want when they need it. \u2047 I am proud of their dedication during this challenging operating time. \u2047 At Sysco, our customers are an inspiration to us and we will show them just as much determination and how we serve them. \u2047 I am really excited to be at Sysco. \u2047 Before I joined Sysco, what I could see from the outside was a company with global scale, a strong competitive position and great profitability and liquidity for the industry. \u2047 Now that I'm on the inside, I see all of that in addition to a driven leadership team relentlessly focused on being ready for the business recovery and then driving a customer and capability-led transformation. \u2047 In short, I see many opportunities in front of us to create shareholder value. \u2047 I will start today with second quarter results for the enterprise and our business segments, followed by an update on cash flow. \u2047 Second quarter sales were $11.6 billion, a decrease of 23.1% from the prior year, but flat to the prior quarter. \u2047 Sales had been trending ahead of Q1 through October and November as restrictions eased, but new lockdown restrictions during December reversed the earlier progress, particularly in the International segment. \u2047 There are a couple of additional metrics. \u2047 For the quarter, local case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 19.7% while total case volume within U.S. Broadline operations decreased 23.7%. \u2047 We do know that there is keen interest in the continued impact of COVID. \u2047 The answer varies by region. \u2047 Europe went into lockdown in December and is expected to remain in varying degrees of lockdown for a significant portion of the second half. \u2047 However, since the week after the holidays, we have been seeing signs of life from volume improvements in our U.S. FS business and SYGMA continues to grow. \u2047 This battle will be fought week by week, region by region for the next couple of quarters until the vaccination is widespread and the business recovery takes hold. \u2047 The only commitment we can make is that we will be ready and more competitive than ever. \u2047 As we move down the P&L, gross profit decreased 25.8% to $2.1 billion in the second quarter. \u2047 Most of the decline in gross profit was driven by lower volumes due to COVID. \u2047 However, we did see a modest gross margin dilution at the enterprise level of roughly 67 basis points as our rate came in at 18.2%. \u2047 A couple of thoughts on that. \u2047 First, we typically see a seasonal decline in gross margin sequentially from the first quarter through the second quarter as we did this year. \u2047 Second, our largest segment US Foodservice and its partner segment SYGMA, each had a flat gross margin rate versus the same pre-COVID, quarter which is frankly remarkable given these market dynamics. \u2047 Given the growth of our national accounts business at SYGMA, which is lower margin, we did see business mix shift, which accounted for the vast majority of the margin rate change. \u2047 Our enterprise margin was also impacted by the International and other businesses as both showed gross margin decline in the quarter for reasons which are being addressed. \u2047 Our"], "gold_summary":
