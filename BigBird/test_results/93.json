on the call today by Co-Presidents, Jim Zemlyak and Victor Nesi; as well as our CFO, Jim Marischen. \u2047 I'm going to start the call by running through the highlights of our third quarter, before turning it over to Jim, who will take you through our balance sheet and expenses. \u2047 I'll then come back with my concluding thoughts. \u2047 The COVID pandemic has impacted millions of people worldwide and resulted in ever-changing challenges for both our healthcare system and our economy. \u2047 Despite this backdrop, it's the focus of my partners and associates at Stifel that has enabled us to provide the high-quality financial advice that our clients have come to rely on over the past 20-plus years as we've grown into a premier wealth management and middle market investment bank. \u2047 With that, let's look at our results. \u2047 Simply, we had another great quarter. \u2047 Stifel benefited from strong capital raising and trading activity as well as continued growth in fee-based assets. \u2047 This more than offset the expected pullback in advisory revenue and net interest. \u2047 Noteworthy, we had one of our strongest recruiting quarters in recent history as we've been able to successfully implement a virtual recruiting strategy. \u2047 Our pipeline remains strong and despite the uncertainty of the U.S. economy resulting from the pandemic, Stifel remains well positioned for continued growth. \u2047 I want to highlight the strength of our business for both the quarter and year-to-date. \u2047 We generated record third quarter revenue and our second best quarterly earnings per share. \u2047 For the first nine months of the year, we achieved record revenue and earnings per share. \u2047 Capital raising revenue achieved a quarterly record, trading volumes are up year-over-year and credit quality remains strong at Stifel Bank. \u2047 Additionally, wealth advisor recruiting accelerated, which built on the momentum we achieved during the first six months. \u2047 The financial performance during the quarter and frankly, the past few years is driven by a diverse business mix that's enabled both our Institutional Group and Wealth Management segment to generate strong growth. \u2047 This diversification is illustrated by record nine month wealth management revenue despite significant declines in net interest income and deposit sweep fees, both a result of the Fed's implementation of a 0 rate environment. \u2047 Likewise, we achieved record nine month institutional revenue as record capital raising and brokerage more than compensated for a 13% decline in advisory revenue. \u2047 Simply, Stifel is a growth company with diversified, balanced and synergistic businesses. \u2047 Over the last 12 months, Wealth Management, under both brokerage and fee models has contributed 46% of net revenue. \u2047 Institutional revenues, comprised of equity and fixed income, investment banking and trading, made up 41%, while net interest income comprised the remaining 13%. \u2047 The synergy and complementary nature of these businesses is reflected in our return on tangible common equity, which is 23.2% over the past 12 months. \u2047 For the third quarter, Stifel's net revenues were $883 million, up 8% from the prior year, representing the fourth highest quarterly revenue in our history. \u2047 In fact, for the 12 months ending September 30, 2020, Stifel generated revenue of more than $3.6 billion, up 14% from the 12 months ending September 30, 2019. \u2047 Compensation as a percentage of net revenue came in at 59.6%, while operating expenses totaled 21%. \u2047 I would note that our compensation ratio is higher for both the quarter and year-to-date as compared to the full year 2019, primarily as a result of the decline in NII. \u2047 Relatively modest loan growth and the stabilization of economic factors, coupled with our management overlay, resulted in essentially no provision for loan losses. \u2047 To give a sense of the range of outcomes under our CECL economic models, assuming our base case scenario, we are approximately $40 million over accrued. \u2047 On our most severe scenario, we would be approximately $60 million under accrued. \u2047 Altogether, earnings per share were $1.59, up 6%. \u2047 Pretax margins were 19.4%, annualized return on tangible common equity was 22.2% and tangible book value per share increased 13% over last year to $32.34. \u2047 Moving on to our segment results. \u2047 And starting with our Global Wealth Management group. \u2047 Third quarter wealth management revenue totaled $527 million, up 4% sequentially. \u2047 The third quarter benefited from the expected rebound in asset management and service fees, which increased by 16% sequentially as well as improved brokerage revenue both offsetting an 11% decline in NII. \u2047 Through the first nine months of the year, our wealth management revenue was up 2% to a record of more than $1.6 billion. \u2047 Again, these results were achieved despite the fact that our NII and deposit fee income declined approximately $65 million. \u2047 Excluding this impact, our year-to-date wealth management revenue increased 18%, driven by strong growth in our brokerage and asset management revenues, both of which reflect strong recruiting end markets. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we expect another strong quarter for our asset management revenue due to the 8% sequential increase in fee-based client assets, which totaled $115 billion at September 30. \u2047 I would also note that total client assets reached $326 billion at the end of the quarter and are just $3 billion below the record level set in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 As you can see on the wealth management metrics slide, we had another outstanding recruiting quarter as our virtual recruiting strategies continue to produce significant growth in our advisor headcount. \u2047 To put numbers to this, we recruited 45 financial advisors with total trailing 12-month production of $38 million. \u2047 Our recruiting performance this quarter is a continuation of our successful recruiting efforts since the beginning of 2019, as we've added nearly 250 new advisors who had trailing 12-month production of roughly $200 million. \u2047 This will continue to drive future revenue growth in wealth management as the new advisors transition their clients onto our platform. \u2047 Looking forward, we have a lot of momentum behind our recruiting efforts. \u2047 And while there is some seasonality in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the holidays, our pipeline remains extremely strong, as Stifel remains a very attractive destination for high-quality advisors. \u2047 Moving on to our Institutional Group. \u2047 Through nine months, we generated record net revenue of $1.1 billion, which is up 33% from last year. \u2047 Reflecting our growth in investments, the first nine months of 2020 would represent our third highest annual revenue. \u2047 These results were driven by capital raising and brokerage, both up more than 50% from last year. \u2047 For the third quarter, net revenue totaled $363 million, up 25% from last year. \u2047 Similar to our year-to-date results, capital raising and brokerage increases of approximately 50% drove the increase in the quarter and more than offset the expected softness in advisory revenue. \u2047 Before I go into the details of this segment's performance on the next few slides, I want to take a minute to talk about the general perception of our institutional business. \u2047 I'm sure you remember that on last quarter's call, I commented that this segment is continually underappreciated by analysts. \u2047 In general, institutional businesses tend to be transactional in nature. \u2047 And consequently, there are persistent concerns that strong results in any given quarter are not sustainable. \u2047 While it's true that we're not likely to generate record results every quarter, we believe that performance in this business is better judged by annual results. \u2047 As you can see by the chart on the bottom half of the slide, not only have our results been sustainable, they've grown substantially. \u2047 In fact, if you annualize our results for the first three months of 2020, our institutional revenues have grown at a compound annual rate of nearly 11% since 2009 despite substantial changes in the operating environment. \u2047 This growth is a direct result of the investments we've made into our business that has enabled us to pick up market share and become more relevant to our clients, which will help to drive continued growth in the future. \u2047 With that said, let's move on to our institutional equities and fixed income businesses. \u2047 While this slide depicts brokerage and capital raising for both equities and fixed income, I'll focus on the brokerage business now and address capital raising on the investment banking slide. \u2047 Fixed income brokerage revenue was $97 million, up 60% year-on-year and was our third highest quarterly revenue ever, with the top two quarters occurring in the first half of the year. \u2047 As such, we are having a record year in fixed income brokerage, as the first three quarters are not only up 70% from 2019, but already surpassed our previous full year record in 2016 by 5%. \u2047 The strength of our results continues to be driven by activity in investment-grade, high-yield rates as well as municipals. \u2047 Equity brokerage revenue of $54 million was up 32% year-on-year as activity levels slowed from the record levels in the second quarter as market volatility slowed. \u2047 Like our fixed income businesses, we are also having a record year in our institutional equity brokerage business, as through the first nine months, revenues are up 23% from our previous nine month high recorded in 2014. \u2047 I would also note that I'm pleased with the contributions from our international businesses. \u2047 On the following slide, we look at our firmwide investment banking revenue. \u2047 Revenue of $218 million was relatively flat with the prior quarter and up 10% year-on-year, driven by record revenue and capital raising. \u2047 Overall, the third quarter was our third strongest investment banking quarter. \u2047 Much like my comments about our overall institutional business, our investment banking business has not only been sustainable on an annual basis, but has grown at a compound annual rate of 20% since 2009 and has more than offset industry headwinds in our institutional brokerage business. \u2047 We will continue to invest in this business as we believe that we can continue to take market share and grow as a premier middle market investment bank. \u2047 Looking at our capital raising business in the quarter, we generated record revenues in both our equity and fixed income issuance. \u2047 Equity underwriting revenue of $85 million was up 41% year-on-year and surpassed our prior record by 20% as IPO activity was up significantly from the prior quarter. \u2047 The record results in the quarter underscore the diversity of the business we've built as healthcare and technology were our strongest contributors, while our largest vertical, financials, slowed as clients looked to raise capital in the debt markets. \u2047 Our fixed income underwriting revenue of $53 million was also a record as our public finance business had a strong quarter and the issuance market continued to improve. \u2047 Stifel lead managed 264 negotiated municipal issues and one was again ranked number one nationally in terms of the number of issues managed. \u2047 Through the first nine months, we have lead managed 632 municipal issues, which is up 17% compared to the combined volume of Stifel and George K. Baum for the same period in 2019. \u2047 I would also note that although our corporate debt issuance revenues were down from the prior quarter, we continued to benefit from our bankers' ability to cross-sell services. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, KBW's clients continue to benefit from our expertise in the debt issuance markets. \u2047 This again highlights the benefits of our model. \u2047 For our advisory business, revenue of $81 million decreased by 23% year-on-year as we were negatively impacted by the slowdown in bank M&A following a very strong year in 2019. \u2047 In terms of verticals, the performance of our advisory business was driven by technology, industrials and restructuring. \u2047 The decline in advisory was expected as the market had been impacted by the slowdown in deal announcements earlier this year following the pandemic. \u2047 That said, we continue to see our clients reengage and our pipelines continue to pick up. \u2047 While bank M&A activity continues to lag the robust levels we saw in 2019, we are starting to see some green shoots as we recently advised CIT on their announced sale of First Citizens, which will create a bank with $100 billion in assets. \u2047 Additionally in the fourth quarter, we advised Eastern Bank on the largest ever first step mutual conversion. \u2047 In terms of our overall pipelines, they continue to build, and I'm optimistic for our investment banking business overall. \u2047 I would note that the capital raising business is robust yet highly market dependent. \u2047 Before I discuss net interest income, I'll make a few brief comments regarding our GAAP earnings. \u2047 I would note that as we successfully integrated all of our recent acquisitions, we've seen the continued convergence of our GAAP and non-GAAP results. \u2047 This can be seen in what was our second highest quarterly GAAP earnings per share in our history, which resulted in an ROE of nearly 13%, an ROTCE of more than 20%. \u2047 Similar to last quarter, the strong GAAP earnings and the pause in our share buyback program resulted in fairly meaningful increases in book value and tangible book value that I'll describe in more detail in the following slides. \u2047 And now let's turn to net interest income. \u2047 For the quarter, net interest income totaled $101 million, which was down $14 million sequentially. \u2047 Our results were impacted by the 0% interest rate environment and elevated levels of cash on our balance sheet. \u2047 Our firmwide net interest margin declined to 190 basis points, which was consistent with the bank's net interest margin declining to 237 basis points. \u2047 Firmwide, average interest-earning assets were relatively flat due to a modest increase in our loan portfolio, primarily due to mortgage loan originations and an 80% increase in our cash position as a result of the debt and preferred equity issuances earlier this year as well as the elevated cash position held at the bank. \u2047 Moving on to the next slide, we review the bank's Loan and Investment portfolios. \u2047 We ended the period with total net loans of $10.9 billion, which was flat sequentially. \u2047 The breakdown of our portfolio skewed to a greater percentage of consumer loans through the end of the third quarter. \u2047 Our mortgage portfolio increased by $100 million sequentially as we continue to see demand for residential loans and refinancings from wealth management clients given the decline in interest rates. \u2047 Our securities-based loans increased in the quarter by approximately $120 million. \u2047 Growth in securities-based loans continues to be strong as FA recruiting momentum continues to grow. \u2047 Our commercial portfolio accounts for just less than half of our total loan portfolio and is comprised of C&I loans, which declined by 2% during the quarter. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q3 non-gaap earnings per share $1.59."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts q3 earnings per share $1.59.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $1.59.  \u2047  q3 earnings per share $1.59."]}
