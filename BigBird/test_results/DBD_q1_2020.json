{"article": ["For the benefit of our participants, we have posted slides, which accompany our discussion. \u2047 And these slides are available on the Investor Relations page of dieboldnixdorf.com. \u2047 In the supplemental schedules of our slides, we have reconciled each non-GAAP metric to its most directly comparable GAAP metric. \u2047 Additional information on these factors can be found in the company's SEC filings. \u2047 And now I will pass the microphone to Gerrard. \u2047 We were very pleased with our results this quarter, and Jeff will get into details. \u2047 From our perspective, we are executing in line with our strategy. \u2047 We delivered stronger-than-expected orders, especially in Eurasia Banking and retail. \u2047 While revenue was in line with our pre-COVID expectations, and we continue to deliver strong year-over-year improvements in profitability. \u2047 Starting on Slide 3, I'll describe our near-term priorities. \u2047 From the earlier stages of the crisis in January, our first priority has been on protecting the health and well-being of our employees. \u2047 Our second priority is on our mission to deliver essential services as designated by the U.S. government and many other governments around the world. \u2047 Almost 100% of our banking revenue and around 65% of our retail revenue is generated from customers that are essential businesses. \u2047 I'm extremely pleased that we have consistently delivered strong service levels: banks, grocery stores, pharmacies and fuel and convenience locations, which facilitate critical day-to-day commerce. \u2047 Thirdly, we are committed to strengthening Diebold Nixdorf during this crisis. \u2047 This means leveraging the operational rigor we have forged over the past two years to drive efficiencies in our business. \u2047 It also means we are taking further steps to maintain adequate liquidity and ensure financial flexibility. \u2047 Our response to pandemic is guided by our company values, shown on the right side of the slide, which have been in place and have underpinned our progress over the past two years. \u2047 Our employees are using technology to collaborate on an unprecedented scale to meet customer needs and address business challenges. \u2047 This is taking place despite the social distancing protocols we operate under. \u2047 We're acting with a great sense of urgency and decisiveness as we seek to enhance the way we do business, for the betterment of customers and shareholders. \u2047 And more than ever, our team is stepping up to hold one another accountable. \u2047 On Slide 4, I'd like to add more color to our comprehensive response plans. \u2047 Starting with our customers and solutions. \u2047 We are delivering strong service levels, which reinforce our value proposition, even in the hardest-hit areas of the world. \u2047 In turn, our customers have affirmed our value and the criticality of the ATM and retail checkout channels. \u2047 Two recent customer quotes on this slide, one from a European grocer and the other from a large financial institution in the U.S., up to the essence of our value proposition. \u2047 And we continue to enhance our differentiation by bringing to market our DN Series next-generation banking solutions, self-checkout solutions, dynamic software and our IoT-enabled AllConnect Data Engine. \u2047 Turning to our employees. \u2047 We've gone to great lengths since early January to proactively care for their health and well-being. \u2047 We have equipped our service technicians with the appropriate protective gear and trained them on relevant hygiene and social distancing rules. \u2047 For employees and our manufacturing facilities, we have segmented our workers, intensified our cleaning rituals and are taking temperatures on a daily basis. \u2047 And for our support functions, we have provided the proper tools, resources and guidance for more than 10,000 employees to safely and productively work from home. \u2047 I'm pleased to report that our efforts are making a difference, and we are operating well in all areas of our business with no disruptions despite these circumstances. \u2047 We're also looking out for the financial health of employees as well during this tumultuous time, by establishing an employee crisis reserve fund, which is available for employees who need support, especially in markets with limited government programs. \u2047 In recognition of the tremendous efforts of our frontline service employees during this challenging time, we have provided an extra week of pay. \u2047 Additionally, our company has increased the frequency and depth of its internal communications. \u2047 In return, we're seeing strong employee engagement and resourcefulness during this crisis. \u2047 In addition, I'm pleased to see Diebold Nixdorf actively supporting our communities. \u2047 In Ohio, we've been producing face shields and shipping them to medical facilities in need. \u2047 In Germany, we started manufacturing ventilated carriages. \u2047 Our manufacturing facilities are all online and performing well. \u2047 With respect to our global supply chains, members of our response team have been vigorously engaged since January to avoid major disruptions by maintaining frequent contact with our key suppliers, monitoring safety stocks and developing contingency plans. \u2047 While COVID-19 is likely to remain as a watch item for supply chains over the coming quarters, we are currently pleased with our ability to limit the impact. \u2047 Our comprehensive response is leveraging the operating rigor, which we've created during the past two years. \u2047 We continue to efficiently manage inventory, receivables and payables, as well as indirect spend. \u2047 And we are keenly focused on maintaining adequate liquidity and financial flexibility. \u2047 After an abundance of caution, we drew the remaining amount on our revolving credit facility in March. \u2047 On Slide 5, we provided a framework for thinking about the impact of COVID-19 on Diebold Nixdorf over the medium term. \u2047 Firstly, our business model is resilient. \u2047 Underpinned by many customers, reaffirming that the ATM and self-checkout channels are vital to their business, and that our company plays a critical role in their ability to serve the needs of their customers. \u2047 Starting with our services business, which generated about 51% of total revenue in 2019, we expect a mild impact as the vast majority of our services revenues are recurring. \u2047 It comes from sticky contracts for maintaining critical ATMs and retail devices. \u2047 In the near term, we're likely to see a slowdown for installation service revenue. \u2047 Certain hardware-related projects are pushed out. \u2047 For our products business, which accounted for about 39% of revenue in 2019, we expect to see a moderate impact of certain customers postpone installation dates or defer new hardware purchases. \u2047 In the first quarter, we experienced early signs within our European retail and Eurasia Banking segments, which corresponds to the geographic spread of the virus. \u2047 And while we did not see an acceleration of these trends in April, it is reasonable to expect that product revenue declines will be more pronounced in the second quarter. \u2047 We've taken multiple steps within our manufacturing operations to create a variable cost structure to help us mitigate the impact of lower volume on our profitability. \u2047 Moving to our software business. \u2047 We generate recurring revenue from the sale of licenses and maintenance, which we expect will be very resilient. \u2047 Our project-based business, or professional services, could be affected by customers deferring initiatives, although we have experienced very limited impact to date. \u2047 The vast majority of our customers are continuing this important work. \u2047 Additionally, our software teams have done a great job of supporting customers remotely. \u2047 For these reasons, we expect a mild impact to our software revenue, which accounted for about 11% of total company revenue in 2019. \u2047 From an industry perspective, we expect our banking business, which generated approximately 74% of the company's revenue during 2019, will show greater resiliency in our retail business, due to the higher mix of services and software revenues. \u2047 So while we are confident in the resilience of our business model, we've not been standing still during this time. \u2047 We continue to take further decisive actions to strengthen Diebold Nixdorf. \u2047 On Slide 6, you will see that we continue to execute on our multiyear DN Now cost program. \u2047 We remain encouraged with our achievements, including substantial gains in profit margins during the first quarter. \u2047 We are seeing good progress from our services modernization plans and our G&A cost reduction actions, especially our finance transformation efforts. \u2047 And while COVID-19 pandemic has mildly influenced select work streams, we are continuing to pursue our gross savings target of $130 million for the year. \u2047 Additionally, the company launched incremental actions during the quarter, which cumulatively add up to another $80 million to $100 million of savings. \u2047 We have suspended capital investments on internal major projects, mostly related to the upgrading of systems. \u2047 During the quarter, we also reduced our annual bonus expense by a substantial amount. \u2047 We have deferred merit pay increases and have implemented a hiring freeze. \u2047 In several European markets, we have transitioned certain functions to shorter work weeks. \u2047 We continue to reduce indirect spend. \u2047 And based on our successful transition to remote work environment, we have reassessed our global real estate footprint and are taking decisive actions to further reduce our footprint over the coming months. \u2047 While some of these cost reductions will be temporary, others will generate long-term structural savings for our company. \u2047 Beginning on Slide 7. \u2047 First-quarter revenue of $911 million was in line with our pre COVID 19 expectation and reflects the actions we are taking to drive higher quality revenue. \u2047 In order to make useful comparisons to the prior year, we have provided a table to explain five different factors. \u2047 Our work stream for divesting noncore businesses accounted for approximately $13 million of revenue variance versus the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Next, you can see a $17 million variance from our efforts to reduce our exposure to low-margin business with most of the impact relating to our actions to call our portfolio of lower value services contracts. \u2047 On the borrowing line, you will see a $31 million variance, which includes nonrecurring volume from the prior year period, partially offset by incremental activity in the current quarter. \u2047 These items were fully known and planned for as part of our 2020 operating plan. \u2047 We have previously communicated our expectation for year-over-year revenue declines in the first half followed by gains in the second half of the year. \u2047 With respect to foreign currency, we experienced headwinds of $23 million in the quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened primarily against the euro and Brazilian real. \u2047 COVID-19 is the last factor on this table. \u2047 Approximately $33 million of revenue, which we expected to recognize in the first quarter of 2020, will be recognized in future periods. \u2047 This effect was predominantly in our retail and Eurasia Banking segments. \u2047 Transitioning to the right of this slide, you will see the combined efforts of higher-quality revenue and our DN Now initiatives, as non-GAAP gross profit increased $7 million year over year. \u2047 We achieved this positive result despite the effects of COVID-19 and a foreign currency headwind of approximately $7 million in the quarter. \u2047 From a gross margin perspective, we are pleased to deliver a 380-basis-point increase year over year to 27.9%. \u2047 On $911 million of revenue, this increase translates to approximately $35 million of incremental gross profit. \u2047 We are delivering significant margin increase across all three business lines, with services rising by 230 basis points, products expanding 280 basis points, and our software and gross margin increased by 1,280 basis points due to an easier comp, as well as better delivery and management of our labor costs. \u2047 Over to Slide 8. \u2047 As previously mentioned, the company is harvesting operating efficiencies and from functional G&A cost as part of our DN Now transformation. \u2047 We made good progress on our finance transformation, which includes regionalizing and centralizing activities, and introducing automation within our core finance functions. \u2047 Through the end of March, we have streamlined our organization by approximately 470 employees. \u2047 Our procurement initiative is also bearing results as we are utilizing spend analytics to reduce indirect spend. \u2047 With respect to real estate expenses, we are looking closely at our needs post COVID. \u2047 We have demonstrated a highly resilient ability to work remotely. \u2047 And accordingly, we are aggressively moving to reduce our real estate footprint. \u2047 In the past several weeks, we have decided to close greater than 50 smaller sites permanently. \u2047 When compared with the prior year, we reduced our non-GAAP operating expenses by $29 million, a decline of 13%. \u2047 Given this success, we expect to continue to deliver G&A efficiencies going forward. \u2047 As displayed on Slide 9, stronger gross margin, coupled with reductions to operating expense, boosted our operating profit by $36 million or 133% year over year to $63 million. \u2047 The operating margin expanded by 430 basis points in the quarter to 6.9%. \u2047 Our first-quarter results include a reduction to our annual bonus expense of approximately $7 million, which is just one of our incremental actions we have executed to strengthen the company during the COVID-19 period. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA of $89 million improved by $24 million or 37% over the prior-year period. \u2047 The company's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 350 basis points in the quarter to 9.8%. \u2047 The next three slides provide segment-level financial information. \u2047 In order to make the year-on-year comparisons more meaningful, we introduced adjusted revenue and gross profit for the first quarter of 2019, which removes the effects of foreign currency and divestitures. \u2047 We are showing gross profit on these slides to more closely reflect how we are running the business. \u2047 However, we will continue to disclose segment operating profit in the MD&A section of our Form 10-Q. \u2047 As Gerrard mentioned earlier, Eurasia Banking delivered very strong orders in the first quarter and built up a nice backlog. \u2047 These wins included a new ATM-as-a-Service contract with Bank99 in Austria, valued at more than $20 million in a branch transformation win, valued at more than $13 million with a large Saudi Arabian financial institution. \u2047 Moving to Slide 10. \u2047 First-quarter revenue of $311 million was in line with our pre-COVID expectations. \u2047 Approximately $13 million of the revenue decline was due to our divestiture activity, while $8 million was due to our delivered actions taken in 2019 to reduce low-margin business. \u2047 Additionally, certain large hardware installations benefited 2019 revenue, which did not continue in 2020. \u2047 Delays from the COVID-19 pandemic pushed approximately $14 million of revenue into future periods. \u2047 Non-GAAP gross profit of $90 million in the quarter and a gross margin of 28.9% reflects the resiliency of this segment as we benefit from our DN Now services modernization and software excellence initiatives, as well as our intentional actions to reduce low-margin business. \u2047 First-quarter gross profit includes a foreign currency headwind of approximately $4 million versus the prior-year period. \u2047 On Slide 11, Americas Banking revenue of $345 million reflects a 3% decline, primarily due to our constant decision to exit lower margin service contracts"], "gold_summary": ["diebold nixdorf targeting break-even free cash flow for the full
