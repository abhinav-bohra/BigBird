{"article": ["Hope everyone is having a safe and good day. \u2047 This is Al Nahmad, Chairman and CEO. \u2047 And with me is A.J. Nahmad, who is our President; and our two Executive Vice Presidents, Paul Johnston and Barry Logan. \u2047 Now as we normally do, before we start, we need to read our cautionary statement. \u2047 Now on to our report. \u2047 I am pleased to share that Watsco has delivered an incredible second quarter, achieving new records in virtually every performance metric. \u2047 Earnings per share jumped 64% to a record $3.71 per share on a 66% increase in net income. \u2047 This was by far our most successful quarter ever. \u2047 Sales grew 36% or nearly $500 million to a record $1.85 billion in sales for the quarter. \u2047 Gross profits increased 50% with gross margins expanding 220 basis points. \u2047 Operating income increased $88 million or 68% to $217 million. \u2047 And operating margins, this is a big one, operating margins expanded 220 basis points to a record 11.7%. \u2047 Now these results are all the more positive when considered against last year's second quarter, which had only a modest impact from the COVID-related slowdowns. \u2047 Now we have two new companies in our family, TEC and Acme. \u2047 They performed very well, and we cannot be happier that they are now part of an important part of Watsco. \u2047 They have a rich and successful history and we will help them any way we can. \u2047 Looking ahead, we are engaged in a very fragmented $50 billion North American market. \u2047 Again, this is a $50 billion North American market. \u2047 And we hope to find more great companies to join us. \u2047 Greater scale in this industry provides more capital for us to fund our growth priorities. \u2047 Also Watsco's industry-leading technologies continues to gain traction, and we believe they are helping us gain market share. \u2047 Here are a few important highlights to mention. \u2047 First, growth rates among active users of our technologies continues to outpace the growth rates of nonusers. \u2047 Customers using our technology are simply growing faster. \u2047 Next, attrition among customers using our technology is meaningfully lower compared to nonusers. \u2047 The technology enables us to create stickier customer relationships. \u2047 Also, more customers are using our digital selling platforms that are called OnCall Air and CreditForComfort. \u2047 They help and modernize how HV solutions are presented to homeowners. \u2047 These tools have also benefited the sale of higher efficiency systems, which we think is an important contributor to the climate chain discussion. \u2047 As older systems are replaced, our technology can play an important role in helping consumers choose more energy-efficient solutions. \u2047 Our progress is very encouraging, but we believe it is still early in terms of reaching the full potential of our technology investments. \u2047 Our focus remains in the long term. \u2047 I think you've heard me say that over and over again. \u2047 We are long-term players in the industry. \u2047 Please feel free to schedule a Zoom call with us, and we can further explain our technology and its impact. \u2047 Finally, but very important, our balance sheet remains in pristine condition with only a small amount of debt. \u2047 We have plenty of capacity and even more ambitions to grow our company both organically and through acquisitions. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["watsco earnings per share jumps 64% to $3.71 in q2.  \u2047  watsco earnings per share jumps 64% to $3.71 setting records for sales, operating profit, operating margin and net income.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $3.71.  \u2047  q2 revenue $1.85 billion versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $1.68 billion.  \u2047  targeted operating cash flow to exceed net income in 2021."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share $3.71.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $3.71."]}
