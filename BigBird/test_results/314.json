I'll kick things off here. \u2047 ORI produced another terrific quarter with General Insurance and Title Insurance each posting exceptional results that drove the strong consolidated results that we posted. \u2047 Compared to the second quarter of 2020, total net premium and fees increased to just under $2 billion, up almost 30%, pre-tax operating income increased to $275 million, and that's up 80% and the consolidated combined ratio improved to 90.6%, a 5.5 percentage point improvement. \u2047 Again, comparing to the second quarter of '20, General Insurance saw growth return with net written premium increasing by 13% and in Title Insurance we grew net premiums and fees earned by 57%. \u2047 So our specialty strategy with our diverse portfolio of specialty products in both the General Insurance and Title Insurance groups continue to deliver strong growth and strong profitability. \u2047 So with that introduction, I'll now turn the discussion over to Frank, to discuss some of the per share figures along with our investment portfolio, and then he'll turn things back to me to cover General Insurance, and that'll be followed by Carolyn, who will discuss Title Insurance, and then of course, we'll open it up to Q&A after that. \u2047 So Frank, I hand it over to you. \u2047 For the first six months of this year net operating income was $427 million, which was up 61%. \u2047 Results for both periods were driven by substantial growth and underwriting profitability within our General and Title Insurance segments, and you'll hear more about that shortly. \u2047 Additionally, shareholders' equity rose to just under $6.8 billion, resulting in book value per share growing to a record $22.59. \u2047 So taking into account dividends, this was an 11% increase from last year-end. \u2047 This growth was driven by a combination of our strong earnings along with further market appreciation within the investment portfolio. \u2047 At June 30th, that investment portfolio consisted of approximately 68% of highly rated bonds and short-term investments with the remaining 32% allocated to large-cap stocks that have a long history of not only paying dividends, but increasing them. \u2047 The fair value of the equity portfolio improved by another $120 million during the quarter and ended with an unrealized gain of nearly $1.3 billion. \u2047 Net investment income decreased slightly for the quarter and almost 5% year-to-date, as the impact of lower yield on new investment purchases more than offset a modest increase in the average investment base. \u2047 The average maturity on the bond portfolio remained consistent at approximately four years, and the book yield was 2.6% compared to a market yield of 2.5%. \u2047 Now turning to the liability side of the balance sheet, claim reserves grew to just over $11 billion at June 30th, all three operating segments recognized favorable claim reserve development for the quarter. \u2047 In total, the consolidated claim ratio benefited by 1.8 percentage points for both this year's second quarter and first half, compared to 0.3 and 0.6 percentage points for the same period a year ago. \u2047 Finally, our mortgage run-off operations continue to generate results aligned with our expectations. \u2047 The group paid another $25 million dividend to parent, bringing the total to $50 million for the year. \u2047 We expect that pace of dividends to continue through the remainder of the year. \u2047 Total GAAP shareholders' equity for the mortgage companies ended the quarter at just under $220 million. \u2047 So turning to General Insurance. \u2047 As I already noted, we saw growth return with net written premium increasing by 13% and net premiums earned increasing 6%. \u2047 Compared to second quarter of 2020, pre-tax operating income rose by almost 45% primarily from our improved claim ratios. \u2047 The overall combined ratio improved 4.4 percentage points from 98.4% to 94%. \u2047 The claim ratios we reported were of course inclusive of favorable prior year development and that came in at 2.9 percentage points for the quarter. \u2047 Net premiums written in commercial auto grew by 13% with the tailwind we have from continued rate increases in auto liability and those rate increases right now are coming in, in the 15% range. \u2047 Our second quarter commercial auto claim ratio improved 75.4% compared to 83.4% in the second quarter of '20. \u2047 As far as frequency, claim frequency is returning, but still lower than pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 And, however, offsetting that is higher severity that continues due to greater speeds and the continued pressure on settlement values. \u2047 Turning to workers' compensation, net premiums written were even compared with the second quarter of '20. \u2047 However, that's a notable improvement from recent quarters where we've experienced some declines. \u2047 Rates in work comp were slightly negative and that's fluctuated between quarters, between a range of plus or minus 2% over the most recent quarters. \u2047 So relatively flat trend there. \u2047 The workers' compensation, second quarter claim ratio came in at 59.6% and that compares to 65.7% in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 Claim frequency here in workers' comp is trending back toward pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Given that we typically provide commercial auto, workers' comp and general liability together in our product offering. \u2047 This combined claim ratio came in at 69.1% compared to 74.6% in last year's second quarter. \u2047 Highlighting the results in financial indemnity, property and other coverages, which we show in the financial supplement, we've expanded our product offering in these areas, and collectively in those three areas we grew net written premium by 25% this quarter and the favorable claim ratios help contribute to the improved combined ratio in the General Insurance Group. \u2047 So we -- in General Insurance, continue to enhance our underwriting excellence through better segmentation, improved risk selection, pricing precision and increased use of analytics and we feel confident that these efforts will continue to facilitate strong underwriting profitability as we move through the year. \u2047 The marketplace is generally disciplined and it's therefore favorable for us to continue to obtain appropriate prices for our products while maintaining our high retention ratios. \u2047 So that will wrap it up for the General Insurance Group for the time being. \u2047 I'll now turn the discussion over to Carolyn, who along with the rest of her team have put together a string of terrific quarters. \u2047 So Carolyn, I'll let you take it from here. \u2047 Total premium and fee revenue for the quarter of $1.1 billion was up nearly 57% from the prior year. \u2047 This is a combination of strong contributions from both agency business, up 61% and our direct production channels up 44%. \u2047 For the six-month year-to-date period premium and fee revenue has already surpassed the $2 billion mark, a 48.6% increase from the comparable period last year. \u2047 Our pre-tax operating income of a $138 million for the quarter compared to $65 million in last year's second quarter, an increase of approximately $73 million or 112.3%. \u2047 The second quarter also marks four consecutive quarters in which the $100 million pre-tax operating income threshold has been exceeded. \u2047 The high premium and fee volume provide greater leverage of our expense structures noted in our 85.4% expense ratio for the second quarter this year. \u2047 An 86.3% for year-to-date June results, versus 89.6% and 90.6% for the comparable prior periods. \u2047 For the Mortgage Banker Association full year 2021 mortgage originations are expected to be one of the top years on record, although, trailing by 10.5%, the record-setting 2020 results. \u2047 Since second quarter 2020, refinances have made up the lion share of the mortgage origination growth and this trend continue through the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 There is a marked decrease expected in refinances for the second half of the year, as compared to the strong volumes experienced during the second half of 2020. \u2047 However, on the flip side, the purchase market is expected to increase by over 15% in 2021, which helps the title insurance industry with a higher fee profile. \u2047 Technology continues to be a cornerstone for advancement in our industry, as well as a key piece of Old Republic's ability to deliver on our business goals and objectives. \u2047 During the third quarter 2020 earnings call, we introduced a Proof of Concept project we had initiated around Robotic Process Automation or RPA, while creating our first spot. \u2047 This Proof of Concept proved measurable ability to reallocate human hours of work. \u2047 More importantly and really more exciting, the early metrics are showing a 35% reduction and the time to complete the processes, while providing elasticity to handle changes in volume. \u2047 This elasticity allows for increases in volume without an increase in corresponding expense. \u2047 The Proof of Concept created the results, we were hoping for and we will continue to deploy and leverage this technology. \u2047 We know that we are only starting to tap the potential of RPA and other automation technologies, and are excited to implement their capabilities. \u2047 This represents just one initiative in our portfolio of technology projects that we are working on. \u2047 The last year showed the increased usage of our digital solutions and platforms, we saw a similar trend with the usage of our digital closing platform Pavaso. \u2047 In fact, we remain the clear market leader in this space, as the majority of the digital closings and e-notes completed nationwide occur on Pavaso. \u2047 As a result, we constantly reinvest in improvements that will continue to expand the adoption of digital closings in the industry. \u2047 One other quick example of our technology focus that I would like to share with you is that one of the major challenges identified in the industry was the work required to tag documents, to allow electronic signatures by all parties in the transaction. \u2047 Historically on the title side it required manual and time-consuming preparation to apply the tags. \u2047 To address this, we released the recent enhancement of text tagging, which allows for the reduction of or even eliminates manual tagging efforts. \u2047 Though this is specifically targeted for the title industry, it will be used by any party that doesn't currently have a document tagging standard. \u2047 We are committed to easing the challenges to adoption and will have a continued focus on that. \u2047 Essentially, our business roadmap and our technology roadmap have converged into one as they must, to achieve our results. \u2047 I look forward to continue to share the results of these with you in the future. \u2047 Our plan is to blend the history of Old Republic solid business practices procedures and expertise with technology to fully unlock their measurable benefits across our business units. \u2047 As we enter the second half of the year our order counts remained strong mortgage rates are projected to remain low, and continued improvements in the unemployment rate are all drivers that should equate to a healthy real estate market to finish off the year. \u2047 I'd like to close with my appreciation to all our employees and customers, as they continue to meet the high demands of the current real estate market. \u2047 As always, our guiding principles of integrity, managing for the long run, financial strength, protection of our policyholders and the well-being of our employees and customers who'll be at the forefront of all that we do. \u2047 Well, again, we're very pleased with another quarter of exceptional operating result, and we're also very pleased with our specialty strategy providing specialty insurance and products to core industry served by General Insurance and Title Insurance, which in turn produces value for our shareholders. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share of 73 cents per share."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted earnings per
