{"article": ["But before I begin, I'd like to take a minute to recognize the hard work of our team at Invesco, like most everybody, our employees have been working in a work-from-home or hybrid environment for more than a year now, and they've achieved these results in a very challenging environment. \u2047 And with the success of the virus, many of us have been coming back to the office and working together in the last few months and I can tell you, it's good to see our colleagues once again. \u2047 And we are in different stages of reopening around the globe and one thing that I hear from everybody that is able to get back to the offices upgraded us to see one another and work together. \u2047 And as always, we'll follow the status of COVID and local guidelines as we transition back to the office, meeting client needs, helping them ensure continued health and well-being of our employees. \u2047 So now, let me turn to the results. \u2047 We achieved a new record in the second quarter for long-term net inflows totaling $31 billion. \u2047 This follows net inflows of $24.5 billion last quarter and up nearly $18 billion in the second half of last year. \u2047 Growth was led by net inflows into institutional ETFs, fixed income, and but as alternative capabilities. \u2047 And as you can see on Slide 3, the key capability areas where we have scale, investment readiness, competitive strength, drove growth again in the quarter. \u2047 These are areas where our investment performance is strong, we're highly competitive and well-positioned for growth. \u2047 Looking at our ETFs, excluding the Qs, they generated net long-term inflows of $12 billion during the quarter. \u2047 Net long-term inflows from alternatives during the quarter were $4.3 billion, including strength in our private markets business. \u2047 We launched two CLOs during the period, raising $1 billion and generated net inflows into our real estate business of a billion dollars. \u2047 We continue to focus and invest in our alternative capabilities space where we also see the benefit of our partnership with MassMutual which we highlighted last quarter. \u2047 MassMutual has committed over $1 billion to various alternative strategies, materially increasing the speed with which[Phonetic] we can get to market for the benefit of our clients. \u2047 We continue to innovate with strategies for retail investors through the launch of products such as INREIT and the partnership we announced with UBS, in which we will provide bespoke Global Property Investment Services for management clients of UBS in Switzerland, other parts of EMEA and Asia. \u2047 We also have $5 billion in direct real estate capital available for deployment. \u2047 We had net long-term inflows of $8.8 billion into active fixed income and within the active global equities, our $52 billion[Phonetic] developing markets fund, a key capability that came with the Oppenheimer combination, continued to see net inflows of nearly $1 billion dollars during the quarter. \u2047 Second-quarter flows included net long-term inflows of $3 billion from Greater China and our Chinese joint venture continues to be a source of strength and differentiation for us as an organization. \u2047 In addition, our solutions enable institutional pipeline accounts for 35% of the pipeline at quarter-end, this following the funding of a large passive mandate from Australia in the second quarter which was enabled by our Solutions team. \u2047 Allison will add more information in a moment on flows, the pipeline results in the quarter, including the continued progress toward our net savings target. \u2047 But I would note, the growth we are experiencing is driving positive operating leverage producing an adjusted operating margin of 41.5% for the quarter. \u2047 Strong cash flows being generated from our business improved our cash position, helping build a stronger balance sheet and improving our financial flexibility for the future. \u2047 Our investment performance was strong in the second quarter with 72% of actively managed funds in the top half of peers or feeding benchmark on a five-year and a 10-year basis. \u2047 This reflected continued strength in fixed income, global equities, including emerging market equities and Asian equities. \u2047 All areas where we continue to see demand from clients globally. \u2047 Moving to Slide 5. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $1.525 trillion in AUM. \u2047 Of the $121 billion in AUM growth, approximately $66 billion is a function of increased market values. \u2047 Our diversified platform generated gross inflows in the second quarter of $114.4 billion. \u2047 This [Technical Issues] 82% improvement from one year ago. \u2047 Net long-term inflows in the second quarter were $31.1 billion, representing 10.6% annualized organic growth. \u2047 Active AUM net long-term inflows were $2.1 billion and passive AUM net long-term inflows were $29 billion. \u2047 The retail channel generated net long-term inflows of $9.5 billion in the quarter, driven by positive ETF flows. \u2047 This represents a $24.1 billion improvement in net long-term inflows from one year ago, driven by significant improvement in equities in the Americas. \u2047 The institutional channel generated net long-term inflows of $21.6 billion in the quarter, augmented by the funding of the nearly $18 billion Australian passive mandate. \u2047 Looking at retail net inflows, our ETF, excluding the QQQ, generated net long-term inflows of $12.1 billion. \u2047 Our global ETF platform, again excluding QQQ, again captured flows in excess of its market share of AUM in the second quarter and for the first half of 2021 with net ETF inflows in the United States included a continued high level of interest and our S&P 500 equal weight ETF, which generated $2.6 billion in net inflows in the second quarter, following $4 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. \u2047 Looking at flows by geography on Slide 6. \u2047 You'll note that the Americas had net long-term inflows of $5 billion in the quarter, driven by net inflows into ETFs, various fixed income strategies, private market CLOs, and the direct real estate net long-term inflows that Marty mentioned. \u2047 Asia-Pacific again delivered another strong quarter with net long-term inflows of $28.3 billion. \u2047 Net inflows were diversified across the region, nearly $18 billion was from the large passive Australian mandate that funded from our institutional pipeline in May. \u2047 The balance reflects $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows from Japan, $3 billion in inflows from Greater China of which the majority was from our China JV, $1.8 billion from Singapore, and the remainder arising from other areas across the region. \u2047 Long-term inflows for EMEA excluding the UK were $1 billion driven by retail flows including net inflows into alternative[Phonetic], particularly our US and European senior loan funds. \u2047 ETFs, the net inflows in EMEA were $2.2 billion in the quarter. \u2047 And finally, the UK experienced net long-term outflows of $3.2 billion in the second quarter, driven largely by net institutional outflows in multi-asset and investment-grade capabilities. \u2047 $2.4 billion of these net long-term outflows relate to our Global Targeted Return capability, which had $10.2 billion globally in AUM at the end of June. \u2047 The overall UK net long-term outflows in the second quarter were an improvement of $2.7 billion as compared to the first quarter net long-term outflows of $5.9 billion. \u2047 This improvement was driven by UK Retail, primarily inflows into the European Equity Funds and lower net outflows during the quarter across a number of fixed income and UK equity capabilities. \u2047 Turning to flows across the asset classes. \u2047 Equity net long-term inflows of $15 billion[Phonetic] reflect a good portion of the Australian mandate and ETF, including our S&P 500 equal weight ETF that I mentioned. \u2047 We continued to see broad strength in fixed income in the second quarter with net long-term inflows of $13.6 billion. \u2047 Driver to fixed income flows include institutional net flows into investment-grade strategies and retail net long-term inflows, and the various municipal funds and fixed maturity products in Asia. \u2047 It's worth noting that although we did have fund launches in China in the second quarter, they were not at the pace of what we experienced in the first quarter. \u2047 You see this largely reflected in the $9.1 billion decrease in the net flows in the balance asset class during the quarter to net outflows of $1.8 billion. \u2047 Our alternative asset class has many different capabilities, and this is reflected in the flows we saw in the second quarter. \u2047 Net long-term flows in alternative improved by $4.5 billion over the first quarter, driven primarily by our private markets business through a combination of inflows from the newly launched CLOs, direct real estate, senior loan and commodity capability. \u2047 Included in these alternative flow results is also the GTR net outflow that I just noted. \u2047 If you do exclude the global GTR net outflows, alternative net long-term inflows were $7.2 billion, quite significant in the quarter. \u2047 Moving to Slide 7. \u2047 Our institutional pipeline was $33.3 billion at June 30, reflecting the funding of the large passive indexing mandate in Asia Pacific, assisted by our custom solution advisory team. \u2047 Excluding the impact of the $18 billion passive mandate in the first quarter, the pipeline has increased in size and remained relatively consistent to prior quarter levels in terms of asset and fee composition. \u2047 Overall, the pipeline is diversified across asset classes and geographies and our solutions capability enabled 35% of the global institutional pipeline and created wins in customized mandates. \u2047 This has contributed to meaningful growth across our institutional network, warranting our continuing investment and focus. \u2047 Turning to slide 11[Phonetic], you'll note that our net revenues increased $52 million or 4.1% from the first quarter as a result of higher average AUM in the second quarter. \u2047 The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees of 34.8 basis points, a decrease was 0.90 of a basis point from the first quarter yield level. \u2047 The decrease was driven mainly by asset mix shift, including higher QQQ and money market average balances, as well as the impact of the large passive of Australian mandate that funded in May. \u2047 This decrease was partially offset by the improvement in markets in the quarter. \u2047 The incremental impact relative to Q1 of higher discretionary money market fee waivers was minimal in the second quarter, but the full impact on the net revenue yield for the second quarter was 0.70 of a basis point. \u2047 We do expect fee waiver to remain in place for the foreseeable future until rates begin to recover to more normalized levels. \u2047 Total adjusted operating expenses increased 1.9% in the second quarter. \u2047 The $14.4 million increase in operating expenses was mainly driven by variable compensations and marketing. \u2047 Higher variable compensation as a result of higher revenue offset by the reduction in payroll taxes and certain benefits from the seasonally higher levels that we experienced in the first quarter. \u2047 We also recognized sales -- excuse me, we also further recognized savings in the quarter, resulting from our strategic evaluation. \u2047 Marketing expenses increased $9.8 million in the second quarter, mainly due to seasonally higher levels relative to the first quarter, which is typically the low point for marketing spend annually. \u2047 We also reevaluated the timing of various branding campaigns and launched targeted initiatives in the quarter across the globe. \u2047 Operating expenses remained at lower than historic activity levels due to pandemic driven impact to discretionary spending, travel, and other business operations. \u2047 However, we did reduce some client activity and business travel late in the second quarter, which is reflected in both marketing and G&A expense. \u2047 As we look ahead to the third quarter, our expectations are for third-quarter operating expenses to be modestly higher compared to the second quarter, assuming no change in markets and FX levels from June 30. \u2047 We expect that the higher AUM levels driven by net inflows and market improvement in the second quarter will have a modest carryover impact on both revenues and associated variable expenses in the third quarter. \u2047 We also expect a modest seasonal increase in marketing-related expenses, as spend[Phonetic] typically increases in the third and fourth quarters. \u2047 One area that's still more difficult to forecast at this point is when COVID impacted travel and entertainment expense levels will begin to normalize. \u2047 We are engaging in more domestic travel and in-person engagements and we do expect to see continued modest resumption of these activities across the third quarter. \u2047 Additionally, our US mutual funds Board has approved certain changes to the pricing of transfer agency services that we provide to our fund. \u2047 As a result, we anticipate that our outsourced administration costs which we reflect in property, office, and technology expenses, will increase by approximately $25 million on an annual basis. \u2047 Offsetting this will be a corresponding increase in service to distribution revenues, resulting in a minimal impact to operating income. \u2047 We expect this new pricing structure to go into effect in the third quarter and to be fully in place by the fourth quarter. \u2047 Moving to Slide 9. \u2047 We update you on the progress we've made with our strategic evaluation. \u2047 As we've noted before, we are looking across four key areas of our expense base, our organizational model, our real estate footprint, management of third-party spend, and technology and operations efficiency. \u2047 Through this evaluation, we will continue to invest in key areas of growth, including ETF, fixed income, China Solutions, alternatives, and global equities. \u2047 In the second quarter, we realized $7.5 million in cost savings. \u2047 $2 million of the savings was related to compensation expense and $5 million related to property, office, and technology expense. \u2047 The $7.5 million in cost savings or $30 million annualized, combined with the $95 million in annualized savings realized through the first quarter of '21 brings us to $125 million in total or 63%[Phonetic] of our $200 million net savings expectations. \u2047 As it relates to timing, we still expect approximately $150 million or 75% of the run rate savings to be achieved by the end of this year, with the remainder realized by the end of '22. \u2047 Of the $150 million in net savings by the end of this year, we anticipate we will realize roughly 70% of the savings through compensation expense. \u2047 The remaining 30% would be spread across occupancy, tech spend, and G&A. \u2047 We expect the total program savings to be 65% in com"], "gold_summary": ["net long-term inflows were $31.1 billion for q2 of 2021, compared to inflows of $24.5 billion in q1 of 2021.  \u2047  qtrly gaap operating revenues
