described in these statements. \u2047 In addition, we may include references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as consolidated adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow. \u2047 As part of our discussion of Cheniere's results, today's call may also include selected financial information and results for Cheniere Energy Partners LP, or CQP. \u2047 We do not intend to cover CQP's results separately from those of Cheniere Energy, Inc. the call agenda is shown on slide three. \u2047 Jack will begin with operating and financial highlights, Anatol will then provide an update on the LNG market, and Zach will review our financial results and guidance. \u2047 Before covering our results and outlook, I want to spend a minute addressing winter storm Uri and its impact on Cheniere. \u2047 As we described back in February, we were impacted by the widespread power outages in Texas, which resulted in our Corpus Christi facility being down for a few days. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of our operating personnel at both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi for rising to yet another weather challenge and working so diligently to manage our operations smoothly throughout the freeze event. \u2047 From hurricanes to fog to now historic freezes, the Cheniere platform has withstood whatever mother nature throws our way and our focus on safe and reliable operations continues to benefit our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders. \u2047 As a result of the winter storm, there was no material impact on our assets or operations, and we were able to fill some cargoes at Sabine Pass and restore Corpus Christi to normal operating levels quickly to mitigate impacts on our delivery obligations. \u2047 We did recognize a financial benefit as a result of some optimization activity in the period leading up to the storm. \u2047 But the magnitude of that benefit is not material, which to our expected full year 2021 financial results. \u2047 More importantly, the global LNG market has recovered significantly for 2021 and beyond as demand has outstripped supply, resulting in higher prices even during the shoulder and summer months. \u2047 I continue to believe in the long-term viability and sustainability of LNG as an essential fuel source in the low-carbon future. \u2047 After delivering on our 2020 guidance, despite a myriad of challenges, we continued our momentum into the first quarter and are off to a fast start. \u2047 Now full year 2021 is looking even better for us than it did on our last call in February. \u2047 For the first quarter, we generated approximately $1.5 billion of consolidated adjusted EBITDA, approximately $750 million of distributable cash flow and almost $400 million in net income on revenue of approximately $3.1 billion. \u2047 We've often described 2021 as Cheniere's cash flow inflection point, and you can see progress on that early in the year in our first quarter financial results. \u2047 Zach will cover these numbers in more detail in a few minutes. \u2047 During the first quarter, we exported a quarterly record of 133 cargoes of LNG from our two facilities, with production incentivized by strong global LNG margins during the quarter, and we had the benefit of Corpus Christi Train three commissioning volumes. \u2047 This record production is also despite Corpus being down a few days as a result of the winter storm in February. \u2047 A sustained stronger LNG margin environment, together with our results for the first quarter, contribute to our ability to raise our full year 2021 financial guidance for the second consecutive quarter. \u2047 Our outlook for the balance of the year has improved since our last call in February, with a slightly higher production forecast, augmenting the impact of the improved LNG margins we see throughout the balance of the year. \u2047 We now forecast consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $4.30 to $4.6 billion, and distributable cash flow of $1.60 to $1.9 billion for the full year 2021. \u2047 Near the end of the quarter, Train three at Corpus Christi achieved substantial completion within budget and in line with the accelerated time line we've previously communicated, with the completion of train three, the Cheniere and Bechtel relationship has now delivered eight LNG trains ahead of schedule and within project budgets, which is truly world class execution. \u2047 And that execution excellence continues with our ninth Train. \u2047 As construction on Train six at Sabine Pass continues to progress against accelerated schedules. \u2047 The estimated substantial completion timeline has accelerated once again. \u2047 Substantial completion is now projected to be achieved in the first half of next year. \u2047 The carbon offsets covered full life cycle emissions. \u2047 From the wellhead through consumption, with Cheniere delivering the cargo to Shell FOB at Sabine Pass and Shell delivering the cargo to a our European regasification facility. \u2047 This first carbon neutral cargo is another step in Cheniere's environmental efforts I've discussed over the past several months. \u2047 Our efforts emphasize enhanced transparency as a critical step toward improving environmental performance, and maximizing the benefits of our LNG for Cheniere, our customers and our value chain partners. \u2047 Today's carbon neutral cargo announcement follows our February announcement of cargo Emissions Tags development. \u2047 The response to our CE tax from current and prospective customers has been extremely positive and has spurred further engagement. \u2047 Our focus is to ensure the long-term benefits of natural gas as an affordable, reliable and clean energy source for the world. \u2047 Turn now to slide six. \u2047 Where I'll discuss what I'm seeing in the market today and why I'm so optimistic about Cheniere's future prospects. \u2047 In the short term market, we're beginning to see the impact of the structural shift to natural gas as a primary energy source for the world, as evidenced by the global LNG demand growth we saw in 2020 despite the pandemic. \u2047 There was constructive LNG demand tension between Europe and Asia earlier this year that left some countries short of natural gas. \u2047 In addition, South America is entering its winter demand month and is contributing to the tightness in the global LNG market. \u2047 With natural gas storage below normal levels in Europe and precious little new supply entering the market this year, we also have a constructive backdrop in the LNG market for the balance of this year and into next year in 2023. \u2047 With Corpus Christi Train three completed very early and the completion time line for Sabine Pass Train six recently accelerated again to the first half of next year. \u2047 We are ideally positioned to benefit from these near-term market dynamics. \u2047 In the longer term, the supply and demand fundamentals in the global LNG market are even stronger and reinforce our confidence in the value of our existing platform and in our ability to commercialize our Corpus Christi Stage III expansion project. \u2047 In the four year period from 2017 to 2020 and the global LNG market added almost 120 million tons of capacity, an average of almost 30 million tons per year. \u2047 In the subsequent four year period, that average is expected to drop to approximately 11 million tons a year, a significant slowdown in supply growth, which will be amplified by output declines from older legacy projects. \u2047 On the demand side, the structural shift to gas on a global basis is evidenced by the near-term doubling of LNG importing nations in the last 10 years, and hundreds of billions of dollars of natural gas oriented infrastructure being built around the world today. \u2047 LNG consumers recognize and value LNG's flexibility, reliability, affordability and the critical role natural gas plays in improving environmental performance and achieving decarbonization goals. \u2047 We forecast that global LNG trade will approximately double, expanding by approximately 350 million tons per annum to over 700 million tonnes per annum by 2040, which would support additional, approximately 225 million tons per annum of incremental global supply. \u2047 Our constructive long-term view on the LNG market was recently reinforced for the results of a comprehensive climate scenario analysis we conducted with a leading global management consulting firm. \u2047 We published this analysis last month, and it's available on our website. \u2047 This study analyzed Cheniere's business over the long-term under various energy transition scenarios and concluded that even under the most aggressive energy transition scenario analyzed. \u2047 Demand for LNG and natural gas is expected to grow for decades to come. \u2047 In that not only are Cheniere's existing assets well positioned to take advantage of that, but new LNG capacity will be needed to meet that demand. \u2047 With regard to Cheniere specifically, our accomplishments and progress over the past five years of LNG operations have been nothing short of transformative and position the company to take full advantage of the constructive market we see in front of us. \u2047 We have established ourselves as a premier LNG operator, demonstrating LNG buyers worldwide the reliability and certainty associated with a long-term supply agreement with Cheniere. \u2047 In addition, our continuous improvement efforts have yielded efficiency gains and debottlenecking has unlocked a significant amount of extremely cost-effective volume across our projects, which further improves our competitive position and increases financial returns. \u2047 As construction ramps down, the long-awaited financial results of our multiyear capital programs are bearing fruit as evidenced by today's results. \u2047 This year, we expect to generate well over $1 billion of free cash flow, and we are quickly approaching our expected run rate metrics. \u2047 Our run rate forecast of $11 per share and distributable cash flow not only has a high degree of visibility but also empowers us to execute on an all of the above strategy for capital allocation, which includes achieving investment-grade credit metrics, funding a significant portion of Corpus Christi Stage three with cash flow after that project is commercialized and returning significant capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividend. \u2047 Zach and his team and I are working diligently with the Board and the rest of management on our detailed capital allocation plans, which we will communicate to you later this year. \u2047 I'm excited about what we are seeing in the LNG market, how Cheniere is positioned to capitalize with our portfolio volumes, a shovel-ready brownfield expansion project commercial offerings tailored to customers' needs and an improving credit and cash flow profile. \u2047 The global LNG market exited 2020 on a positive note as cold weather across Asia and continued economic expansion in China helped contribute to an increase in Asian LNG imports in Q4. \u2047 As non-U.S. supply was slow to respond, markets tightened as Asia pulled cargoes from Europe, a trend which continued in Q1 of 2021. \u2047 The in the first quarter, global LNG supply showed positive year-on-year growth for the first time since the first quarter of 2020, but net growth was modest as a healthy 17% growth in U.S. exports was largely offset by declines at several LNG facilities around the globe, which were either shut down or underperforming, including facilities in Norway, Nigeria, Australia, Trindad, Tobago and Russia. \u2047 Extreme cold weather in Asia and then Europe during the first quarter, combined with the supply constraints and a tight shipping market, caused unprecedented price spikes in JKM in the early part of the quarter to all-time highs of over $30 in January. \u2047 Since then, extreme temperature conditions have passed and JKM prices have moderated. \u2047 However, price levels are still well above where they were a year ago with March JKM settling at $8.26 and June trading above $9 currently. \u2047 Well above prices around the $2 in MMBtu level a year ago, indicating an underlying structural tightening of the market, supported by strengthening demand fundamentals. \u2047 As I just mentioned, in Asia, LNG imports were very strong in Q1, up over seven million tons or 11% year-on-year. \u2047 China added nearly five million tons of LNG demand despite robust domestic gas production and increased Russian pipeline gas imports. \u2047 Early reports of total gas demand in China show an increase of approximately 15% year-on-year in Q1. \u2047 Weather, continued coal-to-gas switching and a remarkable over 18% increase in Q1 GDP drove the demand increase. \u2047 In the Japan, Korea, Taiwan area, LNG imports increased 8% or three million tons year-on-year due partly to scheduled nuclear and coal outages. \u2047 From a structural demand level, 10 years after the Fukushima earthquake, most Japanese nuclear plants remain offline with only nine units, totaling 9.1 gigawatts resuming operation as of Q1 '21 compared with 42 gigawatts in 2010, solidifying LNG as a critical fuel for the stability of the energy system in Japan and in the region as a whole. \u2047 In Europe, gas demand in major markets rose by 9% year-on-year during Q1 and stronger heating and gas-fired power demand. \u2047 Significant drawdowns from storage through winter and into April has left European storage approximately 34 bcm or around 50% lower than the prior year by the end of April and approximately 11 bcm or approximately 375 Bcf below the five year average. \u2047 To attract LNG volumes away from Asia to help replenish storage, TTF prices remain elevated. \u2047 April TTF settled higher than JKM at $6.46 an MMBtu that was 13% higher on the month and up almost 200% year-on-year. \u2047 Current prop margins are in the $3 range, inclusive of a dramatic upward shift in charter rates from the $30,000 a day range well above the $80,000 a day range today. \u2047 Based on these demand fundamentals, although specific conditions during the first quarter led to some dramatic LNG price volatility, we believe we have also seen indications that the structural tightening that we've been predicting for some time is now under way. \u2047 As such, we have continued to transact incremental volumes aligned with our midterm strategy. \u2047 The team has secured an additional approximately 1.7 million tons, locking in over $200 million in fixed fees across 2022 and '23. \u2047 We see strong appetite for midterm agreements as both intermediaries and end users add diversity, security and flexibility to their portfolios. \u2047 Turning now to slide nine, where I will discuss some longer-term aspects of the market. \u2047 We've discussed over the last few years that we viewed 2021 as a transition year to a tight market. \u2047 And as we just described, that has played out so much faster than we expected. \u2047 Forward margins today during the Northern Hemisphere Spring shoulder season, are higher than they have been at any point for this season since we began operating just over five years ago. \u2047 A number of market conditions that have been headwinds to entering into long-term commitments have more recently become tailwinds. \u2047 And such as oil price, prompt margins and forward supply growth, just to name a few. \u2047 We remain quite sanguine on the long-term contracting market for our products over the coming quarters and years as the demand for LNG will continue to increase over time with many current markets expanding and new"], "gold_summary": ["cheniere increases full year adjusted ebitda guidance.  \u2047  cheniere energy - increasing 2021
