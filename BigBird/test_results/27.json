{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Johnson Controls' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Oliver; and our Chief Financial Officer, Olivier Leonetti. \u2047 In discussing our results during the call, references to adjusted earnings per share, EBITA and EBIT exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as other special items. \u2047 Additionally, all comparisons to the prior year are on a continuing ops basis. \u2047 I'm going to start off with a quick look back at 2021 and update you on a few of our long-term strategic priorities. \u2047 Olivier will provide a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and provide you with our fiscal 2022 guidance. \u2047 Let's get started on slide three. \u2047 We rounded out fiscal '21 with another quarter of solid financial results, having met or exceeded all of our original commitments for the year, in what turned out to be a much more difficult environment than originally planned. \u2047 The ability to deliver these results, while navigating through unprecedented levels of inflation and supply chain disruptions, is a testament to the operational discipline and agility demonstrated throughout the organization. \u2047 And for that, I am incredibly grateful for the efforts of the entire Johnson Controls team. \u2047 Despite the challenging external environment, our end market demand remains strong. \u2047 Robust retrofit activity, coupled with a pickup in new nonresidential construction we are starting to see, creates a strong future demand trend. \u2047 This is evidenced by the continued momentum we are seeing in our order books and the record backlog we have built. \u2047 We also remain focused on the big picture, moving ahead with bold new commitments, doubling down with ambitious new ESG goals set earlier this year, embarking on a substantial new productivity program designed to drive a step-function change in profitability. \u2047 And just recently, at our Investor Day in September, we committed to a new set of three year financial commitments. \u2047 We made significant progress in advancing our growth strategy, scaling our OpenBlue digital platform, launching eight new major offerings and greatly expanding our partner ecosystem, investing in the refresh of our product portfolio, focusing on accelerating our service growth and improving our attachment rate. \u2047 And we are capitalizing on strong secular trends for healthy buildings, decarbonization and smart connected equipment and buildings. \u2047 As end markets continue to recover and the adoption of these trends continue to expand globally, I am confident we are uniquely positioned from a competitive standpoint to continue to outperform. \u2047 In addition to the strong financial results and advancement on our strategic initiatives, we have also continued to lead in ESG, including continued progress toward both our 2025 sustainability goals and our new ESG commitments. \u2047 This is not, by any means, an exhaustive list, but I am extremely pleased with what our teams have accomplished in the last year. \u2047 We are committed to net zero, committed to reducing emissions within our own operations and that of our customers. \u2047 Our science-based targets have been approved. \u2047 Our leadership team is aligned from a governance perspective, and we are extending our leadership in sustainable financing as well. \u2047 Tomorrow, I travel to COP26 in Glasgow. \u2047 We made great progress in driving home the understanding that buildings represent approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and there is no tackling climate change without substantial investment in buildings. \u2047 Governments are now acting on this and mobilizing billions to upgrade buildings. \u2047 And Johnson Controls is perfectly positioned to deliver those solutions. \u2047 At COP26, I will meet with government and business leaders to build momentum and ensure action. \u2047 Turning to slide five. \u2047 I wanted to take a few minutes to highlight several new strategic developments in the quarter. \u2047 Most recently, we signed an MOU with two significant technology leaders, Accenture and Alibaba, to address sustainable infrastructure needs. \u2047 This collaboration will focus on an estimated multibillion-dollar market for digital solutions serving data centers in China. \u2047 We also signed a foundational technology agreement with Tempered Networks, building upon our recent cybersecurity partnerships with Pelion and DigiCert. \u2047 Each of these partnerships embeds a critical layer of trust, security and operational capability into our OpenBlue platform and connected devices. \u2047 These elements differentiate our products and services to help protect the integrity of our customers' operations and data. \u2047 Tempered brings an industry-leading zero-trust secure network capability that helps us drive customer confidence and, in turn, accelerate the adoption of OpenBlue services. \u2047 Our partnerships with UL, Safe Traces and with Phylagen are powerful examples of how we are innovating to extend our Healthy Buildings leadership, providing new indoor environmental quality solutions to address our customers' most pressing challenges. \u2047 Our near-term focus is on the education vertical as there is a clear and compelling need to help those customers optimize their investments. \u2047 With an estimated $195 billion in government stimulus earmarked for K-12 spending, this provides a significant opportunity. \u2047 Additionally, we entered into an exclusive joint development agreement and investment with Phylagen, a leading biotech company working on the identification of indoor bacteria and viruses that are all around us in buildings. \u2047 Our work with Phylagen is a commitment to developing the cutting-edge capabilities to deliver and maintain healthy buildings. \u2047 At our Investor Day, we shared with you our three pillars for delivering above-market growth over the next three years and beyond. \u2047 One of those pillars related to gaining share through innovative product development centered around digital and sustainability. \u2047 As planned, we launched over 150 new products in fiscal 2021, spanning nearly all business units, resulting in continued share gains in both Q4 and the full year. \u2047 In 2022, we are well positioned to gain share with another 175 new products across four main categories: sustainability, smart buildings, digital and residential, with heat pumps central to our product development strategy. \u2047 These are just a sample of what is expected to launch over the next 90 days, with a steady pipeline behind us. \u2047 Turning to slide seven. \u2047 Service plays a central role in everything we do. \u2047 Over the last 18 months, we have strengthened our market-leading capabilities to best position ourselves for the shifting industry demographics and evolving digital technologies that are enabling outcome-based solution models. \u2047 At the start of last year, we began articulating our intentions to accelerate service growth to a couple of points above market levels, part of which would be the result of increasing our attachment rate by leveraging our large installed base and the digital transformation of our business. \u2047 In fiscal 2021, we saw the early benefits of our efforts shine through. \u2047 We exited the year with service revenues up 8% in the fourth quarter with high single-digit growth in all three regions in nearly all business domains. \u2047 For the full year, service revenue grew 4%, which is up two to three points over 2019 levels, despite a slow start to the year as we manage through lingering site access restrictions and abnormal customer budget pressures. \u2047 Looking ahead, we see service accelerating through fiscal 2022, in line with our goal to outpace the market. \u2047 The order strength we've seen in the second half of the year bolsters that view. \u2047 Service orders were up 7% in Q4 and, importantly, up low single digits organically versus 2019 levels. \u2047 Additionally, we improved our attach rate to approximately 40%. \u2047 Turning to slide eight. \u2047 The third pillar is our vectors of growth, which we believe, on a combined basis, represents an incremental market opportunity of $250 billion over the next decade. \u2047 Our unique portfolio is a competitive advantage across all three areas. \u2047 And from a financial performance perspective, we have significantly increased both revenue and orders in fiscal 2021. \u2047 This positions us very well for continued strong performance as we move forward. \u2047 Next, on slide nine, I wanted to highlight a key customer win related to one of our key vectors of growth. \u2047 In Q4, we were awarded a Buildings as a Service project by one of our long-standing customers, the University of North Dakota. \u2047 This is the second long-term Performance Infrastructure contract we have been awarded with this university in the last two years. \u2047 It leverages not only our expertise in Performance Contracting, but also the OpenBlue Enterprise Manager software. \u2047 The total contract value was nearly $220 million over the life of the project, with a smaller portion of that booked during the quarter. \u2047 Before I turn things over to Olivier, let me conclude with a few thoughts. \u2047 I remain extremely encouraged by the demand patterns we are seeing across most of our end markets and the ability of our teams to capitalize on more than our fair share of that demand. \u2047 We see this decade as being one of the most exciting for the smart building industry, which Johnson Controls is positioned to lead. \u2047 Underlying momentum in our short-cycle businesses continues to improve despite pressure from ongoing supply chain and component availability constraints. \u2047 Our longer-cycle install business, driven by the new buildings market, also continues to recover, although extended lead times and inflation are delaying some investment decisions, particularly on larger projects. \u2047 Retrofit activity remains an important driver of our business, and we see plenty of opportunity to capitalize on this activity going forward. \u2047 All of that said, we are very mindful of the macro backdrop and our outlook does not assume any significant near-term improvement in supply chain conditions or inflation over the next couple of quarters. \u2047 On price/cost, given the progressive rise in inflation for almost all input costs throughout the year, we took decisive steps on pricing and cost to stay ahead of the curve. \u2047 And I am confident we will continue to manage through these challenges. \u2047 Looking ahead to fiscal 2022, our focus turns to accelerating and demonstrating our growth capabilities. \u2047 Our proven product technology leadership, combined now with OpenBlue, truly differentiates the solutions we can bring to our customers. \u2047 In fact, we believe we are best positioned to lead the revolution of smart buildings, and we are fully committed to creating healthier, safer and more sustainable buildings. \u2047 Let me start with a brief financial summary on slide 10. \u2047 Sales in the quarter were up 5% organically, led by Global Products, which is truly a reflection of the team's strong execution. \u2047 Underlying momentum in this business continue to improve, as evidenced by mid-single digits growth on a two year stack basis. \u2047 Our longer-cycle field business continue to recover, led by strong growth in services, up 8% in the quarter. \u2047 Segment EBITA increased 10% versus the prior year, margin expanding 30 basis points to 15.9%. \u2047 Better leverage on higher volumes, favorable mix and the incremental benefit of our SG&A actions more than offset the headwind from the reversal of temporary cost reductions and price/cost, including significant supply chain disruptions. \u2047 EPS of $0.88 was at the high end of our guidance range and increased 16% year-over-year, benefiting from higher profitability as well as lower share count. \u2047 Free cash flow in the quarter was approximately $300 million, reflecting the reversal of timing benefits experienced in the first three quarters of the year, as expected. \u2047 On a full year basis, we achieved 105% free cash flow conversion. \u2047 Orders for our field businesses increased 9%, led by low double-digit growth in install on strong double-digit growth in retrofit activity. \u2047 We are also seeing continued strength in our service business, with orders up 7%, driven by strong growth in North America and EMEALA. \u2047 Backlog grew 10% to more than $10 billion, with service backlog up 5% and install backlog up 11%. \u2047 The sequential improvement was led by strong retrofit activity as new construction continues to recover from depressed level in fiscal '20, particularly in North America. \u2047 Turning to our earnings per share bridge on slide 12. \u2047 Let me touch on a few key items. \u2047 Overall, operations contributed $0.09 versus the prior year, including a $0.04 benefit from our SG&A productivity program, achieving our targeted savings in fiscal '21. \u2047 We are well on track to achieve our SG&A and COGS savings in fiscal '22 and beyond. \u2047 Similar to last quarter, excluding the headwind from the prior year temporary actions, underlying incrementals in Q4 were approximately 30%. \u2047 Corporate was a $0.03 headwind year-over-year and other items netted to a $0.06 tailwind, primarily related to lower share count, lower net financing charges and FX. \u2047 Let's discuss our segment results in more details on slide 13. \u2047 My commentary will also refer to the segment end-market performance included on slide 14. \u2047 North America revenue grew 4% organically, led by strength in services, which was higher in all domain. \u2047 Install revenue was up low single digits, primarily due to strong demand from shorter-cycle retrofit and upgrade projects, and positive growth in new construction. \u2047 Both our internal and customer supply chain restrictions negatively impacted our North America install business. \u2047 By domain, Commercial Applied HVAC revenue grew mid-single digits, while Fire & Security increased low single digits in the quarter. \u2047 We had another strong quarter in Performance Infrastructure, which grew revenue low double digits, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, a good reflection on our customers' demand for decarbonization solution. \u2047 Segment margin decreased 20 basis points year-over-year to 15.2%, primarily due to the reversal of temporary cost from the mitigation actions in the prior year. \u2047 Orders in North America were up 11% versus the prior year, with high single-digit growth in both Commercial HVAC and Fire & Security. \u2047 Performance Infrastructure orders were up nearly 40%. \u2047 Applied HVAC orders increased 10% overall, driven by strong retrofit activity, with another strong quarter of equipment orders up over 20% in Q4. \u2047 Backlog of $6.5 billion increased 10% year-over-year. \u2047 Revenue in EMEALA increased 3% organically, led by continued strength in our service business, particularly in our Applied HVAC and Industrial Refrigeration businesses. \u2047 Fire & Security, which account for nearly 60% of segment revenues, grew at mid-single digits rate in Q4, with strength across our enterprise accounts and residential security businesses, including a rebound in our retail platform. \u2047 Industrial Refrigeration also grew mid-single digits, while Commercial HVAC & Controls declined low single digits. \u2047 By geography, revenue growth was broad-based, with strength in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by low double-digit decline in the Middle East. \u2047 Segment EBITA margins declined 30 basis points, driven by a prior year gain on sales. \u2047 Underlying margin performance improved as favorable mix, positive price/cost and the benefit of SG&A savings this year more than offset the temporary mitigation actions taken in the prior year. \u2047 Order in EMEALA continued to accelerate, increasing 7% in the quarter, with strong mid-teens growth in Commercial HVAC and high single-digit growth in Fire & Security. \u2047 APAC revenue"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted earnings per share $0.88 from continuing operations excluding items.  \u2047
