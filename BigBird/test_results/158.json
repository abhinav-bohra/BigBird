{"article": ["All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. \u2047 Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Tom Kunkel of Bond and Specialty Insurance and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. \u2047 They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. \u2047 Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Before I address our fourth quarter and full year results, a quick comment on current affairs. \u2047 Yesterday, we witnessed the most American of events. \u2047 The peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected administration to the next. \u2047 It's not a political statement, but a patriotic one to say that we want to see this next administration succeed. \u2047 We have significant challenges to overcome. \u2047 A pandemic threatening the health and safety of our loved ones and neighbors. \u2047 A distressed economy imperilling the lives and livelihoods of millions. \u2047 And a deeply divided society, which undermines our collective sense of security and well-being. \u2047 Let's hope yesterday marks the beginning of our political leaders on both sides of the aisle, taking a constructive approach to addressing these challenges. \u2047 And with that, I'll turn to results. \u2047 I'm pleased to report a very strong finish to the year with fourth quarter core income of $1.3 billion or $4.91 per diluted share and core return on equity of 20.5%, each up meaningfully from the prior year quarter. \u2047 We're also pleased to report full year core income of $2.7 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.3%, a substantial margin of the risk-free rate and our cost of equity. \u2047 Our ability to deliver these results in the face of an historic pandemic, a record-high number of PCS catastrophe events and record-low interest rates is a testament to the strength of our franchise. \u2047 More specifically, to our talented and committed workforce, the value of our hard to replicate competitive advantages and our expertise in balancing risk and reward to achieve industry-leading returns over time. \u2047 The principal driver of the higher level of core income for the quarter was very strong underlying underwriting income, resulting from record net earned premium of $7.5 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 88.7%. \u2047 We're pleased with the underwriting results in all three segments. \u2047 We once again recorded a sub-30% consolidated expense ratio for the quarter and the full year, demonstrating that our strategic investments in improving productivity and efficiency continue to pay off. \u2047 This quarter, our high quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $572 million after-tax as the non-fixed income portfolio continued to recover from the pandemic-related impacts earlier in the year. \u2047 Our operating results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% during the year after returning $1.5 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including $672 million of share repurchases, which we resumed in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Notwithstanding the challenges in the economy, we continued to successfully execute on our marketplace strategies to generate growth in top-line. \u2047 Net written premiums in the quarter grew by 3%, driven by strong renewal rate change broadly across the book and continued strong retention in all three segments. \u2047 Given the headwinds facing the industry, we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue for some time. \u2047 Business Insurance in our core Middle Market business, renewal rate change was a record 9.1%, up 4.5 points over the prior year and about a point sequentially, while retention remained strong. \u2047 Segmentation and pricing is key in this business. \u2047 And to that end, the quality of the execution underneath the headline production numbers was excellent. \u2047 In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12% as renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business achieved a record 10.9%, driven by record renewal rate change, while retention remained strong. \u2047 In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7%, driven by strong renewal premium change in our Agency Homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. \u2047 Fourth quarter production contributed to full year record net written premiums of almost $30 billion, up 2% compared to last year. \u2047 Adjusting for the premium refund to be offered to our Personal Insurance auto customers, net written premiums were up 3%, a strong top-line result in the context of this year's difficult economic environment. \u2047 I've shared before our belief that any commitment to delivering industry-leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time. \u2047 To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we have previously identified is impacting the industry. \u2047 As you can see on the slide, despite the challenging economic and operating environment, 2020 was another successful year of the execution of that strategy. \u2047 Since 2016, we have grown net written premiums and a 4.5% compound annual rate, substantially outpacing both GDP growth over the same period and rate over the prior years in the decade. \u2047 We accomplished that while maintaining a stable underlying underwriting margin. \u2047 In other words, we haven't grown by underpricing the product or changing our risk profile. \u2047 The growth has come organically from customer segments, products, geographies and producers that we know well. \u2047 Over that same period through our ongoing and relentless focus on optimizing productivity and efficiency, we've also improved our expense ratio by about two points compared to the run rate from earlier in the decade. \u2047 As you can also see on the slide, the result of all that is significantly higher underlying underwriting income, meaningfully higher cash flow from operations and double-digit growth in invested assets. \u2047 Those results have contributed to our ultimate objective of creating shareholder value and industry-leading return on equity over time. \u2047 Our core return on equity has increased in each of the last three years and averaged 11% over that period. \u2047 And that 11% is after bearing the impacts of significant cat and non-cat weather activity and meaningful increase in social inflation, historically low interest rates and the global pandemic. \u2047 In short, our performance this year and over recent years is the result of a sound strategy and the successful achievement of our strategic objectives. \u2047 Notwithstanding concerns for their own safety and responsibilities for taking care of loved ones and educating their children, they never wavered from our purpose of taking care of the people with privilege to serve or our mission of creating shareholder value. \u2047 I couldn't be more proud of this team. \u2047 From the scientists to the regulators to those who volunteer to participate in trials, it's a remarkable feat. \u2047 The side of those vaccines rolling off the line inspires optimism for the coming year and the sheer human will and ingenuity behind the effort to inspire hope for the future. \u2047 Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.262 billion, up from $867 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 20.5%, up from 14.8%. \u2047 Improvement in both measures was the result of very strong underlying underwriting results. \u2047 Our fourth quarter results include $29 million of pre-tax cat losses compared to $85 million of pre-tax cat losses in last year's fourth quarter. \u2047 Recall that last year's fourth quarter cat losses included a $101 million benefit from recoveries under the underlying Aggregate Cat Treaty, whereas in 2020, we exhausted the Cat Treaty in the third quarter. \u2047 So there were no recoveries under the treaty in this year's fourth quarter. \u2047 This quarter's cat results include about $40 million of favorable development in our loss estimates for events that occurred earlier in the year. \u2047 PYD in the current quarter, for which I'll provide more details shortly, was net favorable $180 million pre-tax. \u2047 The underlying combined ratio of 88.7%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by 3.4 points from the prior year quarter. \u2047 Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $804 million increased by nearly 50% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher levels of earned premium and higher margins, driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend and continued favorability in personal auto loss experience. \u2047 For the quarter, losses directly related to COVID-19, totaled a modest $31 million pre-tax, split about evenly between Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. \u2047 More than offsetting those losses were lower levels of auto claims in both Personal Insurance and Business Insurance. \u2047 The net impact of the COVID environment on the consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit of about 2.5 points, mostly in Personal Insurance. \u2047 We continue to take a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-related losses given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment. \u2047 As has been the case throughout the year, the majority of direct COVID losses that we've booked through year end remains in IBNR. \u2047 Looking at the full year net impact of COVID costs and benefits, including the impact of premium refunds to policyholders, our consolidated underlying combined ratio benefited by about a point. \u2047 The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29.4% brings the full year expense ratio to 29.9%. \u2047 While throughout the year we continued to make the investments necessary to fuel our continued success, our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency once again resulted in a sub-30% expense ratio despite the downward pressure on earned premiums from the impact of the soft economy on insured exposures and the premium refunds we issued to our personal auto customers. \u2047 We continue to be comfortable with the consolidated expense ratio of around 30%. \u2047 After-tax net investment income improved by 9% from the prior year quarter to $572 million. \u2047 A strong returns in the fixed income portfolio and a higher level of invested assets were partially offset by the expected decline in fixed income yields. \u2047 Looking forward to 2021, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter as we project that the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio in the lower interest rate environment. \u2047 Net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all three segments and totaled $180 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter. \u2047 In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $124 million was driven by better than expected loss experience in workers' comp, primarily from accident years 2017 and prior, partially offset by an increase to reserves related to very old years in our run-off book. \u2047 In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $32 million resulted primarily from better than expected loss development in the surety book. \u2047 And in Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $24 million was driven by the automobile line. \u2047 With our combined 2020 Schedule P is filed earlier in the second quarter, the line of business analysis will provide more detail on the loss trends we've noted in our commentary throughout the year with favorability in workers' comp, commercial property and the personal lines coverages and some strengthening in the commercial liability lines, much of which was in very old accident years relating to our run-off book. \u2047 Our long-standing Corporate Cat XOL Treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. \u2047 Regarding the Underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty we first purchased for 2019, we have renewed the treaty again for 2021. \u2047 While the treaty will continue to address qualifying PCS-designated events in North America, for which we incurred losses of $5 million or more, the 2021 renewal includes a $5 million deductible per event. \u2047 In prior years, PCS-designated events had cost us more than $5 million accounted toward the treaty from $1[Phonetic]. \u2047 The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $350 million, part of $500 million of losses, above our aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. \u2047 The aggregate retention for 2021 increased from 2020's $1.55 billion, largely reflecting recent years' experience and anticipated growth in our property book. \u2047 Hurricane and earthquake events once again have $250 million per occurrence cap. \u2047 And for 2021, wildfires are also capped at $250 million per event. \u2047 Incorporating our assumptions about cat and non-cat weather for 2021, we expect the full year impact of the treaty on our underlying combined ratio to be roughly half a point. \u2047 And we anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio. \u2047 Both of those impacts are consistent with the assumptions we had in each of the past two years. \u2047 Turning to capital management. \u2047 Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.9 billion were again very strong. \u2047 All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. \u2047 And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. \u2047 For the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $6 billion for the first time ever and reflected the benefit of continued increases in premium volume subrogation recoveries from PG&E related to the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and lower overall claim payouts as court room and other settlement activity slowed throughout the year due to COVID-related shutdowns. \u2047 Higher levels of cash flow give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio. \u2047 Interest yields decreased modestly as credit spreads tightened during the fourth quarter. \u2047 And accordingly, our net unrealized investment gains increased from $3.8 billion after-tax as of September 30 to $4.1 billion after-tax at year end. \u2047 Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses was $99.54 at year end, a 7% increase from a year ago. \u2047 We returned $419 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $218 million and share repurchases of $201 million. \u2047 For the year, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \u2047 As we entered 2021, we again thought it would be helpful to highlight the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decades. \u2047 As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. \u2047 Cat losses in the second quarter have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average. \u2047 And the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in seven of the past 10 years. \u2047 To wrap it up, we are very pleased with the quarter and full year results, especially given the challenging circumstances. \u2047 For the fourth"], "gold_summary": ["travelers qtrly core
