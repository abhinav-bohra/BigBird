{"article": ["The Everest executives leading today's call are Juan Andrade, President and Chief Executive Officer; Craig Howie, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and John Doucette, EVP and President and CEO of the Reinsurance division. \u2047 We are also joined today by other members of the Everest management team. \u2047 Management comments regarding estimates, projections and similar are subject to the risks, uncertainties and assumptions as noted in its filings. \u2047 Management may also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 First and foremost, I hope you, your families, your friends and your neighbors are all staying healthy and safe. \u2047 On behalf of our company, I want to offer our heartfelt condolences to all of those, including many in the Everest Re family who have lost loved ones during this difficult time. \u2047 We took early, proactive and decisive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, their families and our stakeholders. \u2047 As a result, Everest continues to successfully operate remotely. \u2047 We are doing our part in support of the global economy by serving all of our customers and stakeholders without interruption. \u2047 Our move to remote work was planful with a well-executed organizational resiliency plan and an underlying technology infrastructure that performs seamlessly and an information technology organization that has performed admirably. \u2047 Our employees have been flexible, resilient and productive. \u2047 We have received accolades regarding our responsiveness and our stability. \u2047 We also continue to support our local communities around the world in their pandemic relief efforts. \u2047 These are leadership moments for people and companies. \u2047 Our culture of collaboration, thoughtful assumption of risk, humility and relentless execution are at the bedrock of our performance. \u2047 I am incredibly proud of our people and our company. \u2047 Our diversified global platform, with its broad mix of products, distribution and geography, remains an important source of stable capacity to our broker partners and customers. \u2047 Our capital position remains a source of strength with high-quality invested assets, significant liquidity and low financial leverage. \u2047 Despite the pandemic and the economic downturn, Everest remains profitable, as reflected in our reported 98.6% combined ratio or 89.9% excluding catastrophe losses and the pandemic IBNR loss provision. \u2047 Additionally, Everest remains resilient, as reflected by both our 21% growth rate in gross written premium and by our capital position. \u2047 We have built a strong capital foundation over the years, holding $8.6 billion of shareholders' equity at March 31, 2020. \u2047 While this is a decrease from year-end 2019, this decrease primarily results from: one, the sharp decline in the fair value of the investment portfolio, which has now substantially recovered since the end of the quarter; two, share repurchases and dividends paid; and three, the pandemic loss IBNR provision. \u2047 Most importantly, our capital position continues to exceed what we need to run the business with excess capital relative to rating agency and regulatory requirements. \u2047 We have substantial liquidity from the cash we hold, and the cash flow from operations, which was over $0.5 billion for the quarter, were up 10% from 2019. \u2047 We have significant access to capital markets, including plenty of debt capacity as we carry very little debt compared to all of our peers at less than 7% of our capital when most of our peers typically carry upwards of 20% to 30%. \u2047 Lastly, our industry-leading expense ratio also gives us operating flexibility, which is particularly critical in times of uncertainty. \u2047 Turning to the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 Everest remains strong and is well positioned with broad capabilities and top talent. \u2047 And we remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. \u2047 We demonstrated excellent momentum across both of our Reinsurance and Insurance businesses with gross written premium growth of 16% and 33%, respectively. \u2047 We also continued to benefit from improved market conditions during the quarter, which I will discuss in a moment. \u2047 Excluding catastrophes and the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, our underlying combined ratios for the group at 89.9% and each of our divisions, Reinsurance at 87.7% and Insurance at 95.6%, are reflective of the strong underwriting performance across the group and the earnings generating power of the franchise. \u2047 Underwriting profitability remains at the core of everything we do. \u2047 Our Reinsurance division had a strong January one renewal season. \u2047 We continue to judiciously deploy capital, and we underwrote a high-performing book that is focused on strong economic returns while improving the diversification and balance of our overall portfolio. \u2047 We also saw stronger opportunities in several areas such as retro and facultative risk. \u2047 As the quarter progressed, we saw continued momentum across the portfolio. \u2047 John Doucette will provide additional details on market conditions and the underlying growth. \u2047 Our Insurance division's growth remained strong and consistent with recent quarters. \u2047 The drivers for this growth were: number one, strong and widespread rate momentum. \u2047 Excluding workers' compensation, the rate increase was plus 24% or plus 17% net of a handful of large deals booked in the quarter and over 12% including workers' compensation. \u2047 This is an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2019 where the rate increase was almost plus 12% excluding workers' compensation and plus 4% all in. \u2047 We also saw continued strength in the E&S space with strong submission flow and market conditions continuing to tighten in property and casualty in both primary and excess lines. \u2047 We also had strong renewal retention in both our retail and wholesale businesses. \u2047 And we had increased productivity resulting from additional underwriters hired in 2019 that are now fully onboarded and providing capacity to address the increased submission flow. \u2047 The insurance growth was also balanced and diversified across our many lines of business. \u2047 Strong rate and tightening terms drove the growth in the long-tail line. \u2047 Despite the impacts of the pandemic in the quarter, our underlying insurance portfolio continues to perform well, and we are seeing the benefits of our various investments in portfolio optimization efforts, all of which position us well for this environment. \u2047 Net investment income of $148 million was up 5% from the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Our investment portfolio had been and is defensively positioned with over 75% in investment-grade fixed income bonds and less than 4% allocated to public equities. \u2047 Most of our risk is bond risk, and we also have the ability to hold bonds until they mature. \u2047 In addition, we have continued to further reposition our portfolio, moving up in fixed income credit quality and reducing equity exposure. \u2047 As per our April 23 announcement, we have taken $150 million IBNR loss provision in the first quarter related to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 These losses relate to event cancellation, business interruption and other coverages such as accident and health and workers' compensation. \u2047 Our estimate was based on an analysis completed during the first quarter. \u2047 This analysis was a thorough cross-functional review of the in-force portfolio by line of business, industry and geography. \u2047 The review was completed by a team of professionals representing every area of the company. \u2047 Given the fluid and continuing nature of this pandemic, this is an ongoing event and so is our analysis. \u2047 While our analysis looked at all aspects of our global portfolio, our estimate does not take into account legal, regulatory or legislative intervention that could retroactively mandate or expand coverage provisions. \u2047 As stated in our release, our philosophy is to recognize and react to expected future losses on a timely basis. \u2047 We will be tracking pandemic losses separately from our attritional losses and as an ongoing event. \u2047 With regard to our specialty insurance business, we have limited exposure to event cancellation, accident and health, workers' compensation and business interruption. \u2047 Our property policies have unambiguous policy language that requires direct physical loss for business interruption coverage to be triggered. \u2047 Additionally, the majority of the property policies in force contain a virus exclusion. \u2047 Only a very small number of policies have endorsed sublimits typically less than $25,000 and with short-duration caps that would offer BI for a notable notifiable human disease. \u2047 These exposures have already been recognized as part of the overall IBNR loss estimate for the quarter. \u2047 The majority of the IBNR loss provision was for the Reinsurance business given the relative size of this portfolio compared to our Insurance businesses. \u2047 It is important to note that as a reinsurer, we have contractual terms and conditions, such as retentions, limits, event definitions, hours clauses and other coverage provisions that will apply to this ongoing event. \u2047 Thus, we do not simply follow the fortunes. \u2047 It will be very fact-specific. \u2047 We have also done a thorough review of our mortgage reinsurance contracts. \u2047 Based on our view of the economic situation that is aided by both external information and our own proprietary internal modeling, we currently believe that our loss picks and reserves remain adequate. \u2047 We will continue evaluating this business as the economic situation unfolds. \u2047 In summary, Everest showed forward momentum, resiliency and profitability in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 We effectively transitioned to running our company remotely. \u2047 And as always, we'll remain a consistent and trusted provider of capacity to our customers. \u2047 Given the uncertainties in the current public health and economic environment, there could be an adverse impact on results for the property and casualty industry and Everest for the remaining part of the year. \u2047 The impact is clearly dependent on the shape and length of the recovery. \u2047 While the economic environment has changed, Everest remains a high-quality franchise with broad capabilities, a global platform and top talent. \u2047 We remain focused on solving our clients' most critical risk transfer needs in a disciplined and profitable way. \u2047 We have the right culture, the right platform and relevance with our clients and trading partners and the capital base to see us through this time. \u2047 Everest reported net income of $17 million for the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 This compares to net income of $355 million for the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Net income included $172 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to $74 million of capital gains in the first quarter last year. \u2047 The 2020 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public equity portfolio. \u2047 Operating income for the quarter was $164 million driven by strong underwriting results across the group, stable net investment income and lower catastrophe losses, offset by a COVID-19 pandemic IBNR loss estimate of $150 million. \u2047 The overall underwriting gain for the group was $29 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $196 million in the same period last year. \u2047 In the first quarter of 2020, Everest saw $30 million of catastrophe losses related to fires and hailstorms in Australia and a tornado in Nashville, Tennessee. \u2047 This compares to $25 million of catastrophe losses reported during the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Overall, our prior year catastrophe loss estimates continue to hold. \u2047 The combined ratio was 98.6% for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 88.7% for the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Excluding the catastrophe events and the impact of the COVID pandemic, comparable combined ratios were 89.9% for the first quarter of 2020 and 87.4% for the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Excluding the pandemic IBNR loss estimate, the attritional loss ratio was 61.5%, up from 60.2% for the full year 2019 primarily due to the continued change in business mix. \u2047 For the Reinsurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, was 59.8%, up from 58.2% for the full year of 2019. \u2047 This increase was related to the continued business mix shift toward more pro rata premium, which carry a higher loss pick but allow us to benefit directly from the firming primary market. \u2047 Pro rata premium is less volatile than excess premium, and we will see the benefit earn into our results as we lap the loss tax season over time. \u2047 For the Insurance segment, the attritional loss ratio, excluding the pandemic loss estimate, remained very steady at 66.1%, essentially flat compared to 66% for the full year 2019. \u2047 As you can see in the financial supplement, we also experienced more growth in areas that typically carry a higher loss pick and but a lower overall combined ratio. \u2047 Our U.S. insurance franchise, which makes up the majority of our global insurance business, continues to run an attritional combined ratio in the low 90s, excluding the pandemic loss estimate. \u2047 The group commission ratio of 22% was down slightly compared to prior year. \u2047 The group expense ratio remains low at 6.3% and was higher than last year due to an increase in nonrecurring incentive compensation, benefits and payroll taxes in the first quarter, which will normalize during the rest of the year. \u2047 Before moving to investments, I'd like to point out that we are now reporting two segments: Reinsurance and Insurance. \u2047 This is consistent with the way the business is managed and the way management views the company's results. \u2047 For investments, pre-tax investment income was $148 million for the quarter from our $20 billion investment portfolio. \u2047 Investment income was 5% above the first quarter of last year. \u2047 This result was primarily driven by the increase in investment-grade fixed income portfolio, which had a higher asset base this year, and higher limited partnership income quarter-over-quarter. \u2047 Since we report most partnership income on a quarter lag, the global equity market performance in the first quarter will be reflected in the limited partnership investment results in the second quarter. \u2047 Pretax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9%, about flat compared to one year ago. \u2047 For our investment-grade portfolio, the new money rate was 2.7% for the quarter. \u2047 Other income included $21 million of foreign exchange gains in the quarter. \u2047 On income taxes, the $60 million tax benefit for the quarter included a $31 million tax benefit related to the CARES Act, which extended the carryback period for cat losses to five years. \u2047 Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on operating income was 12%, in line with our expected tax rate for the full year. \u2047 Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flow of $506 million compared to $460 million for the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 This increase reflects a lower level of paid catastrophe losses in 2020 compared to 2019 and an increase in cash flow from our ongoing growth in insurance and reinsurance premiums. \u2047 Shareholders' equity for the group was $8.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $9.1 billion at year-end 2019. \u2047 The movement in shareholders' equity since year-end 2019 is primarily attributable to the sharp decline in the fair value of the investment portfolio and by capital return for $200 million of share buybacks and $63 million of dividends paid in the quarter. \u2047 The reduction in investment portfolio valuation came from the realized losses"], "gold_summary": ["co wrote nearly $2.6 billion in gross written premiums for quarter, an increase of 21% as compared to a year ago."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports first quarter 2020 net income of $17.4 billion, or $17.6 billion, or $8.6 billion for q1 2020.  \u2047  qtrly net income of
