{"article": ["These materials are available on the Ventas website at www. \u2047 I will now turn over the call to Debra A. Cafaro, Chairman and CEO. \u2047 The Ventas team is dispersed but unified in spirit as we join you for today's call. \u2047 I'd like to provide an overview of our consistent strategy, discuss our third quarter results, highlight how we are driving our research and innovation business forward, describe our competitive advantage and managing institutional third-party capital and touch on the positive senior housing operating trends that continue into October. \u2047 Our enterprise continues to benefit significantly from our steady commitment over decades and various cycles to asset class operator and geographical diversification. \u2047 We aim to generate reliable growing cash flows from a high-quality diverse portfolio of assets on a strong balance sheet. \u2047 We've seen that staying disciplined about diversification has protected the downside and also provided myriad opportunities for our stakeholders. \u2047 The current environment is certainly proving out the merits of this strategy. \u2047 First, our diversified portfolio is enabling the company to remain strong and stable, despite the disruption occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected our different asset classes and geographies in non-correlated way. \u2047 Our medical office, research and innovation business and our healthcare triple-net lease business now represents over half of our enterprise. \u2047 During the quarter, these asset classes have continued to perform well and led our third quarter performance, enabling us to deliver $0.75 of normalized FFO per share. \u2047 Second, our diversified asset base with five verticals has given us the ability to continue successfully allocating capital over time and through cycles. \u2047 For example, following this spinoff of our skilled nursing business, we invested in high quality health systems with[Indecipherable], which is currently performing very well as hospitals have asserted essentiality to the healthcare delivery systems in the U.S. Also, just as we did when we allocated capital to the medical office building business a decade earlier, in 2016, we entered the research and innovation business, and we have found significant opportunities to drive that business forward since then, through both ground up development and asset acquisitions. \u2047 The addition of life sciences to our enterprise has provided uplift to our results, our investment activity and our enterprise value. \u2047 Two recent examples of the benefit of our diversified strategy include our investment in a $1 billion Class A Trophy Life Science Portfolio located in the Premier South San Francisco Life Science Cluster at a forward cap rate of 5% on cash NOI. \u2047 The tenant base is a nice mix of public companies and a diverse group of early to mid-stage life science company. \u2047 The South San Francisco market consistently ranks as one of the elite life science clusters. \u2047 Spurred by record capital flows into the life science sector, this market has less than 2% lab vacancy, unparalleled access to a large concentration of life science firms and an extensive venture capital network going after the world class talent pool. \u2047 We also recently recommenced construction on a 400,000 square foot state-of-the-art Life Sciences project known as One UCity in this thriving research sub market of Philadelphia, bookended by 10 and Drexel. \u2047 This project is designed to be LEED certified and total estimated project costs are over $280 million. \u2047 Similarly, we've invested on a geographically diversified basis with over 30% of our shop portfolio now in Canada. \u2047 Last year, we acquired the high-quality Le Groupe Maurice portfolio in Quebec. \u2047 Building on the strong performance LGM has delivered and its history of successfully developing and leasing up senior communities for vibrant older adults. \u2047 We are also investing nearly $420 million in ground up development of new consumer focused senior living communities, which are well under way. \u2047 We do see areas where we can recycle capital too. \u2047 We have recently sold or placed under contract certain portfolios of senior living assets that are not long-term holds for us. \u2047 We want to continue making senior housing a key part of our diversified portfolio because of the operational asset class upside post-pandemic, the demographically driven demand that is in front of us and the continued improvement on the supply side. \u2047 There remains a strong bid from private capital for senior living, which supports our conclusion. \u2047 On the other side of the ledger, through our growing third-party institutional Capital Management Platform, we also continue to diversify our capital sources, augment our investment capacity, expand our footprint, leverage our team and industry expertise and improve our financial flexibility and liquidity, all of which are positive for our public shareholders. \u2047 Having additional partners and tools to use at appropriate times and for customized situations, provides a significant competitive advantage for Ventas and as an incremental source of earnings. \u2047 We already have over $3 billion in assets under management in our institutional third-party capital management platform. \u2047 These forms include our successful open-end funds, launched in March of this year, that has already grown to nearly $2 billion and 2 million square feet in assets under management. \u2047 Following the South San Francisco Life Sciences portfolio closing, when we raised over 600 million of discretionary new equity, our fund exceeds $1 billion in equity capital, and continues to have additional committed capital to accommodate new investments. \u2047 We've also today announced a new joint venture with GIC, one of the most respected global real estate investors. \u2047 This joint venture covers four research and innovation development projects currently in progress with approximately 930 million in estimated project costs. \u2047 Our joint venture with GIC may be expanded to over $2 billion with other pre-identified future R&I development projects currently in our pipeline if they go forward. \u2047 While maintaining a majority interest in all these projects and receiving market-based compensation, our GIC joint venture enables us to align with a strategic partner, improve our liquidity and financial profile and accelerate our research and innovation development pipeline, including the recent construction commencement of the One UCity project in Philadelphia. \u2047 The success of our open-end fund and the GIC partnership demonstrates a tremendous market opportunity within life science, medical office and senior housing real estate Also they are a testament to Ventas's excellent team and investment track record. \u2047 Turning to the year-end now, I'd like to provide some key observations about our U.S. senior housing operating portfolio. \u2047 Importantly, in the third quarter, our operators continued to build on the improving trend that began in the second quarter. \u2047 Our communities demonstrated sustained increases in leads and movements, which continued through October. \u2047 While we are sober and clear eyed about the recent increase in COVID-19 cases nationally, to a record level of nearly 120,000 confirmed cases today, we believe in the strength of the senior living business as we look toward the post-pandemic environment. \u2047 We are also appreciative that HHS has recognized the crucial role senior living plays in protecting vulnerable older Americans. \u2047 HHS has allocated CARES Act funding to the assisted living community to partially mitigate the losses directly suffered because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Finally, we are encouraged by the progress being made by scientists and doctors on vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. \u2047 Older Americans, including our residents, will be prioritized for vaccine distribution slated just behind first responders and frontline healthcare providers. \u2047 Most of our operators have already registered with pharmacy distribution sources to administer the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it becomes available. \u2047 An effective, widely distributed vaccine will further improve conditions for a senior housing recovery. \u2047 We are glad that we have significant embedded exposure to that upside in our diversified portfolio. \u2047 Today, we published our corporate sustainability report that showcases our long-standing commitment to and leadership in ESG. \u2047 Among other things, this report discloses our new environmental goals are consistent and growing investments in sustainability improvements in our portfolio, and our principles and practice, which is a series of case studies showing our actions on health and safety and COVID-19 describing our emergency preparedness, and demonstrating our customized framework to achieve greater gender and racial equality and social justice. \u2047 In closing, let me reiterate that the long-term demographically driven thesis for healthcare real estate and for Ventas remains in place. \u2047 I'm incredibly proud of our Ventas team. \u2047 Our consistency and cohesion are great assets for all our stakeholders. \u2047 All of us at Ventas have an abiding commitment to stay strong and stable and win the recovery. \u2047 I'll start by mentioning the encouraging trends we continue to see in our shop portfolio. \u2047 We are pleased to have had our first net positive move in month since the start of the pandemic in October and a majority of our portfolios delivering move ins at levels that are equal to or more than typical levels across the U.S. and Canada. \u2047 The underlying demand for need driven senior housing in the U.S. and independent living services in Canada persists. \u2047 While we are encouraged about these positive trends, we're mindful that the pandemic causes ongoing uncertainty and choppy waters in the senior housing business. \u2047 I will also add that in spite of the near-term pressure on the sector, we remain committed to the senior housing business and excited about the supportive underlying supply demand fundamentals that should persist for years to come. \u2047 Now I will review our third quarter senior housing results in the shop and triple-net portfolio and follow that up with some comments on our latest trends and outlook. \u2047 First up, the shop, for the quarter, shop results were in line with the company's expectations. \u2047 Our 395 assets sequential same-store pool comprising over 90% of our shop NOI, posted cash NOI of 109 million which is effectively flat versus the second quarter. \u2047 Average occupancy was 130 basis points lower sequentially with improving trends inter quarter while RevPOR declined 30 basis points and grew 50 basis points in our U.S. and Canadian operating portfolios respectively. \u2047 Leading indicators such as leads and movements also saw a consistent and positive trend intra quarter, both in absolute numbers and relative to prior year, highlighting the resilient demand for senior housing. \u2047 In September leads and move-ins were 85% and 94%, respectively, as compared to the prior year. \u2047 Third quarter revenue declined 3.6% which was offset entirely by 4.5%, lower operating expenses sequentially, primarily driven by lower COVID related expenses. \u2047 As a reminder, all COVID-19 impacts including elevated testing, labor, cleaning and supplies costs have been reflected in property operating results. \u2047 As with last quarter, I'll highlight our Canadian portfolio, which represents 33% of our shop portfolio and demonstrates the benefits of our diversification and a well-orchestrated public health response. \u2047 The 72 communities within our sequential Q3 same-store pool, including our LGM investment was 93.2% occupied, which compares to an average of 93.7% for the second quarter, outperform in the U.S. on an absolute and relative basis. \u2047 Same-store cash NOI on a sequential basis grew in Canada by over 10%. \u2047 Moving on to our triple-net senior housing portfolio, in the third quarter and through October Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. \u2047 Our underlying triple-net senior housing portfolio performance continues to be impacted by COVID-19, which we have been collaboratively addressing with our tenant partners. \u2047 As a result of our proactive steps to improve coverage through mutually beneficial arrangements with Capital Senior, Holiday, Brookdale and other smaller tenants, our trailing 12 months cash flow coverage for senior housing is 1.4x. \u2047 We also expect triple-net senior housing tenants will receive CARES Act funding, which will be a positive development. \u2047 Now I'll address recent trends. \u2047 As described earlier, demand characteristics supporting senior housing remain solid and leads and move-ins continue to improve since the low point in April and month-over-month in the third quarter. \u2047 These trends persisted into October as we experienced net positive move-ins helped in part by selective move in incentives. \u2047 Our operators successful execution of screening, protecting and testing protocols has been supporting a living environment that's more open and more robust than earlier in the pandemic. \u2047 Currently, 96% of our communities are accepting move-ins. \u2047 Moving on to our clinical results. \u2047 As a result of the diligent efforts of our operators executing, testing and preventative protocols new resident COVID-19 cases more than 75% better than the peak seen in April, in spite of broader market trends of increased new infection rates among the U.S. general public. \u2047 In regards to the Q4 outlook for shop, due to the uncertain environment, it is too hard to predict. \u2047 However, we would expect occupancy to soften and we would expect expenses to be relatively flat at the current elevated levels as the health and safety of the residents and frontline caregivers is the biggest priority. \u2047 In summary, we are encouraged by the continued improvement and leading indicators through the third quarter and October and we remain committed to the senior housing business moving forward. \u2047 We are proud of our operators' efforts in the third quarter to successfully execute COVID-19 related protocols while focusing on the health and safety of frontline caregivers and residents. \u2047 With that, I'll hand the call to Pete. \u2047 I'll cover the office segment third quarter results and trends. \u2047 Our office segment which now represents over 30% of Ventas' NOI continues to produce strong results and show its value proposition and financial strength and missed the pandemic. \u2047 MOBs and research and innovation centers, the two lines of business within our office portfolio play a key role in the delivery of crucial healthcare services and research for life saving vaccines and therapeutics. \u2047 The Office portfolio continued to provide steady growth delivering 126 million of same-store cash NOI in the third quarter. \u2047 This represents a 40 basis points of sequential growth. \u2047 You will note that the same-store cash NOI declined 2.2% year-on-year for the third quarter. \u2047 However, we lapped a large $4.7 million termination fee in the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 normalizing for this fee. \u2047 The same-store cash NOI grew 1.5% from the prior year normalizing for the paid parking shortfall and increased cleaning costs due to COVID, same-store cash NOI grew by 2.8%. \u2047 In terms of rent receipts, office tenants paid an industry leading 99% of contractual rents in the third quarter in line with the second quarter. \u2047 This is without D docs for deferrals, which were de minimis. \u2047 Substantially all granted second quarter deferrals that came due have been repaid and new granted, deferrals were negligible. \u2047 As of November 6, our tenants have paid more than 99% of October contractual rents. \u2047 Receiving 99% of total rent without D docs is a direct reflection of the quality of our tenants and the quality of our buildings. \u2047 The solid result underscores the durability and quality of our tenant base. \u2047 Remember 88% of MOB NOI is from investment grade tenants"], "gold_summary": ["ventas
