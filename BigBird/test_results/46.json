{"article": ["We started this year off on a positive note, and we're excited about our momentum. \u2047 We took share in the contact lens market with strength in our silicone hydrogel portfolio led by MyDay and Biofinity. \u2047 Our myopia management portfolio continued to strengthen, including MiSight growing 82% to 3 million and CooperSurgical posted a very strong quarter with Paragard growing 16% and fertility 10%. \u2047 With both businesses outperforming, we delivered robust earnings and cash flow and expect continued strong performance moving forward. \u2047 Regarding the quarter and reporting all percentages on a constant currency basis, even with continuing COVID challenges, we posted consolidated revenues of 681 million with CooperVision revenues of 507 million, up 1%, and CooperSurgical revenues of 174 million, up 7%. \u2047 Non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.17. \u2047 For CooperVision, we saw strength in our daily silicone hydrogel portfolio and in our Biofinity franchise, along with general strength in torics and multifocals. \u2047 By geography, the Americas grew 6% led by strength in Biofinity and daily silicones, including nice growth from both Clariti and MyDay. \u2047 EMEA was down 4% as several countries continued managing through stringent COVID-related restrictions. \u2047 We did see growth in our daily silicones and Biofinity, though, so that bodes well for the future. \u2047 Asia Pac was up 3% led by strength in MyDay, especially in Japan. \u2047 Overall, sales exceeded expectations, and we're well positioned to continue growing and taking share with current and future product launches driving momentum. \u2047 Moving to some additional quarterly numbers. \u2047 Our silicone hydrogel dailies grew 8% with both MyDay and Clariti growing. \u2047 Particular strength was noted in MyDay and especially MyDay toric as we continue rolling that product out around the world. \u2047 Overall, dailies silicones are leading the market right now as health and wellness trends drive adoption, and we believe that will continue as there's still 2.4 billion in annual global sales of older hydrogels that need to be traded up. \u2047 Moving to our FRP portfolio. \u2047 Biofinity grew 6% with strike noted in Biofinity Energys and Biofinity toric multifocal. \u2047 I've mentioned these products before, but as a reminder, Energys is a truly unique and innovative lens that uses digital zone optics to help alleviate eye fatigue from excessive screen time. \u2047 In today's world, this product has the ability to perform well, and we're seeing that. \u2047 And our Biofinity toric multifocal was launched last year and is doing extremely well. \u2047 This is a made-to-order product and part of our extensive offering of unique products that differentiate our business. \u2047 Regarding product launches, we remain incredibly active. \u2047 We now have regulatory approval to launch Clariti in Japan, and we'll be doing that shortly. \u2047 And that's in addition to our ongoing successful launch of a second base curve for MyDay sphere in that market. \u2047 We're also continuing to launch and relaunch MyDay sphere and toric in many other markets around the world. \u2047 We're continuing the rollout of Biofinity toric multifocal, including launching in Europe shortly, and we're rolling out extended toric ranges for Clariti and Biofinity. \u2047 Additionally, our pipeline is strong, and we expect to remain very active going forward. \u2047 And lastly, we're incredibly busy with our myopia management portfolio of MiSight and Ortho-k lenses, which grew 46% for the quarter to 12 million. \u2047 Within this, MiSight grew 82% to 3 million and Ortho-k grew 37%, including 1 million of revenue from our acquisition of GP Specialists from August of last year. \u2047 With respect to MiSight, we now have over 30,000 kids around the world wearing the lens, including over 2,000 in the U.S., and our momentum is accelerating. \u2047 Our launch activity continues to go extremely well, and we expect similar success in new markets such as South Korea where we'll be launching in the next few months. \u2047 We've also made advancements in discussions with several large retailers and buying groups regarding MiSight and even moved into a test phase with one large retailer for roughly 70 stores. \u2047 We've also received several awards recently, including from Contact Lens Spectrum and Popular Science, and we're making advancements with multiple professional associations, helping to get myopia management recognize the standard of care. \u2047 And we made great progress with several universities, supporting the training and education of their optometry students as many schools are now adding myopia management training courses to their curriculums. \u2047 From a fitting perspective, if we look at U.S. data, the average age for a new MiSight wear remains 11 years old, and in a positive sign, it's trending younger. \u2047 Comparing this to the average age of a regular new contact lens wear of 17 shows we're bringing kids into contacts at a much younger age, which is fantastic. \u2047 This is all extremely exciting and supports our goal of reaching or exceeding 25 million of MiSight sales this fiscal year and over 50 million next year. \u2047 Moving to myopia management spectacles, I want to touch on our recent acquisition of SightGlass Vision and our partnership with EssilorLuxottica. \u2047 SightGlass Vision has developed innovative spectacles to reduce the progression of myopia in children, and our joint venture with EssilorLuxottica will leverage our shared expertise and global leadership in myopia management to accelerate the commercialization of these spectacles around the world. \u2047 We're now working through the typical regulatory requirements to form the JV, and we started developing launch plans in certain markets as we await the two-year clinical data, which will be out in the next couple of months. \u2047 The SightGlass technology is a great complement to our existing myopia management portfolio of contact lenses. \u2047 And working with a great partner like EssilorLuxottica will accelerate growth of the entire pediatric vision marketplace. \u2047 More to follow on this exciting opportunity as we continue making progress. \u2047 To wrap up on myopia management, we're at the forefront of an extremely exciting global pediatric opportunity. \u2047 This market is in its infancy, but the growth is exciting, and having the only FDA-approved product in MiSight has been a game-changer. \u2047 We're continuing to invest in sales and marketing programs and new launches, regulatory approvals and R&D to keep driving adoption on a global basis. \u2047 Proactively addressing the progression of myopia in pediatric patients offers immediate visual correction, along with many long-term health benefits, such as reducing the risk of serious eye disease later in life, such as retinal detachment, cataracts and glaucoma. \u2047 So, this effort is important, and it's why so many eye care professionals are getting involved and strongly supporting this activity. \u2047 To conclude on vision, let me add that the continuing rollout of vaccines will definitely benefit us given the consumer nature of our business. \u2047 In the near term, we expect better foot traffic in retail outlets, especially malls, along with increasing service capacity and better staffing attendance in optometry offices. \u2047 We also expect a strong back-to-school season as in-person learning returns around the world. \u2047 On a longer-term basis, our growth drivers remain strong and are likely improving with the macro trend of people spending more time on electronic devices. \u2047 It's estimated that roughly one-third of the world is currently myopic, and that's expected to increase to 50% by 2050. \u2047 Combining this trend with a continuing shift to daily silicones, geographic expansion and growth in torics and multifocals, our industry has a very bright future. \u2047 For CooperVision, our robust product portfolio, active product launch activity, momentum with myopia management and strong new fit data puts us in a great position for long-term sustainable growth. \u2047 We had a very strong quarter led by Paragard and fertility. \u2047 Overall revenues were 174 million, up a healthy 7% as markets rebounded and we took share. \u2047 I'm really excited about the state of CooperSurgical right now under the fantastic leadership of Holly and our team, and the future looks extremely bright. \u2047 Revenues grew 10% year over year to 70 million with strikes seen around the world and throughout our product portfolio. \u2047 We're taking share, and we're well positioned for future gains with improving traction in our key accounts. \u2047 One of the strengths of our fertility business is our broad product portfolio, which essentially covers the full spectrum of fertility clinics' needs outside of pharma products. \u2047 We've done a great job cross-selling and building relationships with the larger clinics around the world, and this has resulted in solid growth in areas ranging from consumable products like pipettes, media and RI Witness, our RFID lab-based management system that I discussed last quarter, to equipment such as incubators and workstations to genetic testing. \u2047 From a market perspective, COVID is still negatively impacting patient flow, and some important countries like India are still significantly hampered, but we're definitely seeing a pickup in activity. \u2047 In the meantime, we're taking market share, and we expect that to continue. \u2047 Overall, the fertility market has extremely positive long-term macro growth trends, and we're well positioned to capitalize on these trends to drive growth. \u2047 Within our office and surgical unit, we were up 5% led by Paragard's growth of 16%. \u2047 As the only 100% hormone-free IUD in the U.S. market, the product offers a fantastic, long-lasting birth control option that addresses the needs and interest of women looking for a healthy alternative. \u2047 We're very bullish on Paragard right now and believe we'll continue posting solid growth this year. \u2047 Elsewhere, we've seen deferred elective procedures steadily rescheduled, and our medical device sales have improved. \u2047 Several of our focus products grew in the quarter, including Endosee Advance, our direct visualization system for evaluation of the endometrial, INSORB, our patented surgical skin closure device, and our portfolio of uterine manipulators. \u2047 We made great progress over the past several years, and we have a lot of exciting things happening today. \u2047 We just completed an ESG materiality assessment to ensure we stay focused on the right areas, and my passion and commitment to this type of work remains very strong. \u2047 If anyone has any questions or interest in our ESG efforts, please reach out and let's connect. \u2047 Our fourth-quarter consolidated revenues increased 5% year over year, or 3% in constant currency to $681 million. \u2047 Consolidated gross margin increased 50 basis points year over year to 67.8%. \u2047 This improvement was driven by strength in CooperSurgical with higher-margin Paragard and fertility consumable products performing extremely well, along with favorable currency. \u2047 Moving forward, we're in excellent shape to continue delivering solid gross margins. \u2047 We completed our manufacturing restructuring activity in Q1, so we're well positioned for the current environment, along with being ready to efficiently ramp up quickly as demand continues to rebound. \u2047 We still have absorption-related inefficiencies, but we expect those to go away with sales growth. \u2047 Opex was up only 2.1% year over year as we kept expenses under control. \u2047 This resulted in consolidated operating margins of 26.9%, up nicely from 25% last year. \u2047 This performance exceeded expectations, and we expect to continue posting strong results, balancing expense control against investment opportunities that we see within our business, particularly within myopia management. \u2047 Interest expense for the quarter was $6.4 million driven by lower rates and lower average debt, and the effective tax rate was 11.3%. \u2047 Non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.17 with roughly 49.7 million average shares outstanding. \u2047 Free cash flow was solid at $92 million comprised of $148 million of operating cash flow, offset by $56 million of capex. \u2047 Net debt increased slightly to $1.7 billion, while our adjusted leverage ratio decreased to 2.1 times with improving EBITDA. \u2047 And finally, we repurchased $25 million worth of stock this past quarter at an average price of $357 per share. \u2047 In addition to our strong operational performance, we completed several tuck-in acquisitions recently. \u2047 During the quarter, we acquired Embryo Options to add a cryo storage software solution to our fertility portfolio, allowing clinics to automate the management of cryopreserved embryos, eggs and sperm. \u2047 The business did $4.7 million in sales last year and added $500,000 in revenue in our Q1. \u2047 Within CooperVision, as Al mentioned, we acquired the remaining 80% stake of SightGlass Vision in January for $41 million in cash plus aggregate potential earn-outs of up to $139 million based on revenue milestones and regulatory approvals. \u2047 After the close of the quarter, we entered into an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture with EssilorLuxottica that we hope to close soon. \u2047 Also subsequent to quarter end, we closed two more tuck-in deals at CooperSurgical. \u2047 The first was the GA Medical, a pre-revenue manufacturer of an in-office water vapor ablation system that will launch shortly, and Safe Obstetric Systems, owner of Fetal Pillow, a balloon device used during c-sections to make the delivery less traumatic for the mother and baby. \u2047 The business did $4.4 million in sales last year. \u2047 And we repurchased -- I'm sorry, we purchased it for $52 million in cash plus a potential earn-out of up to $14 million. \u2047 This is directly tied to the tax item I discussed last quarter where CooperVision's intellectual property and related assets were transferred to the U.K. in November 2020. \u2047 For non-GAAP purposes, we adjusted for this activity and will continue doing so moving forward. \u2047 We continue to monitor and evaluate the scope, duration and impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. \u2047 While we still view resurgences as a significant risk factor, our visibility has improved. \u2047 So, we're now providing full-year 2021 guidance to provide a better feel for our expected upcoming performance, including our anticipated myopia management investments. \u2047 The guidance includes consolidated revenues of 2.8 to 2.845 billion, up 15 to 17%, or up 12 to 14% in constant currency, with CooperVision revenues of 2.090 to 2.120 billion, up 13 to 15%, or up 9 to 11% and in constant currency, and CooperSurgical revenues of 710 to 725 million, up 21 to"], "gold_summary": ["q1 non-gaap earnings per
