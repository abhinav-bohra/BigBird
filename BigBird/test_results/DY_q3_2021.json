{"article": ["These are important to review and contemplate. \u2047 As everyone on the call today is well aware, business environment uncertainty remains heightened due to duration and impact of COVID-19. \u2047 These impacts include an uncertain shut down timeframe for many areas of our economy, ongoing changes to consumer purchasing habits, the potential for a disrupted supply chain, heightened unemployment and many other economic factors. \u2047 This means the results could change at any time, and the forecasted impact of risk considerations is a best estimate based on the information available as of today's date. \u2047 Additional information concerning risk factors and cautionary statements are available on our most recent SEC filings and the most recent Company 10-K. \u2047 I'll now hand it over to our CEO, Ron Lombardi. \u2047 Let's start on Slide 5. \u2047 Last quarter, we were experiencing the very early innings of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 At the time, we outlined several factors our organization began focusing on in real-time to adapt to the changing environment. \u2047 As a result of these actions, I'm pleased to report a solid Q1 earnings results and better than expected revenues. \u2047 This is a testament to our preparedness and the strategy that we outlined. \u2047 For starters, our long-term strategy continues to work. \u2047 Our mission to provide consumers brands they know and trust is unwavering. \u2047 Even with the challenging environment being experienced due to COVID-19, our consumers continue to turn to our leading brands to meet their healthcare needs. \u2047 Second, our robust continuity plans continue to have us well positioned to service our retail partners. \u2047 Our investments in selecting the right manufacturing partners and maintaining ample inventory has paid off in this tight supply environment. \u2047 Third, embracing our company culture of leadership, trust change and execution has paid off in a big way. \u2047 It's allowed us to be agile marketers, pivoting quickly to efforts that optimize our brands in this very unique environment. \u2047 The end result is that we are winning and growing channels like e-commerce and our portfolio continues to be well positioned for the long term. \u2047 And finally, our strong operating model and disciplined capital strategy continue to reward stakeholders. \u2047 Our strong Q1 free cash flow and industry-leading financial profile enabled further debt reduction in the quarter. \u2047 In summary, we are not sitting still. \u2047 We are learning from what is happening and adjusting our go-forward strategy in real time. \u2047 We are doing this through the guide of our proven three-pillar strategy, which remains intact. \u2047 It drives our long-term success, and Q1 was yet another example of it. \u2047 I'll now hand it over to Chris to review Q1 financial results. \u2047 Q1 revenue of $229.4 million declined 60 basis points on an organic basis versus the prior year, which excludes the effects of foreign currency. \u2047 By segment, in North America, revenues were essentially flat, positively impacted by the Women's Health, Oral Care, and Skin categories, but offset by lower Cough and Cold, Eye & Ear Care, and GI shipments, as categories we participate in faced declines in incidence levels and usage rates related to COVID-19. \u2047 Our International business declined in the high single digits after excluding foreign currency. \u2047 This decline was attributable to both a difficult comparison in the prior year for a number of products as well as significantly lower sales of Hydralyte in Australia, as a result of COVID-19's impact to lowering both general consumer illness and activities such as athletics. \u2047 EBITDA and earnings per share for the first quarter grew 12% and 32% respectively versus the prior year. \u2047 Solid earnings per share growth was attributable to positive contributions across our operating expense line as well as lower interest expense and share count from our strong free cash flow and strategic capital allocation. \u2047 As I mentioned on the prior slide, first quarter fiscal '21 revenue decreased 60 basis points versus the prior year, excluding the effects of foreign currency. \u2047 Consumption declined just over 4%. \u2047 This was better than we had anticipated back in early May, driven by strong e-commerce growth as consumers continued to shift to online purchasing. \u2047 That said, we continue to experience consumption declines in certain categories as a result of COVID-19. \u2047 As expected, these consumption declines were partially offset by inventory replenishment efforts as retailers refilled their supply following strong March consumer demand. \u2047 Total company gross margin of 58.4% increased 70 basis points versus prior year's first quarter. \u2047 We experienced early benefits from the transition to our new third-party logistics provider that was completed at the end of fiscal '20, which offset negative product mix. \u2047 For Q2, we anticipate a gross margin of approximately 58%. \u2047 Advertising and marketing came in at 12.1% of revenue, down in dollars versus the prior year as expected, as we eliminated ineffective spending during the unique pandemic environment. \u2047 For the second quarter, we anticipate a more normalized rate of A&M spend of approximately 15%. \u2047 Please note, this line item was previously shown as A&P or Advertising & Promotion but has been relabeled to Advertising & Marketing to better reflect the nature of our long-term brand building expenses. \u2047 There have been no changes to what we are included in the numbers. \u2047 Our G&A spend for first quarter fiscal '21 was approximately $20 million or just under 9% of revenue, down from the prior year, owing to disciplined cost management and lower costs resulting from the current environment. \u2047 For Q2, we anticipate G&A expense of approximately $21 million. \u2047 Left, as stated on the prior page, earnings per share grew approximately 32% versus the prior year. \u2047 Lower operating costs, lower interest expense and lower share count were all factors to growth. \u2047 For Q2, we expect interest expense to approximate $21 million and a corporate tax rate of around 25%. \u2047 In the first quarter, we generated $72.6 million in free cash flow, which represent over 40% growth versus the prior year, driven in part by the timing associated with strong retailer reorders placed in April, following the March consumption spike. \u2047 For Q2, we would anticipate free cash flow below the prior year as we invest in capex of approximately $10 million. \u2047 Despite this, total free cash flow for the first half of fiscal '21 is expected to exceed that of the prior year. \u2047 In the first quarter, we continued to focus on debt reduction and paid down $111 million in debt. \u2047 At June quarter-end, we had approximately $1.6 billion in net debt, which equated to a leverage ratio of 4.4 times. \u2047 We expect to continue to prioritize debt pay down as our primary use of free cash flow. \u2047 Lastly, we would like to remind investors of our continued focus on liquidity in the current environment. \u2047 We ended the quarter with over $50 million in cash on hand with ample access to our revolving credit line of well over $100 million. \u2047 As I touched on earlier, despite the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, we are pleased with the plan we implemented and our results in Q1 performance to-date. \u2047 There are a number of important factors shown here, each of which underpin the financial results Chris just touched on. \u2047 We continue to prioritize putting our employee's safety first through various proactive measures. \u2047 We have numerous manufacturing partners which are all operating in a similar capacity. \u2047 All of these employees are the enablers to our success. \u2047 In the middle of the slide is our supply chain. \u2047 We've continued to work with our third-party partners closely on continuity of supply. \u2047 Although dynamic, we continue to avoid any material out-of-stock positions at retail. \u2047 The results of this is continued and reliable inventory supply and engaged workforce and committed partners, enabling us to maintain superior service levels with our retail partners. \u2047 In doing so, we have set ourselves up for both short- and- long-term success. \u2047 Investing in our leading portfolio of brands remains the number one principal in our three-pillar strategy. \u2047 Our leading brands have heritage in connections with consumers. \u2047 We are also diversified, which positions us well to navigate the impact of COVID-19, as we realized in Q1. \u2047 We continually invest in our key brands over the long-term through a wide-ranging brand building toolkit. \u2047 Critically, it features various efforts which differentiates us from other brands and private label. \u2047 This playbook has not changed. \u2047 What has changed, as outlined last quarter, is where consumers are shopping as well as which categories they are using with frequency. \u2047 This is truly a unique attribute of the COVID-19 pandemic versus prior recessions. \u2047 This impacts all of our brands in unique ways. \u2047 Just over one quarter into this new landscape, we are learning and adapting to the changes it brings for each of our brands in real time. \u2047 Where we've experienced the largest opportunities, at the right end of the spectrum, is from channel shifting into e-commerce. \u2047 Our early investments in this channel had us well positioned to capture growth as consumers transitioned to digital shopping during the pandemic. \u2047 The second opportunity our portfolio is experiencing is consumer focus on self-care at home. \u2047 Examples here include avoiding a doctor's visit and increasing focus on everyday hygiene and wellness. \u2047 Each of these factors are benefiting many of our brands shown toward the right of the slide. \u2047 We'll discuss a few of these in greater detail later on. \u2047 Towards the left, we highlight some challenges we are navigating due to COVID-19. \u2047 Many activities remain at suppressed levels including time spent outdoor, travel and sports activities. \u2047 Furthermore, less time spent with people means less overall illness, which is impacting certain brands such as Hydralyte, during Australia's winter season. \u2047 We've also seen reduced convenience channel traffic temporarily impact incremental to-go purchases like Clear Eyes Pocket Pal and powdered analgesics. \u2047 Despite these category challenges our brands maintain leading positions and many have actually expanded share in the impacted categories. \u2047 An example here is mix. \u2047 As the head lice category is currently declining due to children not in school or attending summer camps, our brand has expanded share through our ongoing brand building efforts. \u2047 With a wide range of impacts, it remains critical that we continually adapt to the changing conditions. \u2047 We are doing just that by allocating investments to the opportunities we have identified here. \u2047 As seen on the previous slide, our diverse portfolio positions us to do well even in this challenging environment. \u2047 Our marketing efforts have moved rapidly to target the shifting needs of consumers and help us to connect with them in a pandemic world. \u2047 The page here shows just a few of the many new initiatives that kicked off recently. \u2047 On the left of the slide is Compound W. We are focused on expanding our leading position with Compound W by using marketing that reminds consumers of the ability to treat warts rapidly at home. \u2047 We believe this message and our brands efficacy is resonating with consumers, further expanding our number one market position. \u2047 In the middle of the page is Clear Eyes. \u2047 We've had several new messages from the brand since the pandemic began. \u2047 Most recently, we are activating digital efforts focused on at-home usage and the feel-good benefit of having Clear Eyes for video calls. \u2047 The results are positive. \u2047 We're seeing higher than average click-through rates on Google and our brand remains as resilient as ever. \u2047 The last example we have here is BC and Goody's. \u2047 These brands, which are concentrated in the Southeast, historically focused marketing efforts in sponsorship activities like Southern League Baseball and NASCAR. \u2047 With these events abbreviated or temporarily suspended, we reallocated our spending into various digital opportunities. \u2047 Two examples shown here are a refresh of our web pages and marketing of new products like the recently launched Goody's Hangover. \u2047 In summary, we are quickly identifying opportunities like the ones discussed here through consumer insights. \u2047 From there, our nimble marketing strategy looks to address the shifting consumer habits. \u2047 It's all part of our brand-building playbook that is built for long-term success. \u2047 Investments in e-commerce has meaningfully paid off as we were able to successfully engage and transact with consumers as their spending patterns shifted online. \u2047 These investments began several years ago as we invested in digital content and bringing external resources in-house. \u2047 E-commerce traffic continues to increase. \u2047 And as a result of these actions, we believe our market shares are actually above our average brick and mortar share in many categories. \u2047 Our established business is a leader in e-commerce consumer healthcare and poised to continue benefiting from the growing interest in the channel. \u2047 In Q1, consumers increased online purchasing with the goal for many to minimize person-to-person contact during the pandemic. \u2047 E-commerce grew triple digits and now accounts for over 10% of our total retail sales with no signs of slowing. \u2047 This growth is broad ranging across many major retail partners. \u2047 It also does not include omnichannel solutions like click-and-collect, which have also seen impressive growth. \u2047 But we aren't sitting still. \u2047 We continue to reallocate investments into this opportunity. \u2047 Our three largest brands in the e-commerce channel are shown on the right side of the slide. \u2047 Each of the brands, Summer's Eve, Monistat and DenTek have unique strategy that continued to build successful momentum for each in Q1. \u2047 For Summer's Eve, consumers are at home more than ever. \u2047 They are exercising at home as well. \u2047 We therefore refocused marketing efforts around home workouts and highlight our recently launched Summer Eve's active products. \u2047 For DenTek, we recently launched a Beyond Brushing campaign that reminds consumers the benefits of a broad oral healthcare routine. \u2047 Beyond Brushing remains consumers the benefits of flossing, dental guards and other medical devices for self-care. \u2047 It's early, but the campaign is resonating with consumers as they shop online and elsewhere. \u2047 Left, for Monistat, we're reminding home shopping consumers about quick and easy shipping to the home. \u2047 Effective advertising has successfully reminded consumers of Monistat's largely superior proposition to an in-person doctors visit. \u2047 As a result, we are seeing a doubling of visits to our monistat.com website. \u2047 As consumers research the category, these digital investments deepen the incidence association with Monistat, consistent with our long-term strategy. \u2047 In summary, by being early and actively investing in the e-commerce channel, our brands are winning. \u2047 As the pandemic shifts consumer preferences, this provides a great positioning for our brands to benefit. \u2047 By continuing to execute our proven strategy and focusing on our leading brands, we are well positioned to continue to weather the storm. \u2047 For the second quarter, we anticipate revenue of $225 million or more. \u2047 Within this outlook, we expect consumption to decline low- to-"], "gold_summary": ["q1 revenue $229.4 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $221.3 million.  \u2047  sees q2 earnings per share $0.70.  \u2047  sees q2 revenue $225 million."], "pred_summary": ["q1 revenue $229.4 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $229.4 million.  \u2047  q1 revenue $229.4 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $229.4 million."]}
