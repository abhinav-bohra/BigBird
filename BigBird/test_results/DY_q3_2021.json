{"article": ["Going to Slide 2. \u2047 Today, we have on the call, Drew DeFerrari, our Chief Financial Officer; and Ryan Urness, our General Counsel. \u2047 Now moving to Slide 4 and a review of our third quarter results. \u2047 As we review our results, please note that in our comments today and in the accompanying slides, we referenced certain non-GAAP measures. \u2047 We refer you to the quarterly report section of our website for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their corresponding GAAP measures. \u2047 We are living in truly unprecedented and trying times for our country. \u2047 I could not be prouder of our employees as they continue to serve our customers with real fortitude in difficult times. \u2047 Now for the quarter, revenue was $810.3 million, a decrease of 8.4%. \u2047 Organic revenue excluding $8.9 million of storm restoration services in the quarter declined 9.4%. \u2047 As we deployed 1 gigabit wireline networks, wireless/wireline converged networks and wireless networks, this quarter reflected an increase in demand from one of our top five customers. \u2047 Gross margins were 18.7% of revenue, reflecting solid overall performance, offset in part by the continued impacts of the complexity of a large customer program. \u2047 General and administrative expenses were 7.7% reflecting tight cost controls and all of these factors produced adjusted EBITDA of $92.8 million, or 11.5% of revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.06 compared to $0.88 in the year ago quarter. \u2047 Liquidity was strong as cash and availability under our credit facility was $587.1 million, this amount represents our highest level of liquidity ever. \u2047 Finally, we made significant progress in reducing net leverage as notional net debt declined $110 million during the quarter to $558.7 million, a reduction of over $467 million in just the last four quarters. \u2047 Now going to Slide 5. \u2047 Today, major industry participants are constructing or upgrading significant wireline networks across broad sections of the country. \u2047 These wireline networks are generally designed to provision 1 gigabit network speeds to individual consumers and businesses, either directly or wirelessly using 5G technologies. \u2047 Additional industry participants have recently stated their belief that a single high-capacity fiber network can most cost-effectively deliver services to both consumers and businesses, enabling multiple revenue streams from a single investment. \u2047 This view appears to be increasing the appetite for fiber deployments and we believe that the industry effort to deploy high capacity fiber networks continues to meaningfully broaden our set of opportunities as we look forward to calendar 2021. \u2047 Access to high capacity telecommunications has become increasingly crucial to society in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in rural America. \u2047 The FCC RDOF auction currently under way reflects the view of some that the needs of work from home, telemedicine, distance learning and other newly essential applications require dramatically increased rural network investment. \u2047 We are providing program management, planning, engineering and design, aerial, underground and wireless construction and fulfillment services for 1 gigabit deployments. \u2047 These services are being provided across the country in dozens of metropolitan areas to several customers, including customers with stated aspirations to initiate broad fiber deployments, as well as customers who appear to be contemplating the resumption of broad deployments and with whom current activity is increasing. \u2047 These deployments include networks consisting entirely of wired network elements as well as converged wireless/wireline multiuse networks. \u2047 Potential fiber network deployment opportunities are increasing in rural America as new industry participants respond to emerging societal incentives. \u2047 Our ability to provide integrated planning, engineering and design, procurement and construction and maintenance services is of particular value to several industry participants. \u2047 Near-term macroeconomic effects and uncertainty may influence some customer plans. \u2047 Customers continue to be focused on the possible macroeconomic effects of the pandemic on their business, with particular focus on small and medium business dislocations and overall consumer confidence and creditworthiness. \u2047 We see some uncertainty in the overall municipal environment as authorities continue to manage the general effects of the pandemic on permitting and inspection processes, and the impact of potential business limitations due to the recent nationwide increase in COVID-19 infections. \u2047 Overall, we remain confident that our scale and our financial strength position us well to deliver valuable service to our customers. \u2047 Moving to Slide 6. \u2047 Despite the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall economy, we performed well. \u2047 During the quarter, we experienced increased demand from one of our top five customers. \u2047 Organic revenue decreased 9.4%. \u2047 Our top five customers combined produced 71.6% of revenue, decreasing 15.4% organically, while all other customers increased 11.1% organically. \u2047 Verizon was our largest customer at 17.9% of total revenue or $144.8 million. \u2047 Revenue from Comcast was $143.6 million, or 17.7% of revenue. \u2047 Comcast was Dycom's second largest customer and grew 9% organically. \u2047 Lumen, formerly known as CenturyLink was our third largest customer at 16.6% of revenue or $134.4 million. \u2047 AT&T was our fourth largest customer at $118.9 million or 14.7% of revenue. \u2047 And finally, revenue from Windstream was $38.9 million or 4.8% of revenue. \u2047 Windstream was our fifth largest customer. \u2047 This is the seventh consecutive quarter where all of our other customers in aggregate, excluding the top five customers have grown organically. \u2047 Of note, fiber construction revenue from electric utilities exceeded $31 million in the quarter, approaching just less than 4% of total revenue. \u2047 We have extended our geographic reach and expanded our program management and network planning services. \u2047 In fact, over the last several years, we have meaningfully increased a long-term value of our maintenance and operations business, a trend which we believe will parallel our deployment of 1 gigabit wireline, direct and wireless/wireline converged networks as those deployments dramatically increase the amount of outside plant network that must be extended and maintained. \u2047 Now going to Slide 7. \u2047 Backlog at the end of the third quarter was $5.412 billion versus $6.441 billion at the end of the July 2020 quarter, declining approximately $1 billion. \u2047 Of this backlog, approximately $2.339 billion is expected to be completed in the next 12 months. \u2047 The decline in backlog largely reflects further communications during this quarter, regarding the reprioritization and rescoping of the components of a large program and our assessment of the expected pace of another component of the same program. \u2047 For AT&T, we were awarded maintenance service agreements in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and Florida. \u2047 Also from AT&T allocating services agreement for Georgia for Frontier Engineering and Construction Services project in New York and Rural Fiber Services agreements in Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Mississippi. \u2047 Headcount increased during the quarter to 14,154. \u2047 In addition, subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we executed contracts that resulted in our booking in excess of $740 million of backlog. \u2047 These bookings will be incorporated in our fourth quarter calculation. \u2047 Going to Slide 8. \u2047 Contract revenues for Q3 were $810.3 million and organic revenue declined 9.4% for the quarter. \u2047 Storm work performed in Q3 '21 was $8.9 million compared to none in Q3 '20. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $92.8 million, or 11.5% of revenue, reflecting 108 basis point improvement over Q3 '20. \u2047 Gross margins were at 18.7% in Q3 and increased 68 basis points from Q3 '20. \u2047 Compared to our expectations for the quarter, gross margins were approximately 100 basis points below the midpoint, this variance reflected impacts from customers whose capital expenditures were weighted toward the front half of the calendar year, including a large customer program, offset in part by improvements across the services performed for several of our top customers. \u2047 G&A expense improved 17 basis points compared to Q3 '20. \u2047 Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $1.06 in Q3 '21, compared to $0.88 in Q3 '20. \u2047 The increase resulted from higher adjusted EBITDA, lower depreciation and interest expense, and higher other income from asset sales, offset in part by higher income tax expense. \u2047 Now going to Slide 9. \u2047 Our balance sheet and financial position remains solid. \u2047 Over the past four quarters, we have reduced notional net debt by $467.4 million, included in this decline was a $110.1 million reduction in Q3 from solid free cash flow. \u2047 We ended the quarter with $12 million of cash and equivalents, $85 million of revolver borrowings, $427.5 million of term loans, and $58.3 million principal amount of convertible notes outstanding. \u2047 As of Q3, our liquidity was strong at $587.1 million. \u2047 Cash flows from operations were robust at $111.9 million, bringing our year-to-date operating cash flow to $279.4 million from prudent working capital management. \u2047 The combined DSOs of accounts receivable and net contract assets was at 127 days, which was in line with Q3 '20. \u2047 Capital expenditures were $3.5 million during Q3, net of disposal proceeds and gross capex was $9.4 million. \u2047 For the full fiscal year 2021, we expect net capex to range from $45 million to $55 million, which is a $15 million reduction from our prior outlook. \u2047 In summary, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and strong liquidity. \u2047 Going to Slide 10. \u2047 For Q4 2021, which includes an additional week of operations due to the company's 52 to 53-week fiscal year, the company expects modestly lower contract revenues with margins that range from in-line to modestly higher as compared to Q4 2020. \u2047 The company believes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on it's operating results, cash flows and financial condition is uncertain, unpredictable and could affect it's ability to achieve these expected financial results. \u2047 Moving to Slide 11. \u2047 Within a challenged economy, we experienced solid end market activity and capitalized on our significant strengths. \u2047 First and foremost, we maintained strong customer presence throughout our markets. \u2047 Our extensive market presence has allowed us to be at the forefront of evolving industry opportunities. \u2047 Fiber deployments enabling new wireless technologies are under way in many regions of the country. \u2047 Telephone companies are deploying fiber to the home to enable 1 gigabit high-speed connections. \u2047 Cable operators are deploying fiber to small and medium businesses and enterprises. \u2047 A portion of these deployments are in anticipation of the customer sales process. \u2047 Deployments to expand capacity as well as new build opportunities are under way. \u2047 Dramatically increased speeds to consumers are being provisioned and consumer data usage is growing, particularly upstream. \u2047 Customers are consolidating supply chains, creating opportunities for market share growth and increasing the long-term value of our maintenance and operations business. \u2047 In addition, we are increasingly providing integrated planning, engineering and design, procurement and construction and maintenance services for wired and converged wireless/wireline networks. \u2047 As our nation and industry continue to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain encouraged that our major customers are committed to multiyear capital spending initiatives. \u2047 We are confident in our strategies, the prospects for our company, the capabilities of our dedicated employees and the experience of our management team as we navigate challenging times. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted non-gaap earnings per share $1.06.  \u2047  qtrly contract revenue $810.3 million versus$884.1 million.  \u2047  dycom
