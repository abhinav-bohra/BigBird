{"article": ["These materials are available on the Ventas website at ir. \u2047 Let me start by saying that we believe the macro environment and the Ventas outlook have turned an important corner and that the worst of the pandemic is behind us. \u2047 You have no idea how good it feels to say those words, even though we recognize that significant uncertainty remains. \u2047 The whole Ventas team is actively engaged in taking steps to win the recovery for our stakeholders. \u2047 These steps include making smart portfolio and capital allocation decisions, capturing the embedded upside in our high-quality senior housing portfolio, focusing on operational excellence and initiatives, investing in value-creating development and acquisition opportunities across our demographically driven asset classes, attracting diverse, attractive capital, and maintaining financial strength and flexibility. \u2047 I also think it's important to reiterate our gratitude and optimism. \u2047 The widespread administration and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines have dramatically benefited the health and wellbeing of our senior residents and their caregivers, and also laid the foundation for sustained economic recovery. \u2047 Let me first address senior housing trends and results. \u2047 With respect to health and safety, I'm thrilled to report that our confirmed new resident cases in SHOP have fallen to literally a single person per day out of a resident population of 40,000. \u2047 And all our communities are now open to new move-ins and most have reintroduced expanded visitation and communal activities. \u2047 As a result, the natural, resilient and demographically based demand for senior living has revised, and we've reached the cyclical pandemic occupancy bottom in our SHOP portfolio in mid-March. \u2047 Since then, led by our U.S. SHOP community, which posted 280 basis points of growth, we grew SHOP spot occupancy 190 basis points through April 30th to nearly 78%. \u2047 Our Canadian SHOP portfolio, which has maintained occupancy of over 91%, tempered the full SHOP occupancy growth because Canadian clinical conditions and regulatory measures are currently lagging those in the U.S. \u2047 We do expect those to catch up over time. \u2047 Notably, for the whole portfolio, March and April were the first two consecutive months when SHOP move-ins exceeded both, pre-pandemic move-in levels and move-outs since the start of the pandemic. \u2047 In fact, move-ins during April at 1,880 totaled more move-ins in a single month than we've experienced at any time since June 2019. \u2047 While many of these positive trends began in the first quarter and therefore did not fully benefit first quarter results, we are also pleased with those results. \u2047 Our first quarter normalized FFO per share and SHOP performance came in ahead of our expectations. \u2047 And our SHOP occupancy gains were at or above those reported by other market participants to date. \u2047 The resilient and robust demand we are seeing for senior housing once again validates the need-based nature of our communities and the crucial role care providers play in facilitating longer, healthier lives for this portion of the nation's population, which is set to grow by over 2 million individuals over just the next few years. \u2047 Supply trends in senior housing are also highly favorable. \u2047 This combination of growing demographic demand and constrained supply creates a favorable backdrop for senior housing recovery, which represents an incredibly significant value-creation opportunity for our shareholders. \u2047 The high quality of our senior housing portfolio, as Justin will describe, makes us well-positioned to recapture NOI and realize this upside. \u2047 Turning to our capital allocation approach, we are confident of our ability to recycle about $1 billion through property dispositions in the second half of this year, and those are expected to enhance our enterprise. \u2047 On the investment side, our attractive life science, research and innovation business continues to provide us with value-creating opportunities to invest capital. \u2047 The Ventas portfolio, which now exceeds 9 million square feet, is located in three of the top five cluster markets and is affiliated with over 15 of the nation's top research universities. \u2047 We are also investing in our active and just delivered ground-up developments in life science, research and innovation, which totaled nearly $1 billion in project costs. \u2047 And I'm pleased to report that we also have another $1 billion in potential projects affiliated with major universities, right behind the four developments currently under way. \u2047 We look forward to sharing more information on our exciting development pipeline with you, later this year. \u2047 We recently expanded our life sciences business through our investment in a Class A portfolio of life science assets anchored by Johns Hopkins Medical, which we purchased at an attractive valuation of $600 per square foot. \u2047 Located in the fourth largest life science cluster in the U.S., Hopkins is a global leader in research and medicine and the number one recipient of government research funding. \u2047 This acquisition leverages our unique expertise at the intersection of universities, life sciences and academic medicine. \u2047 In addition, we continue to invest capital in senior housing with our partner, Le Groupe Maurice in Quebec. \u2047 LGM maintains a first-class brand, product and financial model for success. \u2047 Our two most recently completed high-end communities with LGM opened in the fourth quarter and have already achieved 87% occupancy. \u2047 We have three additional developments under way with LGM, representing nearly $300 million in aggregate project costs. \u2047 Looking at the broader investment market, deal volume is again trending toward normalized levels. \u2047 In a typical year, our deal team reviews over $30 billion in investment opportunities. \u2047 Our pipeline of potential investments across our asset classes is active and growing, and we are on our front foot from an external growth standpoint. \u2047 We have access to significant liquidity and a wide array of capital sources to fund deals. \u2047 Our investment philosophy continues to be focused on growing reliable cash flow and favorable risk-adjusted return, taking into account factors such as market position and trajectory of the asset and business, cost per square footer unit, downside protection and ultimate potential for cash flow growth and asset appreciation. \u2047 In closing, we believe we've turned an important corner. \u2047 And key metrics in our business are showing meaningful improvement. \u2047 The positive investment thesis for all of our demographically driven asset classes and for Ventas is pointing firmly positive. \u2047 As a team at Ventas, we're really happy about the strength and stability we've shown and the recent upswing in economic, clinical and operating environment. \u2047 We have an abiding commitment to win the recovery for all our stakeholders, and we are confident we're taking the right steps to do so. \u2047 I am very excited that senior housing recovery is under way. \u2047 As we've mentioned before, the lifestyle offering in our communities will be a leading indicator of performance. \u2047 Now that vaccines have been executed, activities are picking up again, communal dining is coming back and all of our communities are open to visitation from relatives, the underlying demand for our services should continue to strengthen. \u2047 As we have visited communities recently, the enthusiasm expressed by residents, their relatives and employees is compelling as communities are literally coming back to life again. \u2047 As Debbie noted, we are pleased with the improvement in leading indicators in occupancy as our move-in and move-out performance in March and April resulted in 266 and 363 net move-ins, respectively. \u2047 We expect occupancy improvements benefiting from a return to 2019 move-in levels, while at the same time, move-outs to be lower than 2019 levels due to lower current occupancy levels. \u2047 If we use the move-out rate as a percentage of the resident population from 2019 and apply that percentage to the current lower resident occupancy, the outcome is lower move-outs than pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 That, in combination with a 2019 move-in run rate, results in projected net positive occupancy gains. \u2047 I refer to this as the \"turn the lights on\" scenario, where we simply get the structural benefit from this netting effect. \u2047 Having said that, March and April, both performed well above this baseline, as we started to see a resurgence of high-converting lead sources, which include respites and personal referrals. \u2047 As these lead sources and professional referrals continue to recover, we could see move-in rates grow. \u2047 Moving on to macro drivers. \u2047 We remain optimistic on our long-term supply and demand outlook. \u2047 Construction starts continued to decelerate in the first quarter to the lowest level since the first quarter of 2011, and were down 77% from the peak in the fourth quarter of 2017. \u2047 Fewer starts should translate into materially lower deliveries in 2022 and 2023. \u2047 In addition, we expect strong demographic tailwinds to provide support for occupancy growth. \u2047 The 80-plus population is expected to grow 17% over the next five years, more than double the rate witnessed during the five-year recovery following the financial crisis. \u2047 I'll comment on our SHOP portfolio. \u2047 When I joined Ventas just over a year ago, one of my first priorities was to assess the overall quality of our portfolio. \u2047 Now that we are traveling again and visiting communities, I'm pleased to verify we benefit from a well-invested, highly diversified portfolio of market-leading senior housing communities with service offerings that range from an active adult, independent living, social assisted living, and assisted living and memory care. \u2047 We are well located in high-barrier markets that have substantial income and wealth demographics to support our offering. \u2047 Our three primary operators, Le Groupe Maurice, Sunrise and Atria, are each uniquely positioned to be competitive within their respective markets. \u2047 Collectively, they account for 90% of our SHOP NOI on a stabilized basis. \u2047 With these attributes of a high-quality portfolio in mind, moving forward, we are actively reviewing opportunities to optimize our portfolio through pruning, strategic capex investment, transitioning communities, new developments and pursuing new acquisitions to maintain our strong market position in senior housing. \u2047 Moving on to triple-net senior housing. \u2047 Given the proactive measures taken last year where we addressed a substantial portion of our portfolio and additionally paired with government subsidies and other tenant resources, our tenants continue to pay, as expected, in the first quarter and through April. \u2047 Ventas received all of its expected triple-net senior housing cash rent. \u2047 Our trailing 12 cash flow coverage for senior housing, which is reported one quarter in arrears, is 1.3 times and stable versus the prior quarter. \u2047 I'll summarize by expressing our enthusiasm around our strong leading indicators, high-quality portfolio of communities and operators. \u2047 I have a high confidence in our ability to compete in what should be a very exciting period of recovery for the senior housing sector. \u2047 With that, I'll hand the call to Pete. \u2047 I'll cover the office and healthcare triple-net segments. \u2047 Together, these segments represent over 50% of Ventas' NOI. \u2047 They continue to produce solid and reliable results. \u2047 First, I'll cover office. \u2047 The core office portfolio, ex parking, performed well. \u2047 Core office grew 1.7% year-on-year and 1.1% sequentially. \u2047 Those results were tempered by lower parking activity, which I'm pleased to say is materially increasing. \u2047 All-in, the office portfolio delivered $123 million of same-store cash NOI in the first quarter. \u2047 This represents an 80 basis-point reported sequential growth. \u2047 In terms of rent collections, our strong record continued during the quarter and into April. \u2047 This outstanding record is enabled by the mission-critical nature of our portfolio and our high-quality creditworthy tenancy. \u2047 In our medical office portfolio, 88% of our NOI comes from investment-grade rated tenants and HCA. \u2047 In our life sciences portfolio, 76% of our revenues come directly from investment-grade rated organizations and publicly traded companies. \u2047 All of our MOB properties are in elective surgery restriction-free locations and clinical activity and building utilization is rebounding. \u2047 A clinical rebound provides confidence to healthcare executives in making business decisions. \u2047 We're certainly seeing that on the real estate side. \u2047 As an example, we are finishing negotiations on a 10-year 160,000 square foot renewal with a 16,000 square foot expansion with a leading health system in the southeast. \u2047 We relocated and extended several hospital offices on a Midwestern campus to accommodate the addition of a 50,000 square foot healthcare-focused technical college. \u2047 The leases will commence in July, a win for the health system, the college and Ventas. \u2047 Medical office had record level retention of 91% for the first quarter and 86% for the trailing 12 months. \u2047 Driven by this retention, total office leasing was nearly 1 million square feet for the quarter. \u2047 This includes 160,000 square feet of new leasing. \u2047 The result is that MOB occupancy stayed essentially flat, down only 10 basis points for the quarter, both sequentially and year-on-year. \u2047 Previous actions to bolster leasing are clearly showing results. \u2047 In 2019, we hired a head of leasing. \u2047 In 2020, we hired a digital marketing lead. \u2047 In 2020, we redeployed 30% of our third-party brokers. \u2047 And in 2020, we increased the number of third-party brokers by 70% to impact the local coverage. \u2047 Our digital marketing program focused on local market awareness and virtual touring of vacant suites is fully in place and making a difference. \u2047 Average length of term for new leases was 7.3 years, 5 months higher than the 2019 average. \u2047 Renewal term length also exceeded 2019 averages. \u2047 Average escalators for new leasing was 2.7%, higher than our average in-place escalator of 2.4%. \u2047 All of this represents growing healthcare community confidence in the recovery. \u2047 I'd also like to highlight our pre-leasing construction initiative. \u2047 This is where we take a vacant suite where it is difficult to visualize this future potential and either demolish the in-place improvements to Core and Shell or complete a hospital standard physician suite in advance of leasing. \u2047 We've invested over $2 million in a pilot across 20 suites. \u2047 The results have been fantastic. \u2047 These projects have driven 20 basis points of occupancy and created a nearly 20% return on investment. \u2047 Because of these results, we intend to expand this program later this year. \u2047 We remain enthusiastic about the office business and particularly investment opportunities in the R&I space. \u2047 We continue to make progress on our recently announced $2 billion pipeline of development opportunities with Wexford. \u2047 We've publicly announced four projects in that pipeline, Arizona State University in Phoenix, which opened in the fourth quarter and is soon to be over 70% leased. \u2047 Drexel University College of Nursing in Philadelphia is 100% leased. \u2047 The project, in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh for immunotherapy is 70% preleased. \u2047 And our new development in the thriving City submarket of Philadelphia between Penn and Drexel is showing strong pre-leasing activity. \u2047 Since the acquisition of our South San Francisco life science trophy asset, we have"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports sees q2 adjusted ffo per share $0.69 excluding items.  \u2047  sees q2 adjusted ffo per share $0.69 excluding items.  \u2047  qtrly
