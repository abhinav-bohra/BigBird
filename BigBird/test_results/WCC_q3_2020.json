{"article": ["Information required by Regulation G of the Exchange act with respect to such non-GAAP financial measures can be obtained via WESCO's website at wesco.com. \u2047 Replays of this conference call will be archived and available for the next seven days. \u2047 I'd like to start out by saying on behalf of WESCO, I hope that all of you have been staying safe and healthy. \u2047 I'll start with the third quarter highlights, then I'll provide an introduction to our three new strategic business units. \u2047 And I'll be emphasizing their strong positioning to deliver above-market sales, margin and profit growth. \u2047 Dave will then take you through our third quarter results. \u2047 The excellent progress we're making on our second half commitments and synergy capture efforts and our increased synergy targets for the transformational combination of WESCO and Anixter. \u2047 So let's first start with an update on our business and third quarter results. \u2047 WESCO's new era is off to an absolutely exceptional start. \u2047 As our results exceeded our expectations across the board for sales, cost, margins, profit, EPS, free cash flow generation and reduced financial leverage. \u2047 This was our first full quarter of results after completing the acquisition of Anixter in June and clearly highlights the substantial value creation potential of this transformational combination. \u2047 Our management actions and strong execution were effective in this COVID-driven environment. \u2047 We expanded margins, reduced costs and grew profits, both sequentially and versus prior year. \u2047 Business momentum improved through the quarter as we took market share and built an all-time record third quarter backlog. \u2047 Our positive momentum has continued into the fourth quarter with October Workday adjusted sales down just 3% versus prior year and a book-to-bill ratio remaining above 1.0. \u2047 Free cash flow generation was exceptional at over 300% of net income and demonstrates our resilient business model and strength through the cycle. \u2047 Notably, net debt was reduced by $280 million, consistent with our capital allocation priorities. \u2047 More importantly, financial leverage was reduced to 4.8 times at the end of the third quarter, marking a reduction of about 1.5 turns over the four-month period since closing the Anixter acquisition. \u2047 Now turning to Anixter. \u2047 We accelerated our integration planning execution and synergy realization efforts and made outstanding progress in the third quarter. \u2047 The strong cultural alignment between WESCO and Anixter is proving to be a key driver in our initial success. \u2047 And as Dave will explain in more detail momentarily, just four months since closing the acquisition on June 22, we have already initiated actions that will deliver 100%, 100% of our year one cost synergy target of $68 million. \u2047 I could not be more pleased with the team's execution of our integration plan. \u2047 As a result, we are raising our year one, year two and year three cost synergy targets to $100 million, $180 million and $250 million, respectively. \u2047 Our initial integration progress gives us confidence that we will revisit our synergy targets as we build success upon success. \u2047 We're also realizing initial sales synergies through leveraging our expanded global footprint and cross-selling our broader product and services portfolio. \u2047 We believe our sales synergy efforts will support incremental -- important incremental sales growth in the years ahead. \u2047 As we build on these early successes, we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve significant upside potential and exceed our three-year cost savings sales growth, margin expansion and cash synergy targets. \u2047 So let's turn to Page four. \u2047 We're reporting our results for the first time under our organizational structure that we announced in June. \u2047 And these are our three strategic business units or SBUs as we call them -- outlined on this page. \u2047 So first is Electrical and Electronic systems, or EES, which is a little more than 40% of our company's total business. \u2047 Second, Communications and Security Solutions, or CSS, which is roughly 1/3 of our company's total business. \u2047 And then third, Utility and Broadband Solutions or UBS, which represents the remaining 1/4 of our overall combined company business across the enterprise. \u2047 The respective industries and types of customers that these SBUs serve are outlined on this page. \u2047 Yesterday, we also filed an 8-K with pro forma operating performance for each SBU on a quarterly and annual basis for 2019 and for the first two quarters of 2020. \u2047 As I mentioned last quarter, one of the most meaningful and positive discoveries post close is how complementary the WESCO and Anixter portfolios are. \u2047 The pie charts on this page depicts the legacy WESCO and legacy Anixter composition for each of the three businesses. \u2047 EES is comprised of WESCO's leadership and deep roots in electrical coupled with Anixter's depth and breadth and leadership position in wire and cable solutions. \u2047 And EES brings the complete electrical package and best-in-class solution offers to customers. \u2047 CSS includes Anixter's leading global position, capabilities and scale in communications and security. \u2047 And that's coupled with WESCO's Datacom, AV and Safety portfolio. \u2047 Combined, CSS is exceptionally well positioned in high-growth markets with very attractive secular growth trends. \u2047 And finally, UBS which combines WESCO's and Anixter's leading Utility and Broadband businesses is also very well positioned to outperform the market with a strong execution track record and unmatched supply chain capabilities. \u2047 Organizing our company around these three global businesses enables us to leverage their industry-leading scale and highly complementary portfolios and super serving our customers. \u2047 Each of these SBUs does between $4 billion and $7 billion of business annually, and they offer hundreds of thousands of products and industry-leading services, which makes them highly valued partner to both our suppliers and our customers. \u2047 In what remains a highly fragmented distribution value chain, the combined company benefits from a step change in scale and capability. \u2047 And we're leveraging that to sell more products and more services to more customers in more locations all around the world. \u2047 Finally, the leadership teams of these three businesses are comprised of the best of the best from each company and all possess decades of experience in our industry. \u2047 Nelson Squires who was previously WESCO's Chief Operating Officer and Head of the Canadian and International businesses is leading our ESS business. \u2047 Bill Geary leads our global CSS business, and he previously was Head of Anixter's network and security business. \u2047 And Jim Cameron leads our UBS business after running WESCO's utility business since 2014 and WESCO's broadband business since 2016. \u2047 I'm very pleased that each of these leaders is off to a great start in delivering strong results in our first full quarter of WESCO plus Anixter. \u2047 Now let's move to Page five. \u2047 Our SBUs, each and every one of them are extremely well positioned to benefit from the numerous secular trends that will drive future growth for WESCO. \u2047 We shared these 12 evolving secular growth trends we do previously, but today, we wanted to specifically highlight that they will drive growth across all of our businesses. \u2047 As we see an increase in automation, machine-to-machine connections, electrification of our infrastructure and demand for faster bandwidth and data center capacity, along with or coupled with the positive impact of the emerging trends, such as relocation of supply chain back to North America and increased remote connectivity, all three of our strategic business units have the scale and the capabilities to capture the resultant secular growth. \u2047 We've created the industry leader in electrical, communications and utility distribution and supply chain services just as these trends are poised to drive secular growth in the markets we serve. \u2047 Finally, moving to Page six. \u2047 We first communicated our three year cost savings sales growth, margin improvement and cash generation synergy targets back in March. \u2047 Since that time, we've been executing a detailed, rigorous and process-oriented plan to integrate WESCO and Anixter. \u2047 Against the backdrop of a challenging COVID-driven economic cycle, this strategic combination is even more compelling as we have doubled the size of our company and are transforming our new global enterprise. \u2047 With the benefit of what we have learned since the closing in June and our strong initial execution of our integration plan, we are increasingly confident in our ability to achieve these financial goals, including our updated synergy targets. \u2047 And most importantly, we're increasingly confident that we'll ultimately deliver the substantial value creation associated with this transformational combination. \u2047 As the industry leader, we are now larger and more diverse with differentiated scale and capabilities in what remains a highly fragmented industry. \u2047 We're evolving into a growth company and are exceptionally well positioned to lead the digital transformation of our business and our industry. \u2047 Turning to Slide seven. \u2047 During our second quarter earnings call, we outlined six second half priorities, and we want to provide you with an update on the substantial progress on each of these goals. \u2047 Starting with sales, demand continued to improve, and we believe we've taken share. \u2047 Sales in the quarter were down versus prior year due to COVID and up 8% on a pro forma basis from Q2. \u2047 We maintained our focus on cost management and exceeded expectations. \u2047 Prior to completing the merger with Anixter, we laid out our expectation to deliver $50 million of COVID-related cost actions. \u2047 Between Q2 and Q3, we exceeded this target. \u2047 On a pro forma basis, operating expenses were down $44 million in the third quarter versus the prior year. \u2047 On gross margin, we discussed the success Anixter had expanding gross margin through a targeted improvement program, and we are deploying it to the legacy WESCO business. \u2047 Gross margin was up 20 basis points on a pro forma basis, with broad-based improvement across the combined company. \u2047 We are extremely pleased with the progress made on the integration. \u2047 As John mentioned, we have already initiated actions to achieve the full year one synergy cost target of $68 million in the first four months of the integration and are increasing our cost synergy target. \u2047 One of the areas we are most pleased with is cash generation. \u2047 Free cash flow was extremely strong at $307 million in the quarter, and we reduced net debt by $280 million. \u2047 Our leverage, including year one synergies, improved to 4.8 turns on an adjusted EBITDA basis. \u2047 Lastly, we have fully transitioned our reporting structure to our new strategic business units that John walked you through a moment ago. \u2047 We issued an 8-K yesterday, providing you with the historical WESCO-only results, recast to the new segment reporting structure as well as a pro forma, combining the historical WESCO and Anixter results, including the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 Again, we're very pleased with the results in the quarter against a difficult operating environment due to COVID. \u2047 Moving to Slide eight. \u2047 We are increasing our three year cumulative cost synergy target to $250 million. \u2047 two drivers to the increase. \u2047 First, we set internal goals that are higher than we announced publicly, and our teams are delivering. \u2047 Second, there were specific areas where detailed information and analytics could not be completed until after we close the transaction. \u2047 We are finding upside to our initial estimates in all four buckets of synergies and are particularly excited about the incremental synergy opportunities in the areas of supply chain and SG&A, giving us confidence to take up our target. \u2047 In Q3, we realized $15 million of cost synergies and expect to achieve $100 million in the first year of the merger. \u2047 We still believe there is additional upside, and we plan to build upon our success to drive additional value capture in the areas of cost, cross-selling and net working capital synergies. \u2047 I'll also mention that we continue to make progress with the divestiture of the legacy WESCO Canadian Utility and Datacom businesses, which represent less than $150 million in revenue. \u2047 We engaged an investment bank and are working with potential buyers and are on track to complete the divestitures on a timely basis. \u2047 Turning to our third quarter results on Page nine. \u2047 This summary table compares our third quarter results to the WESCO plus Anixter pro forma results for the prior year period and sequentially, against the second quarter of this year. \u2047 Sales were down 5% versus the prior year and up 8% sequentially. \u2047 These sales improvements represent substantial growth above pierce and indicate we are taking share. \u2047 October Workday adjusted sales were down just 3% versus prior year. \u2047 And as John mentioned, our book-to-bill ratio remains above 1.0. \u2047 Sequentially, October Workday adjusted sales versus September were better than typical seasonality. \u2047 Adjusted gross margin, which excludes the effect of merger-related fair value adjustments of $28 million, was 19.6%, up 20 basis points versus prior year and sequentially. \u2047 We are clearly seeing traction from our margin improvement initiatives and are just beginning to deploy Anixter's proven gross margin improvement programs across the business. \u2047 Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes was $200 million in the quarter. \u2047 Reported EBIT was adjusted to remove the effect of merger-related cost of $14 million, the merger-related fair value adjustments on inventory of $28 million and a gain on the sale of an operating branch in the U.S. that was unrelated to the integration of $20 million. \u2047 Regarding the branch sale, we divested a single location that primarily sold Rockwell Allen-Bradley automation equipment in a specific geography. \u2047 Compared to the prior year, adjusted EBIT margin was up 30 basis points, reflecting the benefits of synergies and cost management actions in response to COVID-related demand declines. \u2047 On a sequential basis, adjusted EBIT was up 60 basis points. \u2047 As I mentioned on the prior slide, the legacy WESCO business expected to generate $50 million in total COVID-related cost savings in the last three quarters of the current year. \u2047 This quarter, we delivered approximately $28 million of these savings. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the effects of the adjustments I just mentioned as well as stock-based compensation in both the current and prior year periods and other net adjustments was $252 million, 5% higher than the prior year and 19% higher sequentially. \u2047 As a percentage of sales, adjusted EBITDA margin was 6.1%, 60 basis points higher than the prior year and sequentially. \u2047 These exceptional results, reflecting both year-over-year and sequential improvements of both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA, reflect our continued strong execution, disciplined cost management, market share gains, industry-leading value propositions across all of our business units and the acceleration of our synergy capture. \u2047 Our leading position and participation in the many secular trends discussed earlier as well as our track record of operational excellence, sets us up exceptionally well to drive substantial value creation. \u2047 Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $1.66.  \u2047  raising our year 1, 2 and 3 cost synergy targets to $100 million, $180 million, and $250 million, respectively."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.80.
