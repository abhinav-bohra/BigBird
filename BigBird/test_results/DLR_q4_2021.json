{"article": ["For a further discussion of the risks related to our business, please see our 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. \u2047 Reconciliations to net income are included in the supplemental package furnished to the SEC and available on our website. \u2047 We further strengthened connections with customers with $156 million of new bookings with record results in both a zero to 1 megawatt and greater than a megawatt category and ended the year with $500 million in new bookings, a 15% increase over the prior year. \u2047 We also continue to enhance our global platform with the completion of organic development projects in multiple metros despite the continued challenges presented by the pandemic and the global supply chain in addition to strategic investments, establishing Digital Realty as the leading pan-African provider. \u2047 Financially, we had a solid quarter with full year results above the high end of the guidance range that we provided this time last year. \u2047 And finally, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet by raising equity capital through the establishment of Digital Core REIT in a highly successful IPO on the Singapore Stock Exchange and the related sale of a 90% interest in 10 fully utilized core data centers. \u2047 As a perpetual capital partner, Digital Realty and Digital Core REIT can continue to work together while providing our customers with a seamless experience. \u2047 Our formula for long-term value creation is a global, connected, sustainable framework. \u2047 And we made further progress on each front during the fourth quarter. \u2047 First, we continue to globalize our business with record global bookings and strength across all regions and all product types, including quarterly highs in both our sub-1 megawatt and greater than 1 megawatt categories. \u2047 We also announced two significant global initiatives. \u2047 First, in December, we announced the successful listing of Digital Core REIT as a stand-alone publicly traded company on the Singapore Stock Exchange. \u2047 and Canada, valued at $1.4 billion at a 4.25% cap rate. \u2047 We generated net proceeds of over $950 million from the transaction, and we retained a 35% equity interest in the publicly traded REIT. \u2047 The offering was very well received, and Digital Core REIT has traded up approximately 30% since the IPO, enhancing the gain on our remaining ownership stake. \u2047 In addition to providing investors a stable cash flow stream from a portfolio of high-quality core data centers, Digital Core REIT offers key strategic benefits to Digital Realty. \u2047 First, Digital Core REIT is a perpetual capital partner. \u2047 It has a long-term investment horizon and a global mandate to invest in stabilized income-producing data centers. \u2047 Second, Digital Core REIT has been carefully crafted to provide a seamless customer experience. \u2047 Digital Core REIT is sponsored by and externally managed by Digital Realty. \u2047 We will continue to manage the properties providing the same level of operational excellence, and we will earn fees for asset and property management, as well as acquisitions, dispositions and development. \u2047 From a customer perspective, nothing changes when we contribute an asset to Digital Core REIT. \u2047 Third, Digital Core REIT is an ideal partner vehicle for Digital Realty. \u2047 We expect to contribute additional stabilized core assets to Digital Core REIT in the future, and we may also co-invest alongside Digital Core REIT on future investment activity. \u2047 Finally, our interests are aligned. \u2047 As mentioned, Digital Realty will continue to own a 10% direct ownership stake in each of the assets in addition to 35% in the publicly traded vehicle. \u2047 Digital Core REIT is led by two longtime Digital Realty team members, John Stewart, who most of you know well, along with an Dan Tith. \u2047 We are excited about their opportunity to create value for Digital Core REIT unitholders, including Digital Realty. \u2047 Our second global initiative, which we announced just after quarter end, is the definitive agreement to acquire roughly a 55% stake in Teraco, Africa's leading carrier-neutral colocation provider. \u2047 This acquisition immediately establishes Digital Realty as the leading colocation and interconnection provider on the high-growth African continent and builds upon our earlier investments in Africa with iColo, in both Kenya and Mozambique and in Medallion in Nigeria. \u2047 Teraco complements these investments, as well as our highly connected facilities in the Mediterranean by hosting the key strategic landing endpoints for subsea cables circling Africa. \u2047 From Marseille and Athens in the North; Mombasa and Maputo along the east; Durban and Cape Town in the South; and Lagos along the Western Coast, PlatformDIGITAL is supporting the growth of our customers, as well as the broader digital transformation of the entire African continent. \u2047 Teraco has seven state-of-the-art data centers across three key metros in South Africa and serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises. \u2047 Teraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and hosts seven cloud on-ramps and provides direct access to seven subsea cables. \u2047 Teraco has historically generated healthy double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA. \u2047 In addition, more than half of Teraco's in-service portfolio was developed within the past two years. \u2047 The current development pipeline will expand the existing asset base by over 25%. \u2047 And Teraco owns land adjacent to its highly connected campuses in Johannesburg and Cape Town that will support another doubling of the in-place capacity, representing significant embedded growth potential and providing considerable runway to support our customers' growth. \u2047 Leading global cloud and content platforms have recently begun making significant investments in Africa, given the existing capacity within the in-service portfolio, the incremental capacity currently under construction and the strategic landholdings to support future expansion. \u2047 Teraco is uniquely positioned to support the expected growth of digital infrastructure in Africa over the next several years. \u2047 Let's discuss our sustainable growth initiatives on Page 3. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, Digital Realty earned Nareit's Leader in the Light Award for the fifth consecutive year, complementing the company's five-star GRESB rating and top ranking within the technology and science sector. \u2047 Digital Realty was also named one of America's Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek and was the No. \u2047 1 ranked data center company. \u2047 We continue to advance our sustainable financing strategy, recasting and upsizing our credit facility with improved terms while incorporating a sustainability-linked pricing component with pricing subject to adjustment based on annual performance against certain green targets. \u2047 We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment, while simultaneously meeting the needs of our customers, our investors and our employees, along with the broader society and advancing our goal of delivering sustainable growth for all these stakeholders. \u2047 Let's turn to our investment activity on Page 4. \u2047 We continue to invest in the expansion of our global platform. \u2047 In addition to the Teraco transaction, we've grown our presence along the Eastern Coast of Africa with iColo and supplemented our acquisition of Medallion data centers in Nigeria with two land purchases in Lagos for future development. \u2047 Over the next decade, we expect to see huge opportunity for global businesses to tap into Africa's rapidly growing internet economy, and Digital Realty is uniquely positioned to enable this growth. \u2047 We also continue to invest in the organic growth of our platform. \u2047 We spent $580 million on growth capex in the fourth quarter, our largest quarterly growth capex investment to date. \u2047 We currently have 44 projects underway, totaling more than 250 megawatts of IT capacity in 27 metros around the world. \u2047 This capacity was 46% presold as of year-end. \u2047 Geographically, we continue to invest most heavily in EMEA with 27 projects underway, totaling more than 140 megawatts across 16 metros. \u2047 In Asia Pacific, we delivered several development projects during the fourth quarter, including facilities in Singapore and Hong Kong. \u2047 In January, we opened Digital Seoul 1, our first data center in South Korea and the first carrier-neutral facility in the country. \u2047 This facility will serve as a connectivity gateway for latency-sensitive customer workloads, but can be connected to hyperscale applications hosted in our second facility in Korea, totaling over 60 megawatts of capacity currently under construction just outside the city center. \u2047 The two facilities will be tied together with fiber to create a connected campus and will complement each other by providing solutions for the full customer spectrum, from small performance sensitive co-location customers to huge hyperscale deployments. \u2047 In North America, our development pipeline is diversified by product mix, as well as geographically with projects underway in seven different markets. \u2047 We continue to see strong hyperscale demand in Hillsboro, while we are expanding in Downtown Atlanta to bring on additional colocation capacity at one of the most highly connected destinations in the Southeastern United States. \u2047 We are bringing capacity online in both these markets, among others, given the robust demand backdrop and our tightening inventory position. \u2047 Let's turn to the macro environment on Page 5. \u2047 We're fortunate to be operating in a business levered to secular demand drivers. \u2047 Our leadership position provides us with a unique vantage point to detect secular trends as they emerge globally on platformDIGITAL. \u2047 Our customers continue to solve some of the most complex IT infrastructure connectivity and data integration challenges. \u2047 We are witnessing a growing trend of multinational companies across all segments, deploying and connecting large, private data infrastructure footprints on PlatformDIGITAL across multiple regions and metros globally. \u2047 Industry research firm Gartner recently updated their global IT spending forecast for 2022, projecting a 5.1% increase to $4.5 trillion, driven by companies investing in digital data growth strategies. \u2047 Additionally, Gartner believes that by 2024, 75% of organizations will have deployed multiple data hubs to drive mission-critical data analytics sharing and governance in support of digital data growth strategies. \u2047 These forecasts are consistent with our view of where the puck is headed. \u2047 Our market intelligence tool, the Data Gravity Index, forecasts similar growth in the intensity of data creation and its gravitational pull on global IT infrastructure. \u2047 In addition, our industry manifesto, enabling connected data communities serves as the global playbook for industry collaboration to tackle data gravity challenges head on and unlock a new era of growth opportunity for all companies. \u2047 Digital Realty was recently named company of the year by Frost & Sullivan for North American data center best practices. \u2047 This award reflects our continued focus on operational excellence, underpinned by continuous innovation and execution of the PlatformDIGITAL road map. \u2047 We are honored by the strong validation of the differentiated value proposition we are creating for customers and partners. \u2047 Given the resiliency of the demand drivers underpinning our business, and the relevance of our platform in meeting these needs, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth for customers, shareholders and employees, whatever the macro environment may hold in store. \u2047 Let's turn to our leasing activity on Page 7. \u2047 As Bill noted, we delivered record bookings of $156 million with an $11 million contribution from interconnection during the fourth quarter. \u2047 Volume was elevated across both of our primary reporting categories in the quarter with a healthy mix between enterprise and hyperscale business. \u2047 For the full year, we booked $0.5 billion of new business with roughly a 60-40 split between greater than 1 megawatt and less than 1 megawatt plus interconnection. \u2047 The EMEA region had a particularly strong quarter accounting for approximately 60% of total bookings led by Frankfurt with standout performance across product types. \u2047 The fourth quarter was also notable for the strength of cross-selling between regions. \u2047 Nearly 30% of our sub-1 megawatt plus interconnection bookings were exported from one region to another, a strong indication of the value customers derive from our global platform. \u2047 Not surprisingly, the Americas was our biggest exporter with most deals landing in EMEA, followed by APAC. \u2047 Both EMEA and APAC had strong export quarters as well, with over 15% of their sub-1-megawatt plus interconnection bookings landing out of region. \u2047 The weighted average lease term was nearly 10 years primarily driven by hyperscale pre-leasing in EMEA. \u2047 We landed over 130 new logos during the fourth quarter, our second best quarterly result and just shy of last quarter's record 140 for our full year total of 480 new logos. \u2047 We are encouraged by the consistent organic growth of our customer base, and we view these results as strong validation of platform digital and our global strategy. \u2047 In terms of specific wins during the quarter and around the world, Graphcore, a British semiconductor company that develops accelerators and systems for AI and machine learning, selected PlatformDIGITAL to address their density, security and scale requirements. \u2047 The initial deployment will land in Amsterdam to be followed by a global rollout, and we are also collaborating on solution engineering and joint go-to-market activities. \u2047 A leading high-frequency trading shop is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to extend their high-performance computing platform across two continents and expand trading into two new international metros, while approving cloud access and business continuity state side. \u2047 A Global 2000 U.S. energy provider is expanding with Digital Realty, consolidating their own on-premise facilities and using PlatformDIGITAL to scale their business across multiple metros. \u2047 A leading aerospace manufacturing and services company is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL, leveraging dense interconnection to support data exchange across four new markets. \u2047 A Global 2000 insurance brokerage is consolidating their data center footprint and has adopted PlatformDIGITAL to remove data gravity barriers and interconnect with clouds across multiple metros. \u2047 An IVY League university is expanding on PlatformDIGITAL to exit their own on-premise facility and enhance their access to the healthcare provider community for data exchange. \u2047 And finally, a major APAC food services organization selected PlatformDIGITAL to improve cloud connectivity and leverage the local centers of data exchange in Japan. \u2047 Turning to our backlog on Page 9. \u2047 The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced rose from $330 million to $378 million as our fourth -- record fourth quarter signings more than offset commencements. \u2047 The lag between signings and commencements was unusually high at nearly 14 months, primarily driven by long-term leases on recent development starts in EMEA as customers accelerated efforts to secure a long-term runway for growth against a backdrop of steadily dwindling inventory. \u2047 Moving on to renewal leasing activity on Page 10. \u2047 We signed $151 million of renewal leases during the fourth quarter in addition to the record new leases signed. \u2047 The weighted average lease term on renewals signed during the fourth quarter was nearly four years. \u2047 Renewal rates rolled down 4%, driven by a handful of large deals in North America as negative releasing spreads on greater than 1 megawatt renewals more than offset the positive releasing spreads on the sub-1 meg"], "gold_summary": ["introduced 2022 core ffo per share
