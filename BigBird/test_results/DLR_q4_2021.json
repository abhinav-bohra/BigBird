{"article": ["If you did not receive a copy of the release, you can find it on our website at hormelfoods.com under the Investors section. \u2047 On our call today is Jim Snee, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Sheehan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Jim Snee will provide a review of the company's current and future operating conditions, commentary and each segment's performance for the quarter, and a perspective on the balance of fiscal 2021. \u2047 Jim Sheehan will provide detailed financial results and commentary regarding the company's current and future financial condition. \u2047 As a courtesy to the other analysts, please limit yourself to one question with one follow-up. \u2047 It will be posted on our website and archived for one year. \u2047 Before we get started, I need to reference the Safe Harbor statement. \u2047 It can be accessed on our website. \u2047 In the third quarter, our team delivered the highest quarterly sales in the company's 130-year history, while operating in an environment, which included inflationary pressures and industrywide supply chain challenges. \u2047 Our ability to deliver this performance demonstrates the strength of our balanced business model and strong consumer demand, as we grew sales in all four segments and all four sales channels on an organic basis. \u2047 Also in the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Planters snacks nut business. \u2047 This brand fits perfectly into our vision for Hormel Foods and is another step in our strategic evolution. \u2047 The integration has been smooth, which has allowed us to effectively operate the business with no disruptions. \u2047 These accomplishments were achieved by our team members who never lost sight of our long-term growth strategy in the face of unprecedented industrywide challenges. \u2047 Now more than ever, our investments across all areas of our business are paying off and have allowed us to reach even more consumers when and where they are eating. \u2047 Whether it is cooking a meal at home, snacking at work, eating at a local restaurant, hosting a gathering with family and friends or ordering food online, a Hormel Foods branded product will likely be an option. \u2047 The proof is in our performance this quarter. \u2047 Sales increased 20% on a volume increase of 1%. \u2047 Compared to the third quarter of 2019, sales increased 25%. \u2047 This all-time record performance was led by an acceleration in our Foodservice business, sustained demand for our retail and deli products, continued growth from our international business and pricing actions taken across the portfolio. \u2047 Excluding a partial quarter of the Planters business, organic sales increased 14% and volume declined 2%. \u2047 For the quarter, we saw an acceleration in our Foodservice business as sales grew 45% compared to last year. \u2047 What is even more impressive is sales increased 17% compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Our Enterprise Foodservice portfolio remains perfectly positioned to meet the most pressing need of today's foodservice operators, which is labor. \u2047 Our products minimize labor, simplify food preparation and save time, all while preserving the flexibility to add their own unique touch to their menus. \u2047 Hormel Bacon 1 fully cooked bacon, Wholly Guacamole, Fontanini authentic Italian sausages and Hormel Fire Braised meats are all excellent examples of products that are succeeding in today's environment. \u2047 Our retail business also showed 9% growth compared to 2020. \u2047 Compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, this business delivered outstanding growth of 31%. \u2047 Brands such as SPAM, Hormel Black Label, Applegate, Jennie-O and Herdez continue to resonate with consumers. \u2047 Sales in the deli channel increased 12% this quarter and are up 16% compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Hormel Gatherings, Party Trays and Columbus charcuterie items showed another quarter of growth as consumers return to entertaining and spending time with family and friends. \u2047 An important component of our growth in retail and deli is our e-commerce performance. \u2047 We continue to invest in the digital space, and we are seeing strong results compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Our International channel delivered impressive growth of 36% compared to 2020 and is 33% above 2019 levels. \u2047 Improvement was led by branded exports and strength from the Multinational businesses in China and Brazil. \u2047 Again, I cannot stress enough, how proud I am of our entire team, for delivering these impressive results, in the midst of an incredibly difficult operating environment, marked by significant inflation, labor challenges and supply chain disruptions. \u2047 This not only demonstrates the team's ability to execute our long-term growth strategy, but also reinforces the power of our brands. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.32, a 14% decline, compared to 2020. \u2047 The decrease was due to one-time transaction costs, and accounting adjustments, related to the acquisition of the Planters business. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share were $0.39, a 5% increase. \u2047 Our team did an excellent job actively managing through inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. \u2047 During the quarter, we continue to see inflation in labor rates, freight, supplies, raw materials and many other inputs, with an acceleration compared to the second quarter. \u2047 Of note, we saw a very high level of inflation in pork input costs. \u2047 To mitigate this inflationary pressure, we have taken pricing on almost every brand and product across our company. \u2047 This is a testament to our successful pricing strategy, the power of our brands and the hard work of our entire team, especially our direct salesforce. \u2047 As a reminder, there is a difference in how quickly pricing flows through by channel, and this can shift profits to later quarters. \u2047 We have a track record of improving profitability through a market cycle and we expect margins to improve in the coming quarters. \u2047 We also saw a drastic step-up in industrywide operational challenges, caused by labor shortages. \u2047 This has impacted both our facilities and the operations of supplier and logistics partners. \u2047 This has created a very complex operating environment, which led to an inability to fully meet customer demand. \u2047 To address labor availability in our facilities, we are taking swift actions to hire and retain team members, implement automation across manufacturing facilities and simplify the portfolio. \u2047 Our entire team, from operations to our direct salesforce, has done an excellent job adjusting, prioritizing and managing through this dynamic environment. \u2047 Turning to the segments, Refrigerated Foods volume decreased 2%, sales increased 19% and segment profit was flat. \u2047 Organic volume decreased 3% and organic sales increased 18%. \u2047 Volume was lower, due to lower harvest levels and commodity sales, compared to last year. \u2047 Our Foodservice business accelerated compared to the second quarter, with elevated levels of demand for all our branded products. \u2047 Nearly every category grew volume and sales compared to last year, with standout performances from products like Hormel Bacon 1, pizza toppings and sliced meats. \u2047 Bacon 1, Fire Braised, Fontanini, Applegate and pizza toppings were just some of the items that also grew volume and sales compared to 2019. \u2047 Similar to prior quarters, we saw excellent growth from premium prepared proteins, which are the cornerstone of our pre-strategy, offering versatile and flavorful items that come pre-marinated, pre-sliced or pre-cooked. \u2047 These items sold for the most pressing issues facing operators today, labor shortages. \u2047 Brands like Bacon 1, Austin Blues, Fire Braised and Cafe H are designed to solve for this challenge and have never been as important or in higher demand than they are today. \u2047 We saw momentum continue for our retail and deli brands in Refrigerated Foods as well. \u2047 Products showing exceptional sales growth include Hormel Gatherings party trays, Hormel Black Label bacon, Hormel Fully Cooked entrees and Lloyd's Barbecue. \u2047 The Columbus brand has shown no signs of slowing down, as consumers look for premium, authentic charcuterie. \u2047 I'm pleased with the performance of our new charcuterie plant in Omaha, as the team is quickly filling up the new production lines. \u2047 We are excited about the upcoming holiday season and expect a high level of demand for our innovative and premium Columbus product lines. \u2047 International delivered its sixth consecutive quarter of record earnings growth, with volume up 2%, sales up 26% and segment profit up 18%. \u2047 Organic volume increased 1%, and organic sales increased 24%. \u2047 Total branded and fresh pork exports grew during the quarter. \u2047 We continue to see strong growth from SPAM, Skippy and many foodservice brands around the world. \u2047 Our business in China continues to perform well led by foodservice and from retail brands such as SPAM and Skippy. \u2047 Our new item launches of Beef Jerky and Skippy Snacking items have also been very successful. \u2047 Grocery Products volume increased 4%. \u2047 Sales increased 20% and segment profit increased 1%. \u2047 Brands, including SPAM, Hormel Complete and Wholly showed excellent growth in the quarter. \u2047 We continue to see strong growth relative to 2019 pre-pandemic levels for brands such as SPAM, Hormel Complete, Dinty Moore, Mary Kitchen and Herdez. \u2047 Organic volume decreased 6%, and organic sales were flat. \u2047 Organic volumes faced difficult comparisons due to the extremely high levels of demand during the early parts of the pandemic. \u2047 Additionally, we have rationalized capacity on numerous contract manufacturing items to support growth of our branded business. \u2047 Our MegaMex joint venture delivered excellent results as equity in earnings increased 30%. \u2047 The growth from the Herdez and Wholly brands are being driven by the tremendous level of innovation from MegaMex, with products such as Herdez Cremosa, Herdez Guacamole Salsa and Wholly Smashed Avocado. \u2047 We are also extremely encouraged by our entry into the hot sauce space with Herdez Avocado Hot Sauce. \u2047 Jennie-O volume increased 9% and sales increased 22%, a combination of a foodservice recovery and higher whole bird and commodity volumes drove the volume increase. \u2047 Increase sales is due to higher volumes and pricing actions across the portfolio. \u2047 Jennie-O Turkey Store segment profit declined 17%, driven by the impact from significantly higher fee and freight costs. \u2047 While spot grain markets remained elevated during the quarter, the hedging actions we took stabilize the cost increases. \u2047 Looking to the balance of the year, we issued our full year net sales and earnings guidance to reflect the Planters acquisition. \u2047 We expect net sales to be between $11 billion to $11.2 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be between $1.65 to $1.69. \u2047 This guidance reflects the addition of the Planters business and includes the associated one-time transaction costs and accounting adjustments in addition to the impact from inflationary pressures on our business. \u2047 We expect a strong finish to the year as pricing actions continue to take effect, the foodservice industry continues to recover and from the addition of Planters. \u2047 Looking beyond the fourth quarter, I feel very optimistic about the future. \u2047 Our balanced portfolio with diversification across raw materials, channels and categories will allow us to perform well in many economic environments. \u2047 Further, we never wavered on our commitment to employee safety and on making disciplined and strategic investments to ensure we are positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. \u2047 Since the onset of the pandemic, we have made the following strategic investments. \u2047 We opened a new Columbus charcuterie plant in Omaha, and we immediately invested in Phase 2, representing a major expansion of our pepperoni capacity. \u2047 We completed the Pizza Toppings expansion at our Burke plant in Iowa, which significantly increased our capacity for Pizza Toppings. \u2047 We have invested in R&D for plant-based products and launched our plant-based pepperoni and sausage crumble items at the Pizza Expo in mid-August. \u2047 Additionally, we bolstered our innovation efforts by investing in new R&D centers, both domestically and in China. \u2047 We expanded our distribution network for both the Shelf-Stable and Refrigerated businesses. \u2047 We made further progress on building out our one supply chain by investing in systems, people and processes. \u2047 We acquired Sadler's Smokehouse, which added capacity to support growth during the recovery in the foodservice industry. \u2047 We completed the HR and finance portions of Project Orion and continue to work toward the multi-phase implementation of our supply chain. \u2047 We continue to make investments in advertising for our leading brands. \u2047 And finally, we made the company's largest investment ever, the acquisition of Planters. \u2047 We are already seeing the benefits that a large iconic and well-known brand can have on our business. \u2047 These are just some of the many investments we have made to further enhance our business and set us up for growth into the future. \u2047 Third quarter sales were $2.9 billion, an all-time record for the company. \u2047 Net sales and organic net sales increased 20% and 14%, respectively, compared to last year. \u2047 Segment profit increased 2% for the quarter, driven by strong results in the International segment, Foodservice growth and the addition of Planters. \u2047 Earnings per share were $0.32. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share, excluding one-time costs and accounting adjustments related to the acquisition of Planters was $0.39, a 5% increase. \u2047 COVID-related expenses during the quarter were immaterial. \u2047 Adjusted SG&A was 6.9% of sales compared to 7.6% last year. \u2047 Advertising for the quarter was $31 million, an increase of 25%. \u2047 Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 8.7%, a decrease from 10.5% last year. \u2047 We expect margins to show sequential improvement in the fourth quarter as the impact of pricing actions continue to take effect. \u2047 Net unallocated expenses increased as a result of the one-time acquisition-related costs for Planters and net interest expense. \u2047 The effective tax rate for the quarter was 13.3%. \u2047 The primary driver of the decline was a large volume of stock options exercised during the quarter and a one-time foreign tax benefit. \u2047 The revised guidance range assumes a full year tax rate between 19% and 20.5%. \u2047 Operating cash flow declined compared to last year, impacted by working capital from the Planters acquisition and higher levels of inventory. \u2047 Inventory levels were unseasonably low last year during the third quarter. \u2047 We paid our 372nd consecutive quarterly dividend, effective August 16 at an annual rate of $0.98 per share, a 5% increase over 2020. \u2047 This completes the 93rd consecutive year of uninterrupted dividend payments. \u2047 Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter. \u2047 The company's target for the capital expenditures in 2021 is $260 million. \u2047 The Planters acquisition represents a change to the company's capital structure"], "gold_summary": ["q3 earnings per share $0.32.  \u2047  q3 sales rose 20 percent to $2.9
