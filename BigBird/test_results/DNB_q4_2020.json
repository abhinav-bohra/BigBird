{"article": ["On the call today, we have Dun & Bradstreet's CEO, Anthony Jabbour; and CFO, Bryan Hipsher. \u2047 our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a number of risks and uncertainties. \u2047 Today's remarks will also include references to non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 I'd like to take some time today to discuss highlights from 2020 and our plans for 2021. \u2047 2020 was an incredible year for Dun & Bradstreet. \u2047 In the midst of a challenging new environment, we're able to successfully complete our IPO, signed a definitive agreement to acquire Bisnode, and continued to transform our business with significant enhancements for our technology, data, and analytics, which are ultimately laying the foundation for our ability to execute on our near- and long-term growth strategies. \u2047 Returning to the public markets last July was a major milestone for our company and allowed us to raise approximately $2.4 billion. \u2047 The net IPO proceeds allowed us to pay down our entire preferred equity, and 40% of both are secured and unsecured notes. \u2047 This significantly improved our financial profile and is saving us more than $175 million of annual dividend and interest expense. \u2047 With our lower leverage and increased cash flow, we now have significantly more financial flexibility to accelerate our growth strategy, both organically and inorganically. \u2047 For example, we're able to execute a critical step in our international growth strategy, the acquisition of Dun & Bradstreet Worldwide Network member, Bisnode, which was signed in October 2020 and closed on January 8, 2021. \u2047 The acquisition of Bisnode significantly expands our footprint to additional territories that make up 40% of the GDP of Europe and are home to 50 of the Global 500 companies. \u2047 The combined business, with nearly 250,000 clients collectively, will now be able to provide mission-critical solutions to an expanded European footprint with more local data, more local knowledge, and more streamlined delivery channels. \u2047 As a global company, having local expertise and knowledge helps us to engage with clients of all sizes in the region and across the globe to provide solutions and support necessary to meet their increasing demands. \u2047 As we've now been operating the business for around a month, we're even more excited about the opportunity. \u2047 The business came with a combination of Dun & Bradstreet products along with some legacy disparate solutions. \u2047 We will sun-down the legacy solutions and invest in the development of our market-leading global platforms and localized solutions. \u2047 We also have identified approximately $40 million in annualized run-rate savings that we expect to have actioned by the end of 2022. \u2047 Bryan will provide incremental financial details, including our expectations for 2021, in his section. \u2047 But overall, we already have strong momentum under way and look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. \u2047 Now, turning back to the fourth quarter and full-year 2020. \u2047 We delivered solid financial results in both the fourth quarter and full-year 2020 despite known headwinds and a challenging macro environment. \u2047 Fourth-quarter revenues were up 1.8%, excluding the net benefit of the lower deferred revenue purchase accounting impact. \u2047 Adjusting for the previously communicated headwinds, normalized revenues on a constant-currency basis were up 3.5% for the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year. \u2047 Total company revenue retention for the year was 96%, an increase of 70 basis points versus prior year. \u2047 And we now have 36% of our business under multi-year contracts. \u2047 Revenue retention for our strategic account segment for the year is 99.8%, which once again reinforces our position as a mission-critical provider to the largest businesses in the world. \u2047 2020 was certainly a challenging year in terms of businesses of all sizes navigating their way through a difficult environment. \u2047 I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish in terms of retention, and in some cases, expansion, especially when you look at what we did with our strategic accounts. \u2047 Building on the near-100% gross retention I just mentioned, we're able to grow our revenues with our strategic customers by 3% versus prior year. \u2047 We also increased our multiyear business in the strategic channel by 11 percentage points to 67.5%. \u2047 These multi-year contracts not only have built-in growth. \u2047 They also create recurring revenue streams that allow us to continue to cross-sell additional solutions. \u2047 A great example of this was with one of the top three wireless providers in the U.S. as they adopted a multi-year agreement with Master Data, digital marketing, and global analytics solutions. \u2047 Next, I'll talk about the significant progress we made in our government channel, where we had a strong year with wins in the Department of Defense, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Small Business Administration. \u2047 And in the fourth quarter, we were able to secure a sole-sourced 16-month contract with two six-month options to further support the General Services Administration or the GSA. \u2047 As governments both domestically and globally look to grapple with a rapidly evolving environment, we are pleased to be able to assist such critical work through our unique and differentiated offerings. \u2047 Moving on to our field sales accounts. \u2047 We saw customers, including one of the leading hedge funds in the world and an online brand management technology company, renew at or slightly above prior-year levels, which was reflective of the overall customer segment. \u2047 These businesses, which range from $100,000 to $1 million of potential spend a year, were more impacted by the current adverse environment. \u2047 However, they maintained consistent spend with us given the criticality of the solutions we provide despite their overall budget limitations. \u2047 We continue to have dialogue in terms of the adoption of incremental solutions as things begin to return to a more normalized environment and look forward to deepening our relationships going forward. \u2047 Finally, our small and medium business accounts were an area that went through a significant evolution. \u2047 We spent the later part of 2019 beginning to execute a digital strategy that shifts our reliance on direct mail campaigns and telephonic interactions to a more e-commerce-centric interaction. \u2047 While revenues from direct mail and telesales were down significantly versus prior year, we're able to partially offset those declines with digital sales up 53% over the prior year. \u2047 We carried this momentum through the back half of 2020 and are excited about our progress in expanding upon our SMB digitization efforts, which I will discuss further in my 2021 operations section. \u2047 From an international lens, as we continue to expand and improve our beneficial ownership data, we're able to secure a new contract with one of China's top four banks. \u2047 This solution will help the bank manage and screen their client shareholders in order to meet anti-money laundering requirements in the Know Your Customer compliance process. \u2047 In the U.K., we expanded our business with a Fortune 500 online payments provider whose platforms are available in more than 200 markets around the world. \u2047 They will be using our modern API and cloud-based Software-as-a-Service solutions globally to provide entity verification screening and monitor potential fraud. \u2047 We also continue to grow our Sales and Marketing solutions internationally. \u2047 A British multinational enterprise software firm, Sage Global Services, a market leader for integrated accounting, payroll, and payment systems, will be using our global data to assist with their Sales and Marketing efforts through cleansing and updating data within their CRM systems and assisting in account-based marketing efforts. \u2047 As you can see, client engagement is strong, and we believe this momentum is a direct outcome of the substantial progress we've made in terms of our ongoing transformation that is producing higher quality, more modern, and scalable global solutions. \u2047 In 2020, we invested approximately $115 million in capitalized software development, focused on enhancing and expanding our data supply chain, innovating new solutions, and modernizing our existing platforms via integration, enhanced user interfaces, and decreased latency. \u2047 As we've discussed before, Project Ascent has been an important piece of our technology transformation as we continue to enhance and expand our ability to ingest and curate data, diversify our coverage of existing data and expand access to a variety of alternative data sets. \u2047 We also made significant progress in simplifying and scaling our infrastructure for further growth. \u2047 Converging multiple existing legacy environments onto a common platform, primarily in the cloud, improves our stability and operating costs and enables automation, continuous integrating, and on-demand provisioning, so our developers can deploy more rapidly into production, ultimately allowing us to scale quickly and efficiently. \u2047 An example of taking an existing set of solutions, focusing on the modern offering, and connecting it to enhance data supply chain, is what we're doing with our Direct+ API. \u2047 All alternative data sets that come to Dun & Bradstreet are now ingested through Ascent and delivered by Direct+, providing our customers with the freshest, most complete, and accurate results, which allows our customers to access the most up-to-date data and analytics available in our ecosystem. \u2047 Over the next year, we will continue to load new data and begin migrating existing data sets to be curated through Ascent. \u2047 These particular investments, along with all the new product innovations we rolled out in 2020, are creating the foundation for our future growth. \u2047 And finally, as we invest in the business, we also continue to focus on efficiency, reflected in our improved EBITDA margins and annualized run-rate cost savings to date of $241 million, which is up $16 million from the third quarter. \u2047 This was achieved through a rationalization of our real estate footprint and net reduction from external providers as we expand our global capability and continued rationalization of our back-office support structure. \u2047 As I said, 2020 was an incredible year. \u2047 Our team continue to make great strides in executing on our strategy, and we are well-positioned for 2021 and beyond. \u2047 Now, turning to 2021, we will continue to focus on our transformation effort as we look to leverage the work we did in 2020. \u2047 One area I'd like to highlight is our new SMB digital platform, which will provide small- and medium-sized businesses a one-stop shop and help to deepen our relationships with cross-sell opportunities, extend our reach to new customers, particularly small businesses, and increase our revenue from new channels, including self-service e-commerce. \u2047 We have thousands of small businesses coming to our website each day for a whole host of reasons, including registering for a Dun's number, looking to improve their credit profile, or becoming a qualified supplier to a major corporation. \u2047 We took multiple digital entry points and established a unified site that provides a single corridor for these businesses to not just access our products, but to gain access to a more expansive environment, including partner products designed specifically for small business. \u2047 This helps us to grow our small, medium business sales; increase stickiness with current clients, and create partnership opportunity with our largest enterprise clients to bring new solutions and services to small business. \u2047 As we look to our Finance and Risk and Sales and Marketing portfolios, we will continue to launch new, innovative capabilities throughout the year. \u2047 And internationally, we'll continue to focus on launching new products in our respective markets through globalizing existing new North America solutions, introducing new offerings concurrently with North America, and launching specific local offerings. \u2047 These solutions will largely leverage existing technology platforms and data supply chains but be tailored for market users with local language, data, and feature requirements. \u2047 2020 was another year of remarkable transformation, and we are poised to accelerate growth in 2021. \u2047 Our key priorities are to continue the transformation of our technology to scale for growth, deliver more to our clients digitally, expand our data and analytics capabilities, integrate Bisnode, and grow both organically and inorganically as we look for new and better ways to serve our clients. \u2047 We are excited for what's to come. \u2047 Today, I will discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2020 results and our outlook for 2021. \u2047 Turning to Slide 1. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, fourth-quarter revenues were $480 million, an increase of 11% or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis compared to the prior-year quarter. \u2047 This includes the net impact of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $39 million. \u2047 Net income for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis was $7 million or a diluted income per share of $0.02 compared to a net loss of $263 million for the prior-year quarter. \u2047 This was primarily driven by prior year's expense of $172 million related to the make-whole provision associated with the Series A preferred stock, which was redeemed as a result of the IPO, also the net impact of the lower deferred revenue adjustment of $39 million, as well as a higher non-operating gain of approximately $24 million related to the fair value adjustment of a foreign currency pilot. \u2047 Before I get to the full-year results, let me clarify that comparisons to full-year 2019 are being compared to the combined pro forma results, which include the predecessor period prior to the privatization, the successor period post-privatization, and pro forma adjustments that give effect to the take-private transaction as if it had it occurred on January 1, 2019. \u2047 For revenue and adjusted EBITDA, the only pro forma adjustment was a $16 million reduction due to additional deferred revenues. \u2047 On a GAAP basis, full-year 2020 revenues were $1,738 million, an increase of 10% compared to 2019. \u2047 This includes the net impacts of the lower purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment of $134 million and an international lag adjustment of $26 million, which had a combined 10 percentage point impact on year-over-year growth. \u2047 We had a full-year net loss of $176 million or a diluted loss per share of $0.48 compared to a net loss of $599 million for the prior year. \u2047 Turning to Slide 2, I'll now discuss our adjusted results for the fourth quarter and full year. \u2047 Fourth-quarter adjusted revenues for the total company were $480 million, an increase of 11% or 10.5% on a constant-currency basis. \u2047 This increase includes the $39 million net impact of lower deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustments, a 9-percentage point impact on year-over-year growth. \u2047 This increase was partially offset by known headwinds as previously communicated. \u2047 These headwinds include Lower usage revenues primarily driven by the impact of COVID-19 of approximately $8 million; lower royalty revenues from the wind-down of the Data.com partnership of approximately $6 million; a decision we made in the second half of 2019 to make structural changes within legacy Credibility solution of $1 million; partially offset by the shift of $4 million of government revenues from the third quarter. \u2047 The total net impact of these known headwinds was approximately $11 million. \u2047 Excluding these unique"], "gold_summary": ["dun & bradstreet sees fy 2021 adjusted ebitda in range of $840
