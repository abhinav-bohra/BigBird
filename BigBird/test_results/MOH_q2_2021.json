Form 8-K filings with the SEC. \u2047 [Operator Instructions] Lastly, we want to invite you to attend our Virtual 2021 Investor Day meeting scheduled for Friday, September 17, where we will share more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy. \u2047 Today, we will provide you with updates on several topics. \u2047 We will present our financial results for the second quarter 2021. \u2047 We will update our 2021 guidance, and we will summarize the status of our growth initiatives and outlook for the future. \u2047 Let me start with the second quarter highlights. \u2047 Last night, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share for the second quarter of $3.40, with adjusted net income of $199 million and premium revenue of $6.6 billion. \u2047 The 88.4% medical care ratio demonstrates solid performance while managing through pandemic-related medical cost challenges that increased the ratio by 110 basis points. \u2047 The net effect of COVID decreased net income per diluted share by approximately $1. \u2047 We managed to a 6.9% adjusted G&A ratio, reflecting continued discipline in cost management, which allowed us to harvest the benefits of scale produced by our substantial growth. \u2047 We produced an adjusted after-tax margin of 2.9%, meeting our second quarter expectations. \u2047 Our six month year-to-date performance, highlighted by an 87.6% MCR, a 7% adjusted G&A ratio and a 3.4% after-tax margin were all squarely in line with our year-to-date expectations. \u2047 This allowed us to produce, as projected, 60% of our full year earnings guidance in the first half of the year. \u2047 And we accomplished all of this as we generated approximately 50% year-over-year premium revenue growth and successfully integrated businesses, representing approximately $5 billion in annual revenue. \u2047 In summary, we are pleased with our second quarter performance. \u2047 We executed well, delivered solid operating earnings and continue to drive our growth strategy. \u2047 Let me provide some commentary highlighting our second quarter performance. \u2047 First, I note that year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful than they would be in a typical year. \u2047 The second quarter of last year was the first full quarter of the COVID pandemic and was distorted by the significant positive net effect of COVID that characterized that early phase of the crisis. \u2047 In contrast, the current quarter was negatively impacted by the net effect of COVID. \u2047 In the second quarter, we produced premium revenue of $6.6 billion, a 4% increase over the first quarter of 2021, reflecting increased membership across our portfolio. \u2047 We ended the quarter with approximately 4.7 million members, an increase of 91,000 members over the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 Our Medicaid enrollment at the end of the quarter was approximately 3.9 million members, an increase of 69,000 over the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 This increase was due primarily to the continuing suspension of Medicaid redeterminations, although this growth catalyst seems to have moderated. \u2047 Our Medicare membership was 130,000 at the end of the quarter, an increase of 4,000, and in line with our growth plan. \u2047 Our Marketplace membership were 638,000 at the end of the quarter, representing growth of 18,000 over the first quarter of 2021 due to lower-than-expected attrition rates and membership additions during the extended open enrollment period. \u2047 Turning now to our medical margin performance in the second quarter by line of business. \u2047 Our Medicaid business achieved a medical care ratio of 89%. \u2047 While we are dealing with the impacts of the pandemic on utilization and medical cost, as well as the continuing temporary impact of the risk corridors, we continue to execute on the underlying fundamentals. \u2047 Our well-diversified portfolio of state contracts across all dimensions of the Medicaid product suite is performing well. \u2047 We continue to deliver high-quality care at a reasonable cost, particularly to high acuity populations. \u2047 The underlying rate environment is stable. \u2047 Our hallmark medical management capabilities continue to deliver appropriate clinical outcomes for our members, while achieving strong financial results. \u2047 Our Medicare results were excellent, having posted a medical care ratio of 87.6%. \u2047 We continue to produce excellent MCRs and margins in this portfolio of high-acuity lives in both our D-SNP product and the MMP programs. \u2047 Although our results were moderately depressed due to COVID utilization and despite the temporary risk score softness for the current year, the underlying results were squarely in line with our expectations. \u2047 Our Marketplace results have been significantly impacted by direct cost of COVID-related care as we posted a medical care ratio of 84.8% in the quarter. \u2047 Many of the new members we attracted were in regions disproportionately affected by COVID, including California, Michigan, Texas and Washington. \u2047 With nearly 500 basis points of pressure on the MCR in each of the first two quarters, we can and should achieve mid-single-digit pre-tax margins as the pandemic subsides. \u2047 In short, our second quarter and first half results across the entire portfolio continue to demonstrate our ability to produce excellent margins while growing top line revenue and successfully managing through the ongoing clinical and financial impacts of the pandemic. \u2047 Turning to our 2021 guidance, beginning with premium revenue. \u2047 For 2021, we now project premium revenue to be more than $25 billion, a 37% increase over the full year 2020 and a $1 billion increase from our previous guidance. \u2047 Specifically, our premium revenue guidance now includes Medicaid enrollment benefiting from the expected extension of the public health emergency period, and the associated pause on membership redeterminations, which we are now projecting through the end of the fourth quarter. \u2047 Recall, that for each month the public health emergency has extended, beyond the month of September, it increases our full year revenue outlook by $150 million. \u2047 Our updated guidance also contemplates the impact from retaining pharmacy-related premium revenue in California, New York and Kentucky due to postponement of, and changes to their respective pharmacy carve-out initiatives, and updated Marketplace revenue reflecting the strong enrollment and retention performance mentioned previously. \u2047 We expect to end 2021 with approximately 590,000 marketplace members. \u2047 We have excluded from our premium revenue guidance any impact of the Affinity and Cigna acquisitions. \u2047 We expect the Affinity acquisition to close in the fourth quarter, representing upside to our premium revenue guidance in 2021, and we expect the Cigna acquisition to close in January 2022. \u2047 Turning now to earnings guidance. \u2047 We are raising our full year 2021 earnings guidance and now expect to end the year with adjusted earnings of no less than $13.25 per share, an increase from our prior guidance of no less than $13 per share. \u2047 We remain on track for full year after-tax margins of at least 3%. \u2047 Specifically, the increase to our 2021 earnings guidance reflects our underlying outperformance, the increase in our revenue guidance and the associated margin, offset by a $1 increase in the net cost of COVID, which we now expect to be $2.50 per share for the full year. \u2047 We have been cautious in projecting our back half earnings due to a variety of exogenous factors. \u2047 The delta variant adds variability to any utilization forecast. \u2047 While highly contagious, the Delta variant disproportionately affects the unvaccinated. \u2047 Older and more vulnerable population cohorts have significantly higher vaccination rates. \u2047 As a result, the Delta variant cases result in proportionately fewer hospital admissions and lower per admission costs, moderating the potential impact. \u2047 In addition, it remains unknown how quickly and to what extent utilization will return to normal levels. \u2047 This will depend upon the strength of the economy, consumer behavior, provider capacity and the emergence of any new COVID variants. \u2047 There is an inherent level of uncertainty with regard to new marketplace member acuity levels and their susceptibility to COVID infection and the COVID-related risk-sharing corridors create an added element of variability. \u2047 Turning now to an update on our growth initiatives. \u2047 We continue to see many actionable opportunities in our acquisition pipeline, which remains an important aspect of our growth strategy. \u2047 Our M&A team is fully deployed and is working an active list of health plan targets in our core businesses. \u2047 Our acquisition strategy remains focused on buying stable membership and revenue streams, particularly focused on underperforming properties. \u2047 Our M&A integration team is also fully deployed and successfully migrating our acquired properties to Molina operating infrastructure and cost structure to ensure we deliver the earnings accretion we expected. \u2047 To date, we are on track to meet or exceed our earnings accretion commitments. \u2047 We continue to pursue to new Medicaid procurement opportunities. \u2047 We have contract winning capabilities, an aggressive in-state ground game and a winning proposal writing platform. \u2047 We are confident that we will continue to win new contracts that will contribute to our growth trajectory in 2022 and 2023. \u2047 Finally, some comments about the longer-term outlook for our business. \u2047 The current rate environment is stable and rational. \u2047 We now have confirmed data points to support the continued belief that the Medicaid risk sharing corridors, related to the declared public health emergency, will be eliminated as the COVID pandemic subsides. \u2047 Pandemic-related corridors have already been eliminated for the 2022 state fiscal years in California, New York, South Carolina and Michigan, with momentum toward similar outcomes in other states. \u2047 The current Medicare risk score shortfall phenomenon is temporary as our 2022 bids did fully account for the current assessment of next year's risk scores. \u2047 We continue to be bullish about the performance of our acquired businesses. \u2047 The operational integrations are proceeding as or better than planned, and we have high confidence in achieving our original accretion estimates and possibly even exceeding them. \u2047 In the context of the pandemic subsiding and our acquisitions maturing, the incremental embedded earnings power of the business as it exists today is meaningful. \u2047 With the increased outlook for the net negative effect of COVID, our incremental embedded earnings power is now more at $5 above our 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance. \u2047 In short, our pro forma run rate after the natural relaxation of these temporary constraints would produce adjusted earnings per share comfortably in the mid-teens and an after-tax margin of approximately 4%. \u2047 I look forward to sharing more about our future growth plans and longer-term strategy at our Investor Day on September 17. \u2047 At our Investor Day, we will provide you with an initial 2022 revenue outlook. \u2047 We will also provide you with an updated view of our long-term targets for revenue growth for our three lines of business, operating metrics for our three lines of business and enterprise margin, net income and earnings per share expectations. \u2047 And, as importantly, as has been our hallmark style, we will provide you with our detailed playbook for achieving those results. \u2047 We will continue not just to declare our goals, but to show you the transparency and specificity how we will achieve them. \u2047 Suffice it to say, we are an inherently high-growth businesses and have demonstrated an ability to grow the top line and maintain an attractive margin profile even during a global pandemic. \u2047 The political legislative and regulatory environments are all positive catalysts, and the social demographic profile of the U.S. population remains in significant need of the social safety net we manage. \u2047 As I conclude my remarks, I want to express my gratitude to our management team and our nearly 13,000 Molina colleagues. \u2047 Their skill, dedication and steadfast service continue to form the foundation for everything we have achieved and everything we will achieve in the years to come. \u2047 beginning with some detailed commentary about our second quarter results. \u2047 The net effect of COVID negatively impacted second quarter results by $77 million or approximately $1 a share. \u2047 This increased the second quarter MCR by 110 basis points to 88.4%. \u2047 The impact was higher than our expectations and negatively affected all three lines of business. \u2047 We experienced high COVID-related inpatient costs early in the quarter, which tapered off as the quarter progressed. \u2047 We also saw increases in professional and outpatient costs, which we attribute to what may be the return to normal pre-COVID utilization patterns. \u2047 In Medicaid, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $25 million and accounted for a 40 basis point increase that is included within our reported 89% MCR. \u2047 The first quarter Medicaid MCR had a 150-basis-point benefit due to COVID, which substantially explains the sequential increase in MCR. \u2047 We continue to expect the full year Medicaid MCR to be in the high 80s. \u2047 In Medicare, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $17 million, increasing the MCR by 200 basis points to 87.6% in the quarter. \u2047 The first quarter, Medicare MCR was increased by 400 basis points due to COVID. \u2047 Sequentially, the MCR improved driven by this lower net effect of COVID and improved underlying performance compared to the first quarter. \u2047 We anticipate a full year Medicare MCR in the high 80s. \u2047 In Marketplace, the net effect of COVID was a cost of approximately $35 million, increasing the MCR by 480 basis points. \u2047 The first quarter Marketplace MCR included a similar impact from the net effect of COVID, which increased the first quarter MCR by approximately 500 basis points. \u2047 The resulting sequential increase in MCR versus the first quarter reflects the normal seasonality associated with members reaching their policy deductible limits. \u2047 Due to the higher-than-expected impact from the net effect of COVID in the first half of the year, we now expect Marketplace pre-tax margins to moderate to low single digits. \u2047 We expect that when the COVID pandemic subsides, our Marketplace pre-tax margin will be squarely on target with our mid-single-digit pre-tax margin expectations. \u2047 Turning now to our balance sheet. \u2047 We received $145 million of subsidiary dividends in the quarter, which brought our parent company cash balance to $564 million at the end of the quarter. \u2047 We have ample capacity to fund the announced acquisitions. \u2047 At our current margins, we generate significant excess cash and additional debt capacity. \u2047 After funding our announced pending acquisitions, we will have year-end acquisition capacity of over $1.4 billion. \u2047 At the multiples we have paid in recent transactions, this gives us the ability to drive $3 billion to $4 billion in annualized revenue growth. \u2047 More importantly, at our current level of performance, this level of acquisition capacity is generated each year. \u2047 Our reserve approach remains consistent with prior quarters, and our reserve position remains strong. \u2047 Days in claims payable at the end of the quarter represented 48 days of medical cost expense, unchanged from the first quarter. \u2047 Prior year reserve development
