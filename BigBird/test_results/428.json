{"article": ["We appreciate you participating in our conference call today to discuss Flowserve's second quarter 2021 financial results. \u2047 These statements are based upon forecasts, expectations and other information available to management as of August 6, 2021, and they involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the company's control. \u2047 We are pleased with the performance and solid results in the second quarter, including adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, which represents a 32% sequential improvement and reflects our continued transformation progress. \u2047 We were encouraged by our bookings of $953 million, which is nearly an 18% year-over-year improvement. \u2047 At this level, Q2 was a momentum-building quarter for Flowserve, as our bookings inflected upward and we now have clear line of sight to earnings growth. \u2047 The higher level of bookings and our improved operational performance have provided us the confidence to raise our outlook further for the full year. \u2047 Our revised adjusted earnings per share guidance is now $1.45 to $1.65 for 2021. \u2047 Since the start of the pandemic, we indicated that recovery in our end markets was expected to be directly correlated with the progress being made with COVID-19. \u2047 Each country and geography are at different stages in fighting the pandemic. \u2047 But on a global basis, a clear pattern has emerged as countries roll out vaccines, COVID cases decline dramatically and then mobility and consumption begin to improve. \u2047 This, in turn, drives customer spending for nearly all of our end markets. \u2047 We are confident in our ability to continue to grow the Flowserve enterprise and ultimately restore our bookings to pre-pandemic levels in the coming quarters. \u2047 There are several factors that contribute to our confidence in the outlook. \u2047 First, we expect to continue to grow our MRO and aftermarket bookings. \u2047 As countries emerge from COVID, we are seeing higher utilization rates in our customers' facilities, which necessitates increased parts replacement units and service activity. \u2047 Additionally, our distribution partners are just now beginning to replenish their inventory levels. \u2047 After about six quarters of destocking, we are now expecting these distributors to rebuild their inventory levels over the coming quarters. \u2047 Second, we believe major project activity will emerge and begin to recover in the back half of 2021 and into 2022. \u2047 In the early part of last year, we had very good visibility to a significant amount of project activity that was expected to be awarded during that year. \u2047 Most of those projects were put on hold as operators were both assessing the COVID impact and reducing their capital spending budgets. \u2047 Today, we are working with many of those same customers to bring those projects forward, as the economic environment has improved dramatically over the past several months and additionally, our activity with EPCs is increased significantly this year. \u2047 Finally, we see energy transition theme as a significant opportunity for Flowserve. \u2047 To date, actual spending in this area is still very [Technical Issues] but we expect it to grow substantially in the quarters and years ahead based on the commitments of our customers -- the commitments that our customers are making as well as from the potential for increased regulation and costs associated with emissions. \u2047 Flowserve is no stranger to this type of work, and I'll talk further about this growing market later in the call. \u2047 Even as the outlook and trends look promising, predicting the exact timing associated with these opportunities is still challenging. \u2047 The Delta variant is causing concerns for Flowserve operations and for our customers. \u2047 We have remained diligent and focused on our safety protocols, and we have successfully limited pandemic impacts at most of our global facilities during the quarter. \u2047 The recent upturn in COVID cases in the Americas due to the Delta variant has the potential to impact our return to office. \u2047 However, we do not believe that the latest COVID trends will negatively impact our business and growth outlook at this time. \u2047 Unfortunately, we did experience significant disruption in our Indian operations during the quarter. \u2047 As a reminder, we have three large manufacturing facilities and several smaller locations in India. \u2047 The good news is that we have seen tremendous improvements over the past several weeks, and we are currently operating at about 80% associate participation in these facilities, which is up from 20% to 30% participation that we experienced for most of the second quarter. \u2047 Our Indian-based suppliers were also challenged in the quarter, which presented modest headwinds for us, but our supply chain team has done a good job mitigating the impact and leveraging our global suppliers to minimize disruptions. \u2047 Let me now turn to our second quarter bookings. \u2047 We are pleased with the 17.9% year-over-year increase, which brought this quarter's total bookings to $953 million. \u2047 Both original equipment and aftermarket bookings grew in the 17% to 19% range. \u2047 We were very pleased to have delivered almost $525 million of aftermarket awards this quarter, returning to pre-pandemic bookings levels for this part of our business. \u2047 Each of our core end markets delivered year-over-year growth with the biggest drivers being oil and gas and chemical, which increased 39% and 19%, respectively. \u2047 On a regional basis, we saw solid growth across the globe with the exception of the Asia Pacific market, which was negatively impacted by India's COVID resurgence in a more difficult compare period. \u2047 Our bookings performance this quarter was driven almost exclusively by our aftermarket and MRO business, which represented a large volume of small awards. \u2047 In fact, we only secured one award that exceeded $10 million, where FCD booked a $12 million nuclear power order in North America. \u2047 To achieve this level of bookings without any large projects in the mix is an encouraging sign for future growth. \u2047 We expected larger project spending to lag aftermarket and MRO work, and it has. \u2047 And we are now confident in the return of project investment later this year and into early 2022 across our end markets. \u2047 Our project funnel continues to grow and is up nearly 25% compared to this time last year, driven by the feedback we obtained from customer discussions, insights gains from EPC bidding and backlogs and our interaction on the delayed projects, which we originally expected to be released in 2020. \u2047 We continued to anticipate bookings in this $950 million range in this year's third and fourth quarters, assuming continued progress with COVID. \u2047 At this level, we should see significant bookings growth in the next two quarters relative to the 2020 comparative periods. \u2047 Delivering these level of bookings or higher would position Flowserve well to deliver a strong 2022 financial performance. \u2047 Our results this quarter also helped drive strong first half results for 2021. \u2047 Our adjusted decremental margins for the first six months was just 13% with our improved market outlook. \u2047 We remain focused on returning Flowserve to growth while driving margin expansion and increased returns. \u2047 Looking at Flowserve's second quarter financial results in greater detail, our reported earnings per share of $0.35 increased significantly over the prior year period. \u2047 In addition, the quality of our earnings also improved, with after-tax adjusted items declining from $61 million in the prior year period to just $3 million this quarter. \u2047 Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.37, excluded just $0.02 of net items, including realignment expenses, the logo line FX charges and a gain on sale of business. \u2047 We were pleased with these results, particularly considering the impact of COVID-related headwinds of about $0.02, primarily from our Indian facilities, as Scott discussed. \u2047 Second quarter revenue of $898 million was down 2.9% or 7.1% on a constant currency basis. \u2047 The decrease was primarily due to the 6.1% decline in original equipment sales, driven by FPD's 19% decrease, but partially offset by FCD's 12% increase. \u2047 As a reminder, FPD entered 2021 with an OE backlog down roughly 25% versus the start of last year. \u2047 Aftermarket sales were relatively resilient, up 0.3%, but mix in composition as FCD's 11% increase was mostly offset by FPD's 1% decline. \u2047 Our second quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 31.4%, primarily due to OE sales decline and related under absorption, including the previously mentioned COVID impact, partially offset by a 2% mix shift toward higher-margin aftermarket sales. \u2047 Sequentially, adjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points on a solid 53% incremental margin performance. \u2047 On a reported basis, gross margin increased 180 basis points to 31%, primarily due to a $23 million decrease in realignment charges as we took significant cost actions in last year's second quarter. \u2047 Second quarter adjusted SG&A increased $13.9 million to $209 million versus prior year, due largely to foreign exchange movements as well as a return of certain temporary cost benefits realized in 2020, such as the absence of travel that has begun to return. \u2047 Reported SG&A decreased $18.5 million versus prior year, where realignment charges declined $27 million versus prior year. \u2047 Second quarter adjusted operating margins of 8.5% increased 40 basis points sequentially, but declined 280 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased under-absorption related to FPD's OE revenue decline. \u2047 FCD's adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points year-over-year to 13.3%, driven by revenue growth and top SG&A -- and tight SG&A cost control, which were partially offset by mix headwinds. \u2047 Second quarter reported operating margin increased 330 basis points year-over-year to 8%, including the $57 million reduction of adjusted items. \u2047 Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 14% was driven by our income mix globally and favorable resolutions of certain foreign audits in the quarter. \u2047 The full year adjusted tax rate is expected to normalize in the low 20% range. \u2047 Turning to cash and liquidity. \u2047 Our second quarter cash balance of $630 million decreased $29 million sequentially as solid free cash flow of $14 million was more than offset by a return of $38 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. \u2047 Flowserve's quarter-end liquidity position remained strong at nearly $1.4 billion, including $739 million of capacity available under our undrawn senior credit facility. \u2047 Turning to working capital. \u2047 It was a $34 million use of cash in the second quarter, primarily due to accrued liabilities and timing of certain payments, partially offset by modest improvement in accounts receivable and inventory, including our contract assets and liabilities. \u2047 The performance was much improved from last year's second quarter when the COVID-related impacts and seasonal inventory build resulted in a use of cash $36 million higher than this quarter's. \u2047 Taking a look at primary working capital as a percent of sales. \u2047 We saw a modest 20 basis point sequential decrease to 29.4%, driven primarily by accounts payable as well as a 4-day improvement in DSO versus the first quarter. \u2047 Despite our backlog increase of $66 million, some progress delays due to COVID and the proactive purchasing of certain inventory items to mitigate potential supply chain issues, we were pleased that our inventory, including contract assets and liabilities, decreased a modest $4 million sequentially. \u2047 Working capital remains a top priority for us, and we're confident that the foundation has been laid for further improvement in the second half of the year as demand-related sales volumes increase result in further reduction of inventory levels. \u2047 We remain committed to delivering free cash flow conversion in excess of 100% of net income for the second consecutive year. \u2047 Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2021. \u2047 Based on the combination of our strong first half bookings, driven mostly by shorter-cycle aftermarket and MRO activities and visibility into improving end markets, Flowserve was pleased to increase our adjusted earnings per share guidance range for the full year to $1.45 to $1.65. \u2047 In terms of cadence, we expect volumes to increase sequentially in the third quarter and to deliver our typical fourth quarter seasonality. \u2047 Our adjusted earnings per share target range continues to exclude expected realignment expenses of approximately $25 million as well as below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of potential other discrete items which may occur during the year. \u2047 Beyond adjusted EPS, we now expect less of a revenue decline versus 2020. \u2047 Our guidance is now for 2021 revenues to be 2% to 4% down compared to last year versus the prior guidance of down 3% to 5%. \u2047 In terms of other guidance metrics, our net interest expense remains unchanged at $55 million to $60 million, and we modestly lowered our adjusted tax rate guidance to 21% to 23%. \u2047 From a booking standpoint, we now expect full year 2021 bookings to increase in excess of 10% year-over-year versus our previous outlook of mid-single-digit growth. \u2047 Additionally, we believe a majority of this increase will come from our aftermarket and shorter-cycle MRO original equipment products, where the associated revenue may be recognized in 2021. \u2047 Our expected major cash usages in 2021 remain in line with prior guidance, including dividends and share repurchases of roughly $120 million, capital expenditures in the $70 million to $80 million range and funding our modest remaining realignment programs. \u2047 In conclusion, with our solid first half operating performance and improved market outlook, we look forward to continuing the momentum through the second half of 2021 and expect to be well positioned to drive margin expansion and earnings growth in 2022. \u2047 Let me close with an update on our energy transition strategy and our outlook for the remainder of the year. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, Flowserve is well positioned for energy transition. \u2047 In fact, energy transition and decarbonization activities have been a part of our offering for the last few decades, where Flowserve has a demonstrated foundation in product portfolio to capitalize on this growing market. \u2047 We estimate that even before the recent increased awareness driven by the global pandemic, Flowserve is delivering $100 million to $150 million annually of equipment and services into energy transition-related work, including areas like energy efficiency enhancements, upgrades, retrofits, carbon and emissions reductions, solar power facilities, biofriendly processes and lithium and hydrogen work. \u2047 Equally important, we have been a valued partner to the customers and the industries that have among the highest opportunities available from energy transition, and we are absolutely committed to supporting them today and through their energy transition journey. \u2047 With increased government regulation and potential costs on greenhouse gas emissions, the financial community's increase focused on ESG metrics and the individual companies' public environmental commitments, it is clear to us that energy transition represents a substantial growth opportunity for Flowserve. \u2047 The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that nearly $60 trillion will be invested over the next decade, with almost"], "gold_summary": ["flowserve q2 adjusted earnings
