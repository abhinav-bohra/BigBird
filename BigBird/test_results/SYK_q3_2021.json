{"article": ["For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Preston with an update on the trends we saw during the quarter. \u2047 Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before opening the call to Q&A. \u2047 For the quarter, we posted organic sales growth of 8.4% versus 2019, driven by excellent double-digit growth from our MedSurg and Neurotechnology businesses, but this was offset by softer sales of hip, knee and spine due to the resurgence of COVID-19. \u2047 A slowdown in deferrable procedures primarily impacted the US and worsened through the quarter. \u2047 While our implant businesses were challenged, we saw strong results for our Mako product technology and capital products across our MedSurg portfolio. \u2047 In addition, we had strong performances from our more emergent businesses, including our core trauma business and another standout performance by Neurovascular. \u2047 International organic growth of 12%, again, outpaced growth in the US, representing robust performances and lessening impacts of COVID-19 across most major geographies, including strong results across Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. \u2047 Our year-to-date organic growth is 7.6%. \u2047 And with the continued uncertainty related to COVID recovery as well as healthcare staffing shortages, we are updating our full year organic sales growth guidance to 7% to 8% compared to 2019. \u2047 Our capital equipment order book remains strong, and we are well positioned for the eventual procedure recovery. \u2047 Our adjusted earnings per share grew 15% versus 2019, and we continued our focus on driving cash flow, leading to a year-to-date cash conversion of 87%. \u2047 The earnings per share growth, although solid, was lower than our expectations and is reflected in our updated guidance, which Glenn will elaborate on. \u2047 Meanwhile, we are pleased with our cash flow performance, which provides us with additional flexibility for future M&A opportunities. \u2047 While the quarter did not progress as we had anticipated due to the Delta variant, we remain confident in the outlook for our businesses as evidenced by our strong international MedSurg and Neurotechnology performances. \u2047 We expect these businesses to continue to perform at high levels with the uncertainty most concentrated in deferrable procedures in the United States. \u2047 We continue to feel bullish about our longer-term prospects as the pandemic recedes with our proven strategy and strong fundamentals. \u2047 We are excited to share more with you at our upcoming Analyst Day on November 18th. \u2047 My comments today will focus on providing additional insights into the current environment, including how certain products and geographies performed during the quarter. \u2047 In addition, I will provide an update on the continued integration of Wright Medical, including the performance of our combined trauma and extremities business. \u2047 During the quarter, significant spikes of the COVID-19 Delta variant drove increased infections and hospitalizations that require higher hospital bed utilization, which ultimately led to the deferral of elective procedures. \u2047 In addition to increased hospitalization, hospital staffing shortages also pressured procedural volumes throughout the quarter. \u2047 This primarily impacted our implant-related businesses including hips, knees and spine, which can be, in many cases, deferred for a period of time. \u2047 However, the disease states that we treat are degenerative and the patients that defer their procedures will eventually return to have those procedures completed. \u2047 The impact on elective procedures was more pronounced in the United States than on other geographies outside the United States. \u2047 Within the United States, there were areas of disruption in most states but disruption was more widespread in the Southeast and Southwest portions of the country, impacting major markets like Florida and Texas throughout the quarter. \u2047 Other markets around the world, including China, Japan and Australia experienced intermittent lockdowns throughout the quarter, which also drove uneven results across our implant-related businesses in those markets. \u2047 During the quarter, Europe, which was more impacted by COVID in previous quarters, had impressive organic growth compared to 2019. \u2047 COVID related hospitalizations in the United States began to trend upwards toward the end of July and then progressively worsened peaking at beginning of September. \u2047 At the end of the quarter, infection and hospitalization rates were declining in impacted regions and has continued into October. \u2047 As a result, we are beginning to see some improvements in our more impacted businesses through the first few weeks of October. \u2047 However, we expect the recovery will be partially muted by discontinued hospital staffing challenges and ongoing COVID related volatility. \u2047 Our assumption for the fourth quarter is that deferrable procedures will gradually return, starting with a low base in October before returning to more normal levels by the end of the quarter. \u2047 As a result, we expect that the fourth quarter growth rates for our more deferrable businesses will be similar to the third quarter. \u2047 Despite the ongoing challenges with elective procedures, we had strong performances in our more emerging businesses like Neurovascular, which grew strong double digits compared to 2019 as a result of continued market expansion and ongoing global demand for our innovative technologies. \u2047 In addition, demand for our capital equipment remains healthy as evidenced by our continued strong sales performance and robust order book for small and large capital products, including our surgical technologies, emergency care and neurosurgical businesses. \u2047 The ongoing strength in capital is also reflected in the continued demand for our Mako robotic technology. \u2047 Our industry-leading Mako robot continues to help surgeons improve patient outcomes by knowing more and cutting less. \u2047 This trend across capital is expected to continue as hospitals take advantage of flexible financing and prioritize capital products like those within our portfolio that are critical to providing emergency care, driving profitable procedures and ensuring safe working environments for caregivers and patients. \u2047 Turning to the Wright Medical integration, which continues to progress in all regions and functions. \u2047 United States commercial integration has moved past the sales force realignment and is now focused on continued business process improvements and system efficiencies. \u2047 The teams have also developed long term product pipeline strategy. \u2047 Outside the United States, we continue to work through integration activities, including sales force and indirect channel alignment across all key geographic regions. \u2047 Overall, we remain pleased with the progress and the pace of integration over the past year. \u2047 Including Wright Medical, the combined US Trauma and Extremities business has grown 8.1% year-to-date. \u2047 The year-to-date growth in the United States has been driven by strong double digit growth in both our core trauma and upper extremities businesses, reflecting the execution of the sales integration in the United States. \u2047 Outside the United States, sales have declined 3.8% year-to-date, driven by timing of distributor conversions in Latin America and Asia Pacific and declines in our legacy Trauson and Trauma business in China as a result of the provincial tendering process. \u2047 Considering the latest results, ongoing COVID related volatility and the provincial tenders in China, we now expect our combined Trauma and Extremities business to grow mid single digits for the full year. \u2047 Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and the related drivers. \u2047 As a reminder, we are providing our comments in comparison to 2019 as it is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020. \u2047 Our organic sales growth was 8.4% in the quarter. \u2047 The third quarter included the same number of average selling days as Q3 2019 and Q3 2020. \u2047 Compared to 2019, the two year impact from pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 2.2%. \u2047 Versus Q3 2020, pricing was 0.7% unfavorable. \u2047 Foreign currency had a favorable 1.2% impact on sales. \u2047 Our MedSurg and Neurotech businesses saw another very strong quarter, continuing the growth momentum of the second quarter with double digit growth in both segments. \u2047 Our Orthopedics and Spine businesses have been adversely impacted by increases in hospitalization rates starting in early August, especially in the US as a result of the Delta variant. \u2047 The corresponding impact on elective procedures has significantly slowed the recovery in our Orthopedics and Spine implant businesses. \u2047 For the quarter, US organic sales increased 7.1%, reflecting the continued strong demand for Mako, instruments, medical and neurovascular products. \u2047 International organic sales showed strong growth of 12%, impacted by positive sales momentum in Europe, Australia, Canada and emerging markets. \u2047 Our adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $2.20 increased 15.2% from 2019, reflecting sales growth, gross margin expansion and a lower quarterly effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of business mix and higher interest charges resulting from the Wright acquisition. \u2047 Our third quarter earnings per share was positively impacted from foreign currency by $0.04. \u2047 Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. \u2047 Orthopaedics had constant currency sales growth of 19.9% and organic sales growth of 2%, including organic growth of 1% in the US. \u2047 This reflects the impact of the slowdown in elective procedures as a result of the Delta variant, which primarily impacted our hip and knee implant businesses. \u2047 Our knee business grew 0.9% organically in the US, reflecting the previously mentioned impact on elective procedures, offset by continued adoption of our robotic platform for total knee procedures. \u2047 Our US trauma business grew 8.8%, reflecting solid performances across the portfolio. \u2047 Other ortho grew 19.8% in the US, primarily reflecting demand for our Mako robotic platform, partially offset by declines in bone cement. \u2047 Internationally, Orthopaedics grew 4.1% organically, which reflects the strong performances in Europe and the momentum in Mako internationally, somewhat offset by the increased impact of restrictions imposed on elective procedures due to COVID, especially in Japan. \u2047 For the quarter, our Trauma and Extremities business, which includes Writer Medical delivered 3.2% growth on a comparable basis. \u2047 In the US, comparable growth was 7.4%, which included double digital growth in our upper extremities business. \u2047 In the quarter, MedSurg had constant currency and organic sales growth of 12%,,which included 12% US organic growth as well. \u2047 Instruments had US organic sales growth of 15.9%, led by double digit growth in their orthopedic implants and surgical technology businesses, which include power tools, waste management, smoke evacuation and skin closure products. \u2047 Endoscopy had US organic sales growth of 10.6%, reflecting strong performances across their portfolio, including video and general surgery products and strong double digit growth of their communications and sports medicine businesses. \u2047 The Medical division had US organic growth of 12.5%, reflecting double-digit performances in its emergency care and Sage businesses. \u2047 Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 12%, reflecting strong growth in the Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical businesses across Europe and Australia. \u2047 Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 11.8%. \u2047 This growth reflects double digit performances in our neurovascular, neurosurgical and interventional spine businesses. \u2047 Our Neurovascular business had particularly strong growth of approximately 26% and makes up roughly 30% of this segment. \u2047 Our US Neurotech business posted an organic growth of 11.8%, reflecting strong product growth in Sonopet iQ, Bipolar Forceps and Bone Mill. \u2047 Our US Neurovascular business had significant growth in all categories of products, including hemorrhagic, flow diversion and ischemic. \u2047 Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 24.6%. \u2047 This performance was driven by strong neurotech demand in China and other emerging markets as well as Europe and Australia. \u2047 Now I will focus on operating highlights in the third quarter. \u2047 Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was favorable approximately 55 basis points from third quarter 2019. \u2047 Compared to the third quarter in 2019, gross margin was primarily impacted by acquisitions, which was partially offset by business mix and price. \u2047 Adjusted R&D spending was 6.7% of sales, reflecting our continued focus on innovation. \u2047 Our SG&A was 34.1% of sales, which was slightly negative as compared to the third quarter of 2019. \u2047 This reflects continued cost discipline and fixed cost leverage, offset by ramping of certain expenses, hiring to support future growth and the dilutive impact of the Wright Medical acquisition. \u2047 In summary, for the quarter, our adjusted operating margin was 25.4% of sales, which is approximately the same as third quarter 2019. \u2047 This performance primarily resulted from our positive sales momentum, offset by the dilutive impact of acquisitions, primarily Wright Medical. \u2047 Related to other income and expenses compared to the third quarter in 2019, we saw a decline in investment income earned on deposits and interest expense increases related to our debt outstanding for the funding of the Wright Medical acquisition. \u2047 Our third quarter had an adjusted effective tax rate of 14%, which was impacted by our mix of US, non-US income and favorable discrete items during the quarter. \u2047 Our year-to-date effective tax rate is 14.8%. \u2047 For the year, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 15% to 15.5%. \u2047 Focusing on the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities and total debt of $12.7 billion. \u2047 year-to-date, we have paid down $1.2 billion of debt. \u2047 In October, we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility and increased that facility from $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion. \u2047 Turning to cash flow. \u2047 Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $2.3 billion. \u2047 This performance reflects the results of earnings and continued focus on working capital management. \u2047 Based on our performance in the third quarter, the continued volatility experienced as a result of COVID, procedural delays in hospital staffing shortages as well as uncertainty around the pace of recovery in the fourth quarter, we expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%. \u2047 As it relates to sales expectations for Wright Medical, we now expect comparable growth for Trauma and Extremities to be in the mid single digits for the full year when compared to the combined results for 2019. \u2047 If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the full year will be positively impacted by approximately 1%. \u2047 Adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be positively impacted by approximately $0.05 to $0.10 in the full year and this is included in our revised guidance range. \u2047 Based on our performance in the first nine months and including consideration of the aforementioned volatility impacting the recovery of elective procedures and the full year Wright Medical impact, we now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $9.08 to $9.15. \u2047 And now I will open the call for Q&A. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $2.20.  \u2047  expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in range of 7% to 8% from 2019.  \u2047  expect 2021 adjusted net
