{"article": ["I'm Hallie Miller, Evercore's Head of Investor Relations. \u2047 At this time, it is uncertain how long our business will be negatively affected by COVID-19 and the associated economics and market downturn. \u2047 These factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Evercore's filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. \u2047 We continue to believe that it is important to evaluate Evercore's performance on an annual basis. \u2047 As we've noted previously, our results for any particular quarter are influenced by the timing of transaction closings. \u2047 It is certainly a very different world today compared to our last earnings call in January. \u2047 The vast majority of our firm is working remotely, and we are conducting our earnings call from widely varied locations. \u2047 I'll comment on our first quarter results in a few minutes; but first, I want to talk about our firm and how we have approached the COVID-19 pandemic from both an operational and a business standpoint. \u2047 Our global team has performed extraordinarily well in very challenging conditions and adapted quickly to our remote working arrangements. \u2047 Despite working from more than 1,800 offices globally, we are effectively communicating with our clients and each other. \u2047 Roger, John, and I could not be more proud of our entire team. \u2047 As we settle into our current work arrangement and acclimate to the current environment, John, Roger and I, and the rest of the management team are focused on four very important priorities. \u2047 First, assuring the health and safety of our team and their families. \u2047 Second, pivoting our services to address the evolving needs of our corporate, institutional investor, and wealth management clients. \u2047 Third, operating collaboratively, effectively and securely, leveraging the technology in both new and old ways. \u2047 And fourth, maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet. \u2047 The economic issue that the United States and much of the world faces today is the rapid and unprecedented increase in unemployment, and the equally rapid decline in economic activity. \u2047 The statistics related to unemployment are truly sobering. \u2047 22 million Americans alone have lost their jobs in the last four weeks and millions more around the world have been similarly affected. \u2047 All of us at Evercore feel deeply for those who are out of work because of this pandemic. \u2047 Their hardship pains us. \u2047 The sharp increase in unemployment undoubtedly pre-stages a substantial decline in global GDP, probably starting in the first quarter and most certainly a deep decline in the second quarter and potentially in the third quarter as well. \u2047 We have seen governments and central banks respond in an aggressive and unprecedented way with monetary and fiscal stimulus to mitigate and ultimately reverse the economic decline. \u2047 And we are confident that over time the economies around the world will recover but it will take time and the recovery almost certainly will not be as sharp as the decline. \u2047 As a consequence, we expect that our business will be negatively affected in the coming quarters. \u2047 Advisory business, M&A is our largest revenue contributor and we expect that business to be negatively affected for some period of time. \u2047 As John will describe in his remarks, the conditions typically require for a strong M&A activity currently are not present. \u2047 Additionally, equity underwriting has virtually disappeared since mid-February. \u2047 So, we anticipate a strong return once market stabilizes, similar to what we saw in the second and third and fourth quarters of 2009, following the depths of the global financial crisis. \u2047 So, these are the negatives. \u2047 On the other hand, the current environment has created opportunities for us as we have rapidly redirected our advisory efforts to adjust to the evolving needs of our clients. \u2047 The investments that we have made in our platform over the last several years, both to broaden and diversify our capabilities and to expand our coverage of key sectors in geographies, have significantly expanded the scope of our expertise and are allowing us to continue to provide independent and trusted advice to our clients on the topics that are most relevant to them today. \u2047 Our restructuring, debt and equity capital markets advisory businesses are going flat-out. \u2047 Additionally, the volatility and increased trading volume of the equity markets has driven a strong increase in secondary revenues in our equities business. \u2047 These businesses are smaller than our M&A advisory business and it will take time before the increase in revenue related to restructuring and debt and equity capital markets advisory activities are recognized. \u2047 As a consequence, the increase in activity in these areas will not come quickly enough or be of sufficient scale to offset the expected near-term weakness in M&A. \u2047 Normally, at this point, I comment on our backlog. \u2047 It's way too early in this location to know the overall effect on our backlogs as they are in transition. \u2047 Restructuring and debt advisory is building rapidly while M&A transactions are currently being delayed, postponed or put on hold, as buyers and sellers assess the duration and severity of the downturn. \u2047 The dialog around M&A however, certainly has not halted as the dialog with financial sponsors is increasing and well capitalized and liquid companies are opportunistically exploring either long sought after assets or new ideas. \u2047 While we cannot be sure of the duration and severity of the downturn, I believe that as a relatively young and highly entrepreneurial firm, are ready for the challenges presented by the current environment and that we have already responded effectively. \u2047 If we continue to work collaboratively and adapt to the changing needs of our clients and communities, we will emerge from this period well positioned for future long-term growth and market share gain. \u2047 Let me now talk about our financial performance in the first quarter. \u2047 We reported the second best first quarter revenues in our history, indicative of the revenue generating power of our franchise and our business model in more normal time. \u2047 Adjusted net revenues of $435 million increased 4% versus the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 In aggregate, our total revenues of $436 million from our investment banking businesses, advisory, underwriting and commissions, increased 10% versus the first quarter of last year. \u2047 Advisory fees of $359 million, our largest revenue source, increased 10% compared to the first quarter of 2019, and held up very well compared to our larger competitors, almost all of whom experienced double-digit declines between 10% and 20% in their advisory revenues. \u2047 As a general matter, previously announced transactions closed as expected in the quarter. \u2047 These results are especially impressive considering the fact that the dollar value of announced M&A transactions globally declined 24% in the first quarter and the dollar value of closed M&A transaction fell by 37% compared to the quarter a year ago. \u2047 Due to the strength of our advisory revenues compared to the declines experienced by our larger competitors, we expect to increase again our market share of advisory fees among all publicly reporting firms on a trailing 12-month basis, the 8.6% from 7.9% for the 12-month period ending March 31, 2019, and from 8.3% at the end of 2019. \u2047 Underwriting fees were $21.1 million, a decline of 22% from the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 This business had a very strong start to the year. \u2047 But as COVID-19 began to spread, activity in this business essentially halted in mid-February. \u2047 Commissions and related fees of $55.4 million increased 32% versus the first quarter of 2019 or our best first quarter since 2016. \u2047 Our Equities team benefited from the heightened volatility and equity trading volumes associated with the market downturn that began in mid-February. \u2047 Asset management and administration fees from our consolidated businesses were $15.3 million, an increase of 7% versus the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Our first quarter compensation ratio of 62% was impacted by the revenue decline in other revenue, caused by the shift from gains to losses associated with the investment portfolio that hedges a portion of our deferred cash compensation plan. \u2047 The compensation ratios for the first quarter of 2020 and 2019 are essentially the same when the impact of these gains and losses are excluded. \u2047 We historically have reflected a compensation ratio in the first quarter based on our best estimates for the full year revenue expectations and compensation requirements and reassess that compensation ratio each quarter to address changes in these expectations. \u2047 Given the uncertainty of the current environment, our first quarter compensation ratio is reflective only of our first quarter performance. \u2047 We will reevaluate the appropriate amount of compensation and our compensation ratio on a quarterly basis, as we always have, but the likelihood of change will certainly be higher in the current year than in other years, due to the highly uncertain environment for the next two to three quarters. \u2047 Non-compensation costs were $82.8 million, up 2.7% from the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 The increase reflects higher occupancy costs and expenses associated with certain technology initiatives, many of which are supporting our successful work from home operations today. \u2047 The increase in these costs was partly offset by lower professional fees and travel expenses. \u2047 As we have reported to you before, we have started a number of initiatives to reduce costs at the end of last year, and these results begin to demonstrate our progress. \u2047 Bob will comment further on this. \u2047 Adjusted operating income and adjusted net income of $82.5 million and $57.8 million declined 14% and 29% respectively, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21 declined 27% versus the first quarter of 2019. \u2047 Here again, our change in operating income was affected meaningfully by the changes in the value of the hedges for our deferred compensation plans rather than any change in our compensation philosophy, and the larger change in net income and earnings per share was significantly affected by the higher tax rate in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to 2019. \u2047 Bob will discuss this in his remarks. \u2047 We remain focused on our capital management strategy, and returned $178.1 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and repurchase of 1.8 million shares at an average price of $76.57. \u2047 Our commitment to offset the dilution associated with equity grants has been substantially completed for the year, so any additional share repurchases in 2020 will be dependent on future earnings and maintaining our strong liquidity position. \u2047 Our Board declared a dividend of $0.58, consistent with prior quarters and reflective of our results for the quarter. \u2047 Our Board and management will continue to evaluate the dividend on a quarterly basis, as the effect of COVID-19 virus on revenues becomes more clear. \u2047 Although the current expectation, absent a steep decline in revenues and a significant reduction in our cash position, is that our current dividend will be maintained. \u2047 Our first quarter results demonstrate the continued strength of Evercore's franchise in more normal time. \u2047 In each of the last two years, we have generated revenues in excess of $2 billion and experienced operating margins that averaged in excess of 25%. \u2047 These results were produced by essentially the same team that we have on the field today, and we really don't see any reason why those results can't be repeated when normal and less disruptive conditions return. \u2047 The market environment for much of the first quarter continued to be supportive of M&A and strategic capital raising transactions in most sectors and geographic regions. \u2047 As such, the rapid change in environment associated with the global spread of COVID-19 is not generally evident in our first quarter results. \u2047 As Ralph mentioned earlier, many of the transactions we announced continued to move toward completion throughout the quarter. \u2047 Yet today, the conditions necessary for a healthy M&A market, including stable equity valuations, readily available credit, and CEO confidence and optimism do not exist. \u2047 Demand for restructuring and, more broadly, debt advisory and liability management advisory has dramatically increased in the current environment, as companies focus on their most immediate liquidity needs. \u2047 Financial sponsors continue to have record levels of dry powder. \u2047 But with valuation so uncertain, it is difficult for them to put money to work at the moment. \u2047 However, opportunities for innovative assignments do exist and our investment in and build out of our financial sponsors team continues. \u2047 The cash equities business tends to perform better when volatility and volumes increase. \u2047 The VIX spiked dramatically late in the first quarter, and it remains elevated. \u2047 Clearly, three weeks into the second quarter, we faced challenging conditions. \u2047 CEOs are assessing a volatile and uncertain environment and dialogues are more focused on operations and liquidity requirements as opposed to strategic and growth initiatives. \u2047 Volatility in the market remains high and valuations are in flux. \u2047 Many activists have dialed back on large campaigns and are starting fee renewal, paralleling the M&A slowdown, and access to public capital is challenging. \u2047 Despite these more challenging conditions, we are confident that the breadth and capabilities that we have, position us well with clients to evaluate all situations, and our independent advice model will be of increasing value in the current environment. \u2047 We are focusing our efforts on maintaining constant and high quality dialogs with our clients to assist them in the areas where they currently seek advice, and are working hard to build relationships with new clients, looking to broaden their relationship with an independent advisor. \u2047 When the markets begin to show sustained stability, we believe that we will begin to see an increase in proactive attention to strategic matters. \u2047 Until then, we are actively communicating and engaging with all of our clients to help them navigate the current environment and be there for them when the eventual recovery comes. \u2047 Our performance during the first quarter was solid despite increasingly challenging conditions as the quarter progressed and came to a close. \u2047 We sustained our number-one ranking for volume of announced transactions over the past 12 months, both globally and in the U.S., among independent firms. \u2047 Among all firms, we were once again number-six globally and number-four in the U.S. \u2047 We continued to advise on a large number of the most prominent M&A assignments of the quarter, including three of the four largest transactions in the United States. \u2047 Our underwriting business had a very strong first six weeks of the quarter and we are pleased to have served as a joint bookrunner on two of the top-three largest IPOs priced during the quarter. \u2047 However, activity has significantly decreased since mid-February. \u2047 Our Private Capital Advisory business performed well during the quarter and completed assignments already in progress. \u2047 Our Equities business, had a very strong quarter as a result of the heightened volatility and volume associated with the market downturn precipitated by COVID-19. \u2047 The strategic investments in senior talent we made last year have contributed to our success. \u2047 We've been able to increase our connectivity with investors and advisory clients and provide valuable insights during a period of significant market dislocations. \u2047 Our healthcare analysts are digging deep into the science of COVID-19 and collaborating with our macro and other fundamental analysts to determine investment implications across many different sectors. \u2047 Our macro analysts are also providing insights on government stimulus programs and the overall state of the economies worldwide"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports qtrly adjusted earnings per share $1.21.  \u2047  compname reports first quarter 2020 results; quarterly dividend of $0.58 per
