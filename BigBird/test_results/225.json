{"article": ["Yesterday, on the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted related materials on our website at allstateinvestors.com. \u2047 Our management team is here to provide perspective on these results. \u2047 Let's start on Slide two. \u2047 Today, we're going to link operating results and strategy in order to show how we expect to continue to generate shareholder value. \u2047 So Allstate's strategy has two components: increase personal profit liability market share; and expand protection solutions, which are shown in the two ovals on the left. \u2047 The Transformative Growth plan to increase market share and personal profit liability has four components. \u2047 This strategy will drive market valuation by executing, innovating and focusing on long-term value creation. \u2047 So in the first half of the year, we executed well for customers, we executed well financially and for shareholders, as you can see on the right-hand panel. \u2047 Property-Liability market share increased by approximately one percentage point due to the acquisition of National General. \u2047 Allstate Protection Plans continue to grow rapidly by broadening the product offering to include appliance and furniture and expanding availability through Home Depot stores. \u2047 Strong execution generated excellent financial results, with revenues increasing 23.8% compared to the prior year, adjusted net income of $3 billion and a return on equity of 23.8% for the last 12 months. \u2047 Shareholders benefited from a 50% increase in the quarterly common dividend and a reduction in outstanding shares by 2.4% just this year under the current $3 billion share repurchase program. \u2047 Yesterday, the Board approved a new $5 billion common share repurchase program, which represents approximately 13% of current market capitalization, and we expect to complete that by the end of March of 2023. \u2047 Let's continue on Slide three. \u2047 In addition to operating execution, we're innovating to create long-term value. \u2047 The Transformative Growth plan to create a digital insurance company is making good progress. \u2047 Today, we're going to spend time talking about the distribution component of that plan. \u2047 Allstate is among the leaders in telematics capabilities with Drivewise in the industry's largest pay-per-mile product Milewise, which offers customers unique value. \u2047 Arity, our telematics service platform company, recently launched Arity IQ, which, when combined with LeadCloud and Transparent. \u2047 ly platforms, will integrate telematics information into pricing at the time of quote rather than at the times after the sale. \u2047 We enhanced our competitive position in independent agent channel by using National General to consolidate and improve our IA business model. \u2047 We executed agreements to sell Allstate Life Insurance Company and Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York to redeploy capital out of lower growth and return businesses and reduce exposure to interest rates. \u2047 Increasing market share, while maintaining attractive returns and expanding protection solutions through transformation, targeted acquisitions and divestitures will create shareholder value. \u2047 Slide four lays out the Allstate's strong second quarter performance. \u2047 Revenues of $12.6 billion in the quarter increased 21.6% compared to the prior year, largely reflects the National General acquisition and higher net investment income. \u2047 Property-Liability premiums earned and policies in force increased by 12.9% and 12.1%, respectively. \u2047 Net investment income of $974 million increased by over $0.75 billion compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting $649 million of income from the performance-based portfolio. \u2047 Net income of $1.6 billion was reported in the second quarter compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. \u2047 Adjusted net income was $1.1 billion or $3.79 per diluted share, as you can see from the table on the bottom. \u2047 That's a 40% increase from the prior year quarter. \u2047 Allstate's excellent execution and strong operating results in the quarter contributed to that return on equity, which I just mentioned, of 23.8% over the last 12 months. \u2047 Let's move to Slide five to discuss our progress on building Transformative Growth business models. \u2047 So Transformative Growth, it's a multiyear initiative, and what we're working to do is build a low-cost digital insurer with broad distribution, and that's going to be accomplished through four areas: expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition, and deploying new technology ecosystem. \u2047 In Transformative Growth, you wouldn't do it all in one day, of course, so it's got five phases, and substantial progress has been made in Phases two and three. \u2047 Phase two successes include improving the competitive price position of auto insurance, protecting margins by reducing costs. \u2047 New advertising was launched with increased investment. \u2047 We also are off to an excellent start with National General. \u2047 And of course, the phases overlap, so progress is also being made in Phase three. \u2047 So we're transforming the distribution platform, including supporting transition of Allstate agents to higher-growth and lower-cost models, which we'll discuss on the next slide. \u2047 Improving customer acquisition sophistication will lower cost relative to lifetime value. \u2047 We continue to focus on lowering underwriting claims expenses to deliver lower-cost protection to customers, and we've designed a new technology architecture. \u2047 We've coded much of the new applications. \u2047 The next step for us is to launch an integrated system with one product in one state. \u2047 Turning to Slide six. \u2047 Let's review how we're transforming the Allstate agent, Allstate direct sales and independent agent distribution platforms to grow market share. \u2047 The illustrative slides on the right side of the slide show -- provide a view into our growth expectations by channel over time. \u2047 Starting with Allstate exclusive agents, we're making progress transitioning to a higher-growth and lower-cost model. \u2047 This year, we changed agent compensation by increasing new business compensation opportunity and reducing of bonus paid on policy renewals. \u2047 We expect to continue this shift from renewal compensation to new sales because it aligns with what consumers want. \u2047 Consumers want assistance with purchasing insurance more than they want routine policy service. \u2047 To lower cost for agents, we're digitizing processes, redesigning products to increase self-service and expanding centralized service support. \u2047 We're also working to reduce agent operating expenses and real estate costs. \u2047 These changes will improve the customer value proposition with lower cost and easier service. \u2047 Now of course, you're not going to do this in one day either, so a multiyear transformation -- transition program is in place to support existing agents. \u2047 We've initiated it, and it has different levels of support based on agent performance. \u2047 Given this transition, we reduced new agent employment last year, which has had a negative impact on new business levels. \u2047 But as Mario will discuss next, this has been offset by higher productivity from existing agents. \u2047 At the same time, we have two new agent models in market, which have personal touch but a lower cost structure. \u2047 All of these changes are supported by more competitive auto insurance pricing and increased marketing spending, which is designed to continue to grow. \u2047 But as you can see on the right, the net impact of these changes for the Allstate agent channel is to be flat to a slight decline in sales in the short term but increased growth thereafter. \u2047 The Allstate direct sales effort leverages the capabilities that we built for the Esurance brand, and we've shifted our advertising focus away from Esurance to be totally focused on the Allstate brand and utilizing the direct channel for Allstate-branded sales as well. \u2047 And pricing is lower than the Allstate agent model since it doesn't come with the help of an agent. \u2047 And as this business grows, we're improving our operational and marketing effectiveness. \u2047 Direct sales now represent 29% of new auto business sales, and we expect that to continue to grow rapidly, as you can see on the right. \u2047 Independent agent distribution also represents an attractive growth opportunity. \u2047 The acquisition of National General enhanced our capabilities in this channel, and it added four million policies in force. \u2047 Additional growth is expected by broadening the product portfolio from high-risk drivers to middle-market auto and home insurance through the existing agent relationships. \u2047 We also expect to increase the number of agents actively engaged in selling National General products. \u2047 So when you combine this effective and efficient distribution with more competitive auto insurance pricing, enhanced marketing, advanced pricing and telematics and a digital experience, that's the Transformative Growth plan that will drive Property-Liability market share growth. \u2047 So Mario will now discuss the second quarter results in more detail. \u2047 Turning to Slide seven. \u2047 Let's dive deeper into the near-term results on our multifaceted approach to grow Property-Liability market share. \u2047 As you can see in the chart on the left side of the slide, Property-Liability policies in force grew by 12.1% compared to the prior year quarter primarily driven by National General and growth in Allstate brand new business. \u2047 National General, which includes Encompass, contributed growth of four million policies, and Allstate brand Property-Liability policies increased in the quarter driven by growth in homeowners and other personal lines. \u2047 Allstate brand auto policies in force declined slightly compared to the prior year quarter but increased sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, including growth of 111,000 policies compared to prior year, and as you can see by the table on the lower left. \u2047 The chart on the right shows a breakdown of personal auto new issued applications compared to prior year. \u2047 We continue to make progress in building higher-growth business models as we look to achieve leading positions in all three primary distribution channels. \u2047 The middle section of the chart on the right shows Allstate brand impacts by channel, which in total generated a 6.7% increase in new business growth compared to the prior year. \u2047 Modest increases from existing agents, excluding new appointments, and a 31% increase in the direct channel more than offset the volume that would normally have been generated by newly appointed agents, as we pilot new agent models with higher growth and lower costs. \u2047 The addition of National General also added 481,000 new auto applications in the quarter. \u2047 The recorded combined ratio of 95.7% increased 5.9 points compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 This was primarily driven by increased losses relative to the historically low auto accident frequency experienced in the prior year quarter due to the pandemic. \u2047 Increased losses were partially offset by lower pandemic-related expenses primarily shelter-in-place paybacks in 2020 as well as lower catastrophe losses. \u2047 These are represented by the green bars in the combined ratio reconciliation chart on the lower left of the slide. \u2047 Shifting to the chart on the bottom right, we continue to make progress in reducing our cost structure. \u2047 This enables improvement in the competitive price position of auto insurance and investments in marketing and technology, while maintaining strong returns. \u2047 The total Property-Liability expense ratio of 24.7% in the second quarter decreased by 7.1 points compared to the prior year, again, driven by lower coronavirus-related expenses. \u2047 This was partially offset by the amortization of purchased intangibles associated with the acquisition of National General, restructuring charges and a 0.7-point increase from higher investment in advertising. \u2047 Excluding these items, as shown by the dark blue bars, the expense ratio decreased by 0.4 points in the second quarter compared to the prior year period, decreased 1.7 points below year-end 2019 and 2.5 points below year-end 2018, reflecting continued progress in improving cost efficiencies. \u2047 Claims expenses have also been reduced through innovations such as QuickFoto Claim, Virtual Assist and aerial imagery, which also improves the customer experience. \u2047 These claim improvements are not reflected in the expense ratio but are in the loss ratio and also helped maintain margins. \u2047 Moving to Slide nine, let's discuss how our auto insurance profitability, which remains very strong and is still favorable to prepandemic levels despite pandemic-driven volatility. \u2047 Allstate Protection auto underlying combined ratio finished at 91.8%. \u2047 As you can see from the chart, the level remains favorable to 2017 through 2019 historical second quarter and year-end levels despite increasing by 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. \u2047 The increase to the prior year quarter reflects a comparison to a period with historically low auto accident frequencies. \u2047 The improvement relative to historical levels is driven by auto accident frequency remaining below prepandemic levels, partly offset by auto severity increases and competitive pricing enhancements. \u2047 To illustrate the pandemic-driven volatility, Allstate brand auto property damage gross frequency increased 47.3% from the prior year quarter but is 21% lower than the same period in 2019. \u2047 Auto severity increases persisted relative to the prior year quarter and prepandemic periods across coverages, largely driven by the shift in mix to more severe, higher-speed auto accidents and rising inflationary impacts in both used car values and replacement part costs. \u2047 The incurred severity increases are running higher than general inflation, which are reflected in the recorded combined ratio. \u2047 To counteract rising severity, we are leveraging advanced claim capabilities, predictive modeling, advanced photo and video utilization and deep expertise in repair process management to enable a scaled response to inflation and supply constraints. \u2047 Targeted price increases will also be implemented, as necessary, to maintain attractive auto insurance returns. \u2047 Now let's shift to Slide 10, which highlights investment performance for the second quarter. \u2047 Net investment income totaled $974 million in the quarter, which was $754 million above the prior year quarter, driven by higher performance-based income as shown in the chart on the left. \u2047 Performance-based income totaled $649 million in the second quarter, as shown in gray, reflecting both idiosyncratic and broad-based valuation increases in private equity investments and, to a lesser extent, gains from the sales of real estate equity. \u2047 Market-based income, shown in blue, was $3 million above the prior year quarter. \u2047 The impact of reinvestment rates below the average interest-bearing portfolio yield was mitigated in the quarter by higher average assets under management and prepayment fee income. \u2047 Our total portfolio return in the second quarter totaled 2.6%, reflecting income as well as higher fixed income and equity valuations. \u2047 We take an active approach to optimizing our returns per unit risk over appropriate investment horizons. \u2047 Our investment activities are integrated into our overall enterprise risk-and-return process and play an important role in generating shareholder value. \u2047 We draw upon a deep and experienced team of roughly 350 professionals to leverage expertise in asset allocation, portfolio construction, fundamental research, deal leadership, quantitative methods, manager selection and risk management. \u2047 While the results for this quarter were exceptionally strong, particularly for the performance-based investments, we managed the portfolio with a longer-term view on returns. \u2047 At the right, we have provided our annualized portfolio"], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted earnings per share $3.79.  \u2047  q2 revenue rose 21.6 percent to $12.6 billion."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 earnings per share of $3.79.  \u2047  q2 earnings per share $3.79."]}
