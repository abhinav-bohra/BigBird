{"article": ["I'm Susie Lisa, senior vice president of investor relations for CVS Health. \u2047 Today's call is being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. \u2047 2021 was an important year for CVS Health. \u2047 We exceeded our financial goals. \u2047 We advanced our strategy and we brought greater value to the people we serve, playing a critical role in the nation's pandemic response. \u2047 We ended a strong 2021 with another strong quarter. \u2047 We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share expectations for the fourth quarter in a row delivering $1.98 adjusted earnings per share in the final quarter of 2021 and $8.40 adjusted earnings per share for the full year. \u2047 We are entering 2022 with powerful momentum. \u2047 We are delivering healthcare solutions that are personalized, connected, and increasingly digital. \u2047 We are engaging millions of consumers across our businesses and in our community health destinations across America. \u2047 CVS Health is becoming a bigger part of their everyday health. \u2047 Turning now to our performance. \u2047 For the full year 2021, CVS Health grew adjusted revenue by 8.8% to $292 billion. \u2047 We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion, up 8.1% year over year. \u2047 And we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12%. \u2047 We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion for the full year, exceeding our most recent guidance of at least $13.5 billion. \u2047 This strong performance positions us well for 2022. \u2047 At this early stage of the year, we are maintaining our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.10 to $8.30. \u2047 Our forecast reflects increased volume from COVID testing and front store sales in our retail business relative to our forecast at investor day, offset by the accelerated timing of vaccine boosters pulled into the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 Shawn will provide more details on our results and guidance shortly. \u2047 Our 2021 performance demonstrates our ability to anticipate, deliver, and exceed consumers' expectations for healthcare. \u2047 Consumers are a major force driving change in healthcare, and we continue to engage successfully with individuals in more places and on their terms, virtually, in the home, and in their local community. \u2047 Customers and clients continue to realize the superior value we are providing with our integrated health solutions, particularly those that address the most prevalent, costly, and complex health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, and chronic kidney disease. \u2047 Turning to the segment highlights. \u2047 In healthcare benefits, we delivered 9.4% adjusted revenue growth for the full year 2021, driven by our performance in government services. \u2047 We had another strong year of Medicare growth with increases across all product lines. \u2047 Total Medicare Advantage membership grew at 9.8% on a year-over-year basis, as we added over 265,000 new members in 2021 and exceeded our initial growth expectations. \u2047 As a result of our strategic focus on dual-eligible special needs plans, enrollment nearly doubled in 2021. \u2047 Our full year medical benefit ratio of 85% was in line with our guidance expectations. \u2047 For the full year 2021, the utilization of total healthcare services in aggregate was in line with normalized historical baseline levels. \u2047 Turning to 2022, we had an impressive annual enrollment period in our Medicare business. \u2047 For the second consecutive year, we grew all Medicare product lines, and our growth rates this year exceed the industry averages in all categories. \u2047 We grew total Medicare Advantage membership by 11.6% versus the prior year, reflecting increases in individual and group Medicare Advantage of over 15% and 6%, respectively, year over year. \u2047 We also led the industry in absolute Medicare PDP net membership growth. \u2047 This added nearly 295,000 net new members, while the overall PDP market continues to decline. \u2047 We had a solid 2022 selling season in our national accounts commercial business. \u2047 We expect to grow membership in the low single digits for the full year and maintained strong client retention of 96%. \u2047 Our success is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs, including medical and pharmacy, and products and services that utilize CVS Health capabilities, such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs. \u2047 Membership enrollment was lower than expected in the eight ACA individual exchanges we entered this year. \u2047 We continue to build this business gradually, with select geographic expansion, a focused price discipline, and the appeal of co-branded Aetna CVS Health offerings. \u2047 Consistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect this offering to contribute materially to our financial results in 2022. \u2047 Overall, our deep understanding of consumer needs, innovative product portfolio, and our service excellence will drive growth in our healthcare benefits segment. \u2047 Our comprehensive range of products and benefit design that address consumers' whole health needs remains a key differentiator and fueled a strong selling season. \u2047 For 2022, we forecast 7% to 9% revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted operating income growth. \u2047 Turning to pharmacy services, we delivered 7.8% revenue and 20.6% adjusted operating income growth in 2021. \u2047 We continue to be a consultative partner to our clients and members. \u2047 We're delivering industry-leading cost trends and savings, service excellence and a broad product portfolio, and a commitment to transparency. \u2047 We consistently create value for our customers and clients with our better-than-market drug trend. \u2047 We continue to enhance our utilization programs to ensure access to the therapeutics that are the most clinically appropriate. \u2047 For 2022, we achieved a client retention rate of over 98% and drove $8.8 billion of net new business revenue. \u2047 We are a leader in specialty pharmacy, delivering revenue growth of 12.3% for the fourth quarter and 9.3% for the full year versus prior period. \u2047 Our specialty pharmacy programs drive value in the marketplace and they differentiate us as we pair programs with digital capabilities to deliver a convenient and connected experience. \u2047 For pharmacy services in 2022, we expect 6% to 8% revenue growth and 7% to 9% adjusted operating income growth, as we create long-term value for our clients and our members. \u2047 Our retail segment plays a critical role as a community health destination for millions of Americans. \u2047 This segment outperformed the industry and our expectations in 2021. \u2047 We grew revenue 9.8% year over year to just over $100 billion, marking an important milestone in the history of this CVS Health business. \u2047 We delivered an exceptional 24% adjusted operating income growth in 2021. \u2047 Pharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased by nearly 9% year over year. \u2047 This was notably driven by consumers who came to CVS Health for COVID-19 vaccine administration. \u2047 For the full year 2021, CVS Health administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million vaccines. \u2047 Over 35% of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 were administered during the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our work to test and vaccinate America for COVID is a powerful example of the relationships we are building with consumers, which leads to new customers seeking a range of other health services at CVS Health. \u2047 Front store sales growth was strong throughout 2021, up 8.4% versus the prior year. \u2047 They were led by consumer demand for the over-the-counter COVID-19 tests, as well as cough and cold, beauty, and personal care products. \u2047 We sold over 22 million OTC COVID-19 tests with approximately 70% of sales in the fourth quarter. \u2047 We are progressing on optimizing our retail portfolio and pivoting our stores into three formats: primary care clinics, enhanced health hubs, and traditional CVS pharmacy locations. \u2047 We are executing our plan to dedensify stores based on consumer health and buying needs, omnichannel preferences, and shifts in the U.S. population. \u2047 For 2022, as I mentioned, given the earnings outperformance and pull-forward of vaccine boosters in 2021, we are maintaining our 2022 guidance. \u2047 This now implies retail revenue to be plus or minus 1% versus prior year, and a low 20% decline in adjusted operating income growth. \u2047 Shawn will provide more details. \u2047 Our digital approach is focused on delivering a superior experience for consumers by creating a more connected and seamless health journey. \u2047 We are making progress toward setting a new standard for digital healthcare for consumers. \u2047 CVS.com is one of the top health websites with over 2 billion visits in 2021, up nearly 55% over the prior year. \u2047 Our digital capabilities for health interactions such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services, and sales of health and wellness products have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses. \u2047 We now serve 40 million customers digitally, up approximately 10% in the last six months alone. \u2047 In 2021, we launched several new digital health services powered by advanced analytics to personalize the experience. \u2047 We made it easier to join our CarePass program reaching 5.6 million subscribers in the quarter, up more than 40% year over year. \u2047 We integrated CarePass for our Aetna Commercial members and are excited about the adoption we are seeing. \u2047 We also simplified the CarePass enrollment for all consumers, which is driving more growth in subscribers. \u2047 For our HealthHUB and MinuteClinic patients, we simplified and digitized the check-in process for patients. \u2047 Our self-service digital tool enables individuals to complete traditional paperwork in advance of their appointment. \u2047 Almost 80% of patients are already utilizing this capability. \u2047 At our investor day, we promised a superior healthcare experience for consumers that will improve health outcomes, lower cost, and provide broader access to care. \u2047 We are making several moves to realize our vision for healthcare. \u2047 We're advancing our care delivery capabilities, optimizing our retail portfolio, and further diversifying the health products and services that we offer. \u2047 We're driving this evolution both through internal initiatives and by seeking to execute capability-focused M&A for complementary health services. \u2047 We will connect consumers in more places in more ways and on their terms, with our digital-first technology-forward approach, as well as an enhanced omnichannel health experience. \u2047 These strategic moves will accelerate the growth of our foundational businesses. \u2047 In all this work, we will place the consumer at the center of all that we do. \u2047 We remain focused on delivering on our commitment to sustainability for our shareholders, our customers, and our communities. \u2047 We recently launched CVS Health Zones, aim to advance health equity and to address social determinants of health in high-risk communities. \u2047 We are collaborating with trusted national and local organizations to confront the six key social determinants of health through local investments. \u2047 Our goal is to equip communities with the resources needed to close gaps in care for specific health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. \u2047 Health Zones is now active in five geographies with additional markets planned in 2022. \u2047 We remain committed to the environment and have pledged to reduce our overall impact, cutting greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain, and decreasing resource consumption, especially paper and plastic. \u2047 In December, CVS Health was named to the 2021 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the 9th consecutive year and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the third consecutive year. \u2047 Our financial performance, execution, portfolio of assets, and differentiated strategy all create strong momentum into 2022 and a clear pathway to achieve low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth over time. \u2047 I would also like to take a moment to recognize the continued contribution of our colleagues who have played a vital role in helping our nation prevail over the pandemic. \u2047 I am proud of what we have done and are doing every day to make a difference. \u2047 Our fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong performance delivered in the first three quarters of the year, as we once again exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share. \u2047 We maintained our focus on growth, operational execution, and supporting the communities we serve as the effects of the pandemic persists. \u2047 Starting with the enterprise as a whole. \u2047 Total fourth quarter adjusted revenues of 76.6 billion, increased by 10.6% year over year. \u2047 We reported adjusted operating income of 4.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.98, representing an increase of 40.8% and 52.3% versus prior year, respectively. \u2047 For full year 2021, we reported total adjusted revenues of 292.1 billion, an increase of 8.8% versus prior year, reflecting robust growth across all business segments. \u2047 We delivered adjusted operating income of 17.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $8.40, up approximately 8.1% and 12% year over year, respectively. \u2047 And we generated significant cash flow from operations of nearly 18.3 billion. \u2047 This marks a record year of cash flow from operations for CVS Health and reflects the strength of our financial results, accelerated collections, and focused improvements in our working capital position. \u2047 Turning to the healthcare benefits segment. \u2047 Fourth quarter adjusted revenue of 20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year over year, driven by membership growth in our government services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee. \u2047 Adjusted operating income of 510 million grew by over 230% year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments and improved underlying performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical costs compared to prior year. \u2047 Our adjusted medical benefit ratio of 87% improved 130 basis points year over year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee. \u2047 As a result of the omicron variant, we experienced higher COVID testing and treatment costs in the fourth quarter, but this was largely offset by lower non-COVID costs, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid. \u2047 Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49 and was, as expected, lower than the third quarter and consistent with normal seasonal trends and historic levels. \u2047 Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. \u2047 In the pharmacy services segment, fourth quarter revenues of 39.3 billion increased by 8.2% year over year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy, and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. \u2047 Total pharmacy membership increased by approximately 400,000 lives sequentially, reflecting sustained growth in government programs. \u2047 Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 8.2% above prior year. \u2047 Approximately half of this growth was attributable to net new business in 2021, with COVID-19 vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth. \u2047 Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion grew 16.8% year over year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization, and growth in"], "gold_summary": ["cvs health qtrly revenue rose 10.1% to $76.6
