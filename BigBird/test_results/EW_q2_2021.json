{"article": ["Just after the close of regular trading, Edwards Lifesciences released second quarter 2021 financial results. \u2047 These statements include, but aren't limited to: financial guidance and expectations for longer-term growth opportunities, regulatory approvals, clinical trials, litigation, reimbursement, competitive matters and foreign currency fluctuations. \u2047 Finally, a quick reminder that when using terms underlying and adjusted, management is referring to non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 Otherwise, they are referring to GAAP results. \u2047 \"We were encouraged by the clear signs of recovery during the second quarter. \u2047 Vaccine adoption in key regions have contributed to an increasing number of patients seeking and, most importantly, receiving treatment. \u2047 At Edwards, our dedication of providing innovative solutions for people fighting cardiovascular disease around the world motivates our employees every day. \u2047 We never stopped our aggressive pursuit of breakthrough technologies with the potential to help an even broader group of patients. \u2047 Last year, we noted that we're in the midst of the onset of this tragic global pandemic. \u2047 There were more than 20,000 patients around the world who were treated with our SAPIEN valves in that second quarter. \u2047 This quarter, more than 30,000 patients were treated with SAPIEN valves, an indication that more patients are benefiting from our life changing technologies than ever before. \u2047 The comparisons of 2020 are challenging as last year marked an extraordinary time for structural heart patients, especially during the second quarter, when the COVID surge overwhelmed hospitals and undermined regular ongoing care. \u2047 Patients and their doctors around the world were forced to weigh the risk of COVID versus the severe effects of progressive heart valve disease. \u2047 Fortunately, we are now experiencing encouraging signs of increased patient confidence to visit their position. \u2047 Turning now to our recent results. \u2047 We are pleased to report better than expected second quarter sales of $1.4 billion, up 44% on a constant currency basis from a year ago period. \u2047 All four product groups delivered large increases in sales led by TAVR. \u2047 Total company sales increased sequentially versus Q1. \u2047 And importantly, sales grew 11% on a two year compounded annual basis, compared to the strong pre-pandemic second quarter of 2019. \u2047 While hospital heart teams have not been reporting significant backlogs, we believe that procedure rates in Q2 were lifted because patients who previously postponed their doctor visits returned and were treated. \u2047 We are raising our full year outlook for 2021. \u2047 We remain cautious about the mix trends of the recovery from the pandemic and additionally, we expect a more pronounced summer seasonality associated with the pent-up demand for vacations. \u2047 Yet, given the better than expected year-to-date performance and momentum exiting the quarter, we now expect total sales growth to be in the high teens versus our previous guidance of mid-teens. \u2047 In TAVR, second quarter global sales were $902 million, up 48% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period or 14% on a two year compounded annual basis. \u2047 We estimate global TAVR procedure growth was comparable with Edwards' growth in the second quarter. \u2047 Globally, our average selling price remains stable as we continue to exercise price discipline. \u2047 We continue to be optimistic about the long-term potential of TAVR because of its transformational impact on the many patients suffering from aortic stenosis and because many remain untreated. \u2047 In a recent article in the American Journal of Cardiology reported, it reported on the survival of severe AS patients since the introduction of TAVR in 2008. \u2047 The analysis included clinical data on 4,000 patients obtained at the mass general and concluded that in the TAVR era overall survival of patients with severe AS has doubled. \u2047 The long-term potential, along with the rebound in procedures reinforces our view that this global TAVR opportunity will exceed $7 billion by 2024, up from more than $5 billion today. \u2047 And beyond 2024, bolstered by two pivotal trials currently being enrolled, we believe the impact of treating this deadly disease before symptoms and before the disease becomes severe has the potential to transform the lives of even more patients. \u2047 In the U.S., our TAVR sales grew sequentially over Q1 and over 50% on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Our U.S. TAVR volumes were well above pre-COVID levels as our two year compounded annual growth rate was in the mid-teens. \u2047 We estimate that our share of procedures was stable. \u2047 We are encouraged that U.S. TAVR procedures grew as vaccinations increase and patients decided to seek treatment during the quarter. \u2047 Growth was broad based across both high and low volume centers. \u2047 Outside the U.S., in the second quarter, our sales grew approximately 40% on a year-over-year basis and we estimate that total TAVR procedure growth was comparable. \u2047 On a two year compounded annual basis, we estimate that sales grew in the low double-digits in the second quarter versus 2019. \u2047 And although we are encouraged by the strong results, vaccination progress outside the U.S. creates uncertainty for the remainder of the year. \u2047 Long-term goal, we see excellent opportunities for OUS growth as we believe international adoption of TAVR therapy remains quite low. \u2047 TAVR procedure and Edwards' growth in Europe, also rebounded significantly on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 Edwards' growth was driven by the continued strong adoption of our SAPIEN platform and was broad based across all countries. \u2047 Patient flow recovered throughout the quarter, although it remains suboptimal in several countries and uncertainty among patients about the urgency of their disease. \u2047 In Japan, we continue to see strong TAVR adoption, driven by SAPIEN 3 and broad growth across centers of all sizes. \u2047 We remained focused on expanding the availability of TAVR therapy throughout the country, driven by the fact that aortic stenosis remains an immensely undertreated diseases among this large elderly population. \u2047 As previously announced, we received the approval earlier in the second quarter for SAPIEN 3 in patients at low surgical risk and we continue to anticipate increased treatment rates in Japan when reimbursement is approved in Q3. \u2047 Now, turning to several recent TAVR clinical trial highlights, last week at the TVT Conference, data on the Vancouver's TAVR Economic Study were presented which further demonstrated the favorable economic value of our SAPIEN 3 platform, a comparison of 1100 patients was conducted to assess the economic impact of next day discharge. \u2047 The SAPIEN 3 platform with a minimalist approach achieved better patient outcomes 30-days post-procedure and enhanced resource utilization, which resulted in meaningful cost improvements. \u2047 Also at TVT, results from the PARTNER 3 bicuspid registry showed similar outcomes to other TAVR patients, as well as significant improvement in patient symptoms and quality of life. \u2047 We remain as optimistic as ever about the long-term growth opportunity as patients and clinicians increasingly understand the significant benefits of TAVR therapy, supported by the substantial body of compelling evidence. \u2047 In summary, based on the strength that we saw in the second quarter, we have confidence that the underlying TAVR sales will grow around 20% in 2021 versus our previous expectation of 15% to 20% growth. \u2047 Turning to TMTT; we continue to be very pleased with our clinical outcomes as they remain a key driver to treating many patients in need and unlocking the significant long-term growth opportunity. \u2047 We continue to be committed to ensuring procedural success and employing a high touch clinical support model. \u2047 We are progressing in the enrollment of five pivotal trials across our differentiated portfolio to support therapy for patients suffering from mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. \u2047 We have initiated use of the PASCAL precision platform and are currently enrolling CLASP and early physician feedback has been positive. \u2047 We remain on track for U.S. approval of PASCAL for patients with DMR late next year. \u2047 We advanced our clinical experience with transcatheter replacement as we continued enrollment with our TRISCEND 2 pivotal trial for EVOQUE tricuspid replacement. \u2047 We also continue to treat patients with both our transcatheter mitral replacement therapies through the ENCIRCLE pivotal trial for SAPIEN M3 and the MISCEND Study for EVOQUE Eos. \u2047 In mitral, an analysis of EuroPCR of over 2,100 commercially treated patients provided further evidence of the efficacy, safety, and ease of use of the PASCAL platform. \u2047 In addition, two year results from the CLASP study of PASCAL highlighted strong and sustained MR reduction, as well as high survival rates for both FMR and DMR patients. \u2047 And in tricuspid, 30-day outcomes for our TRISCEND study for the EVOQUE tricuspid valve replacement system demonstrated favorable technical feasibility and safety, along with significant improvements is tricuspid regurgitation and quality of life for patients. \u2047 Similarly, outcomes for PASCAL tricuspid valve repair resulted in significant TR reduction, low complication rates, and sustained functional and quality of life improvements at six months. \u2047 Turning to the financial performance in TMTT, global sales of $22 million were driven by the continued adoption of our PASCAL platform, as we activated more centers across Europe. \u2047 We now expect 2021 TMTT sales of $80 million to $100 million, up from our previous sales guidance of $80 million. \u2047 We continue to estimate the global TMTT opportunity to triple to approximately $3 billion by 2025 and we are pleased with our progress toward advancing our vision to transform the lives of patients with mitral and tricuspid valve disease. \u2047 In Surgical Structural Heart, record second quarter global sales of $237 million was up 42% on an underlying basis versus a year ago period. \u2047 Revenue growth was lifted by increased adoption of our premium RESILIA technologies around the world and rebounding surgical aortic treatment rates in the U.S. \u2047 We were encouraged by steady improvement in global surgical procedure volumes, as we progress through the quarter. \u2047 We experienced strong year-over-year adoption of Edwards RESILIA tissue valves including continued adoption of the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic surgical valve, the KONECT RESILIA aortic tissue valve conduit, as well as our new MITRIS RESILIA surgical mitral valve, which was launched in Japan in the second quarter. \u2047 We believe the adoption of RESILIA tissue valves will be further bolstered by the four year mitral data from our COMMENCE clinical trial presented at the recent meeting of the American Association of Thoracic Surgery, as well as the growing body of RESILIA clinical evidence, which demonstrates excellent durability of this tissue technology even in the high pressure mitral position. \u2047 In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Surgical Structure Heart guidance, we now expect underlying sales growth in the mid-teens versus our previous expectation of high-single-digit growth. \u2047 We continue to believe the current $1.8 billion Surgical Structure Heart market will grow in the mid-single-digits through 2026. \u2047 In Critical Care, second quarter global sales were $215 million, up 27% on an underlying basis versus the year ago period. \u2047 Growth was driven by balanced contributions from all product lines led by HemoSphere sales in the U.S. as hospital capital spending continues to show signs of recovery. \u2047 Demand for products used in high-risk surgeries remains strong, and demand for the ClearSight non-invasive finger cuff used in elective procedures accelerated following its recovery to pre-COVID levels in the first quarter. \u2047 And Smart Recovery received FDA clearance for the software algorithm that powers our Hypotension Prediction Index, HPI on HemoSphere and the Acumen IQ cuff. \u2047 The non-invasive Acumen IQ cuff provides clinicians with an important new tool to reduce hypotension in a broader range of patients including those that do not require an arterial line. \u2047 In summary, given the strength of our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full year Critical Care guidance to low-double-digits versus our previous expectation of high-single-digit growth. \u2047 We remain excited about our pipeline of Critical Care innovations as we continue to shift our focus to smart recovery technologies designed to help clinicians make better decisions for their patients. \u2047 I am pleased with the momentum we experienced as we exited the first quarter continued in the second quarter across all of our product lines. \u2047 While we are expecting some headwinds due to the summer vacation schedule and flare-ups of COVID in various regions, we are optimistic about favorable business conditions for Edwards. \u2047 Total sales grew 49% year-over-year, as patients increasingly were more confident about pursuing treatment in the second quarter. \u2047 Of course, the unusually high growth rate also reflects depressed sales in last year's second quarter due to COVID. \u2047 Our underlying two year compounded growth rate in the second quarter was 11%, another indicator that conditions are improving. \u2047 The much stronger than expected sales performance lifted by unexpectedly high procedure volume fell through to the bottom-line resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.64. \u2047 Based upon our strong start to the year and positive outlook, we are raising our previous sales guidance ranges for 2021. \u2047 For total Edwards, we now expect sales of $5.2 billion to $5.4 billion, for TAVR $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion, for TMTT, $80 million to $100 million, for Surgical Structural Heart, $875 million to $925 million, and for Critical Care, $800 million to $850 million. \u2047 Now, regarding second half margins, we are intending to resume a higher rate of spending as commercial activities increase, especially as we continue to build our clinical and field teams to support our planned new product introductions in multiple regions. \u2047 In addition, we expect growth in research and development expenses as our clinical trial activities increase. \u2047 The combination of these actions contributes to our more moderated guidance for margins in the second half. \u2047 We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance at the high-end of our previous range of $2.07 to $2.27. \u2047 While public health conditions remain uncertain, we are projecting total sales in the third quarter to grow sequentially to between $1.29 billion and $1.37 billion resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.56. \u2047 Now, I will cover additional details of our results. \u2047 For the second quarter, our adjusted gross profit margin was 75.9%, compared to 74.4% in the same period last year when we experienced lower sales and substantial cost responding to COVID. \u2047 This increase was also driven by a more profitable product mix, partially offset by a negative impact from foreign exchange. \u2047 We continue to expect our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin to be between"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports quarterly earnings per share of $0.78, quarterly adjusted earnings per share of
