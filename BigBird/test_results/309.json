{"article": ["Before beginning, let me cover the formalities. \u2047 Such factors are detailed in the company's SEC filings and last night's news release. \u2047 It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without our express permission. \u2047 The purpose of the call is to review our First Quarter 2020 results detailed in our news release issued yesterday. \u2047 These numbers reflect the beginning of what we expect will be a gradual and steady recovery over the coming quarters as the world emerges from the economic effects of the pandemic and regains its confidence in air travel once again. \u2047 The results we reported in our news release, last night, represent a solid start to the year and were largely consistent with our expectations. \u2047 And we were more than pleased with how well we performed in controlling costs and delivering stronger margins. \u2047 Our Hexcel team has transformed this downturn in demand into an upturn in productivity, cash management, inventory control, and efficiency. \u2047 While we have a few more months of restructuring ahead of us, especially in Europe, which is on track, we are already realizing meaningful results from our rapid and robust response to the pandemic and its unprecedented effects on our business. \u2047 As we have previously communicated, we expect to reduce overhead costs by the middle of this year on an annual basis by approximately $150 million. \u2047 And I'm pleased to report a significant portion of those savings are reflected in our first-quarter results. \u2047 We expected that second half of 2020 and our first for this year would represent the troughs or the low point of the demand cycle resulting from COVID-19. \u2047 Now, with Q1 behind us and a clearer view ahead, we're even more convinced that our expectations were correct, which we continue to validate via regular customer interactions, including customer site visits where this can now be accomplished safely. \u2047 Keep in mind, however, the pandemic has triggered many challenges that the world has not yet fully overcome, and therefore, any substantial increases in build rates, air passenger demand, and even consumer spending remain uncertain. \u2047 For example, we anticipate that 2021 will continue to be impacted by pandemic headwinds, including inventory destocking, which we expect will wind down as we move through the second quarter and to be largely behind us as we move into the second half of the year. \u2047 Some tightness in our supply chain is always a risk, and even more so with the ever-present threat of pandemic-related slowdowns, shutdowns, and shortages. \u2047 The rollout of vaccines is encouraging in some countries, yet, unfortunately, slow in others. \u2047 Domestic travel in the US is showing signs of improvement and may boom by year-end. \u2047 While other countries are entering their second, third, or fourth lockdowns with minimal domestic flights. \u2047 International travel is still showing little sign of recovery. \u2047 So, for the aerospace industry, 2021 remains a transition period between the dramatic decline triggered by the pandemic and a return to strong growth in 2022. \u2047 We remain cautiously optimistic by both our demonstrated performance and the momentum we see building in the global economy as the air travel begins a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Now, let me highlight some of the results. \u2047 First-quarter sales of $310 million were in line with our expectations. \u2047 Adjusted first-quarter earnings per share was a negative $0.10 compared to a positive $0.64 last year. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, we have maintained a strong focus on cash, and in the first quarter, our free cash flow was a use of $6 million compared to a use of $19 million in Q1, 2020. \u2047 Despite significantly lower sales, we continue to tightly manage cash by controlling spending, which includes capital expenditures. \u2047 Liquidity at the end of the quarter was strong and included $82 million of cash and $536 million of revolver borrowing availability. \u2047 Overall, our balance sheet remains robust. \u2047 Turning to our three markets. \u2047 Aerospace sales of $147 million were down more than 59% compared to the first quarter of last year, which included sales before the effects of the pandemic began to dramatically impact Commercial Aerospace. \u2047 Sales were down significantly across all major platforms, which reflects pandemic induced build rate reductions by the aircraft OEMs and continued supply chain destocking. \u2047 While one quarter does not make a trend, we did see sequential sales growth in the first quarter for narrow bodies. \u2047 Admittedly, Boeing 737 MAX sales continue to be at a low level as the supply chain works through channel inventory. \u2047 This may take some time and will be uneven as inventory levels vary across the supply chain. \u2047 Sales to other Commercial Aerospace, which include regional and business aircraft, were down 48% compared to 2020. \u2047 Business Jets is the largest portion of this sector and while most business jet programs were down significantly year-over-year, there were a few select programs that increased modestly. \u2047 While not getting into program specifics, we are confident business jet demand will return over time, likely led by the small and mid-sized classes. \u2047 Space and Defense sales were basically flat year-over-year at $112 million. \u2047 We have content on over 100 space and defense programs and they fluctuate by quarter. \u2047 Our space business has been growing nicely over time, yet, paused in the first quarter with softer sales which was not usual. \u2047 We are -- not unusual. \u2047 We are beginning to benefit from the ramp in the CH-53K and we are pleased to see the growing international demand for this composite rich, heavy-lift helicopter. \u2047 We are encouraged with the initial outlook through proposed US defense spending, particularly as composite lightweighting[phonetic] supports the US military focus on longer-range aircraft and rotorcraft. \u2047 We expect to benefit from growth in Space and Defense throughout the year. \u2047 Total Industrial sales of $51 million in the first quarter were down more than 23% and 27% in constant currency. \u2047 Lower wind energy sales drove the decrease, yet were partially offset by stronger automotive sales, which may be an indication that consumer confidence is improving. \u2047 Wind energy sales, which is the largest submarket in Industrial, were down more than 40% compared to last year. \u2047 And reflects a previously reported softening in customer demand, as well as the closure of our wind blade prepreg production facility in North America, last November. \u2047 Wind energy remains a good business for Hexcel and Vestas continues to be a great customer. \u2047 Material manufacturing continues at our plants in Neumarkt, Austria; and Tianjin, China, as well as our continuing commitment to innovation in the wind energy market. \u2047 During the quarter, we announced our new HexPly XF Surface Treatment Technology that significantly reduces show manufacturing time during the wind blade production process. \u2047 It's a product that has had a successful track record in prepreg blades and now is adapted for infusion processes. \u2047 We also received type approval certification for our HexPly M9[Phonetic] prepreg materials, which adds to our growing portfolio of prepreg processing options for marine applications. \u2047 To finish, I'd like to provide a slightly longer-term perspective. \u2047 As sales recover in 2022 and beyond, we expect to deliver strong incremental margins as utilization of existing capacity increases. \u2047 While we do not guide to incremental margins, what may be helpful is to review past sales levels and operating margin performance before the A350 reached peak rates. \u2047 Specifically, in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe Hexcel sales were in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, with operating margins in the range of 17%. \u2047 And what is noteworthy is that the A350 production rate was ramping to five per month during these years. \u2047 We believe that we can return to these margin levels when we attain similar sales levels. \u2047 While our depreciation expense is now higher than during that prior time period, our focus is to more than offset this by efficiency improvements and our overhead cost reductions. \u2047 Our cost base will expand with growth, but what is incumbent on our management team is to be extremely disciplined in managing cost growth and ensuring the depreciation headwinds is more than off overcome. \u2047 To state this succinctly, we expect to achieve strong, mid-teens plus operating margins, with sales of approximately $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, and we are targeting to exceed prior peak margins when we return to previous peak sales levels. \u2047 As a reminder, the year-over-year comparison will be in constant currency. \u2047 The majority of our sales are denominated in dollars. \u2047 However, our cost base is a mix of dollars, euros, and British pounds, as we have a significant manufacturing presence in Europe. \u2047 As a result, when the dollar strengthens against the euro and the pound, our sales translate lower while our costs also translate lower leading to a net benefit through our margin. \u2047 Accordingly, a weak dollar, as we are currently facing, is a headwind to our financial results. \u2047 We hedge this currency exposure over a 10-quarter horizon to protect our operating income. \u2047 Quarterly sales totaled $310.3 million. \u2047 The sales decrease year-over-year reflects production rate decreases by our Commercial Aerospace customers in response to the pandemic, combined with the continued Commercial Aerospace supply chain destocking. \u2047 Turning to our three markets. \u2047 Commercial Aerospace represented approximately 48% of the total first-quarter sales. \u2047 Commercial Aerospace sales of a $147.6 million, decreased 59.7% compared to the third quarter of 2020 as destocking continues to impact our sales. \u2047 We continue to expect destocking to wind down during the second quarter of 2021, consistent with what we have communicated during our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. \u2047 We don't expect to generally be aligned with OEM production levels entering the second half of 2021, with destocking largely behind us and recognizing the beneficial impact of the cost takeout actions that we have implemented. \u2047 Space and Defense represented 36% of first-quarter sales and totaled $111.7 million, basically unchanged from the same period in 2020. \u2047 We remain bullish for the outlook for our Space and Defense business globally. \u2047 Industrial comprised 16% for first quarter 2021 sales. \u2047 Industrial sales totaled $51 million, decreasing 27.1% compared to the third quarter of 2020 on weaker wins and recreation market, partially offset by stronger automotive. \u2047 Wind energy represented approximately 50% for first quarter Industrial sales. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, gross margin for the first quarter was 17.1% compared to 26% in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 The sequential gross margin improvement from the fourth quarter of 2020 had three drivers, including greater impact from our cost reduction actions, improved sales mix, and a few more carbon fiber lines coming back online as our production levels and inventory becomes appropriately realigned with demand. \u2047 We continue to temporarily idle select carbon fiber assets. \u2047 And as we bring further lines back into production over time to support this expected gradual and steady sales growth in future periods, this should help generate strong incremental margins. \u2047 First-quarter selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 17% or $8 million in constant currency, year-over-year, as a result of headcount reductions and continued tight controls on discretionary spending. \u2047 Research and Technology expenses decreased 19.7% in constant currency. \u2047 The other expense category consisted primarily of severance costs in Europe. \u2047 We continue to target approximately $150 million of annualized overhead cost savings, including indirect labor. \u2047 As Nick said, a significant portion of these savings have been achieved and were reflected in our Q1 2021 results. \u2047 We expect that most of the remainder of this cost and take-outs will be achieved by the end of the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Adjusted operating income in the first quarter was $1.9 million, which is the first positive operating income since the destocking began in earnest during the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 The year-over-year impact of exchange rates was negative by approximately 10 basis points. \u2047 Now turning to our two segments. \u2047 The Constant Materials segment represented 76% of total sales and generated a 3% operating margin or an adjusted operating margin of 8% compared to 19.9% adjusted operating margin in the prior-year period. \u2047 The Engineered Products segment, which is comprised of our structures and engineered core businesses represented 24% of total sales and generated a 6.4% operating margin or a 5.4% adjusted operating margin compared to 6.6% adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 The tax benefit for the first quarter of 2021 was $7.5 million, which included a discrete tax benefit of $3.2 million from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities related to a favorable US state tax law change. \u2047 The pandemic and consequent mix of results across the countries in which we operate is expected to continue to have an impact on the Company's overall effective tax rate throughout 2021. \u2047 Net cash used by operating activities was $1.2 million for the first quarter. \u2047 Working capital was a use of cash of $26.2 million in the quarter, primarily related to increased receivables as first-quarter sales were weighted toward the end of the quarter. \u2047 Capital expenditures on an accrual basis were $4 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $21.9 million for the prior-year period in 2020. \u2047 Capital expenditures continue to be tightly managed with a focus on improving existing asset efficiency and new technology flexibility. \u2047 Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2021 was negative $6.1 million compared to negative $18.6 million in the prior-year period, which reflects tight spending control on significantly lower sales. \u2047 In late January 2021, we announced the second amendment to our revolver, which we've structured to accommodate the temporary economic impact of the pandemic. \u2047 The amendment temporarily replaces the leverage covenant with a minimum liquidity covenant. \u2047 The minimum required liquidity is $250 million, which includes unrestricted cash, plus unutilized revolver-based[Phonetic] availability. \u2047 This minimum liquidity requirement is through and including March 31, 2022. \u2047 The facility terms then revert to the prior leverage covenant, effective April 1, with the first measurement of leverage to occur as of June 30, 2022. \u2047 Additionally, the amount of the revolver is reduced to $750 million from $1 billion, previously. \u2047 This amendment preserves our access to liquidity during this period of market transition and reinforces our strong relationship with our bank's indication. \u2047 We remain within all covenant conditions. \u2047 Our total liquidity at the end of the first quarter of 2021 was $618 million, consisting of $82 million of cash and an undrawn revolver balance of $536 million[Phonetic]. \u2047 Our revolver matures in 2024 and our two senior notes mature in 2025 and [Technical Issues] purchase program remains suspended and is also restricted by the previously referenced revolver amendment. \u2047 Our Board continues to regularly evaluate capital allocation priorities. \u2047 As our earning
