{"article": ["I'm joined on the call today by our Chairman and CEO, Ron Kruszewski; our Co-Presidents, Victor Nesi and Jim Zemlyak; and our CFO, Jim Marischen. \u2047 This audiocast is copyrighted material of Stifel Financial Corp. \u2047 , and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without the consent of Stifel Financial. \u2047 I'll start the call with some highlights from our quarter and first nine months. \u2047 Then Jim Marischen will review our balance sheet and expenses, and I'll wrap up with some concluding thoughts. \u2047 Our third quarter represented our second-highest net revenue and earnings per share, as both operating segments, Global Wealth and Institutional, generated strong results. \u2047 As I've said before, our success is driven by the continued reinvestment in our business. \u2047 And based on our investment banking and recruiting pipelines, organic bank growth and expertise in acquisitions, Stifel remains well positioned to continue and build upon our decades-long growth. \u2047 Revenue in the quarter totaled nearly $1.15 billion, an increase of 30%. \u2047 While certainly pleased with our quarterly revenue, it is noteworthy that we achieved this despite the fact that several large advisory assignments which we had forecast to close in the third quarter have slipped into the fourth quarter. \u2047 For the nine-month period, we generated record revenue of more than $3.4 billion, up 28% over the comparable period in 2020. \u2047 The growth in revenue and lower expense ratios resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.65, which is up 56% year-on-year, and $4.85 year-to-date, which is up 68%. \u2047 The strength of our results were driven by a combination of revenue growth and expense discipline, resulting in pre-tax margins of nearly 24%. \u2047 In addition, reflecting our focus on returns to investor capital, we earned nearly 28% annualized return on tangible common equity. \u2047 Tangible book value per share also increased 27% in the last year. \u2047 Turning to the next slide. \u2047 Our third quarter net revenue was driven by record Global Wealth Management revenue and robust Institutional revenue. \u2047 As we forecasted, compensation as a percentage of net revenue declined sequentially to 58.2%. \u2047 Our operating expense ratio was 17.9% and, excluding credit provision and investment banking gross-ups, totaled 16.9%, which was within the guidance range we gave on last quarter's call. \u2047 Taken together, Stifel's quarterly pre-tax income totaled $274 million, which increased 60% from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 As I said on last quarter's call, Stifel is and will continue to be a growth company, and our results in the third quarter and year-to-date illustrate our impressive long-term growth trajectory. \u2047 Our disciplined approach to capital deployment and acquisitions has resulted in a diversified business model that has not only made us more relevant to our clients, but also enabled us to grow during good and bad market environments. \u2047 Last quarter, we updated our full year 2021 revenue guidance to be in a range of $4.5 billion to $4.7 billion. \u2047 Our annualized nine-months revenue is essentially in the middle of our guidance and would represent our 26th consecutive year of record net revenue and up over 20% from last year. \u2047 Our performance in 2021 and, quite frankly, over the past six years has been a testament to our focus on consistently reinvesting in our business and our people. \u2047 We've built a diversified business comprised of highly talented people that has enabled our firm to generate consistent growth regardless of the operating environment, which is something I believe gets overlooked by analysts and investors. \u2047 We take a disciplined approach to capital deployment by focusing on where we can generate the best risk-adjusted returns. \u2047 Since the end of 2015, this approach has enabled us to consistently grow our assets from $13 billion to over $30 billion, execute and integrate 11 acquisitions, add nearly 700 financial advisors, initiate and consistently grow our dividend and repurchase approximately 20 million shares. \u2047 We accomplished all of this while improving our pre-tax margins over that time period from 10% to nearly 24% and through the first nine months of 2021 generated an annualized return on tangible equity of nearly 30%. \u2047 I would note these results are against a backdrop of a 0-rate environment, and Stifel is very well positioned from a net interest income and margin perspective for an increase in interest rates. \u2047 We expect this transaction to close at the end of October, and I'm excited about the strategic fit of this business. \u2047 As shown on this slide, we are adding a highly complementary business to our already strong fixed income franchise. \u2047 Vining Sparks focuses on providing institutional fixed income brokerage, balance sheet management, portfolio accounting and underwriting services to depository institutions. \u2047 Our analysis indicates that 70% of Vining Sparks' revenue is generated from depositories with less than $2 billion in assets, while nearly 75% of Stifel's depository revenue comes from clients with greater than $2 billion in assets. \u2047 As such, we believe that the combination of our two firms is not only highly complementary, but cements Stifel's position as the leading investment bank for depository institutions in the United States. \u2047 Looking another way at the complementary profile of this combination, there exists only a 5% revenue overlap within end clients of the combined client base. \u2047 We also believe there exist solid synergy opportunities in debt offerings and M&A through KBW and correspondent banking through Stifel Bank. \u2047 Moving on to our operating segments, and starting with Global Wealth Management. \u2047 Again we posted record quarterly and year-to-date revenue. \u2047 Third quarter revenue totaled $656 million, up 24% year-on-year, and year-to-date revenue was approximately $1.9 billion, an increase of 19%. \u2047 This growth was driven by recruiting, increased client activity and growth in interest-earning assets. \u2047 The continued growth in our asset management revenue in the third quarter was buoyed by higher market valuations and increased client assets in the second quarter, as the majority of our fee-based assets don't advance. \u2047 Despite muted growth in equity valuations during the third quarter, as measured by the S&P 500, we finished the quarter with record client assets of $407 billion and fee-based assets of approximately $150 billion. \u2047 I am pleased with both our loan growth and improvement in both net interest income, which increased 21% over last year, and a 10-basis point sequential improvement in our net interest margin. \u2047 The next slide highlights the strength of our recruiting and growth drivers of our platform. \u2047 For the quarter, we added 46 advisors, including 41 experienced advisors, with total trailing 12-month production of $35 million. \u2047 Our recruiting pipelines remain very robust. \u2047 And furthermore, I expect that our independent channel will begin to add to our recruiting success, as that advisor channel is gaining traction and momentum. \u2047 Moving on to our Institutional group. \u2047 We posted our second-highest revenue quarter, as we continue to benefit from increased activity levels and the scale of our business. \u2047 Our quarterly net revenue totaled $492 million, which was up 36% from the prior year. \u2047 nine-month revenue increased 39%, to over $1.5 billion. \u2047 Record quarterly advisory revenues of $208 million were up nearly 160%, while capital raising posted revenue of $153 million, up 18%. \u2047 As expected, trading revenue declined to $124 million, while year-to-date trading declined 10%, to $455 million. \u2047 Our Institutional pre-tax margin for the quarter was 25.4%, which was our second highest, trailing only the second quarter of this year. \u2047 For the first nine months, pre-tax margin was 25.3% and was up nearly 700 basis points, as we continue to generate substantial top line growth, which drives operating leverage. \u2047 Looking at the revenue components of the Institutional group, our equities business posted record nine-month results of $533 million, up 37%, while our third quarter revenue totaled $142 million, up 7% year-on-year. \u2047 Our fixed income business posted year-to-date revenue of $428 million and quarterly revenue of $135 million. \u2047 Our quarterly fixed income business reflected strength in capital raising, offset by a decline in trading revenue. \u2047 I'll focus on the trading businesses of these segments and discuss capital raising on the next slide regarding investment banking. \u2047 With respect to our trading businesses, quarterly equity revenue totaled $48 million, down 21% sequentially. \u2047 As I stated earlier, this was the result of lower market activity level, as volumes on the NYSE and NASDAQ declined 8% sequentially. \u2047 Additionally, we incurred mark-to-market losses attributed to warrants associated with certain investment banking transactions versus gains in the prior quarter. \u2047 For the first nine months, equity trading revenue was $189 million, up 1% from 2020. \u2047 Fixed income trading revenue of $76 million was down 17% sequentially, as we saw lower activity levels in agencies, corporates and munis, as overall market activity declined a similar amount. \u2047 On slide nine, investment banking quarterly revenue increased 71%, to $372 million, which was just $5 million short of what would have amounted to our fourth consecutive quarterly record. \u2047 Year-to-date, investment banking revenue totals nearly $1.1 billion, up 77%, as both advisory and capital raising are having record years. \u2047 The $208 million of advisory revenue was our second consecutive record quarter, driven primarily by the strength of our U.S. business; notably, financials, diversified services and technology. \u2047 While essentially all of our major verticals generated strong results, we also saw sequential gains in healthcare, industrials and in the fund placement business from Eaton Partners. \u2047 With our pipelines at record levels and barring a substantial change in the market or the economy, we expect another strong advisory quarter for the fourth quarter of 2021. \u2047 Moving on to capital raising, our equity underwriting business posted revenue of $104 million, up 22%. \u2047 We saw a balance in this business, with contributions from healthcare, technology, financials and industrials. \u2047 Our fixed income underwriting business posted its second consecutive record quarter, with $61 million in revenue, up 6% sequentially. \u2047 Our municipal finance business posted another great quarter, as we lead-managed 257 municipal issues. \u2047 For the first nine months, our market share in terms of number of transactions increased year-on-year by 140 basis points, to 12.7% market share. \u2047 In addition to the strength of our public finance business, we continue to see strong contributions from our debt capital markets business, as we completed a record number of deals in the quarter. \u2047 While activity levels in equity capital raising have slowed from the robust levels earlier this year, overall activity remains solid, and with strong pipelines in our fixed income underwriting business I expect another strong quarter for the fourth quarter. \u2047 Turning to slide 10. \u2047 For the quarter, net interest income totaled $132 million, which was up 10% sequentially. \u2047 Our firmwide net interest margin increased to 210 basis points, primarily due to increases in leverage finance fee income and our stock loan business, while our bank NIM remained at 240 basis points. \u2047 The growth in our NII was driven by a 5% increase in our interest-earning assets as well as the aforementioned increased leverage finance fee income and security lending activity. \u2047 In terms of our fourth quarter expectations, we see net interest income in a range of $125 million to $135 million and with a similar NIM to the third quarter, as we expect lower activity levels in some of the more episodic fee income opportunities to -- growth in our balance sheet. \u2047 I'd also note that we've updated our asset sensitivity based on the increased size of our balance sheet. \u2047 In our first quarter earnings call, we estimated that we'd generate an incremental $150 million to $175 million of pre-tax income as a result of a 100-basis point increase in rates. \u2047 However, given the nearly $3 billion increase in our balance sheet since the end of the first quarter, we are revising this forecast to a range of $175 million to $200 million, using the same market and deposit beta assumptions. \u2047 Moving on to the next slide. \u2047 I'll go into more detail on the bank's loan and investment portfolios. \u2047 We ended the quarter with total net loans of $13.6 billion, which was up approximately $730 million from the prior quarter and was primarily driven by growth in our consumer channel. \u2047 Our mortgage portfolio increased by $390 million sequentially, as we continue to see demand for residential loans from our Wealth Management clients. \u2047 Our securities-based loan portfolio increased by approximately $250 million. \u2047 Growth in these loans continues to be strong, as FA recruiting momentum continues to drive increased loan balances. \u2047 Our commercial portfolio increased by nearly $100 million sequentially, primarily due to a 5% increase in C&I loans, as increases in fund banking loans more than offset the expected reduction in PPP loans. \u2047 Moving to the investment portfolio, which increased by $330 million sequentially, the vast majority of the sequential growth was in our CLO portfolio, as we continue to see these securities as generating strong risk-adjusted returns. \u2047 Turning to the allowance. \u2047 We had a modest reserve release of approximately $700,000, as the improvement in our economic projections was essentially offset by the additional reserves tied to loan growth. \u2047 As a result of the reserve release and the composition of our loan growth during the quarter, our ratio of allowance to total loans declined to 91 basis points, excluding PPP loans. \u2047 I would reiterate that it's important to look at the level of reserves between our consumer and commercial portfolios, given the relative levels of inherent risk. \u2047 At quarter-end, the consumer allowance to total loans was 36 basis points; for the commercial portfolio, it was 120 basis points. \u2047 We also continue to see strong credit metrics, with nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans declining to only four basis points. \u2047 Moving on to capital and liquidity. \u2047 Our risk-based and leveraged capital ratios increased to 20.6% and 12%, respectively. \u2047 The increase in our capital ratios was a result of continued strength in our operating results, an incremental $150 million of preferred equity and the decreasing impact of volatility associated with the pandemic on our trading portfolio. \u2047 We continued our share repurchase program in the third quarter by buying back 670,000 shares at an average price of $66.74. \u2047 Year-to-date, we've repurchased nearly 1.5 million shares, at an average cost of $66.34. \u2047 We have approximately 11.8 million shares remaining"], "gold_summary":
