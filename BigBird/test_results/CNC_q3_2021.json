{"article": ["Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its estimates to change. \u2047 Additionally, please mark your calendars for our upcoming 2022 guidance meeting to be held on December 10. \u2047 We will invite sell-side analysts to participate in person in New York, and ask others to participate virtually. \u2047 Brent Layton has a conflict that could not be avoided, but you can expect him to join us on future calls. \u2047 First, on the quarter, we were pleased with the results and the fact that the matrix was straightforward with minimum noise. \u2047 In the quarter, we generated revenue of $32.4 billion and HBR of 88.1% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26. \u2047 Drew, provide additional context. \u2047 Overall, the numbers reflect a return to a normal utilization while still covering reasonable amounts of COVID costs which seem to have peaked in August. \u2047 Importantly, our performance provides a strong foundation for our value creation plan and we remain committed to our margin goals. \u2047 Further supporting our strategic progress during the quarter, we announced a series of organizational changes including a point Sarah London as Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors and Brent Layton as the company's President and Chief Operating Officer. \u2047 We do not plan to replace his position, as we continue to work on refreshing and streamline the Board to a size of 9 to 13 members. \u2047 Turning to the current landscape. \u2047 Overall, the portfolio is performing well. \u2047 We delivered a strong membership increase in Medicaid are positioned for continued growth in Medicare and we continue to stay the course in marketplace. \u2047 Sarah, will provide further detail. \u2047 We are working closely with states and the timing redetermination, which has so far been extended until January with the opportunity for additional extensions three months at a time. \u2047 In addition, we look forward to offer members who will no longer qualify for Medicaid, the opportunity to enroll in our marketplace for us. \u2047 We expect that advanced premium tax credits will keep costs in line for these members, and we value the opportunity support continuity of care and preserve, provide relationships which in the long-term leads to higher quality care, which is much more cost effective. \u2047 Looking ahead of 2022, there are several additional factors we continue to monitor and evaluate. \u2047 These include the pace of the RFP pipeline, ongoing growth in Medicare, the opportunity for improvement in marketplace license, as well as the COVID landscape overall. \u2047 We will provide full details on these factors and their potential impacts, as headwinds and tailwinds at our Investor Day in December. \u2047 In addition, we are committed to achieving an investment grade rating and a disciplined capital allocation framework that takes into consideration our priorities including investing in our business debt management and share repurchases. \u2047 Before I close, I would like to highlight the importance of vaccine mandates in stopping the transmission of COVID and protecting those who cannot yet safely receive inoculations, particularly the immunologically compromised, and young children for whom vaccine access is getting closer, but still pending. \u2047 Centene has been a leader on this critical issue mandating vaccinations, as an additional employment. \u2047 We also continue to support our members in assessing the vaccine to a national outreach and campaigns and creative participation such as the Pro Football Hall of Fame NESCO. \u2047 In closing, we are pleased with our third quarter results and has the same momentum across the enterprise. \u2047 We remain focused on executing across the value creation playbook, we have in place. \u2047 As always, we intend and continue to provide transparent updates, as we progress through our initiatives and I look forward to seeing many of you at our December Investor Day. \u2047 I'm going to provide highlights of our product line performance before touching on the early progress we are making around our value creation plan. \u2047 During the quarter we continue to build on our market leading position and are experiencing solid growth and good outcomes. \u2047 In Medicaid our business continues to perform well, membership increased to $14.8 million aided by continued suspension of redeterminations and the go-live of our business in North Carolina. \u2047 In marketplace with more than 90% of our membership receiving some form of subsidy we maintain our low income focus and our commitment to providing healthcare access and affordability to our members. \u2047 At the end of the third quarter our marketplace membership was $2.2 million, and we are pleased with the progress of our clinical initiatives as we head into the fourth quarter. \u2047 Looking ahead, our 2022 marketplace offerings reflect a diverse and evolving needs of our Ambetter consumers. \u2047 We are introducing a group of new products designed to optimize flexibility, access and affordability. \u2047 In addition, we plan to grow our coverage map by entering five new states with marketplace products. \u2047 As we continue to monitor policies and plans around the return of Medicaid redeterminations we believe that our enhanced footprints within both Medicaid and marketplace positions Centene well to support our members with options for coverage continuity. \u2047 In Medicare Advantage, we continue to see a compelling growth opportunity for the company. \u2047 We are expanding Centene's footprint to reach $48 million Medicare eligible adults across the country, which is more than 75% of eligible beneficiaries. \u2047 Today, Centene serves more than 1.2 million Medicare Advantage members across 33 states. \u2047 Beginning in 2022, the company expects to offer plans in 327 new counties, representing a 26% increase and three new states including Massachusetts, Nebraska and Oklahoma. \u2047 Now turning to our value creation plan. \u2047 As as we outlined this past June, we have embarked on our strategy to leverage Centene's size and scale and drive margin expansion through SG&A efficiencies, medical management initiatives and strategic capital deployment. \u2047 We are focused on generating sustained growth and margin expansion. \u2047 And although it is still very early seeing the enterprisewide commitment from the outset has given me confidence that we are on the right track to achieve our goal. \u2047 Brent, Drew and I are leading this effort and we believe, we now have an organizational structure in place to drive this forward across our business and functions. \u2047 On the SG&A front, we have identified opportunities across the company where we believe we can be more efficient. \u2047 This isn't about cost cutting, it's about positioning the company for long-term success. \u2047 For example, we piloted new technology within our call centers for use by Centene employees. \u2047 This technology trial yielded significant reductions in cycle times, and now will be rolled out enterprisewide. \u2047 Another opportunity we've mentioned is a value creation target is pharmacy. \u2047 As we alluded to in June, we are now taking steps toward consolidating down to a single PBM platform, and rationalizing those platforms we view as non-essential. \u2047 We began this work in Q3, and look forward to providing more detail around this overall program in December. \u2047 In addition, we are progressing on the review and potential sale of certain non-core assets, as part of our portfolio optimization process, which has taken on an increased focus as part of the value creation plan. \u2047 Again, we are in the very early stages, and as we continue to leverage our size and scale to our benefit these are just a few of the many levers we are pulling to achieve our adjusted net income margin target of at least 3.3%. \u2047 Let me remind you that as we progress through these and other initiatives, particularly in 2023 and 2024, we anticipate seeing a greater impact pushing us toward our goal. \u2047 Before handing the call over to Drew, let me provide a quick update on the Magellan transaction. \u2047 We are still awaiting one final regulatory approval in California, and continue to expect the deal to close by the end of 2021. \u2047 We continue to work with the regulators to move the transaction to completion. \u2047 Our Q3 consolidated HBR was 88.1%, right on track with our full year guidance. \u2047 Consistent with national data our COVID costs peaked in late August, drop throughout September and the sharp drop of COVID costs continues in October. \u2047 While the delta variant has a higher peak, as measured in authorizations compared to January 2021, it peaked and fell rather quickly. \u2047 With our diversified enterprise we were able to manage through this given our steady performance in Medicaid and Medicare. \u2047 Accordingly, we are maintaining the midpoint of our consolidated HBR range for 2021 just shrinking the width of the range since we're three quarters through the year. \u2047 Our adjusted SG&A expense ratio was 8.6% in the third quarter with higher short term variable incentive compensation costs compared to Q2 given the positive trajectory of the business. \u2047 While we are getting some SG&A leverage on our growth in 2021, there is a lot more to come over the next few years, as we execute on the value creation plan. \u2047 One item to point out from a mix standpoint circle, a well positioned ASC like hospital enterprise and England has an SG&A rate in the '30s on service fee revenue of approximately $1.4 billion. \u2047 This has an approximate 30 basis point mathematical impact on our consolidated SG&A rate for Q3 2021 and going forward. \u2047 Continuing on the highlights of the quarter, cash flow provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $1.8 billion. \u2047 With respect to unregulated cash we had $2.7 billion at quarter end, which includes the $1.8 billion we borrowed to partially fund the Magellan transaction. \u2047 We expect to need approximately $2.3 billion of unregulated cash to close Magellan in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Debt at quarter end was $18.8 billion, our debt to cap ratio was 41.2% inclusive of Magellan financing and excluding our non-recourse debt. \u2047 Our medical claims liability totaled $14.1 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 48 in Q2. \u2047 This three-day increase was driven by the timing of state-directed payments, claims payments and state fee schedule changes. \u2047 You will see a couple of items in our GAAP to adjusted earnings per share reconciliation, a $309 million one-time gain as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 60% of circle in early July 2021 and a write-down of our investment in RxAdvance of $229 million in the quarter, as we are simplifying our pharmacy operations, both of these are non-cash items. \u2047 Before we get to updated 2021 guidance I wanted to comment on the recently announced rating year 2022 star scores. \u2047 This will drive 2023 Medicare revenue. \u2047 We are certainly pleased with over 50% of membership in 4-star contracts and our first 5-star contract, rating year 2022 benefited from the continuation of disaster provisions due to COVID with an expectation of those provisions sunsetting and upon reviewing the in-process results of our quality program we expect rating year 2023 scores to drop, followed by a subsequent jump in rating year 2024 scores. \u2047 This essentially has the effect of providing some fungible investment dollars for calendar year 2023. \u2047 We've updated our full-year 2021 outlook including a narrowed adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $5.05 to $5.15. \u2047 This outlook incorporates revenues within a range of $125.2 billion to $126.4 billion increased by the inclusion of Circle and expected state-related pass through payments of $500 million. \u2047 It includes an expected HBR of 87.6% to 88% and then SG&A ratio of 8.2% to 8.6% 20 basis points higher than the prior guidance with the largest driver being the mix math on Circle as we just discussed. \u2047 While we still have a quarter to go to finish 2021, the strength of our diversified enterprise has enabled us to manage through the volatility of COVID, pent-up demand and resulting 2021 marketplace pressure. \u2047 This enterprise strength will only improve, as we execute on the value creation plan over the next few years. \u2047 With regards to 2022, consistent with our public comments in September, we continue to expect modest adjusted earnings per share growth next year. \u2047 We look forward to providing more details around 2022 expectations and going more in-depth into the long-term value creation drivers during our December 10 Investor Day. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["centene q3 adjusted earnings per share $1.26.  \u2047  q3 adjusted earnings per
