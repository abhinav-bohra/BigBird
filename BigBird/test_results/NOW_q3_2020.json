{"article": ["Joining me are Bill McDermott, our president and chief executive officer; and Gina Mastantuono, our chief financial Officer. \u2047 During today's call, we will review our third-quarter 2020 financial results and discuss our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of 2020 and full-year of 2020. \u2047 The guidance we will provide today is based on our assumptions as to the macroeconomic environment in which we will be operating. \u2047 Those assumptions are based on the facts we know today. \u2047 Many of these assumptions relate to matters that are beyond our control and changing rapidly including, but no limited to, the time frames for and severity of social distancing and other mitigation requirements, the continued impact of COVID-19 on customers' purchasing decision and the length of our sales cycle particularly for customers in certain industries. \u2047 We'd also like to point out that the company reports non-GAAP results in addition to and not as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \u2047 All financial figures we will discuss today are non-GAAP except for revenues, net income and remaining performance obligations. \u2047 A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. \u2047 I hope you and your loved ones are healthy and safe. \u2047 We continue to be ServiceNow strong in support of our employees and communities in these challenging times. \u2047 We also remain passionately focused on delivering for our customers, partners and shareholders. \u2047 2020 has brought unimaginable change to the world. \u2047 Companies have to operate in new and faster ways, pivoting their business models. \u2047 Everyone is adapting to new employee and customer expectations. \u2047 It's all about people. \u2047 Getting teams to collaborate across the enterprise is now more important than ever. \u2047 The workplace of the future will be distributed. \u2047 Managing complex digital workflows will be critical. \u2047 Enterprises need innovation without disruption. \u2047 It's clear that speed has become the differentiator. \u2047 ServiceNow is leading this once-in-a-generation opportunity to make work, work better for people. \u2047 And this is what we're seeing. \u2047 All value chains are being split apart. \u2047 They are being reformed into modern digital workflows across the enterprise. \u2047 More than $3 trillion have been invested in digital transformation initiatives. \u2047 But as IDC research shows us, only 26% of the investments have delivered meaningful ROI. \u2047 Massive investment is simply not creating massive change. \u2047 This is fueling the workflow revolution. \u2047 The missing link is integration. \u2047 Systems, silos, departments and processes must come together into holistic, cross-enterprise workloads. \u2047 The Now Platform unlocks this ROI by offering speed, agility and resilience. \u2047 Companies need it now. \u2047 It gives companies the ability to deliver at scale the experiences employees and customers demand. \u2047 That's the power of the Now Platform, a single architecture and data model that serves as the enterprise platform for all other platforms. \u2047 In other words, it's the platform for digital business. \u2047 As one CIO said to me, my goal with the Now Platform is to enable my colleagues to perform their top 50 tasks in a single environment that provides a consumer-like experience. \u2047 The momentum of the workflow revolution is unstoppable. \u2047 Despite the COVID operating environment, our team delivered outstanding Q3 results. \u2047 Gina will provide the details. \u2047 Here are the headlines. \u2047 We beat expectations across the board. \u2047 We surpassed 1,000 customers with ACV over $1 million. \u2047 We landed our largest deal ever with our largest customer who has now crossed over $40 million in ACV. \u2047 And we're raising full-year guidance today. \u2047 We're driving sustainable growth well on our way to $10 billion and beyond. \u2047 I'm incredibly proud of our team. \u2047 In the most challenging of times, we are focused, disciplined committed to helping our customers succeed above all other priorities. \u2047 The speed at which we're innovating has never been faster. \u2047 Our team is leading the future of work. \u2047 We are releasing new innovations every two weeks with our Safe Workplace suite to help our customers safely return their employees back to the workplace. \u2047 Other new product introductions include Hardware Asset Management, Financial Services Operations, Telecom Service Management, Legal Service Delivery, Workplace Service Delivery and Connected Operations. \u2047 I could go on. \u2047 In addition, our platform innovations are differentiated for the direct-to-consumer industry where subscribers demand flawless customer service. \u2047 One of the largest streaming services in the world seamlessly upgraded their ServiceNow environment this past weekend with 0 downtime. \u2047 There was no impact to any of their active subscribers. \u2047 How's that for customer service. \u2047 Such innovation demonstrates the power of the Now Platform. \u2047 We were honored in Q3 to be named a leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for enterprise low-code application platforms. \u2047 We believe this is yet another example of the agility of the Now Platform to help customers quickly workflow any challenge. \u2047 We think our Gartner recognition validates the breadth of our IT solutions, putting ServiceNow in a leader position in the two 2020 Magic Quadrants: IT risk management and IT vendor risk management tools. \u2047 And of course, we remain the leader on both completeness of vision and highest in ability to execute for our ITSM core business. \u2047 Now let's look at Q3 performance. \u2047 Highlights across our portfolio, here we go. \u2047 Our top 20 deals included three or more products. \u2047 Our core remains ever strong. \u2047 ITSM was included in 17 of the top 20 deals with customers choosing ITSM Pro in 16 deals. \u2047 The embedded AI and machine learning capabilities are helping IT organizations scale and automate, reduce complexity, cost and risk, while enabling people to work from anywhere. \u2047 ITOM was included in 18 of the top 20 deals. \u2047 We won deals with Mount Sinai and the Federal Defense Information Systems Agency. \u2047 Our customer workflows continue to be a growth driver. \u2047 13 of the top 20 deals included CSM. \u2047 Eight of those deals were greater than $1 million. \u2047 Our customer wins in Q3 demonstrate how ServiceNow is becoming the enterprise workflow standard. \u2047 For example, Q3 was our largest federal quarter ever. \u2047 We now have nine federal customers over $10 million in ACV. \u2047 Army and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. \u2047 And we had new customer wins with agencies such as the U.S. Senate and Federal Claims Court. \u2047 In our largest deal ever, the Department of Veteran Affairs is modernizing its enterprise service management and IT capabilities. \u2047 They are using the Now Platform to have real-time visibility into the health, availability and costs of their critical business services. \u2047 This will deliver significant benefits to our heroic veterans. \u2047 With ITSM Pro, VA will automate its manual workflows with AI and machine learning capabilities to free up employees to better serve veterans. \u2047 As the U.S. Air Force has publicly described, they are deploying the Now Platform as part of their digital Air Force of the Future vision. \u2047 We are helping them deliver Genius Bar-like self-help services to the women and men serving our country around the globe. \u2047 In addition to federal, state governments also are leveraging the Now Platform. \u2047 Tennessee's Department of Human Services expanded its relationship with ServiceNow. \u2047 They are using CSM to reopen state offices for public services, while keeping health and safety a priority. \u2047 They quickly adopted our latest Now Platform Paris release, utilizing a new feature that enables the public to self-schedule appointments and digitally check in when arriving for appointments. \u2047 The state of Alaska's governor issued a directive to protect workers and ensure that the state can continue operating in a pandemic environment. \u2047 Their existing systems, manual processes and dispersed population created numerous issues to work effectively. \u2047 The HR department is transitioning to a centralized operating model, and ServiceNow will solve their manual onboarding issues and enable employee workflows to be digitally transformed. \u2047 Outside of federal and state and customers across industries, the Now Platform is the standard for driving enterprise digital transformation. \u2047 2020 has brought significant changes to Dell's work-from-home model. \u2047 Our HR product will support this new way of working by providing enterprise onboarding and transitions. \u2047 And the Now Platform is helping Dell in its mission to provide the best customer experience in the markets they serve. \u2047 Leading managed services provider, TPx, became the first customer of our new telecom industry-specific product. \u2047 ServiceNow is going to run TPx' customer portal, enabling, onboarding, project management, customer servicing and IT support. \u2047 A major Indian financial institution chose ServiceNow to give them complete visibility to better control enterprise risks, replacing legacy solutions that were stitched together. \u2047 This is another example of the movement we are seeing in the industry to replace legacy solutions and consolidate on the Now Platform. \u2047 In Q3, we continued to see strong momentum with our Safe Workplace suite of apps. \u2047 This quarter, we added two new apps into the Safe Workplace suite: Employee Travel Safety and Health and Safety Testing. \u2047 Our Safe Workplace apps demonstrate our ability to innovate quickly and deliver fast time to value in weeks, not months and years. \u2047 We've seen nearly 800 downloads of our Safe Workplace apps. \u2047 Customers include Standard & Poor's, Raymond James and Rutgers University. \u2047 At Rutgers, our Safe Workplace apps are being used for health screening, contact tracing and room reservations to ensure a safe environment for all students and faculty. \u2047 Here's my favorite customer win. \u2047 I'm a huge basketball fan. \u2047 As many of you know, my grandfather, Bobby McDermott, was a Hall of Famer. \u2047 So I couldn't be more proud of how ServiceNow helped pro basketball have a successful restart season. \u2047 The NBA and WNBA were able to implement ServiceNow's employee workflows in under a week to manage the complex manual processes associated with restarting. \u2047 ServiceNow helped the league facilitate screening for more than 2,600 league staff, vendors and guests who entered the NBA and WNBA bubble in Florida and successfully processed more than 13,000 essential documents. \u2047 Using ServiceNow technology, the league demonstrated that a safe, careful return to professional sports was possible with the right tools and protocols in place. \u2047 We are very proud to become the official workflow partner of the NBA and WNBA, and we look forward to helping the league continue to drive digital transformation to deliver great employee player and fan experiences. \u2047 As we drive great customer wins, our partner ecosystem is growing even stronger. \u2047 We are grateful for the investments our partners are making to grow their ServiceNow businesses and to serve our customers. \u2047 We recently announced a go-to-market partnership between IBM and ServiceNow. \u2047 This new business opportunity combines ServiceNow's ITSM and ITOM capabilities with IBM's Watson AI ops to help customers automate IT and scale, reducing cost and risk. \u2047 Last week, we announced an expanded partnership with Accenture. \u2047 The new Accenture ServiceNow business group will accelerate digital transformation programs for customers in telecom, government, financial services, manufacturing, healthcare and life sciences. \u2047 Hey, in summary, Q3 was another great outperform quarter. \u2047 We are confident in our ability to succeed in this environment. \u2047 We are bullish on our long-term outlook and our path to $10 billion and beyond. \u2047 Our leadership is expanding our reach and opportunities with marquee partnerships, such as the NBA and WNBA, IBM and Accenture. \u2047 There are many more. \u2047 Our brand is resonating. \u2047 We are becoming an essential C-suite strategic partner. \u2047 Our ecosystem is growing fast. \u2047 Our go-to-market capabilities are stronger than ever. \u2047 Our product innovation is second to none. \u2047 We are deeply committed to attracting, retaining and developing the best talent in this industry. \u2047 We are a big tent company dedicated to diversity, inclusion and belonging. \u2047 Diversity makes us stronger, making ServiceNow the destination company where the best talent belongs and thrives. \u2047 And this is what's going to make us unstoppable. \u2047 Our new board member and new chief global talent officer were announced today, and it demonstrates the caliber of people we are attracting. \u2047 I could not be more thrilled to have Larry Jackson joining our board and Gaby Toledano joining our leadership team. \u2047 Both are exceptional leaders. \u2047 Larry is leading the music industry revolution for Apple Music. \u2047 His experience using technology to create innovative, market-leading consumer experiences will be invaluable as we drive innovative employee and customer experiences for the global marketplace. \u2047 Likewise, Gaby brings deep tech industry and talent leadership experience, building world-class organizations at scale for some of the best-known companies in the world. \u2047 We were humbled to recently be recognized as the company with the best leadership team in an anonymous survey of more than 10,000 employees across the industry. \u2047 Gaby is a great addition who will only make us stronger. \u2047 In so many ways, we are just getting started. \u2047 This year's unprecedented headwinds have only strengthened our digital transformation tailwinds. \u2047 We have the platform businesses need to workflow standard for enterprise transformation, the missing link for integration of existing technology investments and the creation of modern enterprise workflows. \u2047 Remember, behind every great experience is a great workflow. \u2047 Whatever challenge a business is facing, we workflow it. \u2047 We will make workflow a verb. \u2047 ServiceNow is incredibly well positioned to become the defining enterprise software company in the 21st century. \u2047 We will not slow down in pursuit of this goal. \u2047 We couldn't be more fired up to finish this year very strong. \u2047 Q3 was a fantastic quarter for ServiceNow as the team continued to execute very well despite the challenges created by COVID-19. \u2047 We exceeded the high end of our subscription revenues and subscription billings guidance, and that top line beat carried through to our robust operating margin and strong free cash flow generation. \u2047 Q3 subscription revenues were $1.091 billion, representing 29% year-over-year constant currency growth. \u2047 Q3 subscription billings were $1.081 billion, representing 24% year-over-year adjusted growth driven by the great execution from our sales team. \u2047 Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, ended the quarter at approximately $7.3 billion, representing 28% year-over-year constant currency growth. \u2047 And current RPO was approximately $3.8 billion, representing 30% year-over-year constant currency growth. \u2047 Our top line strength demonstrates the power of our product portfolio and our ability to meet the evolving needs of our customers. \u2047 The Now Platform is uniquely positioned to deliver exceptional time to value and provide workflows that create great experiences for customers, employees and partners. \u2047 We are solving customers' challenges and playing a key role in accelerating their digital transformation. \u2047 The Now Platform enables the missing integrations that link together systems, silos, departments and processes into unified workflows. \u2047 Our best-in-"], "gold_summary": ["subscription revenues of $1,091 million in q3 2020, representing 31% year-over-year growth.
