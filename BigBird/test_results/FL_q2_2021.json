{"article": ["On a per share basis, second quarter earnings were $4.09 compared to earnings per share of $0.43 last year and earnings per share of $0.55 for the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 During the second quarter of 2021, the company recorded adjustments to earnings, including $303 million of noncash gains related to our minority investments, of which $290 million was related to a higher valuation for the company's investment in GOAT and a $39 million charge was due primarily to the impairment review of Footaction. \u2047 On a non-GAAP basis, earnings were $2.21 per share, up over 200% compared to earnings per share of $0.71 for the second quarter of last year and compared to earnings per share of $0.66 for the second quarter of 2019. \u2047 Andy Gray, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, will then provide additional insights into the business drivers in the quarter. \u2047 Andrew Page, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide guidance for the current fiscal year. \u2047 We are pleased to report that our momentum continued into the second quarter, leading to excellent top and bottom line results that reflect the health of our category, the deep engagement we have with our customers and the strategic nature of our vendor partnerships. \u2047 The broad-based growth was driven by strong performances in women's and kids footwear, coupled with strong demand across apparel and accessories. \u2047 In addition, with further gains in our inventory productivity and meaningfully low levels of promotional activity, we were able to deliver significant margin gains in a truly impressive bottom line performance. \u2047 For the second quarter, our global fleet was open for approximately 94% of possible operating days with temporary closures in Canada, certain markets in Asia and Germany. \u2047 With economies reopening to a greater extent throughout most of the markets in which we operate, we saw a low double-digit lift in traffic compared to fiscal 2020, which demonstrates the ongoing importance of our stores, where our customers enjoy spending time after connecting with us digitally. \u2047 Together with the strength of our stores, our digital channels also drove important connections with our customers. \u2047 Our digital sales penetration rate was 20.1%, normalizing from the peak levels we saw in 2020 while remaining well above 2019 levels, a trend we expect to continue going forward. \u2047 I'm proud of the great progress our teams have made against the ongoing challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, delivering great customer experiences despite lean inventory levels and temporary store closures in certain countries. \u2047 Turning now to some highlights of our three geographies. \u2047 In North America, our Kids Foot Locker and Champs Sports banners led the way with double-digit comp gains on top of last year's double-digit increases. \u2047 Our U.S. fleet was open close to 100% of the possible operating days, while our Canadian business was impacted by closures in Ontario, resulting in doors being opened approximately 70% of possible operating days. \u2047 We are also making meaningful progress on our North America portfolio and fleet transformation strategy. \u2047 As we discussed last quarter, we made the strategic decision to wind down our Footaction banner by the end of fiscal 2022 and focus our resources on our core concepts. \u2047 We just completed our first Footaction store conversion, reopening it as a Foot Locker format. \u2047 And we have approximately 50 more conversions planned for the back half of the year, along with 130 Footaction store closures. \u2047 In EMEA, pent-up demand drove growth as stores reopened across all countries, leading to a double-digit comp gain at Foot Locker Europe. \u2047 Altogether, our EMEA fleet was open 87% of possible operating days in the quarter compared to 70% in the second quarter of last year and a meaningful improvement from the 39% in the first quarter of this year. \u2047 Our APAC region delivered another solid quarter, also overcoming challenges related to COVID, with the fleet opened approximately 80% of possible operating days compared to over 90% in Q2 last year. \u2047 But even with the decline in operating days, we saw a 30% comp increase in our Asia markets and a mid-single-digit gain in the Pacific region. \u2047 We continued to make progress in our expansion strategy within Asia in the second quarter. \u2047 We launched our local Foot Locker website in South Korea, which will help us connect with our customers and grow our social media following and create a stronger omnichannel business in the market. \u2047 We also opened two new stores in South Korea and one store in Singapore. \u2047 In addition, we are excited to announce that we have signed a licensing agreement to enter the Indonesia market in partnership with MAP Active, the leading brand commerce and athletic retailer in Southeast Asia. \u2047 We expect to launch the local Foot Locker website and open two Foot Locker locations, a power store and a core store this year, with the first store slated to open by early Q4. \u2047 Turning to an update on FLX. \u2047 We continue to see our membership program gaining traction as enrollment increases. \u2047 We finished the second quarter with over 25 million members, up from over 20 million members at the end of the first quarter. \u2047 We are excited about the momentum and engagement in the program and the overall benefits it will provide to our business, including higher average spend for members versus nonmembers. \u2047 It's worth noting that members spent over 75% more than nonmembers in the second quarter as their average order values were approximately 10% higher than nonmembers and they shopped more frequently at our banners. \u2047 We are excited about where FLX is going, and we will continue to create new features and evolve the customer experience for members within existing markets while also working to launch the program in additional countries where we operate. \u2047 Overall, these metrics are why we are optimistic about the strength of our portfolio, the power of our assortments and the loyalty of our customers. \u2047 Andy will provide more detail around product highlights in the quarter and what we see in the pipeline for back-to-school and more broadly in Q3. \u2047 Before he does, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our recently announced agreements to acquire WSS and atmos and how we expect the addition of these two businesses to the Foot Locker Inc. family will advance our four strategic imperatives. \u2047 You may recall that on numerous occasions, we have articulated our commitment to our four strategic pillars in order to accelerate growth and drive greater value for our stakeholders. \u2047 First, elevate the customer experience. \u2047 Second, invest for long-term growth. \u2047 And fourth, leverage the power of our people. \u2047 The acquisitions of WSS and atmos fit our strategy to a tee while also tying back to our purpose, to inspire and empower youth culture and strengthening our connection to the sneaker community. \u2047 Each transaction will be accretive, create disciplined growth and enable us to invest in platforms that will maximize value for Foot Locker shareholders. \u2047 As we discussed when we announced the two transactions, the addition of WSS and atmos to our brand portfolio will diversify our store footprint and product mix, provide access to complementary and differentiated customer bases and accelerate our growth both in North America and internationally. \u2047 Moreover, together, these acquisitions will expand our ability to service the entire retail price value spectrum. \u2047 Today, we would like to provide additional detail on how we expect these two terrific businesses to deliver significant financial benefits and drive additional value for shareholders. \u2047 The management team has built a strong and scalable business model, led by their off-mall real estate strategy, full family offerings, focus on the Hispanic customer and the commitment to elevating the communities that it serves. \u2047 We see a path to approximately $1 billion in sales in the next five years from the $425 million in fiscal 2020, driven by the differentiated WSS consumer concept that we can bring to new U.S. markets and favorable future demographics of the United States marketplace. \u2047 In addition to market expansion opportunities, we also have identified both revenue-generating and operating cost synergies. \u2047 Our company's expertise in private label apparel design and sourcing, along with the utilization of our team additions speed-to-market apparel facility, present opportunities to generate incremental apparel sales for WSS. \u2047 Our company will also deliver incremental supply chain capabilities and capacity, along with shared services operating synergies across the business. \u2047 WSS is also well positioned for operating margin enhancements in light of its full family offering that increases basket size, a successful labor model that values outstanding customer service and expertise in choosing high-potential store locations that are well positioned to succeed. \u2047 We are excited to add this premium, globally recognized brand into our portfolio. \u2047 Over the past two decades, Hommyo-san, the founder of atmos, and his team have built a digitally led and culturally connected premium lifestyle brand that sits at the center of sneaker culture in Asia and beyond. \u2047 This acquisition will represent a highly strategic entry point into the important Japanese marketplace with immediate scale as we continue our expansion across Asia Pacific and tap into youth and sneaker culture across the globe. \u2047 As many of you know, atmos has a long and storied history of iconic collaborations with a variety of strategic brand partners that create unrivaled hype in our industry. \u2047 They are also best-in-class when it comes to retail design and experiential stores located in key markets and shopping districts that serve as inspiring and critical touch points in the omni customer journey. \u2047 Atmos generates over 60% of its revenue from their digital channels and has a strong global following across social media platforms. \u2047 Both WSS and atmos are high-growth businesses. \u2047 We expect that each will generate low double-digit sales growth annually over the next five years, that will, in turn, be accretive to the bottom line. \u2047 Andrew will provide some additional color on the potential accretion in his remarks. \u2047 We are excited about welcoming both WSS and the atmos to the Foot Locker Inc. family and look forward to integrating these businesses for the benefit of all stakeholders. \u2047 One other call out I would like to make is regarding our investment in GOAT. \u2047 During the quarter, GOAT closed $195 million Series F round of funding, again confirming the market's confidence in the broader sneaker category. \u2047 We continue to be excited about GOAT's success as they expand into new categories such as luxury apparel and accessories. \u2047 And we'll continue to look for ways to work together and expand the ecosystem. \u2047 In short, the strength of our business has enabled us to invest in profitable growing businesses and deploy our capital effectively to drive shareholder value. \u2047 Andrew will drill down into the numbers and discuss capital allocation and our outlook in a moment. \u2047 Before he does, here's my perspective as we look to the back half of the year. \u2047 We have positive momentum coming off of strong results from the first half. \u2047 That said, we're still facing several macro-level issues from the global pandemic to the knock-on effect that it is having in our supply chain. \u2047 We are also working closely with our strategic vendor partners to ensure our continued access to product amid the COVID-19 outbreak in Vietnam and other supply chain-related headwinds. \u2047 But for those things that we can control, we believe we're in a very good place to deliver positive results in the back half of this year. \u2047 Our product pipeline, which continues to be very strong, is resonating well with our consumers. \u2047 We anticipate the culture of basketball will continue to be a key revenue driver in the third quarter. \u2047 Seasonal offerings will also be very important as consumers look to diversify their footwear purchases. \u2047 Lastly, apparel trends continue to be very favorable as we enter back-to-school in the fall season. \u2047 And as we consider the opportunities for back-to-school in comparison to the delayed back-to-school season last year, a more normalized cadence this year presents an opportunity to capture more of that demand earlier in the quarter. \u2047 That said, we are keeping a close eye on possible disruptions caused by the evolving COVID-19 situation. \u2047 We continue to monitor the temporary store closures across the countries in which we operate and will adhere to government mandates. \u2047 We look forward to getting our store fleet back to full strength and meeting the pent-up demand we expect to see from our customers as we fully reopen our stores. \u2047 Our financial position remains strong. \u2047 Our vendor relationships are very strategic in nature. \u2047 And we continue to obsess around our customers, whether it's through our digital channels, social media, FLX or an in-store customer experience. \u2047 It is their dedication and hard work that made these outstanding results possible and will enable us to continue to drive our business forward and fulfill our purpose, to inspire in a power youth culture. \u2047 Our second quarter results continue to showcase that our strategy to strengthen the relationship with our current customers and bring new customers into our business are working. \u2047 The three key objectives here are: to maximize our product leadership and diversity of brands, utilize our global scale and investments to elevate our store and digital experiences to get great product into the hands of our consumers, and to continue to double down on our commitment to the communities we serve. \u2047 And we saw broad-based growth this quarter by following those objectives. \u2047 Our footwear business increased low single digits. \u2047 Our apparel and accessories businesses were both up double digits, with both families of business also up double digits compared to 2019. \u2047 We saw consumer diversity across departments, and our total men's business was relatively flat and we saw acceleration in women's and kids. \u2047 Encouragingly, kids had the largest gain as we continue to recruit and bring in the next generation of sneaker head to start their lifelong journey with us. \u2047 The culture of basketball, led by the key Nike icons and new additions from Adidas and New Balance, continues to create excitement and drive momentum. \u2047 Here, strength in women's and kids more than offset a mid-single-digit decline in men's that was going up against a double-digit comp of last year. \u2047 Additionally, we brought new consumers to our business with an increased focus on the seasonal category, delivering a high double-digit increase with gains in Crocs, UGG and Birkenstock along with an expanded balkanized offering in Vans and Converse, showcasing the variety our consumers want on their feet. \u2047 Another area of our business that continues to excite us and gain momentum is apparel, which was up double digits to last year and 2019. \u2047 Men's, women's and kids all delivered gains over 20%. \u2047 And again, our kids business had the largest increase as we bring in the next generation for apparel as well. \u2047 To add distinction to our assortments, we are thrilled to continue working with all of our partners to deliver a strong pipeline of exciting exclusive product concepts that resonate with all of our consumers. \u2047 This is a big part of how we bring energy every day. \u2047 Recent"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports
