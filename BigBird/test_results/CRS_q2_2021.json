{"article": ["Please note, for those of you listening by phone, you may experience a time delay in slide movement. \u2047 When referring to operating margins, that is based on operating income and sales, excluding surcharge. \u2047 Let's start on slide four and a review of our safety performance. \u2047 Through the first half of our fiscal year, our total case incident rate was 0.5. \u2047 During this time, we have achieved the lowest incident rate in Carpenter Technology's history and a 60% improvement year-over-year. \u2047 This marks another key step forward in our mission to achieve a zero injury workplace. \u2047 It is also noteworthy to point out that our PEP segment worked injury-free during the first half of the fiscal year. \u2047 We continue to emphasize key initiatives as we look to secure our next safety milestone. \u2047 Our safety results to date are especially impressive given the challenges related to COVID-19. \u2047 Importantly, every one of our operating facilities has remained open, which is an achievement that I know resonates with our customers and shows a clear resiliency and commitment. \u2047 Our second quarter results finished largely in line with our expectations. \u2047 Our performance was impacted by ongoing inventory reductions as well as the continued market headwinds. \u2047 Despite conditions being challenging, we are actively managing our business and have placed consistent emphasis on three key strategic priorities: first, ensure the safety of our employees. \u2047 Second, drive cash flow generation and strengthen our liquidity profile. \u2047 We have made further progress against this initiative in the second quarter and delivered $51 million of free cash flow. \u2047 Fiscal year-to-date, we have generated almost $114 million in free cash flow. \u2047 If you look at the last three quarters, we have generated $214 million of free cash flow. \u2047 We ended the second quarter with total liquidity of $665 million, including $271 million of cash and no near-term financial obligations. \u2047 Third, focus on the long-term relationships with our customers. \u2047 We have successfully deepened our relationships with our key customers across our end-use markets as we partner to address evolving material requirement and the initial signs of recovery across our end-use markets. \u2047 A great example of this is in the aerospace and defense end-use market, where we have recently extended multiple long-term agreements with key customers. \u2047 There are a couple of critical takeaways from these contract extensions. \u2047 Customers fully understand that capacity was limited for the aerospace materials we produce prior to the pandemic and that supply of such aerospace materials will be constrained again when build rates return to normalized levels. \u2047 Carpenter Technology is one of only a handful of companies in the world that produce these highly specialized materials and the only one that has invested in capacity, namely the Athens facility. \u2047 And the aerospace fundamentals that were present prior to the pandemic remained strong and unchanged going forward. \u2047 While we are working to best position our core business to be stronger on the other side of the pandemic, we also continue to take steps to advance our capabilities and leadership in critical emerging technologies. \u2047 To that end, our hot strip mill in Reading is now in the commissioning phase. \u2047 The mill will be a significant enhancement to our existing soft magnetics leadership position as it expands our capabilities to capitalize on the electrification megatrend that is shaping and growing many of our end-use markets. \u2047 I will speak more about our leading position in electrification later in my remarks. \u2047 Now let's move to slide six for the end-use market update. \u2047 Starting with the aerospace and defense end-use market, where sales were down year-over-year, but up slightly sequentially. \u2047 Many of the trends we were seeing last quarter are still prevalent, including changing forward material needs and uncertainty around recovery timing. \u2047 While our sequential results were up, we expect our third quarter performance to be choppy as the recovery takes shape. \u2047 In the medical end-use market, sales were down 3% sequentially as customers continue to manage inventory levels as concerns around hospital capacity and potential resurgence weighed on the supply chain. \u2047 In the transportation end-use market, sales were down year-over-year, but up sequentially due to a rebound in the global light vehicle submarket and the strength of our high-temperature solutions. \u2047 Now moving to the energy end-use market. \u2047 In terms of the year-over-year comparison, keep in mind that we divested our Amega West business earlier this fiscal year. \u2047 Within the oil and gas submarket, conditions in North America remain challenging. \u2047 For the power generation submarket, opportunities exist for applications in the gas turbine replacement cycle. \u2047 Lastly, for the industrial and consumer end-use market, sales were down year-over-year and sequentially. \u2047 However, we continue to experience strong demand for semiconductor and fluid control application. \u2047 In addition, consumer market demand was up across all key application areas. \u2047 In our industrial end-use market, we expect continued strong demand in the semiconductor industry for our highly engineered ultra high-purity materials. \u2047 The strong demand is driven by global growth in semiconductor manufacturing to support 5G smartphones and cloud infrastructure. \u2047 In fact, the demand for semiconductor capital equipment is expected to remain robust for the foreseeable future, with the world's largest contract chip maker planning to boost capital spending by almost 50% in 2021. \u2047 Since Carpenter Technology is a global leader in providing ultra-clean materials to support critical semiconductor applications, we are constantly evaluating customer request to increase our already strong participation in this space. \u2047 As we move into the second half of fiscal year 2021, we expect continued strength in the transportation in these markets. \u2047 Our high-value solutions play a significant role in delivering advanced powertrains across both passenger and commercial vehicles. \u2047 These are increasingly in demand as global emission standards tighten. \u2047 Strong sales have been met with low inventory levels as U.S. vehicle inventory remains below 50 days of supply, down approximately 16% year-over-year. \u2047 The heavy-duty truck market has rebounded and is projected to be up 40% in calendar year 2021. \u2047 That's positive news as Carpenter Technology supplies high-temperature exhaust valve materials and specialty fuel delivery solutions to the top three engine producers. \u2047 In our aerospace and defense end-use market, we continue to build on our already strong leadership position as we look forward to the market recovery. \u2047 In the near-term, demand will likely continue to remain low and choppy at times as specific programs and customers are recovering at different rates. \u2047 However, we expect a demand reset to higher levels if customers confidently reorient to increasing OEM demand. \u2047 Of course, Carpenter Technology will benefit from this recovery as a critical supplier across multiple applications on virtually all aircraft platforms. \u2047 Our customers continue to plan for the long-term, and we, likewise, are working with them to map out appropriate support plans. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, we continue to secure beneficial long-term contracts even during this downturn, with substantial price increases. \u2047 These key aerospace customers understand robust demand will return and value our support. \u2047 We remain very active in our defense submarket by offering advanced solutions. \u2047 As a notable example, recently, a key customer accomplished a step change in performance of a target platform with the help of our material solutions. \u2047 Our solutions are and will continue to be important for designers working on programs from aerospace electrification to next-generation defense systems. \u2047 Now turning to our medical end-use market. \u2047 States are beginning to lift restrictions on elective surgeries, spurring a restocking actions that will continue over the coming quarters at both end-user OEM customers as well as distributors supporting the medical device market. \u2047 These restocking efforts have more impact on elective surgery applications such as orthopedic and dental as opposed to the more nonelective cardiology segment, which has been more resilient. \u2047 The medical market is recovering ahead of aerospace, and our role as a critical supplier to the industry has been strongly reinforced and will provide incremental bottom line impact as demand recovers. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, we continue to invest in critical emerging technology. \u2047 In addition to supporting an already strong aerospace position and auxiliary power units and generators, our new hot strip mill will enable the launch of products to provide lead time benefits and capacity for growing aerospace electrification applications, automotive-based engine turbocharger designs and the transition to electric vehicles. \u2047 As electric vehicle demand continues to grow and program activity increases for electrifying short-range air travel, we are increasing our investment in motor technology and our soft magnetic solutions. \u2047 Specifically, we are investing in advanced part capabilities and state-of-the-art modeling and testing. \u2047 These capabilities ensure our customers realize the full material performance benefits in their motor and powertrain designs. \u2047 We've also invested in emerging technologies related to additive manufacturing and digital platforms, where adoption could be accelerated due to changes caused by this pandemic. \u2047 All are exciting developments to say the least and accelerators of earnings growth moving into the future. \u2047 I'll start on slide nine, the income statement summary. \u2047 Net sales in the second quarter were $348.8 million. \u2047 And sales, excluding surcharge, totaled $299.4 million. \u2047 Sales excluding surcharge decreased 3% sequentially on a 11% lower volume. \u2047 Compared to the second quarter a year ago, sales decreased 36% on 33% lower volume. \u2047 As Tony covered in his review of the end-use markets, the year-over-year decline is attributable to the ongoing demand headwinds in our key end-use markets of aerospace and defense and medical as a result of the global pandemic. \u2047 As expected, the demand was similar to our recent Q1 levels. \u2047 Given the current demand environment, we continue to actively manage our production schedules and focus on executing against our targeted inventory reduction program. \u2047 As we said on prior calls, while the reduction in inventory drives near-term cash flow generation as evidenced by our growing liquidity, it negatively impacts our operating income performance. \u2047 SG&A expenses were $42.2 million in the second quarter, down $13 million from the same period a year ago and flat sequentially. \u2047 The lower year-over-year SG&A expenses primarily reflect the actions we took to reduce costs, including the elimination of about 20% of our salary positions, managing discretionary spend closely, as well as the impact of remote working conditions that reduce certain administrative costs, such as travel and entertainment. \u2047 The current quarter's operating results include a $52.8 million goodwill impairment charge associated with our additive reporting unit that is in our PEP segment. \u2047 In addition, our results for the quarter include $3.9 million in COVID-19 related costs. \u2047 Included in this amount are direct incremental operating costs, including outside services to execute enhanced cleaning protocols, isolation pay for employees potentially exposed to COVID-19 and additional personal protective equipment and other operating supplies necessary to maintain the operations while keeping the employees safe against possible exposure. \u2047 The operating loss was $89 million in the quarter. \u2047 When excluding the impact of the special items, namely the goodwill impairment charge and the COVID-19 costs, adjusted operating loss was $32.3 million compared to adjusted operating income of $57.3 million in the prior year period and an adjusted operating loss of $30.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. \u2047 Again, the current quarter's results reflect the impact of significantly lower volume, combined with the targeted inventory reduction, partially offset by the cost reduction efforts. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 11.2%. \u2047 When factoring out the disproportionate impact of the goodwill impairment charge on the tax rate, the income tax rate for the quarter would have been approximately 25%. \u2047 For the balance of the year, we currently expect the tax rate to be in the range of 28% to 32%. \u2047 Earnings per share for the quarter was a loss of $1.76 per share. \u2047 When excluding the impact of the special items, adjusted earnings per share was a loss $0.61 per share. \u2047 Before we move on to the segment slides, I would like to highlight a couple of modeling items. \u2047 The first is related to interest expense. \u2047 We provided fiscal year 2021 guidance for net interest expense of $35 million, which reflected the impact of the bond refinancing we completed in Q1 and the assumptions around capitalized interest for the large projects expected to be placed in service in 2021. \u2047 Through six months, we reported interest expense of about $15 million and continue to expect full-year fiscal '21 interest expense to be about $35 million. \u2047 The second is depreciation and amortization. \u2047 Our guidance for fiscal year 2021 remains at $130 million. \u2047 Through six months, we reported depreciation and amortization of $60 million. \u2047 Now turning to slide 10 and our SAO segment results. \u2047 Net sales for the quarter were $300.4 million or $251.6 million, excluding surcharge. \u2047 Compared to the second quarter last year, sales excluding surcharge decreased 34% on 32% lower volume. \u2047 Sequentially sales, excluding surcharge, were essentially flat on 11% lower volume. \u2047 The sequential results reflect similar demand conditions in our largest end-use market of aerospace and defense as the supply chain continues to deal with near-term reductions in OEM build rates. \u2047 This was partially offset by stronger shipments in transportation as North American light vehicle production continues to ramp back up. \u2047 The industrial and consumer end-use market saw weaker demand in general industrial applications that was partially offset by higher demand for consumer applications. \u2047 SAO reported an operating loss of $11.6 million for the current quarter. \u2047 The same quarter a year ago, SAO's operating income was $76.3 million; and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, SAO reported an operating loss of $18.6 million. \u2047 The year-over-year reduction in operating income primarily reflects the impact of lower volume as well as the negative income statement impacts of reducing inventory, partially offset by the actions taken to reduce operating costs. \u2047 During the current quarter, SAO reduced inventory by approximately $58 million and year-to-date has reduced inventory by $131 million. \u2047 Sequentially, the lower operating loss is principally the result of lower volume, offset by a favorable product mix and a less pronounced impact of the inventory reduction relative to the first quarter due in part to rising raw material prices. \u2047 In addition, the current quarter's results reflect approximately $3.2 million of direct incremental costs associated with our efforts to protect our facilities and employees in light of COVID-19. \u2047 This compares with $7.3 million in COVID-19 costs in Q1, which as we disclosed last quarter, included $3.1 million associated with a bad debt write off. \u2047 Looking ahead, we expect demand conditions across most end-use markets will stabilize and begin to gradually"], "gold_summary": ["carpenter technology q2 loss per share $1.76.  \u2047  q2 adjusted loss per share $0.61 excluding items.  \u2047  q2 loss per
