{"article": ["I'm pleased to report on the Company's solid financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2019 as well as for the full 2019 year. \u2047 We continue to generate strong loan and core deposit growth and maintain solid asset quality and capital ratios, both on a sequential quarter and a year-over-year basis. \u2047 For the full 2019 year compared to last year, we improved our net interest income, net interest margin, non-interest income and efficiency ratio. \u2047 Our profitability and strong capital position enabled us to repurchase 165,700 shares of CPF stock during the fourth quarter. \u2047 During the 2019 year, we repurchased 797,000 shares or roughly 2.8% of our common stock outstanding as of the end of 2018. \u2047 Combined with cash dividends, we have returned $48.5 million in capital to our shareholders this past year. \u2047 We continue to execute with our RISE2020 initiative to enhance customer experience, drive stronger long-term growth and profitability, and improve shareholder returns. \u2047 In the fourth quarter, we launched our new website under the cpb. \u2047 bank domain name and implemented an end-to-end commercial loan origination system that will drive better efficiency. \u2047 The development of our new online and mobile banking platform is progressing well and our employees are excited to pilot the new platform in the first quarter. \u2047 Key steps toward our 2020 milestones in the area of the branch and ATM modernization were achieved with construction under way at our main branch headquarters and our new ATM selected. \u2047 The Hawaii economy continues to perform well with annual visitor arrivals set to exceed 10 million for the first time ever, continued strength in construction activity and growing importance of military in Hawaii over U.S.'s Indo-Pacific strategy. \u2047 Our total assets surpassed the $6 billion mark at year-end and reflected an increase of 3.5% from the previous year-end. \u2047 Our balance sheet composition continues to move in the right direction with growth focused in loans and core deposits. \u2047 Total loans increased by $82 million or 1.9% over the previous quarter and by $371 million or 9.1% year-over-year. \u2047 On a sequential quarter basis, increases were led by $43 million in growth in consumer loans and $41 million in growth in resi mortgages. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, the $371 million loan growth was broad-based in almost all loan categories. \u2047 Asset quality continued to be strong with non-performing assets of $1.7 million, which represented 3 basis points of total assets. \u2047 Total deposits increased on a sequential quarter basis by 1.6% and year-over-year by 3.5%. \u2047 Importantly, core deposits contributed to all that growth with the sequential quarter increase of $103 million or 2.5% led by a 3.7% increase in non-interest bearing demand balances. \u2047 The year-over-year increase in core deposits of $243 million or 6.1% was led by a 10.5% increase in savings and money market balances and a 9.3% increase in interest-bearing demand. \u2047 The increases in core deposits, both sequential quarter and year-over-year, were offset by planned decreases and higher cost government time deposits. \u2047 Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 87% as of the end of the year. \u2047 Our efforts in business development and targeted deposit gathering strategies have yield successful results in deposit growth. \u2047 We are continuing to ramp up these efforts in 2020, supported by further strengthening of our teams and technology platforms. \u2047 Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $14.2 million or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.6 million or $0.51 per diluted share reported last quarter. \u2047 Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 0.95% and return on average equity was 10.70%. \u2047 For the full 2019 year, net income was $58.3 million or $2.03 per diluted share, compared to net income of $59.5 million or $2.01 per diluted share in the prior year. \u2047 Return on average assets for the 2019 year was 0.99% and return on average equity was 11.36%. \u2047 For the full-year 2019, pre-tax pre-provision net revenue totaled $84.2 million, which was a year-over-year increase of $7.1 million or 9.2%. \u2047 We are pleased we were able to post solid 2019 results, while investing for our future through our RISE2020 initiative. \u2047 Net interest income for the fourth quarter increased by $2.3 million to $47.9 million on a sequential quarter basis, and the net interest margin was 3.43%. \u2047 The fourth quarter included $1.1 million in non-recurring interest and dividend income, which positively impacted net interest income and net interest margin. \u2047 On a normalized basis, the fourth quarter net interest margin was 3.34%, which represented a 4 basis point sequential quarter increase. \u2047 The sequential quarter normalized net interest margin expansion was driven by increases in average loan balances and decreases in interest-bearing deposit and borrowing costs. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of $2.1 million, compared to a provision of $1.5 million recorded in the prior quarter. \u2047 Net charge-offs in the fourth quarter totaled $2.3 million, compared to net charge-offs of $1.6 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 The charge-offs primarily came from the Hawaii consumer loan portfolio. \u2047 At December 31, our allowance for loan and lease losses was $48.0 million or 1.08% of outstanding loans and leases. \u2047 Fourth quarter other operating income totaled $9.8 million, compared to $10.3 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 The decrease was primarily due to lower mortgage banking income. \u2047 Other operating expense for the fourth quarter was $36.2 million, compared to $34.9 million in the prior quarter. \u2047 The sequential quarter increase was driven by higher salaries and employee benefits, and higher computer software expense. \u2047 These increases relate to our RISE2020 initiative and also include accruals for incentive compensation. \u2047 The efficiency ratio was 62.81% in the fourth quarter, compared to 62.48% in the prior quarter. \u2047 The effective tax rate increased to 26.7% due to return to provision adjustments. \u2047 Going forward, we expect that effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 26% range. \u2047 Overall, we are pleased with another solid quarter and the continued positive momentum as we finished up the 2019 year. \u2047 Our team is working hard to deliver on our RISE2020 commitments, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you over the coming quarters. \u2047 At this time we will be happy to address any questions you may have. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["central pacific financial q4 earnings per share $0.50.  \u2047  q4 earnings per share $0.50.  \u2047  central pacific
