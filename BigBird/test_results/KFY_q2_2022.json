{"article": ["We want to send out our very best wishes that you and your families are well. \u2047 We've worked hard to prepare our materials and remarks for today to share with you the strength of our businesses and provide insight into what we believe, well, to be some of the most significant opportunities and challenges we'll face in the coming months. \u2047 Please let us know if we can do anything to provide more timely and important information. \u2047 With me, today and offering prepared comments are from TDS, Pete Sereda, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; from U.S. Cellular, LT Therivel, President and Chief Executive Officer; Ken Meyers, Senior Advisor to the CEO; Doug Chambers, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Mike Irizarry, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. \u2047 From TDS Telecom, Vicki Villacrez, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 We provide guidance for both adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization or OIBDA and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA to highlight the contributions of U.S. Cellular's wireless partnerships. \u2047 We have updated our safe harbor statements to include specific risks related to COVID-19 and its impacts on our businesses and provided that here specifically on Slide 3. \u2047 In terms of our upcoming IR schedule, Slide 4, we will be virtually attending the Morgan Stanley's Corporate Access Day on August 13th and then doing a Virtual Morgan Stanley Non-Deal Roadshow on August 20th, which will include a fireside chat and our open-door policy is now more of a open phone or a open video policy, so please reach out to us and we can arrange them. \u2047 Before turning the call over, I'd like to remind everyone that due to the FCC's Anti-Collusion Rule, we will not be responding to any questions related to the FCC auctions and spectrum strategy. \u2047 I'm going to make some brief comments about the balance sheet and actions we've taken during the COVID-19 crisis to protect ourselves, financially. \u2047 But before doing so, I'd like to highlight the strong operational and financial results of both business units during the quarter. \u2047 The pandemic has highlighted the criticality of our products to our customers and the teams have stepped up and continued to deliver on their typically outstanding service levels. \u2047 Now to the balance sheet. \u2047 As we've talked about before, maintaining financial flexibility is one of the pillars of our corporate strategy. \u2047 Over the years, we have worked to retain relatively low leverage levels, long-dated debt maturities, sufficient undrawn revolving credit facilities and significant cash balances, while at the same time making sure we have the financial resources we need to fund our businesses. \u2047 As you can see on Slide 5, at June 30th, TDS had $1.7 billion in available funding sources, including cash and cash equivalents, available credit facilities, undrawn term loans and the undrawn portions of our EIP securitization. \u2047 We took a number of steps earlier this year to solidify our overall liquidity and feel confident we are in a stable and sound position for the rest of the year. \u2047 We also repurchased a little over 500,000 TDS common shares at favorable prices during the quarter, balancing the need to retain liquidity with a pricing opportunity offered by the market. \u2047 As this is our practice, we will look to take advantage of favorable market conditions to augment our balance sheet going forward. \u2047 We believe we have additional access to the debt capital markets both retail and institutional as well as other conventional debt sources. \u2047 If it were necessary, we believe, we would also have a number of potential additional funding sources, including some related to our own towers and wireless partnerships, although we would view such financings less favorable -- less favorably than straight debt for costs and operational reasons. \u2047 Finally, as you can see from the chart on the right side of the page, most of our existing debt is very long-dated with essentially no near-term maturities pressuring our liquidity position. \u2047 I'd be lying if I told you this wasn't a bittersweet moment for me. \u2047 I'm so proud to have worked for TDS and U.S. Cellular for over 30 years, by my count -- actually, by Jane's count. \u2047 I've been involved in reporting for some 136 quarters, with many of you on the receiving end of some those, maybe even many of those or maybe just feeling that way. \u2047 And I want you to know that I'm confident that I am leaving the organization in great hands. \u2047 U.S. Cellular has an exceptionally talented management team and the most customer-focused associates in the industry. \u2047 And now, has a new leader with the skills and experience to move the company forward. \u2047 I'm humbled to have worked with you and which -- and wish each of you much success going forward. \u2047 LT, it's all yours. \u2047 Given that I started this job just on July 1st, I'm going to share some of my initial impressions, but for the most part, I'm going to be in listen mode today. \u2047 Doug Chambers is going to -- are going to -- is going to walk you through our results for the quarter. \u2047 And this has been a challenging few months for everyone but I have to say, I'm proud to be part of this industry and I'm particularly proud to be part of this company. \u2047 The pandemic has validated that what we do is truly essential, connecting family, friends and commerce and this is a particularly exciting time to be in wireless, especially as we embark on 5G. \u2047 As you know, we've already launched some initial markets on 5G and we're going to provide some more details on that later in the call. \u2047 My first month at U.S. Cellular has been full of learning and listening and I feel it's been a seamless and effective transition. \u2047 Over the past few weeks, I traveled to several of our various locations, met with many of our associates, of course, in the safest manner possible and I'm consistently inspired by our customer-centric culture and the high levels of engagement that we have across the entire company. \u2047 The flexibility and resiliency that our associates have displayed throughout this pandemic are tremendous and it's clear to me that our focus on the customer and our high quality network are critical to growing this business. \u2047 And speaking of network, I'm pleased to report that our network strength was recently recognized as we won another J.D. Power Award. \u2047 This recognition validates for me that our network modernization strategy is working. \u2047 I want to talk for just a minute about why I joined this company. \u2047 It's a strong company, tremendous corporate culture, it is also a company with incredibly valuable assets, spectrum, towers, distribution, and our assets have both significant financial value and operational importance. \u2047 And my goal is to build on that strong culture and that strong assets in order to drive strong growth. \u2047 Let me be very clear, I was hired to lead U.S. Cellular into the future to grow this business. \u2047 I'm going to be very focused on building value for all of our constituents. \u2047 Over the coming months, my leadership team and I are going to be developing a strategy aimed at doing what is best for U.S. Cellular to continue to be a formidable competitor over the long-term. \u2047 Let me touch briefly on the quarter. \u2047 Many aspects of our second quarter performance were impacted by the pandemic, yet we were able to generate very solid results. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of what the team has accomplished and the results are really a testament to Ken and his leadership. \u2047 Doug is going to take you through the details in a moment. \u2047 And looking forward to the rest of the year, we're going to build off these strengths, we'll also intensifying our focus on community specific campaigns and delivering the products and services and solutions that our customers want. \u2047 I'm looking forward to reporting on our progress throughout the back half of 2020 and getting to know all of you, our investors and our analysts. \u2047 Network quality is foundational to U.S. Cellular. \u2047 Our goal is to ensure our customers have a great experience, whenever and wherever they use their devices. \u2047 As most of you know, Iowa and Wisconsin were phase one of our multi-year 5G network expansion. \u2047 And last week, we announced our next phase. \u2047 Phase two will begin in the second half of 2020 and we will deploy in 11 states or about 10 million PoPs. \u2047 We are working with three equipment vendors and we are continuing to expand the number of 5G devices. \u2047 We've been very pleased with the performance of phase one. \u2047 Customers are receiving an improved customer experience, our 5G deployment improves average and peak speeds for our 5G and our 4G customers. \u2047 In addition to improved customer experience and new revenue opportunities, we expect 5G to carry traffic more efficiently, improving the cost to deliver a bit. \u2047 And this efficiency enables us to get the most out of our spectrum portfolio. \u2047 We expect to begin deploying our Millimeter wave spectrum in 2021 to improve speed and capacity in denser areas of our footprint. \u2047 Further, we expect to conduct trials of our Millimeter wave fixed wireless service in 2021 in CLEC markets. \u2047 Turning to Slide 8. \u2047 First, let me briefly provide a COVID-19 update. \u2047 First, our entire organization has been incredibly resilient as we successfully managed through continuing uncertainty. \u2047 We have maintained our work-at-home program for those where it is feasible and while we are working on a return to office plan, we have not set a timetable for doing so. \u2047 On the retail front, our stores are opened and largely back to normal hours. \u2047 We continue to follow important safety steps to keep our frontline associates and customers safe. \u2047 As expected, the pandemic led to reduced store traffic levels in the quarter. \u2047 However, each metric has shown steady improvement off the post-pandemics lows. \u2047 Recently, store traffic has been running about 20% below prior year levels. \u2047 Finally, our supply chain remains fully functional and our inventory levels are good. \u2047 Turning to Slide 9. \u2047 Even with all this disruption, we are still executing on our strategic priorities. \u2047 As I will detail in a moment, subscriber results benefited from very low churn and strong connected device additions in the quarter. \u2047 Revenue growth in the quarter was impacted by reducing roaming -- reduced roaming revenue, which was partially due to decreased mobility of wireless users during the pandemic. \u2047 Also, as an additional way to help our customers, we removed caps on data usage and waived overcharges, which had a negative impact on ARPU in the quarter. \u2047 We signed the FCC's Keep Americans Connected Pledge, where we committed to not disconnect customers who are experiencing COVID-19 related challenges for non-payment through June 30th. \u2047 We had about 56,000 subscribers sign up for the pledge with 39,000 remaining at June 30th. \u2047 This [Technical Issues] amount of paid subscribers is less than we anticipated at March 31st and resulted from proactively working with pledge customers to administer collections and enroll them in payment arrangements. \u2047 As a result, we decreased our estimate of bad debts expense related to the pledge in the second quarter. \u2047 Overall, despite some negative impacts to revenue and expenses as a result of the pandemic, we continue to control cash expenses, which decreased 3% year-over-year. \u2047 From a network standpoint, we engineer our network for peak usage periods and the network continues to perform well. \u2047 To-date, COVID-19 has increased data traffic about 20%-25% and our network has been able to handle that extra demand. \u2047 Throughout the quarter, we continued our network modernization and 5G efforts and we will be finishing our VoLTE deployment this year. \u2047 Our expansion markets in Iowa and Northern Wisconsin are doing well. \u2047 And as LT highlighted, we won another J.D. Power Award. \u2047 Let me touch briefly on postpaid connections results during the second quarter shown on Slide 10. \u2047 Postpaid handset gross additions decreased primarily due to mobile switching activity and decreased store traffic due to the impacts of COVID-19. \u2047 Partially offsetting this was an increase in demand for connected devices. \u2047 Total smartphone connections increased by 11,000 during the quarter and by 64,000 over the course of the past 12 months that helps to drive more service revenue given that smartphone ARPU is about $21 higher than feature phone ARPU. \u2047 As mentioned, we saw connected device gross additions increased by 9,000 year-over-year. \u2047 This was driven by gross additions of Internet products such as hotspots and routers as a result of an increase in demand by customers seeking wireless products to meet their need for remote connectivity due to the impacts of COVID-19. \u2047 During Q2, we saw an average decline in store traffic of around 35% with the larger drop in traffic at the beginning of the quarter and the end of the quarter. \u2047 Decrease in store traffic had a negative impact on gross additions and accessory margin although connected device activity remained stronger than the prior year. \u2047 Next, I want to comment on postpaid churn rate shown on Slide 11. \u2047 Currently, as you would expect, churn on both handsets and connected devices is running at very low levels. \u2047 Postpaid handset churn depicted by the blue bars was 0.71%, down from 0.97% a year ago. \u2047 This was due to mobile switching activity, resulting in a decrease in defections as customers' shopping behaviors were altered due to the overall COVID-19 crisis as well as reduction in non-paid defections related to the FCC pledge. \u2047 Postpaid churn combining handsets and connected devices was 0.89% for the second quarter of 2020 also lower than a year ago. \u2047 Now let's turn to the financial results on Slide 12. \u2047 Total operating revenues for the second quarter were $973 million, flat year-over-year. \u2047 Retail service revenues decreased by $4 million to $658 million. \u2047 The decrease was due to a decline in the postpaid subscriber base, partially offset by higher average revenue per user, which I'll cover on the next slide. \u2047 Inbound roaming revenue was $41 million that was a decrease of $3 million year-over-year driven by lower rates, partially offset by higher data volume. \u2047 Other service revenues were $54 million, that was an increase of $3 million year-over-year attributable to a 16% increase in tower rental revenues. \u2047 Finally, equipment sales revenues increased by $4 million or 2% year-over-year due to the increase in devices sold, partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price and a decrease in accessory sales. \u2047 Now a few more comments about postpaid revenue shown on Slide 13. \u2047 Average revenue per user or connection was $46"], "gold_summary": ["q2 revenue $973 million versus refinitiv ibes estimate of $900.7 million.  \u2047  qtrly postpaid retail arpu $46.24."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q2 operating earnings per share $0.89.  \u2047  q2 operating earnings per share $0.89.  \u2047  q2 operating earnings per share $0.89.  \u2047  q2 operating earnings per share $0.89."]}
