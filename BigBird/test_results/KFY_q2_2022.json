{"article": ["I'm pleased to report that Korn Ferry once again achieved all-time financial performance highs. \u2047 Revenue was up 47% and our diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.38 and $1.53, respectively. \u2047 And our adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.1%. \u2047 I think our performance over recent quarters has reached a new level of scale and it speaks to the resiliency and agility of our colleagues, as well as our operational excellence, amid a time of enormous transition and secular change. \u2047 And this aligns with our businesses. \u2047 Today, wherever and whenever strategy meets talent, Korn Ferry is at that cross section, enabling agility in a world that will undoubtedly be in transition for the next several years. \u2047 Our strategy in the New Year will be to continue to innovate, replicate, and scale, allowing people and organizations to exceed their potential in this rapidly changing world. \u2047 Elements of our strategy will include driving a top-down go-to-market strategy, through our Marquee and Regional Accounts, which represent about 36% of our portfolio and that not only facilitates growth and enduring partnerships, but is also key to more scalable and durable revenues. \u2047 For example, in the quarter, about 30% of our revenue was driven by cross referrals within our firm, demonstrating the effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy. \u2047 Although our search businesses, both Pro Search and Executive Search combined represent about 45% of our revenue, we believe there is still substantial market opportunity ahead, given the acceleration of an increasingly nomadic labor market. \u2047 It's one of the reasons we acquired the Lucas Group during the quarter, a move that adds breadth and depth to Korn Ferry's search portfolio. \u2047 Looking at our digital and consulting businesses, we will continue to innovate, marrying Korn Ferry's capabilities with tomorrow's opportunities. \u2047 From ESG to DE&I to M&A services and we're also going to further push the monetization of our IP and move more of our digital business to a subscription offering. \u2047 We're going to also scale our learning development outsourcing or LDO capabilities, leveraging our Korn Ferry Advance platform, in which we now have completed 50,000 development and coaching sessions. \u2047 And lastly, we're going to deploy a balanced capital allocation strategy, including a disciplined approach to M&A. \u2047 Looking ahead, I truly feel we have the strategy, the people, the diversity of solutions and expertise to help our clients drive performance in this new world and our results clearly reflect this reality. \u2047 We look forward to keeping up the momentum in the New Year ahead. \u2047 And with that, I am joined by Bob Rozek and Gregg Kvochak. \u2047 Let me start with a few comments before I jump into the second quarter results. \u2047 So, I've always felt that the best way to measure success is through performance and if you look at our performance coming out of the COVID recession, it's really been and continued to be exceptional and that's reflected in our Q2 results. \u2047 There's no doubt that the world we live in has changed for good. \u2047 Today, more than ever, our clients are facing unprecedented organizational and human capital challenges as workforces are transformed and digitized, as corporations are called upon to have greater environmental, social and governance responsibilities, as organization strive to have work environments that are inclusive and free from bias, so even as companies are challenged to grow in a post-COVID environment. \u2047 These are real secular changes, creating real and challenging business issues for companies across the globe and it's a fact that no business issue has ever been solved without the involvement of people and that's really where Korn Ferry comes in. \u2047 I mean that's our sweet spot, right. \u2047 Our core and integrated solutions line up perfectly with the secular changes that companies across the globe are wrestling with today, whether it's finding the right talent in a dislocated labor market to accelerating the top line growth or to even keeping employees engaged, motivated, appropriately rewarded and retained in this new and evolving work and social environment. \u2047 As these forces continue to shape the workplace, our clients, in growing numbers, continue to recognize the role that our people and our solutions play in helping them solve their most pressing business issues through their most precious asset, their people. \u2047 I would also say that this is not our 15 minutes of fame. \u2047 I mean these secular changes that we're all feeling are real and they are here to stay. \u2047 In my view, I think, I really believe that we're in the first inning of a long ball game. \u2047 Now just as market demand has been strong, our execution has been stronger, driving our fee revenue, earnings and profitability to new all-time highs. \u2047 Now I'm going to turn to Q2 results. \u2047 So as Gary mentioned, fee revenue in the second quarter grew $204 million or 47% year-over-year and $54 million or 9% sequentially, reaching an all-time high of $639 million. \u2047 Fee revenue growth in the quarter for our consolidated Executive Search business was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially while our RPO and Professional Search business was up 76% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. \u2047 Growth for our Consulting and Digital businesses was also very strong. \u2047 Consulting grew 30% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, while Digital was up 18% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. \u2047 Turning to earnings and profitability, they also grew to new highs in the quarter. \u2047 Our adjusted EBITDA grew $69 million year-over-year and $13.5 million or 11% sequentially to $135 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.1%, both are new quarterly highs. \u2047 Our earnings and profitability continue to benefit from both higher consultant and execution staff productivity and lower G&A spend. \u2047 Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share also advanced to a new high in the quarter, improving to a $1.53, which was up $0.99 compared to adjusted fully diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of fiscal '21 and actually up $0.16 or 12% sequentially. \u2047 When you compare our business today through the first six months to the same period in fiscal year '20 and that's the pre-pandemic period just two years ago, both our scale and our profitability are up dramatically. \u2047 Our firm's fee revenue for the fiscal year '22 Q2 year-to-date period is up 25% with double-digit growth in every line of business. \u2047 Our adjusted EBITDA over the same comparison period is up 67%, that's nearly 3 times greater than fee revenue growth and our adjusted EBITDA margin is up 530 basis points to nearly 21%. \u2047 Our earnings power has never been higher. \u2047 As I look at new business, that also accelerated in the quarter, reaching new highs for each of our lines of business. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, new business awards, excluding RPO, were up 40% year-over-year and up approximately 8% sequentially. \u2047 RPO new business was also extremely strong with a record $136 million of total contract awards. \u2047 This consolidated record level of new business across the -- all of our business lines in the second quarter really provides us with a very solid backlog, entering the fiscal third quarter. \u2047 Our investable cash position also remained strong. \u2047 At October 31, the end of the second quarter, cash and marketable securities totaled $997 million. \u2047 Now, when you exclude amounts reserved for deferred compensation arrangements and accrued bonuses, our global investable cash balance at the end of the second quarter was approximately $591 million and that's up about $133 million or 29% year-over-year. \u2047 It should be noted that this investable cash position includes approximately $90 million that was used to acquire the Lucas Group on November 1. \u2047 We continue to take our balanced approach to allocation of capital. \u2047 In addition to the Lucas Group and investing in the hiring of additional fee earners and execution staff, year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately $14 million of our stock and have paid cash dividends of approximately $14 million as well. \u2047 With that -- excuse me. \u2047 I'm going to start with KF Digital. \u2047 Global fee revenue for KF Digital was $88.6 million in the second quarter, which was up 18% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. \u2047 The subscription and licensing component of KF Digital fee revenue grew to $26 million in the second quarter, which was up 16% year-over-year and up 7% sequentially. \u2047 Additionally, global new business for KF Digital in the second quarter grew 29% year-over-year to a new high of $114 million with $44 million or 39% related to subscription and license services. \u2047 Earnings and profitability also continued to grow for KF Digital in the second quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $28.6 million and a 32.2% adjusted EBITDA margin. \u2047 Now turning to Consulting. \u2047 In the second quarter, Consulting generated $164.9 million of fee revenue, which was up approximately $38 million or 30% year-over-year and $16 million or 11% sequentially. \u2047 Fee revenue growth continued to be broad-based across all solution areas and strongest regionally in North America, which was up over 43% year-over-year. \u2047 Consulting new business also reached a record high in the second quarter, growing approximately 17% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. \u2047 Regionally, new business growth was also broad-based in the second quarter with continued strength in North America and improving trends in EMEA and APAC. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for Consulting in the second quarter improved to $30.1 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.2%. \u2047 Growth for RPO and Professional Search continued to improve in the second quarter. \u2047 Globally, fee revenues grew $150.4 million, which was up 76% year-over-year and up approximately $11 million or 8% sequentially. \u2047 Both RPO and Professional Search continued to take advantage of post-recession dislocation in the labor market for skilled professionals. \u2047 RPO fee revenue grew approximately 69% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, while Professional Search fee revenue was up approximately 88% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. \u2047 Sequentially, both the number of new search assignments and the average fee per assignment were up double digits for Professional Search. \u2047 New business wins for both RPO and Professional Search were also extremely strong in the second quarter, reaching new all-time highs. \u2047 Professional Search new business was up 13% sequentially and RPO was awarded a record $136 million of new contracts, consisting of $28 million of renewals and extensions and $108 million of new logo work. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA for RPO and Professional Search continued to scale with revenue improving to $36.3 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.1%. \u2047 Finally, in the second quarter, global fee revenue for Executive Search reached another new all-time high of $235 million, which was up 59% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. \u2047 Growth was also broad-based and led by North America, which grew 74% year-over-year and over 14% sequentially. \u2047 Fee revenue in our international regions remained steady in the second quarter. \u2047 EMEA and APAC were up approximately 34% and 36%, respectively, measured year-over-year, and essentially flat sequentially. \u2047 We continue to invest in expanding our team of consultants in the second quarter. \u2047 The total number of dedicated Executive Search consultants worldwide at the end of the second quarter was 570, up 58% year-over-year and up 5%, sequentially. \u2047 Annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the second quarter improved to a record $1.66 million and the number of new search assignments opened worldwide in the second quarter was up 37% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to a new all-time high of 1,830. \u2047 In the second quarter, global Executive Search adjusted EBITDA grew to approximately $66 million, which was up $38 million year-over-year and up $4.5 million or 7% sequentially. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter was 28.1%. \u2047 As I mentioned earlier, new business in the second quarter grew to a new all-time high and it actually accelerated each consecutive month in the quarter and that positions us with a very strong backlog entering our third fiscal quarter. \u2047 In fact, as we ended the quarter, October and September were our first and second highest new business months ever. \u2047 While our third quarter is usually our most seasonal quarter as both our clients and colleagues take time off during the year and holiday seasons. \u2047 However, November was also an excellent month for new business, actually eclipsing September as the second highest month ever, and that was up 37% year-over-year. \u2047 Now if monthly trends in each of our lines of business are consistent with our historical patterns and the market conditions remain strong, we would expect December to be seasonally slower than November with demand accelerating and peaking at a quarter high in January. \u2047 Additionally, we will continue to make investments in consultants and execution staff to fuel future growth, and we expect employee productivity to remain strong and G&A spend to remain at current levels in the third quarter, keeping both earnings and profitability strong. \u2047 Now assuming no new major pandemic-related lockdowns or changes in worldwide economic conditions, financial markets, and foreign exchange rates, and including fee from the Lucas Group, we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to range from $640 million to $660 million and our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to range from $1.42 to $1.58 while our GAAP diluted earnings per share should range from $1.38 to $1.56. \u2047 As we look ahead to the New Year, we see a great opportunity to continue to build on our strong financial performance. \u2047 Based on the strength or I should say the continuing strength of our new business trends, it is evident to us that our portfolio of solutions will have a continuing relevance as companies address the secular changes I previously discussed. \u2047 We will continue to execute at a high level and there is little doubt that we are well positioned to take more than our fair share of the growing market. \u2047 Korn Ferry has never been better positioned to serve all of its constituencies; colleagues, clients, candidates and shareholders for years to come. \u2047 With that, we would be glad to answer any questions you may have."], "gold_summary": ["q2 earnings per share $1.38.  \u2047  fee revenue of $639.4 million in q2 fy'22, an increase of 47%.
