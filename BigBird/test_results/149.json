{"article": ["On the call today are CEO, Mick Farrell; and CFO, Brett Sandercock. \u2047 Other members of management will join us during the Q&A section. \u2047 During today's call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures. \u2047 We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions. \u2047 However, actual results may differ. \u2047 More details and information, including an agenda and how to register, will be available on our investor relations website approximately two weeks before the event. \u2047 OK, Mick, over to you. \u2047 I will discuss execution highlights against our top three strategic priorities and our urgent and ongoing actions to address current industry supply chain issues and opportunities. \u2047 I'll then hand the call over to Brett for further detail on our financial results. \u2047 Let me start with the situation that has generated many stakeholder questions in the last month and a half. \u2047 During the quarter, demand for ResMed's sleep and respiratory care devices surged dramatically after a competitor's recall announcement, putting additional pressure on an already challenging environment for our industry's supply chain. \u2047 Global supply chain limitations, including a shortage of electronic components, as well as ongoing freight constraints and costs are impacting our ability to respond to the unprecedented increase in demand for ResMed products. \u2047 Executive teams across automotive, consumer products and communications technology industries have confirmed on their recent earnings calls that they are struggling with the same issues. \u2047 Some major producers have suggested the chip and electronic component shortages could extend 12 or even 18 months. \u2047 We are working incredibly closely with our global supply chain partners to ensure access to additional supply of the critical components that we need to further increase production of our medical devices. \u2047 During this June quarter, the demand spike was so high that we have been forced to allocate products due to the unprecedented demand and these real-world supply chain capacity constraints. \u2047 In doing so, our guiding principles are very simple. \u2047 We are focused on the highest acuity patient needs first. \u2047 It's very similar to our approach to ventilator allocation during the peaks of the COVID crisis these last 18 months. \u2047 We will continue to coordinate with all of our stakeholders as the situation develops and we begin to open up these supply constraints. \u2047 We understand this is a frustrating situation for all of our customer groups, including physicians, home medical equipment providers, payers and most importantly, the ultimate customer, the patient. \u2047 It is a unique time in our industry with steady recovery of patient flow after COVID-19 peaks in various countries with these global supply chain constraints and with an unforeseen competitor recall all occurring simultaneously. \u2047 I wanna be clear that, through it all, our priority will always be patience, doing our best to help those who need treatment for sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory diseases. \u2047 Our goal is to ensure that patients get the therapy that they need and when they need it. \u2047 Let me be very clear about a couple of things. \u2047 One, ResMed's sleep apnea and respiratory care devices are safe to use. \u2047 They are the best in the market. \u2047 They are the smallest, the quietest, the most comfortable and the most connected therapies. \u2047 And positive airway pressure therapy remains the gold standard for the treatment of sleep apnea. \u2047 And two, ResMed will not be able to fill the entire supply gap that has been created by this situation caused by a competitor just seven weeks ago. \u2047 They were the No. \u2047 2 player to our No. \u2047 1 leading market position in almost all of the 140 countries that we compete in worldwide. \u2047 We are doing everything that we can to partner further and further up our supply chain in order to increase our access to the supply of the parts, the pieces and the components that we need to manufacture at scale. \u2047 We expect to be in a somewhat supply chain-constrained environment throughout fiscal-year 2022. \u2047 This news from our competitor was only released to the market on June 14, so we are in the first 7.5 weeks of our response. \u2047 However, we have already partnered with our global supply chain team, both internal and external. \u2047 And although we expect the current quarter and the December 2021 quarter will be the most supply constrained, we do see room for expansion of supply ahead. \u2047 We expect that the flow of ResMed products will accelerate significantly during the March 2022 and the June 2022 quarters. \u2047 We are focused on partnering with physicians, providers and distributors to ensure that our devices get to newly diagnosed patients. \u2047 And while that human impact is the most important, I know our investors and our analysts need to model the future financial impact of this accelerated growth on our ResMed financials. \u2047 Based upon our latest supply chain information and analysis, we see a path to $300 million to $350 million in additional revenue in fiscal 2022, over and above our previously planned revenue growth for fiscal 2022. \u2047 Importantly, we see a clear opportunity to increase our long-term sustainable market share as patients, physicians and providers experience our ResMed market-leading device and integrated cloud-based software solutions. \u2047 Our experience over the last seven-plus years since we launched our online platform called Air Solutions at scale is that when providers adopt and embrace our suite of digital health solutions, they can lower their own labor costs by over 50%. \u2047 They can drive their own patient adherence rates up to over 87% and beyond. \u2047 After doing that, they don't want to go back to an inferior solution. \u2047 And yes, during the near distant future, we will be starting the full product launch of our brand-new next-generation platform called AirSense 11. \u2047 Let me now turn to overall market conditions in our industry. \u2047 As we discussed last quarter, the countries we operate in are at various stages of the post-COVID peak recovery process in terms of sleep apnea and COPD patient flow. \u2047 We are seeing continued improvement in patient flow country by country. \u2047 But there is a wide variance in that total patient flow from 75% of pre-COVID levels in some countries around the world to 95% or even 100% of pre-COVID levels in other countries. \u2047 Vaccines are steadily rolling out country by country, and at the same time, new variants, including the Delta variant, continue to cause disruption in some geographies. \u2047 Our team remains committed to working with hospitals and healthcare providers to provide the ventilators, masks and training that they need for acute care. \u2047 We will continue to support frontline respiratory therapists and physicians, as well as providers, patients and our ResMedian team throughout the 140-plus countries that we operate in. \u2047 A few things that have become really clear during this pandemic is that every country in the world has: one, increased its adoption of digital health solutions; two, increased its focus on respiratory hygiene and respiratory health; and three, increased its investments in healthcare treatment outside the hospital and particularly in the home. \u2047 These are all catalysts for ResMed's long-term growth. \u2047 We are pleased with the steady progress that we are seeing in diagnosing new sleep apnea, COPD and asthma patients. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, our sales team delivered very strong revenue growth across our core sleep apnea and respiratory care business. \u2047 This incredible double-digit growth was despite the headwind from lapping $125 million of incremental COVID-related ventilator sales in the June 2020 quarter and with some tailwinds from our competitors' recall right at the end of the quarter. \u2047 While I am proud of the team for this 10% constant currency revenue growth in the quarter, I'm also very proud of their achievement over the fiscal year, with over 6% growth in revenue throughout fiscal-year 2021 to over $3.2 billion in total annual revenue and with leverage producing over 12% growth in our non-GAAP operating profit, and all the while, fighting for recovery of patient flow and battling COVID-19 impacts. \u2047 Quite a performance from our team of 8,000 ResMedians, helping people in 140 countries. \u2047 We expect to see steady improvement in patient flow for sleep apnea and respiratory care therapy as we move throughout our fiscal-year 2022. \u2047 We are encouraged to see patients, physicians and providers adopting digital health tools for remote patient screening, for home-based testing, for patient monitoring and for ongoing population health management. \u2047 As the leader in digital health for the treatment of sleep apnea, COPD and asthma, as well as other chronic respiratory conditions, we are well-positioned to drive this growth with our healthcare delivery partners. \u2047 During the quarter, we generated over $227 million of operating cash flow, allowing us to return $57 million in cash dividends to shareholders these last 90 days. \u2047 Today, we announced an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend for shareholders to $0.42 per share. \u2047 We are pleased to return your cash to you, our shareholders, reflecting our confidence in ResMed's resilient business and our ongoing cash flow. \u2047 We also increased our R&D investments in digital health technology during the quarter, as well as our research and development for masks, for devices, for embedded device software and for global clinical research, all the while maintaining fiscal discipline with SG&A and keeping other operating costs in line. \u2047 We are reinvesting for long-term growth. \u2047 We lead the field of remote patient engagement and population health management with over 15 million cloud-connectable medical devices in the market. \u2047 Our increasing investments in digital health innovation will ensure that we provide superior value to patients, to physicians and to providers to be their partner of choice. \u2047 We don't take our leading market share position for granted. \u2047 We have to earn it every day with every product, every solution and every service and every customer interaction. \u2047 Customers vote with their wallets. \u2047 And right now, they are voting for us, and we plan to keep earning their support. \u2047 Our digital health technologies are a growth catalyst for our business. \u2047 We have an exciting pipeline of innovative solutions that will generate both medium- and long-term value with an industry-leading intellectual property portfolio, including over 8,200 patents and designs. \u2047 We now have over 9 billion nights of respiratory medical data in our cloud-based platform called Air Solutions. \u2047 We have over 16.5 million patients enrolled in our cloud-based AirView software solution for physicians. \u2047 And we recently upgraded our patient engagement tool called myAir. \u2047 This app is now cloud-native and serverless in the cloud. \u2047 This new myAir 2.0 release supports our next-generation platform called AirSense 11. \u2047 The AirSense 11 platform comes to the market with new capabilities, with improved data delivery, with scalable architecture and with support for full-cycle teams. \u2047 And what that all means is that we have the opportunity for accelerated innovation in our ecosystem. \u2047 We have over 110 million patients managed within our Software-as-a-Service network for out-of-hospital care. \u2047 These incredible data assets allow us to unlock value for all of our customer groups, for patients, for physicians, for providers, as well as for private and government payers and the communities that they serve. \u2047 Let me now update you on our top three strategic priorities. \u2047 These are: one, to grow and differentiate our core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; two, to design, develop and deliver world-leading medical devices, as well as digital health solutions that can be scaled globally; and three, to innovate and grow the world's best software solutions for care delivered outside the hospital and especially in the home. \u2047 Last quarter, we previewed our next-gen platform called AirSense 11. \u2047 Responding to the current industry situation, our market-leading research and development team accelerated the launch of the AirSense 11. \u2047 First, by expanding the controlled product launch to additional customers just this last month; and second, by moving to an earlier full product launch date. \u2047 We now expect to launch in the United States before the end of this current quarter and then, to other countries gradually over time. \u2047 This AirSense 11 device launch will be a device launch like no other in the history of ResMed. \u2047 Previously, we carefully timed new product platform launches to minimize the selling overlap of device platforms. \u2047 We are in a unique situation today. \u2047 Our market-leading AirSense 10 continues to be very strongly adopted, and we believe that it is better than any other device currently on the market. \u2047 In short, it makes sense to continue to sell the AirSense 10 at scale, particularly as this will help maximize the overall CPAP, APAP and bi-level volume available for our customers for sale given the unprecedented demand for new patients to receive ResMed devices in the market right now. \u2047 The bottom line is that we're gonna be selling both the AirSense 10 and the AirSense 11 in parallel for quite some time as we meet this extraordinary market demand over the coming fiscal year and as we continue to expand the availability of AirSense 11 to new markets and new geographies around the ResMed world. \u2047 We are very excited to bring the AirSense 11 to market. \u2047 And I am understating the results when I say that the response to our controlled product launch has been very positive. \u2047 AirSense 11 benefits patients and bed partners, and the device and software platform combination will also benefit physicians, providers, payers and overall healthcare systems. \u2047 As I said earlier, we make the smallest, the quietest and the smartest and the most comfortable devices on the market, but they are also the most connected and the most clever devices. \u2047 All AirSense 11 devices are 100% cloud-connectable with upgraded digital health technology to increase patient engagement and adherence, to improve clinical outcomes and to deliver proven cost reductions within our customers' own healthcare systems, engaging patients directly in their own digital therapy like never before in the industry. \u2047 Let me now turn to a discussion of our respiratory care business, focusing on our strategy to better serve the 380 million chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and the 330 million asthma patients worldwide. \u2047 Our goal is to reach these many hundreds of millions of potential patients with our respiratory care solutions, including noninvasive ventilation and life support ventilation, as well as newer therapeutic areas such as cloud-connected pharmaceutical drug delivery solutions and high flow therapy offerings. \u2047 We announced that our respiratory care business benefited this time last year in the June 2020 quarter as we sold incremental ventilation devices and mask solutions to meet the growing demand for COVID on an acute scale to the tune of $125 million in sales. \u2047 During the current June 2021 quarter, we had modest COVID-related ventilator sales. \u2047 They were not material to our overall results. \u2047 They were under $20 million in sales, just under. \u2047 As the Delta variant of this coronavirus surges in various markets and regions, we will still be there to support governments and healthcare systems and the patients that they serve in their acute need."], "gold_summary": ["q4 non-gaap earnings per share $1.35.  \u2047  q4 earnings per share $1.33.  \u2047  qtrly revenue increased by 14% to $876.1 million.  \u2047  quarterly
