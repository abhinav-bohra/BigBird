{"article": ["All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. \u2047 Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents; Greg Toczydlowskias of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. \u2047 They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. \u2047 Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 We're pleased to report strong top and bottom-line results for the quarter and the first nine months of the year, including very strong underlying underwriting profitability and healthy top line growth. \u2047 Core income year-to-date of $2.2 billion is about $800 million higher year-over-year, generating core return on equity of 11.6%. \u2047 Core income for the quarter was $655 million or $2.60 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 10.1% despite a high level of catastrophe losses. \u2047 Our cat losses were well below our market share and well above the prior-year quarter and the tenure average for the quarter. \u2047 Underlying underwriting income of $632 million pre-tax was 6% higher than in the prior-year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. \u2047 We're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses. \u2047 The underlying combined ratio improved by almost 4 points in Business Insurance and more than 5 points in Bond & Specialty Insurance. \u2047 As you'll hear in a few minutes from Michael, underlying results in Personal Insurance were impacted by auto frequency returning to pre-pandemic levels and elevated severity in both auto and property due to higher costs for labor, materials. \u2047 Our consolidated results demonstrate the value of having a diversified group of businesses. \u2047 Turning to investments, our high quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $645 million after-tax, reflecting reliable performance in our fixed income portfolio and very strong returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. \u2047 These results together with our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to grow adjusted book value per share by 10% over the past year after making important investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. \u2047 During the quarter, we returned $821 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $601 million of share repurchases. \u2047 Turning to the top line, net-written premiums grew 7% to a record $8.3 billion. \u2047 Each of our three segments again contributed meaningfully to the top line growth. \u2047 In Business Insurance, net-written premiums grew by 5% with renewal premium change of 9.9%, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year, a near all-time high. \u2047 Renewal premium change was driven by continued strong renewal rate change and higher exposure growth. \u2047 Importantly, at the same time, retention was also higher. \u2047 Our ability to continue to drive price change at historical highs while increasing retention reflects excellent marketplace execution and the stability of the pricing environment. \u2047 In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net-written premiums increased by 19%, driven by record renewal premium change of 13.6% in our Management Liability business and continued strong retention. \u2047 We're also pleased to report strong production in our Surety business. \u2047 In our Commercial businesses, written pricing continues to outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it earns in. \u2047 Given social and other inflation, the frequency and severity of weather-related loss activity and the low interest rate environment, we expect the pricing environment to remain strong. \u2047 In Personal Insurance, net-written premiums increased by 7%. \u2047 Policies in force in both auto and homeowners were at record levels, driven by continued strong retention and growth in new business. \u2047 Before I wrap up on results, I'd like to spend a minute discussing how our leading data and analytics and risk expertise contributed to our relatively favorable loss experience with Hurricane Ida. \u2047 As I shared in our first quarter earnings call, our share of the industry's property cat losses over the past five years have been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share, and while there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, it was no accident that we again outperformed in Hurricane Ida. \u2047 Our medium underwriting expertise supported by cutting edge data analytics are key to an effective assessment of risk and reward. \u2047 For us third-party models are starting point for our more advanced proprietary cat modeling. \u2047 At the portfolio level, the insights from our models warned us away from the coast where Ida made landfall, given the impediments to achieving an appropriate risk-adjusted return. \u2047 In the other states among Ida's path, we effectively managed risk selection, pricing and other terms and conditions, sophisticated data and analytics at the fingertips of our frontline underwriters. \u2047 These include robust flood risk scoring, location intelligence down to the parcel level, Hill dashboards and output from our risk control engineers. \u2047 Within Personal Insurance, we continue to see the benefits from our highly segmented Quantum Home 2.0 product, which has now rolled out in more than 40 states. \u2047 In the Northeast, extreme rainfall from Ida resulted in significant claim activity for the industry, including from water and drainage back up, which is a coverage we provide in our QH 2.0 product. \u2047 The model underneath the product leverages data and analytics to underwrite a price tag coverage on a very granular basis. \u2047 In addition to underwriting, data and analytics are increasingly informing our claims handling strategies. \u2047 For example, our AI-assisted claim damage detection model was a key part of our Ida claim response. \u2047 This model uses AI and high-resolution aerial imagery to detect the extent of damage to individual properties as soon as a day after an event. \u2047 Within two days of impact, we were collecting and analyzing aerial imagery of customer properties along Ida's path as it moved across 20 states. \u2047 This enabled us to remotely identify which of our customers properties had sustained exterior damage and effectively organize our claim response. \u2047 In some cases, we can use this technology to adjust and pay total losses before the customer has even been able to return to their home. \u2047 We also utilized other virtual capabilities in our Ida response, such as image share and live video capture, on a majority of claims with interior damage. \u2047 These leading edge capabilities, enhanced the claim experience for our customers by cutting significant time out of the claim process, expediting an accurate loss assessment and in many cases, eliminating the need for physical inspection. \u2047 Again, with Ida, we successfully closed 90% of all homeowners plans within 30 days. \u2047 All of this also results in a more efficient outcome for our shareholders. \u2047 As strategic as the data and analytics are, maybe even more important is the culture that brings it all together. \u2047 Our collaborative approach to developing a holistic, 360-degree view of risk, incorporating underwriting, claims, actuarial risk-control, legal and regulatory inputs is an important differentiating factor in effectively managing risk and reward. \u2047 That culture is decades in the making and very hard to replicate. \u2047 As I shared last quarter, Jeff is a 22-year veteran at Travelers most recently as a member of Tom Kunkel leadership team and head of our Management Liability business. \u2047 Jeff succeeded Tom, following his retirement last month. \u2047 We're fortunate to have Jeff in the role and you will hear from him in a few minutes. \u2047 To sum it up, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date. \u2047 Our significant and hard to replicate competitive advantages position us very well and continued to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. \u2047 Core income for the third quarter was $655 million compared to $798 million in the prior-year quarter. \u2047 For the quarter, core return on equity was 10.1% and on a year-to-date basis, core ROE was 11.6%. \u2047 The decline in core income was driven by prior-year reserve development and catastrophe losses. \u2047 Recall that last year's PYD benefited by approximately $400 million of subrogation recoveries from PG&E. \u2047 Those unfavorable year-over-year comparisons were partially offset by increased investment income and a higher level of underlying underwriting income. \u2047 Underlying underwriting income increased 6% to $632 million pre-tax, reflecting a higher level of earned premium in all three segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. \u2047 Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. \u2047 Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty results both reflected the benefit of our pricing efforts, as earned price continues to exceed loss trend. \u2047 We expected a higher underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance given that last year's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses related to the pandemic. \u2047 As Alan mentioned, the underlying combined ratio in PI was further impacted by higher severity in both the auto and homeowners products. \u2047 Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment results in a few minutes. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, the underlying loss ratio for the quarter improved slightly to 62% compared with last year's 62.2%. \u2047 The expense ratio of 29.4% was in line with the prior-year quarter and in line with our expectations. \u2047 We've improved the expense ratio by more than 2 points from where we were five years ago. \u2047 Having added roughly $7 billion to our annual net-written premiums over that period, while maintaining a focus on productivity and efficiency, all while adding significantly to the level of strategic investment we're making to ensure our future success. \u2047 Before turning to catastrophe losses, I wanted to point out that within our underlying combined ratio, non-cat weather was higher than we would have assumed for the quarter, although lower than the unusually high levels we experienced in last year's third quarter. \u2047 Our third quarter cat losses were $501 million pre-tax compared to $397 million a year ago. \u2047 Remember that in last year's third quarter, we had a full recovery under the property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty. \u2047 In this year's third quarter, we recognized a partial recovery of $95 million from the treaty, $83 million benefiting the cat line with $43 million in Business Insurance and $39 million in Personal Insurance and $12 million benefiting our underlying results with $3 million in Business Insurance and $9 million in Personal Insurance. \u2047 That leaves us with $255 million of potential recovery in the fourth quarter, depending on the level of qualifying losses we actually experienced. \u2047 In terms of the level of cat losses relative to our assumptions, third quarter cats were elevated compared to what we would have assumed for a typical third quarter. \u2047 Although our losses from Hurricane Ida are well below our relative market share, the sheer size of Ida on top of the other cat losses in the quarter resulted in overall cat losses that were higher than our assumption. \u2047 Turning to prior-year reserve development. \u2047 In Personal Insurance, $30 million of pre-tax net favorable PYD resulted from better-than-expected experience from recent years in the property line. \u2047 In Bond & Specialty Insurance, $22 million of pre-tax net favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experience in the surety product line for recent accident years. \u2047 In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD was $108 million pre-tax. \u2047 Our annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $225 million as the level of claim activity did not decline as much as we had assumed in our previous estimate. \u2047 Excluding asbestos charge, Business Insurance had net favorable prior-year reserve development of $117 million, driven primarily by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years. \u2047 Net investment income improved to $645 million after-tax this quarter. \u2047 Our non-fixed income portfolio delivered another strong results contributing $224 million after-tax. \u2047 Consistent with our expectations, fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior-year quarter as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields. \u2047 For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect NII from the fixed income portfolio, including earnings from short-term securities of between $425 million and $435 million after-tax. \u2047 For 2022, we expect that figure to be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter. \u2047 Turning to capital management. \u2047 Operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.5 billion was an all-time record. \u2047 All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. \u2047 The market value of the bonds in our fixed income portfolio declined as U.S. treasury yields increased and credit spreads widened during the quarter, and accordingly our after-tax net unrealized investment gain decreased from $3.2 billion as of June 30 to $2.7 billion at September 30. \u2047 Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $104.77 at quarter-end, up 5% since year-end and up 10% since September 30 last year. \u2047 We returned $821 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter with $220 million of dividends and $601 million in share repurchases. \u2047 Overall a very good quarter performance with healthy top line growth, strong and improved underlying margins in our commercial businesses, excellent cash flows and a terrifically strong balance sheet. \u2047 Business Insurance had another great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace. \u2047 Segment income was $558 million for the quarter, up more than 50% from the prior-year quarter. \u2047 The improved year-over-year result was driven by higher underlying underwriting income, prior-year reserve development and higher net investment income, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. \u2047 We're once again particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 90.2%, which improved by 3.8 points from the third quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to three things. \u2047 First, about 2 points of the improvement resulted from earned pricing that continued to exceed loss cost trends; the other nearly 2 points resulted from a combination of a favorable impact associated with the pandemic and a lower level of property losses. \u2047 Turning to the top line, net-written premiums were up 5%, benefiting from strong renewal rate and exposure levels as well as high retention. \u2047 As for domestic production, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.9%, while retention increased to an exceptional 85%. \u2047 The 9.9% renewal premium change was up more than 2 points from the third quarter of last year with strong renewal rate change"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 core earnings per share $2.60.  \u2047
