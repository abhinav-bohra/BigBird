{"article": ["Presenting today are Ray Scott, Lear President and CEO; and Jason Cardew, Senior Vice President and CFO. \u2047 Other members of Lear senior management team have also joined us on the call. \u2047 The agenda for today's call is on Slide 3. \u2047 First, Ray will review highlights from the quarter and provide a business update. \u2047 Jason will then review our third quarter financial results and our full-year 2021 outlook. \u2047 Finally, Ray will offer some concluding remarks. \u2047 Now I'd like to invite Ray to begin. \u2047 The third quarter was marked by the continuation of supply chain challenges the auto industry has been facing. \u2047 Our financial results were negatively impacted not only by significant volume reductions versus last year but also by low visibility from our customers leading to short notice production shutdowns. \u2047 Slide 6 highlights numerous achievements in the quarter, including innovation, quality, awards, and strategic investments in both business segments. \u2047 In the third quarter, Lear's sales growth outpaced the market by 9 percentage points with strong growth over market in both Seating and E-Systems, continued new business wins as well as products that are favorably aligned with the industry shift to electrification are expected to deliver continued growth above market over the next several years. \u2047 Last week, we announced the acquisition of substantially all of Kongsberg Automotive Interior Comfort Division, which will further strengthen our industry-leading Seating business. \u2047 On the E-System side, we announced agreements to form two separate joint ventures, which will further enhance our capabilities in electrification. \u2047 The joint venture with Hu Lane, which we expect will close later this year will further enhance our growing portfolio of connectors capabilities for both high voltage and low voltage applications. \u2047 This joint venture -- The joint venture with Shinry, when agreed on complementary portfolios of advanced onboard chargers from Lear and Shinry and increased access to a broad range of customers. \u2047 We also continue to be recognized across both of our business segments for excellence and innovation and quality. \u2047 We won our third consecutive Automotive News PACE award and two PACEpilot awards, more than any other supplier. \u2047 Lear has long been known as a leader in Seat quality and this year we won more than twice as many Seat Quality awards from J.D. Power as any other company. \u2047 We increased cash returns to shareholders in the quarter by doubling our dividend and buying back more stock. \u2047 In total, we returned $100 million to shareholders during the quarter. \u2047 We also increased our credit agreement to $2 billion and extended the maturity to 2026. \u2047 With respect to capital allocation, we continue to follow a balanced plan that includes organic investment, inorganic investment, and returning excess cash to our shareholders. \u2047 Turning to Slide 7, our seating business continues to grow faster than the market, reflecting our strong position in SUVs, CUVs in luxury vehicles. \u2047 In the third quarter seating growth over market was 8 percentage points, reflecting new business and the Ford Bronco and Bronco Sport, the Hyundai Tucson and strong performance on the luxury brands in Europe, the seating also benefited from strong demand from GM's full size SUVs. \u2047 During the quarter, we were awarded key programs with GM, BMW, Stellantis, Nio and Great Wall. \u2047 And there are additional programs we expect to be sourced prior to the year-end. \u2047 We also received a new development award for our award winning configure plus product. \u2047 This award is with the European OEM and is expected to launch in 2026. \u2047 Customer interest in our patent protected configure plus product remains very high. \u2047 We continue to move forward on key launches in the quarter, including a new plant in Canada to supply seats for GM's large pickup trucks, at the reopened Oshawa plant. \u2047 Other key ongoing launches are highlighted on this slide. \u2047 A few weeks ago, we broke ground on our new energy-efficient jet facility in Detroit to supply seats for GM battery electric truck programs. \u2047 I've already touched on the Innovation and Quality awards we received in Seating, but I want to spend a little bit more time explaining the PACEpilot award for thermal comfort. \u2047 This new product that was developed jointly with Gentherm integrates, intelligent climate control software into a complete seating system. \u2047 The algorithms and software controls were developed by Lear. \u2047 They use a combination of occupant temperature data, seat position and cabin temperature to optimize energy usage within the vehicle and keep passengers at an optimal temperature. \u2047 Kongsberg is a recognized automotive supplier specializing in luxury comfort seating solutions, with strong market positions in massage, lumbar, seat heat and ventilation systems, comfort features continue to be of increasing importance as automakers look to improve the driving experience through product differentiation in Increased efficiency and improved performance, especially in luxury SUV in electric vehicle segments. \u2047 The company has almost 50 years of experience in seating comfort solutions. \u2047 Technical centers and sales offices in three different continents, and an experienced and dedicated team with approximately $300 million of annual revenue. \u2047 Kongsberg has well-balanced customer portfolio built on long-standing relationships with leading premium automakers. \u2047 Kongsberg is a global leader in-seat massage and he has a number 3 position in lumbar and adjustable comfort. \u2047 The company is a technology leader with expertise in Pneumatic Comfort Systems and patented technology that enables superior performance, weight reduction in packaging flexibility In addition to performance benefits, there also much player, which is even more important in electric vehicles where noise will be much more noticeable. \u2047 Kongsberg also has a strong market position as the number 2 player Heat Mats and the number 4 player in Vent Systems for thermal comfort. \u2047 On Slide 9, I will highlight how Kongsberg will enhance our competitive advantage in Seating. \u2047 This acquisition is consistent with other acquisitions we have made over the past decade to enhance our vertical integration capabilities. \u2047 These moves have enhanced growth in margins and extend our market leadership in luxury and premium seating. \u2047 This acquisition extends our capabilities in Comfort Systems Solutions. \u2047 Further, solidifying our position is the most vertically integrated seating supplier while bringing additional price of a content to our offerings. \u2047 It strengthens our ability to serve EV, luxury, SUV customers and to provide them with the next level vertically integrated design solutions. \u2047 Integrating Kongsberg in Lear's operations solidifies our strategy to offer a complete suite of luxury comfort seating solutions to our OEM customers and ultimately to the consumer. \u2047 This combination will enable Lear to improve overall seat system performance by offering more efficient, lower weight, and flexible packaging design solutions. \u2047 The total addressable market for massage, lumbar heat, ventilation products is estimated at $2.5 billion to $3 billion. \u2047 IHS trend data indicates this market will grow about 2 percentage points faster than the vehicle production over the next five years. \u2047 Based on our assessments of industry, mega trends, we expect the market to grow even faster in that timeframe and beyond. \u2047 Customers are looking for features to improve the driving experience. \u2047 As cars become smarter, a higher emphasis is being placed on interior comfort. \u2047 We are already seeing this with luxury in EV customers. \u2047 And we anticipate this trend and focus on interior comfort to further increase when a autonomous cars come to market. \u2047 We also expect increased adoption of seating comfort products beyond the luxury segments into higher volume vehicle segments. \u2047 In addition, we believe that by creating a more efficient packaging solution, we will see more proliferation of seating comfort systems in the rear seats. \u2047 And perhaps the biggest opportunity which will unfold over a longer term will come with the acceleration in electrification, which requires more efficient, heating and cooling systems in the cabin. \u2047 Our expertise in software and algorithms combined with heating and cooling products from Kongsberg and our other partners will position us as one of the leaders in this area. \u2047 Slide 10 highlights Lear's leading performance in the latest J.D. Power US seat quality of sales section study. \u2047 For years, Lear has consistently been recognized is by the industry experts and our customers as a leader in seat quality. \u2047 In the latest J.D. Power seat quality survey, Lear was the only seat supplier to win two first-place awards. \u2047 We also won five additional awards and more than twice as many total awards as any other seat supplier. \u2047 Our leadership in luxury and SUVs was evident by the multiple awards in both categories. \u2047 The bread of our wins was notable as well, with awards for products with six different OEMs and in six of the seven different categories. \u2047 In the third quarter, new system sales grew 9 percentage points faster than the market, reflecting new business on the Ford Bronco Sport in the Mustang Mach-E in North America and strong performance in connection systems in Europe and with Geely and the Great Wall in China. \u2047 We have one -- over $1 billion in business awards so far this year. \u2047 Over 80%, which are new for Lear. \u2047 Based on awards to date, our 2022 to 2024 backlog is expected to be higher than our prior three-year backlog. \u2047 We will update and provide details on our backlog in our next earnings call. \u2047 With the momentum of new business wins, we expect our E-Systems business to continue to grow faster than market for the next several years. \u2047 Despite the industry slowdowns, we remain busy executing launches with Mercedes, Volvo, Jaguar among others. \u2047 We also are launching our initial programs with GM and Audi on our recent award-winning battery disconnect unit and our first to market 5G Telematics Control Unit. \u2047 Our Connection Systems Business is on track to grow to approximately $600 million next year. \u2047 Growing this part of our business is part of our strategy to increase the size and strength of our Electrical Distribution Systems business and increase our margins. \u2047 In addition to organic investments, we are entering into joint ventures and partnerships and making acquisitions to enhance our capabilities in connection systems. \u2047 We already are seeing benefits from our M&N acquisition, and our developing new high-speed connectors with IMS. And we are looking forward to closing the whole lane joint venture by the end of the year, which will increase our presence in connector catalogs. \u2047 We're also making progress in our plan to grow our connection systems business to $900 million to $1 billion by 2025. \u2047 We will continue to identify and pursue additional acquisitions or partnerships to accelerate this growth. \u2047 On the power electronics side joint venture announced yesterday was Shinry will expand our capabilities to improve manufacturing and design efficiencies for onboard chargers. \u2047 They are, one our third consecutive Automotive News PACE Award for the battery disconnect unit we designed for GM, this product controls all power switching in and out of the battery pack. \u2047 Our design incorporates breakthrough thermal management innovations, which improves the efficiencies of large and high performance electric vehicles. \u2047 We will be supplying this part on the GMC Hummer EV, the Chevrolet EV Silverado and other vehicles on GM battery electric truck programs. \u2047 We also are pursuing opportunities on strategic EV platforms with other customers. \u2047 We also won a PACEpilot Award

technologies. \u2047 Our design removes the Shark Fin external antenna required on many vehicles today, reducing complexity in improving styling capabilities in aerodynamics, which is particularly important for EV's were every element that increases range is critical. \u2047 We have received interest from numerous customers to commercialize this technology. \u2047 We also have been recognized by our customers for quality. \u2047 A few weeks ago, we received the World Excellence Award from Ford for our plant in particular Argentina and earlier this year, we received two Plant Quality Award from General Motors. \u2047 And now, I'd like to invite Jason to review our third quarter financial results and full-year outlook. \u2047 Slide 14 shows vehicle production and key exchange rates for the third quarter. \u2047 The impact of continuing component shortages led to a significant reduction in global industry production in the third quarter particularly in our two largest markets North America and Europe. \u2047 As a result, global vehicle production in the third quarter decreased by 19% compared to 2020 and on a Lear sales weighted basis global production declined by approximately 25%. \u2047 From a currency standpoint, the U.S. dollar continued to weaken against the Euro and RMB compared to 2020. \u2047 Slide 15 highlights Lear's growth over market in the third quarter. \u2047 Overall company growth over market was a strong 9 percentage points with E-Systems growing nine points and seating growing eight points above market respectively. \u2047 Growth over market in North America of 12 points reflected the benefit of new business in both segments and strong production on GM's full-size SUVs as well as Mercedes SUVs. \u2047 In Europe, growth over market of five points was driven primarily by new businesses while strong performance in the luxury segment and seating. \u2047 Increased business in connection systems in Europe also contributed to the growth over market performance. \u2047 In China growth over market of four points resulted from strong production on BMW programs and seating and new business with GLE and Great Wall and E-Systems. \u2047 Year-to-date Lear's sales have grown faster than the market by nine points that was above market growth in both segments. \u2047 Slide 16 highlights our financial results for the third quarter of 2021 compared to 2020. \u2047 Our sales declined 13% year-over-year to $4.3 billion. \u2047 Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, commodities, and acquisitions sales were down by 16% primarily reflecting lower production and Lear platforms partially offset by the addition of new business. \u2047 Semiconductor shortages in the quarter negatively impacted our revenue by approximately 24%. \u2047 Core operating earnings were $98 million compared to adjusted operating earnings of $327 million last year. \u2047 The reduction in earnings resulted from the impact of lower production volumes and higher commodity costs partially offset by positive operating performance in addition of new business. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share were $0.53 as compared to $3.73 a year ago. \u2047 Third quarter free cash flow was negative $157 million compared to $474 million in 2020. \u2047 Free cash flow was negatively impacted by lower earnings, higher capital expenditures, and an increase in working capital. \u2047 Working capital was higher in the quarter as volatility and customer production schedules resulted in elevated inventory levels. \u2047 Slide 17 explains the third quarter year-over-year variance in sales and adjusted operating margins in the seating segment. \u2047 Sales in the quarter were $3.2 billion, a decrease of $526 million or 14% from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and commodities sales were down 16% reflecting lower production partially offset by the benefit of new business. \u2047 In seating production downtime in the third quarter related to semiconductor shortages reduced our sales by approximately $1.1 billion or 25%. \u2047 Core operating earnings were $144 million, down $142 million from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Lower volume on their platforms and higher commodity costs partially offset by positive"], "gold_summary": ["q3 adjusted earnings per share $0.53.  \u2047  q3 sales fell
