{"article": ["These statements reflect the participants' expectations as of today, but the actual results could be different. \u2047 Participants also expect to refer to certain adjusted financial measures during the call. \u2047 Our company began fiscal '22 with positive momentum following an incredibly challenging year battling the pandemic. \u2047 In each successive quarter, our people worked with great tenacity and success to improve top and bottom-line results to close the gap pre-pandemic levels, drive the recovery, and return to profitable growth. \u2047 We entered the pandemic year from a position of strength following 11 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth in our footwear businesses. \u2047 Our overall performance in a difficult environment reflects the strong competitive positions of our retail and branded concepts, the strength of our Footwear Focus strategy, and our success capitalizing on opportunities to bolster these positions. \u2047 As a result, fiscal '22 is off to an incredibly strong start with the first quarter that meaningfully exceeded our expectations. \u2047 Our outperformance was driven by better-than-anticipated results at every division, led by record first-quarter revenue and profitability at Journeys. \u2047 Even as the pandemic continued to impact our businesses to varying degrees, the pace of our recovery accelerated each month and overall in Q1, reflecting stellar execution, combined with a temporary boost from U.S. government stimulus, and pent-up demand as the economy reopens faster than anticipated. \u2047 I'd like to begin today by outlining some of the key highlights from the quarter. \u2047 First, revenue and operating profit exceeded pre-pandemic levels, increasing 9% and 125%, respectively, over Q1 Fiscal '20 two years ago, even with our stores opened for a little less than 90% of the possible operating days in the quarter, given closures primarily in the U.K. and Canada. \u2047 Next, higher operating profit, combined with pre-pandemic share repurchases delivered outstanding Q1 earnings per share of $0.79, compared with a loss of $3.65 last year with positive earnings per share of $0.33 two years ago, all on an adjusted basis. \u2047 And finally, we achieved record first-quarter digital revenue and profit as we continue to capitalize on the accelerated shift to online spending. \u2047 We sustained last year's 64% growth and added another 43% on top of that. \u2047 Other highlights include hitting our highest store traffic numbers compared to pre-pandemic level as the vaccine rollout increased shoppers' confidence to return to physical stores, increasing the gross margin of almost 500 basis points compared to last year as our merchandise assortments and inventory management continued to fuel strong full-price selling, leveraging SG&A significantly compared to pre-pandemic levels, and achieving greater capital efficiencies by managing inventories and capital spending effectively leading to a healthy balance sheet and solid cash position. \u2047 We were pleased that every business in every channel contributed to the beat versus expectations with the stores delivering the biggest gain. \u2047 We've always known our customers enjoy our differentiated store experience and the exceptional service they receive in person, and that has been so exciting to see the strength of our brands draw enthusiastic shoppers back in as economies reopen. \u2047 It was, however, the combination of the store and e-commerce results that led to the strength in the quarter. \u2047 Our online business, from a strong foundation prior to COVID-19, generated double-digit operating margins due to our focus on full-price selling, disciplined marketing spend, and shipping-and-return policies to reinforce profitability. \u2047 To advance our digital capabilities at an even faster pace, we announced we promoted Parag Desai to the newly created position of chief strategy and digital officer. \u2047 In this new role, Parag will drive greater synergies and continue to integrate systems and digital best practices across our e-commerce portfolio, while also working with our divisions to deepen consumer insights and CRM capabilities. \u2047 Our digital investments have been generating strong results and we are confident Parag's appointment will accelerate progress, ensuring that we take advantage of the many omni-channel opportunities the pandemic presented. \u2047 Turning now to discuss each business in more detail beginning with Journeys, which again led the way delivering record first-quarter revenue and profit with 75% operating income growth versus pre-pandemic level. \u2047 There are several factors that shaped Journeys' exceptional Q1 performance starting with superb execution by its merchant team. \u2047 The pandemic has only magnified Journeys' industry-leading capabilities of anticipating, identifying, and securing the brands and styles most coveted by our team customers. \u2047 The combination of the right assortments and effective consumer engagement drove strong demand and full-price selling, including later in the quarter when we captured a healthy share of the increased consumer spending following the arrival of government stimulus checks and tax refunds. \u2047 In addition, Journeys' store team executed with excellence, achieving much higher conversion rates and increased transaction size, capitalizing on improving store traffic to drive store revenue above pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 On top of this, Journeys' online team delivered e-commerce sales that more than doubled pre-pandemic levels as new website visitors increased by almost 30% and generated close to 50% of Q1 online revenue. \u2047 With these incredibly strong vendor relationships, the Journeys team accomplished all of this while skillfully managing through the supply chain disruptions, which persisted in the industry throughout the quarter. \u2047 Journeys' offering of casual products resonated strongly with consumers as comfort continue to rain as the fashion choice of the pandemic. \u2047 While teens always have a big complement of fashion athletic footwear in their closets, we have talked about when fashion swings toward non-athletic or casual footwear, Journeys is especially well-positioned among its competition to deliver this assortment. \u2047 Moreover, current teen fashion trends are diverse and playing into a number of Journeys' brand strengths. \u2047 While fashion athletic grew nicely year over year, the gains in casual outpaces growth, including a strong start to the sandals season. \u2047 Congratulations Journeys team on another record quarter as the destination for fashion footwear for teens. \u2047 Over in the U.K., Schuh delivered a commendable performance under very difficult circumstances. \u2047 Stores were open for less than 20% of the possible operating days during the quarter due to government-mandated lockdowns that began around Christmas and continued until after Easter. \u2047 Despite the substantial loss of store days, revenue was in striking distance of Q1 two years ago and operating income exceeded pre-pandemic levels, including some one-time gains. \u2047 The Schuh team leaned successfully into its best-in-class digital capabilities throughout the pandemic to take advantage of the shift to online purchasing. \u2047 The first quarter was no exception as direct comps grew by more than 70% on top of last year's 90% growth and constituted more than 80% of Schuh's total revenue. \u2047 Prior to COVID-19, Schuh had the most advanced digital capabilities among our retail businesses, which have only strengthened over the past year through enhanced CRM capabilities, including more robust prospecting. \u2047 Schuh implemented significant operational changes to facilitate this digital growth, including reconfiguring its DC and labor model to add more e-commerce, packing stations, extending the deadline for next-day delivery through new freight carrier arrangements, and using stores as many DCs by rotating store fulfillment of e-commerce orders. \u2047 stores at the end of the quarter. \u2047 With seven of the top 10 best-performing brands in common, many of the trends driving Schuh's business were similar as usual to the ones driving Journeys, but with more of a fashion athletic tilt. \u2047 Before moving on from Schuh, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate the team on the official certification of its operations by Carbon Footprint Ltd as a carbon-neutral organization. \u2047 It has for a long time been a part of Schuh's DNA to operate in a socially responsible manner, consistent with its purpose pillars, and this accomplishment is the result of the team's efforts over several years. \u2047 This impressive achievement was realized ahead of schedule and provides the roadmap for our other businesses as we seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work with our partners to reduce the carbon footprint of the products that we sell. \u2047 For Johnston & Murphy, the first quarter marked another positive step forward in its recovery. \u2047 As vaccines rolled out, consumers began their return to life phase more quickly than expected, gathering with family and friends in social outings and occasions. \u2047 In Q1, retail store traffic improved in each successive month, digital sales grew a notable almost 20%, attracting new customers to the brand, and wholesale revenue increased. \u2047 The announced recovery plan is centered around new product technology and innovation with 90% of new product development focused on expansion of its casual offering. \u2047 We were pleased that Q1's success was driven by high demand for newly developed casual styles, led by the athletic-inspired Amherst and Activ8 collections, and a new holistic marketing campaign in support of these launches. \u2047 At the same time, we saw continued gains in golf shoes and apparel this spring further validating our success extending J&M beyond its dress shoe roots. \u2047 While sales lagged pre-pandemic levels, we are encouraged by these trends and expect the recovery to accelerate once America begins the return to office phase likely begin in earnest as we enter summer and move into fall. \u2047 In yet another highlight, license brands is now beginning to realize the benefits of the Levi's footwear license and Togast acquisition that closed in January 2020 right as the pandemic began. \u2047 Revenue more than doubled to record Q1 levels, and operating profit improved considerably versus pre-pandemic levels as Levi's footwear was well received in accounts ranging from department stores to Journeys and Journeys Kidz to family footwear. \u2047 This progress reinforces our excitement about the potential to create value by combining powerful brands with our fully integrated footwear sourcing capabilities. \u2047 Turning now to the current quarter. \u2047 While Q2 is typically our lowest volume quarter as teams and consumers in general turn their attention to getting out-of-school and summer activities, the momentum from Q1 has continued into May. \u2047 While we expect government stimulus and pent-up demand to ebb at some point, we expect Journeys' strength to continue, Schuh's strength to build with the opening of stores in the U.K. economy, and Johnston & Murphy's recovery to continue, but it will likely take until back to work in the fall to propel another step function improvement. \u2047 Vaccine rollout progress should benefit store traffic in the back half of the year, and we expect that a good amount of the digital business that we captured during the pandemic will be sticky and anticipate a much higher e-commerce penetration as compared to fiscal '20. \u2047 We're anticipating a more normalized back-to-school with a significant return to in-person learning and a more normalized holiday. \u2047 Some COVID effects will linger, but with higher savings and continued government aid, the consumer is well-positioned to spend. \u2047 While stimulus has been a positive, the strength we're seeing in our results goes well beyond this tailwind to the traction and momentum we're experiencing as a result of our strong portfolio of businesses and the strategic direction we embraced a couple of years ago with our footwear focused strategy. \u2047 The pace of our recovery only reinforces our belief that the path we were on prior to the pandemic and now is the right path forward. \u2047 What we're most excited about is we see opportunities to solidify the digital gains we made and capitalize on the ongoing industry consolidation to further expand our market share. \u2047 COVID-19 has provided us the real opportunity to transform our business at a faster case, and our results demonstrate that's what we're accomplishing. \u2047 Q1 results far exceeded both our expectations and last year across the board. \u2047 For comparison purposes, we believe that comparing to two years ago, our pre-pandemic fiscal '20 provides the most meaningful assessment of current performance is there is simply too much noise in fiscal 21's results for drawing informative comparisons. \u2047 However, looking back at how our business has changed since fiscal '20, e-commerce has become a larger percentage, and our licensed brand segment has become a larger piece of the total as well due to the acquisition of Togast and strong Levi's sales. \u2047 These changes come with an overall lower gross margin rate due to the impact of direct shipping expense and the expansion of our wholesale volume, which should be more than offset with lower SG&A from these businesses, coupled with the impact of our cost reduction initiative once our business normalizes post-pandemic. \u2047 While these changes will reshape the P&L, they have a positive impact on operating margins and an added benefit of a less capital-intensive business model. \u2047 Turning back to Q1. \u2047 I'm pleased to report that the first quarter continued the sequential improvement of our operating results since the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 Higher revenue in excess of pre-pandemic levels, combined with SG&A that remains well managed, led to significantly higher operating income versus fiscal '20, and Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 compared to $0.33 in fiscal '20. \u2047 In terms of the specifics for the quarter, consolidated revenue was 539 million, up 9% compared to fiscal '20, driven by continued strength in e-commerce, up 144% versus fiscal '20 combined with strong results from Journeys and licensed brands compared to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 We did not provide overall or store comp results in Q1 as our comp policy removes any stores that are closed for seven consecutive days, either this year or last year. \u2047 And therefore, we feel that overall sales is a more meaningful metric. \u2047 Overall digital sales increased to 25% of our retail business compared to 11% in fiscal '20, led by Journeys' penetration improvement, Schuh's ability to capture lost store sales online, and J&M's double-digit improvement compared to fiscal '20. \u2047 Licensed brands revenue was up 122% versus fiscal '20. \u2047 Consolidated gross margin was 47.8%, down 160 basis points from fiscal '20. \u2047 As we have experienced since the onset of the pandemic, increased shipping to fulfill direct sales pressure the gross margin rate in all our businesses, totaling 150 basis points of the overall decline, driven mainly by Schuh's much higher level of digital sales due to store closures. \u2047 While e-com puts pressure on our gross margin rate, as I mentioned, it comes with a lower cost structure and a high operating income rate. \u2047 Journeys' gross margin increased 130 basis points driven by lower markdowns in both stores and online. \u2047 Schuh's gross margin decreased 1,030 basis points due largely to the higher shipping expense from the shift in channel mix since e"], "gold_summary": ["q1 non-gaap earnings per share $0.79 from
