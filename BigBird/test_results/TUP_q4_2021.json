{"article": ["It is great to be here with you today to share our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. \u2047 As we ended 2021, we passed the midway point of our three-year turnaround plan. \u2047 In 2020, our priority was to stabilize the company. \u2047 In 2021, our priority was to build a foundation for omnichannel growth. \u2047 And in 2022, we will expand our efforts and increase our investments to make our products available to consumers wherever they choose to shop. \u2047 And while we focus on building a strong foundation in 2021, we reported both top and bottom-line growth in 2020 and in 2021. \u2047 Most important to me and to our board at this point are accomplishments, what we've learned and what we see ahead of us in the second half of our turnaround plan. \u2047 First, what has been accomplished. \u2047 We had to rightsize our cost structure to survive in 2020, carry that fiscal rigor into 2021, and successfully stabilize the company. \u2047 We reorganized and upgraded talent to help us fix and stabilize our direct selling business. \u2047 We have brought into the company new talent with retail and CPG experience to help us build an omnichannel business. \u2047 We restructured our debt twice, first, to provide a bridge loan in late 2020, and again in late 2021, to provide critical funding for growth, increasing our financial flexibility and reduce our cost of capital. \u2047 We divested non-core assets and reclassified the company's beauty business as discontinued operations in our financials as we work to complete remaining sales transactions in 2022. \u2047 We implemented proven methods of operations, utilizing data and techniques to revamp our core direct selling business. \u2047 We started building new capabilities to open up our iconic brand to new channels of distribution, with the goal of dramatically increased consumer access to our products. \u2047 And we have been working with retailers around the world to take limited amount of products into new channels, and we closed the year ahead of our objective of $50 million in B2B revenue, which is product sales sold through retails in their loyalty programs. \u2047 We accomplished top and bottom-line growth in 2021, while continuing to execute on our turnaround plan. \u2047 Additionally, we made important changes and investments while navigating unprecedented operating conditions, such as COVID lockdowns throughout the world. \u2047 And our gross profit was dramatically impacted both by higher resin prices and logistic costs. \u2047 Yet despite these outside distractions, we delivered growth in three of our four regions, with APAC being the outlier, as it was the hardest hit by the most recent COVID variant. \u2047 2021 performance was a tale of two halves. \u2047 Through the first half of 2021, we were ahead of our internal expectations and really seeing the initial benefits of using direct selling methods that we know are successful. \u2047 and Canada, and high resin and transportation cost as well as other inflationary pressures. \u2047 That said, we managed controllable expenses as we are exercising more discipline in our spending. \u2047 We ended the year up 1% of revenue and more than 50% on adjusted income. \u2047 Given the unknowns of COVID and all that we have accomplished to develop a stronger and scalable foundation, we are pleased with the progress our teams are making to prepare for an omnichannel future. \u2047 Additionally, as you know, we're up against very difficult comps in the second half of the year. \u2047 I'd also like to mention a few noteworthy recent achievements. \u2047 We continue to focus on introducing new more sustainable materials to our product lines, new products design to solve consumer needs identified by data and insights, and refined product strategy tied to our renewed purpose to help consumers reduce food waste and eliminate the use of single plastic products and packaging. \u2047 In 2021, the ECO+ Coffee To-Go Cup received the Fast Company's 2021 Innovation by Design Award and the Green Good Design Award. \u2047 The Handy Spiral also received high honors by the 2022 German Designer Award. \u2047 We introduced a freezable reusable bottle that, when frozen, offers up to eight hours of fresh, cool water for consumers on the go. \u2047 We also launched our Universal Cookware set, a product line developed for small kitchens and spaces. \u2047 In 2022, we will expand the glass bakeware and storage category given the current needs of today's consumers. \u2047 With our purpose to nurture a better future, in 2021, we brought to life a collaboration with TerraCycle circular reuse platform called Loop, producing a one-of-a-kind reusable packaging container option for Tim Hortons and Burger King. \u2047 Lastly, we continue to make progress in our ESG efforts. \u2047 We published our 10th annual sustainability report in the fourth quarter, which highlights the degree to which sustainability is moving into our cultural nevus. \u2047 For the first time ever, we conducted a materiality assessment intended to guide our efforts toward the ESG targets, the most important to many of our stakeholders. \u2047 The new report includes first-time social and governance goals, a new established 2025 and 2030 environmental target, including 90% absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. \u2047 As a testament to our sustainability reports, we're recently recognized by Newsweek as one of America's most responsible companies in 2021 for our commitment to our people, planet, and environmentally responsible products. \u2047 And last month, we renewed our partnership with the National Park Foundation, providing $2 million multi-use donation to create meaningful impact across the National Park system. \u2047 As we head into 2022, and the second half of our turnaround plan, we believe our strategy is the right one: to make the company as big as our famous brand. \u2047 We will continue to fix our core business, continue to enter into product categories, and continue to open and expand into new channels, all of which we believe will transform this iconic brand. \u2047 In our core direct selling business, we're using a more data-driven approach to making better and smarter decisions. \u2047 This includes segmentation of how we look at our sales force and our customers to personalize their experience with Tupperware and, in some cases, introducing preferred customer loyalty programs in our biggest markets. \u2047 We're also turning around unprofitable markets through changing our sales models and supplementing with business expansion strategies. \u2047 When we started the turnaround plan, we had 18 markets that we're losing money. \u2047 By converting these markets to a more omnichannel approach, this 18 formerly struggling markets now represent over $180 million in revenue and are contributing over 14% operating profit return on sales. \u2047 As I talked about in prior earnings calls, using importers is one of those models we're using more broadly to both expand sales and improve margins. \u2047 At the end of 2021, revenue from importers was almost $70 million, up 12% from last year. \u2047 Our retail studio market, excluding China, grew 19% in 2021, while our B2B loyalty programs achieved $56 million revenue, over 50% higher than last year. \u2047 In 2021, we continue to create the foundation for transforming a business that has been a pure direct selling business for more than 75 years. \u2047 We continue to learn as we go and readjust and make investments to accomplish the goal that we set from the very beginning of the turnaround plan. \u2047 We're doing something no company has done before in taking a proved direct selling organization and going omnichannel. \u2047 This transformation will take time to execute organically, but we've made progress in 2021 through the expansion of importer, studios, and B2B loyalty programs. \u2047 We believe we are laying the foundation for further retail expansion as we enter into the next half of the turnaround. \u2047 We know the real price is opening up consumer access to our products in a major way, and that means meeting consumers wherever they shop. \u2047 Therefore, in 2021, we invested in retail talent to develop and grow retail partnerships, expand with third-party distribution partners across the globe to improve service levels, implement detailed tools to support the retail business and enhance packaging and labeling. \u2047 We also onboarded a new product team and established a new sourcing and supply chain center of excellence in Singapore and developed a sub-brand specifically for this channel. \u2047 In summary, significant progress has been made in 2021 to build a foundation that accounts for both a direct selling business and the omnichannel business. \u2047 and the U.K., just to name a few. \u2047 Our focus in 2022 is globalizing direct selling best practices, accelerating new product development, increasing consumer access through omnichannel efforts, including expanded product access in the U.S. and Canada, stabilizing in China. \u2047 The entire Tupperware team, our sales force, our associates, our board, and our executive team is excited about the future. \u2047 We've made meaningful progress in 2021, despite some challenging headwinds in the second half of the year, while continuing to execute on our turnaround plan and lay the groundwork for future expansion and sustainable growth. \u2047 In 2021, we invested in the business to fix the core and set the foundation for expanding into more channels. \u2047 We refinanced the debt for more flexibility with more favorable terms, continued our efforts to divest of non-core assets, significantly improved our tax rate and remediated the material weakness within our Mexico operations. \u2047 Now to our financial results. \u2047 As a reminder, we made an accounting change last quarter to classify our sold and held-for-sale beauty and personal care businesses as discontinued operations, which is consistent with our strategy to focus on the performance of our core business and expansion efforts. \u2047 For the full year 2021, we posted revenue of $1.6 billion, which represents an increase of 1% compared to 2020. \u2047 As Miguel mentioned, we were outpacing our plan during the first half of the year. \u2047 Then in the second half, we had to manage through the impact of restricted COVID lockdowns, especially in Asia and Europe. \u2047 We also were challenged in the second half in the U.S. and Canada business with the implementation of a new sales force tool, but still managed to achieve an all-time high for revenue in this market in 2021. \u2047 We also grew in three of our four regions for the full year, with Europe up 2%; North America, up 6%; South America, up 20%; and APAC was down 11%, mainly due to China. \u2047 Business expansion, which includes B2B loyalty programs, importers, studios, and retail, is now approximately 20% of our revenue. \u2047 We're pleased to report that the B2B loyalty revenue was $56 million for the year, exceeding our stated goal of $50 million for 2021 and $37 million in 2020. \u2047 Miguel also mentioned the significant progress we've made in importers and studios outside of China. \u2047 For the year, three of our big four markets posted growth with the U.S. and Canada up 2%; Brazil up 9%; and Mexico higher than last year by 13%. \u2047 China was the only big four market that did not grow and was down by 21%, heavily impacted by fewer studio openings, impacts of lockdowns due to COVID and leadership changes throughout the year. \u2047 For the year, gross profit was $1.1 billion, flat compared with last year. \u2047 However, gross margin was 66.7%, as compared to 67.5% last year. \u2047 The decrease of 80 basis points was driven primarily by higher resin cost of 200 basis points, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies in the first half of the year. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA was $290 million or 18.1% of sales, relatively flat on a reported basis. \u2047 Excluding the foreign exchange impact, EBITDA would have been lower due to the gross profit impacts I just spoke about. \u2047 We continue to improve SG&A, despite higher distribution and freight and incremental investments. \u2047 Adjusted earnings per share was $3.25, as compared to $2.15 last year as reported. \u2047 In 2021, we had two favorable one-time items for the year: $0.15 related to a favorable ruling from the court in regard to a Brazil non-income tax matter; and $0.05 for a China grant, which are being partially offset by a deferred tax asset adjustment of $0.10 that we'll talk about in a minute. \u2047 Adjusted for these one-time items and for tax items in both periods, adjusted earnings per share was $3.15 for 2021, compared to $3.33 for 2020. \u2047 The decrease was primarily driven by higher resin cost of $0.47; investments, $0.24; partially offset by $0.53 of favorable manufacturing efficiencies, tighter cost controls, and lower interest. \u2047 The operating tax rate was 21.9% versus 45.5% in 2020. \u2047 As we noted in prior calls, we made significant investments in 2021 to accelerate our tax strategies in an effort to achieve our goal of sub-30%, aligned with our peers and our global operating structure. \u2047 Next, turning to performance for the quarter. \u2047 Overall, the fourth quarter was heavily impacted by COVID lockdowns, especially in Asia and Europe. \u2047 It also had the highest resin cost for the year and a one-time tax adjustment that I'll discuss in more detail in a few minutes. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, net sales were $395 million, representing a decrease of 10% compared to last year. \u2047 The impact of omicron variant of the COVID-19 was significant in the quarter, with partial or countrywide lockdowns in various markets affecting our operations, particularly in Asia Pacific and Europe. \u2047 Excluding the COVID impact, net sales would have decreased 2% in the quarter. \u2047 Also coming off a strong second half of 2020, we were facing tougher comps in Q4, particularly in the U.S., due to over $25 million of backlog from previous quarters being shipped in the fourth quarter of the prior year. \u2047 On a two-year stack, fourth-quarter revenue increased by 6%. \u2047 Q4 was the strongest quarter for B2B loyalty program revenue, with $20 million of the full year $56 million and representing an increase of $15 million compared to the same quarter last year. \u2047 Turning now to sales performance by region, including specific performance in our largest markets. \u2047 First, in Asia Pacific, sales decreased by 10%. \u2047 The slowdown in China, which was down 14% in the quarter, was driven by COVID lockdowns related to resurgence challenges as well as studio closings and a slower pace of new openings, partially offset by the successful entry into small kitchen appliances in this market. \u2047 We also made an important leadership change and believe that we have the right person now in place. \u2047 China remains an important market for the Tupperware brand and holds significant potential for future growth. \u2047 We will continue to prioritize the revitalization of this important market, including through new product innovation, upgrading the look and feel of our physical studio locations and investments in digital and e-commerce"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted non-gaap earnings per share $0.38 from continuing operations including items.  \u2047  as a result of its remediation efforts, material weaknesses were
