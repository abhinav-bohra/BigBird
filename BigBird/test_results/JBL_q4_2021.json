{"article": ["We have a great session planned for you today. \u2047 And as an organization, we're excited to provide you with a little extra detail about our business as typical for our September call. \u2047 Over the next 60 minutes or so, we will review our strong fourth quarter and fiscal 2021 results, followed by yet another great outlook for fiscal 2022. \u2047 As usual, you will hear from both Mark Mondello, our CEO; as well as Mike Dastoor, our CFO. \u2047 Along this journey, we'll discuss our approach to the end markets we serve, the uniqueness of our supply chain solutions, and the innovation underway within our global network of factories. \u2047 And we'll kick that right off with the following brief video. \u2047 Such a great video. \u2047 As we all know, the world is complex and only getting more so each and every day. \u2047 But as Mark often says, our people are our greatest differentiator and that couldn't be more apparent as you visit our global network of factories and meet the roughly 260,000 people that make Jabil's foundation so strong. \u2047 Our foundation is solid. \u2047 Through over 50 million square feet of manufacturing space and 100-plus sites, our people strive to make anything possible and everything better for over 400 of the world's most recognizable brands. \u2047 Our agility and global scale enable us to respond quickly and flexibly to meet customer needs in key end markets, like mobility, industrial and semi cap, automotive, and healthcare, just to name a few. \u2047 These wide-ranging end markets represent a diverse and thoughtfully designed portfolio that, over the years, has helped reduce volatility and improve the reliability of our financial results. \u2047 To help illustrate our diversification strategy over the past few years, I'd now ask that you turn to the next slide, which shows our revenue growth and the end markets we serve. \u2047 As you may know, the EMS industry has long struggled with customer concentration, and this dynamic has created a lot of variability in operating performance from one year to the next. \u2047 In 2016, our management team concluded that our model was missing an important characteristic if we were going to deliver upon our financial priorities consistently and sustainably. \u2047 This important characteristic was product diversification. \u2047 So beginning roughly in the 2017 time frame, we embarked on a journey to grow and diversify our business in areas such as 5G, cloud, healthcare, packaging, connected devices, automotive, and semi-capital equipment. \u2047 As a result of our efforts to diversify the business, revenue has grown rapidly. \u2047 And since 2017, we have added more than $10 billion in revenue across several key end markets. \u2047 And it's important to note this growth has been very intentional and focused. \u2047 Moving to the right side of the chart, you'll see the composition of our $29.3 billion in revenue, and you'll likely notice that no end market dominates our diverse portfolio. \u2047 In each of these areas, Jabil partners with some of the world's most recognizable companies to accelerate their speed to market through product engineering, supply chain design and, of course, manufacture. \u2047 In healthcare, think of drug delivery systems, such as inhalers and insulin pens, diagnostics, medical devices, orthopedics, and instruments that all meet exacting FDA standards. \u2047 Our healthcare business serves programs and products with long stable life cycles of 10 to 20 years with high cost of change, thus providing stable earnings and cash flows. \u2047 In packaging, we design and manufacture highly engineered rigid plastic packaging for many leading consumer brands, bringing to bear capabilities in ideation, product design, material scientists, and eco-friendly barrier technologies. \u2047 Within mobility and connected devices, we generally focus on machining, tooling, and molding of highly engineered plastic and metal parts, leveraging a strong product development skillset. \u2047 In areas such as digital print and retail, we're focused on 3D print, large form factor printing, and retail automation. \u2047 And in industrial and semi cap, 5G wireless and cloud, and networking and storage, we participate in the design, product development, industrialization, and manufacturing of some of the most sophisticated tech products on the marketplace today. \u2047 And then in automotive, the bulk of our business focuses on the electrification of auto supported by a nearly 10-year relationship with the world's leading EV company. \u2047 So from mobility to retail automation to complex heavy industrial equipment, Jabil helps customers navigate large complex material supply chains while effectively managing change, mitigating risks, and delivering quickly and efficiently. \u2047 In summary, our business has grown rapidly over the last several years to serve a diverse blend of end markets that today are benefiting from long-term secular trends. \u2047 And again, this gives us the confidence and comfort to not only provide financial guidance more than one quarter out but also invest in things like factory innovation. \u2047 And when you drill down one level deeper, you'll again notice an incredibly diverse set of customers, representing some of the largest, most innovative, and successful organizations in the world today. \u2047 This by no means is a complete list of the customers we serve, but it's certainly impressive by any standard, especially when considering many of these customers rely on Jabil as the sole source for their products. \u2047 I'm sure most of you recognized some of our incredible partners such as Apple, HP, Ericsson, Amazon, Cisco, John Deere, Tesla, and J&J. \u2047 In all of our customer relationships, we're incredibly focused on delivering consistent value and reliable value from early in the product life cycle, like product innovation and design, to more mature products where we offer planning, automation, supply chain management and, of course, manufacturing. \u2047 At the end of the day, we build stuff at Jabil, and we do it really, really well. \u2047 This leads me to our financial priorities as a management team. \u2047 We're squarely focused on three areas: expanding operating margins, increasing earnings per share, and generating strong cash flows. \u2047 In fact, this focus has been further sharpened as we've embedded core margins, core earnings per share, and free cash flow within our short-term and long-term compensation programs as we believe this effectively aligns management and shareholders. \u2047 And over the next several minutes, we plan to provide you with a credible plan to improve all of these three metrics in fiscal '22. \u2047 Following me today will be Mike who joined Jabil in 2000 as a regional controller based in Hong Kong. \u2047 Mike will walk you through our fiscal '21 results and our robust financial plan for fiscal '22. \u2047 He will also spend some time highlighting our end markets and discussing some of the trends which should drive our business for many years to come. \u2047 Then Mark, who joined Jabil in 1992 as a manufacturing supervisor, will share some of the value that Jabil provides to its customers through our people, our culture, and our best-in-class manufacturing capabilities. \u2047 These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. \u2047 An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2020, and other filings. \u2047 As Adam highlighted, our business model is fundamentally structured to deliver core margin expansion and strong predictable cash flows, and our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility. \u2047 This flexibility has enabled us to reshape our end-market portfolio over the last several years, and in the last 18 months, our strategy has been pressure tested. \u2047 And our diversified, well-balanced portfolio performed extremely well evidenced by a solid Q4 and exceptionally strong FY '21 results. \u2047 In Q4, the teams in both segments successfully managed to navigate an incredibly dynamic supply chain environment. \u2047 During the quarter, demand continued to be broad-based and robust, but revenue came in slightly lower than expected due to some incremental tightness in the supply chain, mainly in healthcare, industrial, and cloud. \u2047 This was partly offset by upsides in connected devices and networking and storage. \u2047 Despite this, our core operating margin performance in the quarter was quite strong coming in at 4.2%, approximately 10 basis points higher than expected, a testament to our team's execution in the quarter, solid cost optimization, and our ever more resilient end-market portfolio. \u2047 In Q4, our interest and tax expense also came in better than expected, which when combined with the strong margin performance allowed us to deliver strong core diluted earnings per share in Q4, putting it all together on the next slide. \u2047 Net revenue for the fourth quarter was $7.4 billion, up 1% over the prior-year quarter. \u2047 GAAP operating income was $265 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.16. \u2047 Core operating income during the quarter was $314 million, an increase of 23% year over year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 70-basis-point improvement over the prior year. \u2047 Net interest expense in Q4 was $36 million, and core tax rate came in at approximately 22.3%. \u2047 Core diluted earnings per share was $1.44, a 47% improvement over the prior-year quarter. \u2047 Now turning to our fourth-quarter segment results on the next slide. \u2047 Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.9 billion, an increase of 9.7% on a year-over-year basis. \u2047 The strong year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based with strength across our healthcare, automotive and mobility businesses. \u2047 Core margin for the segment came in at 4.1%, 20 basis points higher than the previous year. \u2047 Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.5 billion, down 6.4%, primarily driven by our previously announced transition to a consignment model. \u2047 Core margin for the segment was 4.3%, up 120 basis points over the prior year reflecting solid execution by the team. \u2047 For the year, our DMS segment revenue was $15.4 billion, an increase of 17% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up an impressive 49% year over year. \u2047 This resulted in core margins expanding 110 basis points to 4.8%, reflective of our improved mix. \u2047 In EMS for the year, core margins were also up strong, coming in at 3.7%, 100 basis points higher than the prior year on revenue of $13.9 billion. \u2047 Turning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. \u2047 Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $202 million and for the full fiscal year came in better than expected at $793 million or 2.7% of net revenue. \u2047 We sometimes hear from investors seeking clarification on our net capex, so I'd like to take a moment to walk you through the components. \u2047 As a reminder, our customers sometimes co-invest in plant, property, and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. \u2047 We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which are then subsequently reimbursed to us by customers. \u2047 The line item acquisition of property, plant, and equipment on our statement of cash flows includes the full upfront payment made by us. \u2047 The reimbursements by our customers are reflected as a sale of assets in the line item proceeds and advances from sale of property, plant, and equipment on our statement of cash flows. \u2047 The net of these two items reflects our true spend and what we refer to as net capital expenditures. \u2047 In Q4, inventory days came in higher than expected at 71 days, an increase of three days sequentially, driven by the previously mentioned incremental tightness in the supply chain. \u2047 While these higher inventory days may continue in the short term, we expect it to normalize below 60 over the mid- to longer term. \u2047 The management team continues to be fully focused on this metric, particularly in the current environment. \u2047 In spite of this, our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were very strong, coming in at $762 million. \u2047 As a result of the strong fourth-quarter performance and cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $640 million. \u2047 We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.4 times and cash balances of $1.6 billion. \u2047 During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased in FY '21 to 8.8 million shares or $477 million. \u2047 This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY '13 to approximately 90 million shares at an average price under $27, bringing our total returns to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends, to approximately $3 billion, reflective of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders. \u2047 In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver exceptionally strong results in fiscal '21. \u2047 Next, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight Jabil's unique position across multiple end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends and the convergence of technology in our day-to-day lives. \u2047 We believe these trends will continue to drive sustainable growth and margins across the enterprise in FY '22 and beyond. \u2047 In healthcare today, on the next slide, the industry is undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations, the demand for better healthcare in emerging markets, and the accelerated pace of change and innovation. \u2047 Consequently, we're witnessing healthcare companies shifting their core competencies away from manufacturing toward innovative and connected product solutions. \u2047 We continue to be in the early days of outsourcing of manufacturing in the healthcare space. \u2047 Our strategic collaboration, which we have highlighted in previous years, has enhanced our credibility within the industry and has further enabled Jabil to benefit from this outsourcing trend. \u2047 On top of this, we are also seeing the impact of connectivity, digitization, and personalized care across healthcare. \u2047 I expect these trends to accelerate over the next few years. \u2047 Our deep domain expertise within the healthcare industry uniquely positions us to build technology-enabled products which help our customers excel in today's evolution of healthcare. \u2047 Another end market experiencing a rapid shift in technologies is the automotive market. \u2047 Climate change, fuel efficiency, and emissions are ongoing concerns, and regulatory policies worldwide are beginning to mandate more eco-friendly technologies. \u2047 As a result, OEMs are making substantial investments into vehicle electrification efforts. \u2047 The bulk of our automotive business is focused on electrification of cars, which we believe still has plenty of room to grow. \u2047 Over the next three years, we expect the fastest-growing area of our auto business will be in what's known as ACE, autonomous, connectivity, and electrification. \u2047 Today, electric vehicles account for a small fraction of total vehicles in the market, but the EV segment overall is growing rapidly and gaining a"], "gold_summary": ["jabil q4 gaap earnings per share $1.16.  \u2047  q4 non-gaap core earnings per share $1.44.  \u2047  q4 gaap earnings per share $1.16.  \u2047  q4 revenue $7.4 billion
