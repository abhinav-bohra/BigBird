{"article": ["With me on the call today is Jeff Powell, our President and Chief Executive Officer. \u2047 Before we begin, let me read our safe harbor statement. \u2047 These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \u2047 Following the remarks, I will give an overview of our financial results for the quarter and the year, and we will then have a Q&A session. \u2047 I'll begin by discussing our operational highlights and our fourth quarter financial results. \u2047 The fourth quarter was a solid finish to a challenging year. \u2047 Despite the uncertainties brought about by the pandemic, we had a solid execution during the quarter and generated strong cash flow while safeguarding our employees. \u2047 Strong capital project activity across all our operating segments and robust demand for our Parts & Consumables led to record bookings and cash flow in the fourth quarter. \u2047 I'll provide more details about this activity when I discuss the results of our operating segments. \u2047 Our balance sheet remains healthy and our liquidity position has strengthened throughout the year. \u2047 Robust cash flows have always been a strength of Kadant, and we expect this will continue as economies recover from the effects of the pandemic. \u2047 Turning now to our Q4 performance. \u2047 We achieved a notable turnaround from the prior quarter's weak business levels. \u2047 Our Q4 bookings were a record $197 million, up 23% compared to the prior year, with our Industrial Processing segment driving this growth. \u2047 Strong demand led to a 9% sequential increase in Parts & Consumables revenue, which made up 67% of total Q4 revenue. \u2047 Total revenue was down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 We were particularly pleased that our adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 19.1%, and our free cash flow was up 7% to a record $38 million in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Overall, the quarter was better-than-expected and I'm pleased with how our employees delivered these solid operating results. \u2047 While 2019 was a record year on many fronts, and we began 2020 with positive momentum, no one could have anticipated the full impact that the pandemic would have on the world and the global economies. \u2047 Full year revenue declined 10% to $635 million, while our bottom line performance benefited from a favorable product mix along with cost containment measures and government systems programs. \u2047 Cash flow from operations strengthened throughout the year, and free cash flow was near a record $85 million for the full year 2020. \u2047 Our diluted earnings per share was $4.77 and on an adjusted basis, declined 7% to $5 compared to our record of $5.36 per share in 2019. \u2047 Our workforce around the globe deserves a tremendous amount of credit for these results as they adapted to a new way of work and performed exceptionally well under very challenging circumstances. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of our talent and dedicated employees for the work they've done and continue to do to serve our customers. \u2047 Next, I'd like to review the performance of our three operating segments. \u2047 Our Flow Control segment benefited from a rebound in capital project activity in the fourth quarter, which led to bookings increasing nearly 9% compared to the prior year period. \u2047 Our quarterly bookings performance moved in the right direction as the year progressed and positions us well for a solid start to 2021. \u2047 Our Parts & Consumables revenue was up 5% sequentially and made up 68% of total Q4 revenue. \u2047 As many of you know, our aftermarket parts business has a more favorable margin profile compared to capital business, and the product mix combined with improved operating leverage led to a 13% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared to Q4 of 2019 and represented 26% of revenue. \u2047 Looking ahead, we expect the first quarter of 2021 to show stability in terms of both capital project bookings and demand for Parts & Consumables. \u2047 We believe market conditions are improving and will continue to strengthen as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes more widely available and businesses are permitted to fully reopen. \u2047 Turning now to our Industrial Processing segment. \u2047 We continue to experience strong demand for our wood processing equipment and also for our stock prep equipment, with capital bookings in this segment more than doubling compared to the prior year. \u2047 This demand was largely driven by two factors. \u2047 One was a robust U.S. housing market, which saw single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, increased 12% in December. \u2047 The other was a significant increase in our stock prep capital project activity in China and North America, which more than doubled compared to the prior year. \u2047 Revenue in this segment declined 13% to $69 million year-over-year, but increased 11% sequentially. \u2047 Parts & Consumables revenue was up 12% compared to the same period last year, and made up 70% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. \u2047 A favorable product mix and good execution led to a 250-basis point improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margin. \u2047 While government systems programs were significantly reduced in the fourth quarter, we did have some remaining benefit that helped allow us to retain our talented workforce. \u2047 In our Material Handling segment, we continue to see relatively stable yet moderate order activity. \u2047 Revenue was down 7% to $39 million, and Parts & Consumables revenue in the fourth quarter made up 58% of total revenue. \u2047 Capital bookings in our Material Handling segment increased 23% compared to the same period last year and were up 18% sequentially. \u2047 We are encouraged to see our customers showing increased confidence in the economic outlook by awarding us these larger capital orders. \u2047 As in all other segments, we are seeing increasing market activity. \u2047 Looking ahead to 2021, we believe this segment will continue to strengthen throughout the year. \u2047 As we look ahead to the first quarter of 2021 and the full year, we are seeing signs of increased project activity and expect industrial production to continue its modest rebound. \u2047 Our strong cash flows combined with a strengthening balance sheet have us well positioned to capitalize on opportunities that may emerge with the improving global economy. \u2047 While we are hopeful the worst of the pandemic is behind us, there is still a great amount of uncertainty, particularly in Europe, regarding how economies will respond to pandemic given the unevenness in the vaccine distribution. \u2047 This uncertainty limits our ability to forecast the timing of orders and as a result, we will not be providing guidance at this time. \u2047 I would like to pass the call over to Mike for a review of our Q4 performance. \u2047 I'll start with some key financial metrics from our fourth quarter. \u2047 Consolidated gross margins were 44.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 40.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019, up 320 basis points. \u2047 The increase was primarily due to higher gross margins on Parts & Consumables in the quarter and a higher percentage of Parts & Consumables. \u2047 Our overall percentage of Parts & Consumables revenue increased to 67% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 60% in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 Also contributing to the increase in gross margins was approximately 50 basis points due to the receipt of government assistance benefits related to the pandemic. \u2047 SG&A expenses were $47.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, down $0.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 28.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 26.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 There was an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect, which increased SG&A expenses by $1.1 million, and we received government assistance benefits of $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 Excluding these items, along with backlog amortization and the SG&A from our acquisition, SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2020 were down $1.3 million or 3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to reduced travel-related expenses. \u2047 Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.40 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.76 in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter includes $0.12 from an intangible asset impairment charge, $0.01 of restructuring costs and $0.01 of acquired backlog amortization. \u2047 In addition, our fourth quarter results included pre-tax income of $1.2 million or $0.07 net of tax attributable to government employee retention assistance programs. \u2047 Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.4% and included approximately $0.12 of tax benefits related to the following items. \u2047 A reversal of tax reserves associated with uncertain tax positions, the exercise of previously awarded employee stock options and return to provision adjustments. \u2047 Excluding these items, our tax rate would have been 27%. \u2047 For the full year 2020, gross margins increased 200 basis points to 43.7% compared to 41.7% in 2019. \u2047 Excluding the government assistance benefits, which contributed approximately 60 basis points to the 2020 gross margins and the amortization of profit and inventory in 2019, gross margins were up 90 basis points, primarily due to higher gross profit margins on Parts & Consumables and a higher overall percentage of Parts & Consumables. \u2047 Our percentage of Parts & Consumables revenue increased to 66% in 2020 compared to 63% in 2019. \u2047 SG&A expenses decreased $10.6 million or 6% to $181.9 million in 2020 compared to $192.5 million in 2019. \u2047 As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 28.6% in 2020 compared to 27.3% in 2019. \u2047 We had $0.6 million of SG&A from our acquisitions in 2020 and incurred acquisition-related costs of $1 million and $2.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. \u2047 In addition, there was a favorable foreign currency translation effect of $0.4 million and we received government assistance benefits of $2.2 million in 2020. \u2047 Excluding SG&A from our acquisition, acquisition-related costs, the impact of foreign currency translation and government assistance benefits, SG&A expenses were down $7.4 million or 4% compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in travel-related costs. \u2047 Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in 2020 was $4.77, up 5% compared to $4.54 in 2019. \u2047 Our GAAP diluted earnings per share in 2020 includes $0.12 from an intangible asset impairment charge, $0.07 of restructuring costs, $0.04 of acquired backlog amortization, $0.03 of acquisition costs and $0.03 from a discrete tax benefit. \u2047 In addition, our 2020 results included pre-tax income of $6.1 million or $0.39 net of tax attributable to government employee retention assistance programs. \u2047 In the fourth quarter of 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $32.1 million or 19.1% of revenue compared to $32.2 million or 17.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 On a sequential basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% due to increased profitability in our Material Handling segment. \u2047 For the full year, adjusted EBITDA was $115.9 million or 18.3% of revenue compared to the record set in 2019 of $127.1 million or 18% of revenue. \u2047 In the fourth quarter of 2020, operating cash flow was a record $40.3 million and included a positive impact of $12.8 million from working capital compared to operating cash flows of $39.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, which included a positive impact from working capital of $17.9 million. \u2047 For the full year, operating cash flow was $92.9 million, down 5% compared to the record of $97.4 million in 2019. \u2047 We had several notable nonoperating uses of cash in the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 We repaid $30.1 million of debt, paid a $2.8 million dividend on our common stock and paid $2.2 million for capital expenditures. \u2047 For the full year, we repaid $72 million of our debt. \u2047 Free cash flow was a record $38.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, increasing 69% sequentially and 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 For the full year, free cash flow was $85.3 million, down $2.2 million or 2% compared to the record of $87.5 million in 2019. \u2047 Let me turn to our earnings per share results for the quarter. \u2047 In the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.40 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.54. \u2047 The $0.14 difference relates to an intangible asset impairment charge of $0.12, restructuring costs of $0.01 and amortization of acquired backlog of $0.01. \u2047 The $0.12 intangible asset impairment charge is associated with our timber harvesting product line, which is part of our Wood Processing Systems business. \u2047 This is an ancillary product line that was part of our acquisition of NII FPG's Forest Products business in 2017 and represents less than 1.5% of our consolidated revenues in 2020. \u2047 We experienced a decrease in demand for these products in 2019, which continued into 2020 due to several factors including a general softening in demand for equipment used in steep slope logging due to reduced availability of timber, higher stumpage fees and the resulting closure of some sawmills in Western Canada. \u2047 We evaluated the recoverability of the intangible asset related to this business, which resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 and $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. \u2047 After these impairment charges, the remaining intangible asset for this product line is $0.5 million. \u2047 In the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.76 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.32. \u2047 The $0.56 difference relates to a $0.55 charge for the settlement of a pension plan, an intangible asset impairment charge of $0.16, and restructuring costs of $0.01, which were partially offset by a $0.16 tax benefit associated with the exercise of previously awarded employee stock options. \u2047 The increase of $0.22 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 consists of the following: $0.21 due to higher gross margins, $0.15 from a lower recurring tax rate, $0.07 due to government assistance programs, $0.06 due to lower interest expense, $0.02 due to lower operating expenses and $0.01 from the operating results of our acquisition. \u2047 These increases were partially offset"], "gold_summary": ["q4 adjusted
