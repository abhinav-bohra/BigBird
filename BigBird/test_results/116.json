{"article": ["Against the backdrop of the reopening of the U.S., we are seeing consistent improvements in our business fundamentals. \u2047 Key among these include accelerated cash collection levels and significant progress in our theater portfolio. \u2047 Our increased cash collection levels reflect strengthening the businesses and an increasingly more positive environment for the experiences our properties deliver. \u2047 At a macro level, with the broad increase of vaccine deployment, we are seeing a meaningful improvement in consumer confidence and stabilization of the economy as is evidenced by employment and GDP data. \u2047 Separately, the new protocols from the CDC for fully vaccinated people reflect the opportunity to achieve increasing levels of normalcy and life as we once knew it. \u2047 Across our portfolio, consumers have been exhibiting their desire to experience out-of-home entertainment, and our tenants businesses have been beneficiaries of this pent-up demand. \u2047 In particular, during the quarter and continuing through April, consumers demonstrated their desire to return to theaters as we achieved new box-office high since the onset of the pandemic. \u2047 Importantly, this momentum has been established in an environment with capacity constraints, limited content and direct-to-consumer streaming options, which provide the opportunity to view select features at home. \u2047 Said another way, even with the challenges and limitations of the current operating environment, these results indicate that consumers still value the theater experience for new movie titles. \u2047 We look forward to being able to fully maximize the reopening of theater exhibition as we expect that 98% of our theaters will be opened by the end of May, and consumers will have the opportunity to see a strong lineup of film titles for the remainder of 2021, many of which have been delayed several times. \u2047 As we continue to manage the business, we remain laser focused on our goals for 2021, including our exit from covenant relief, reestablishment of a dividend and a return to sustained growth. \u2047 During the quarter, we also made progress on our strategic capital recycling activities and utilized proceeds from dispositions and stronger collections to pay off the remaining $90 million balance on our $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. \u2047 These steps of strengthening liquidity and optimizing the portfolio are supportive of our goals and should fuel growth as we move into the second half of the year. \u2047 This was an important quarter as we sustained ongoing positive trends in key business measures necessary for us to add our existing debt covenant waivers, most specifically, continued improvement of our cash collection levels. \u2047 As I stated earlier, the trends appear to be very favorable at this point, including vaccinations, consumer demand and exhibition recovery. \u2047 Having positive momentum across all these areas should propel us toward the achievement of our goals. \u2047 At the end of the first quarter, our total investments were approximately $6.5 billion with 354 properties in service and 93% occupied. \u2047 During the quarter, our investment spending was $52.1 million, entirely in our experiential portfolio. \u2047 The spending included build-to-suit development and redevelopment projects that were committed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the acquisition of a newly constructed TopGolf facility in San Jose, California, for $26.7 million, which was acquired primarily with cash received from TopGolf as payment of a portion of their deferred rent balance. \u2047 Effectively, we acquired TopGolf, San Jose, using a portion of their deferred rent as currency, a creative and complementary outcome for both sides. \u2047 Our experiential portfolio comprises 280 properties with 42 operators is 93% occupied and accounts for 91% of our total investments or approximately $5.9 billion of the total $6.5 billion. \u2047 We have four properties under development. \u2047 Our education portfolio comprises 74 properties with eight operators and at the end of the quarter was 100% occupied. \u2047 Now I'll update you on the operating status of our tenants, our deferral agreements and rent payment time lines. \u2047 71% of our theaters were open as of April 30. \u2047 Under Regal's announced reopening schedule, all of our Regal theaters will be opened by May 21. \u2047 And at that point, we anticipate 98% of our theaters will be open. \u2047 Five of our theaters remained closed because of governmental orders. \u2047 All four of our Canadian theaters are closed at least through May 20 due to governmental mandate, and our dine-in theater in San Francisco is closed until July because of local indoor dining restrictions. \u2047 We have five vacant theaters not operated by any of our major exhibitors, which we are releasing and seven closed theaters, which we are selling, six of which are under contract. \u2047 Finally, we are continuing to operate two theaters through a third-party manager, a former AMC in Columbus, Ohio, and the former Goodrich Savoy in Champagne, Illinois. \u2047 April's box-office performance exceeded industry expectations, led by King Kong versus Godzilla, Mortal Combat and Demon Slayer. \u2047 The outperformance of all three films drove box office to $189 million for April, a 66% increase from March's $113 million. \u2047 The strong results from these three films show the consumer is eagerly embracing the opportunity to get back to the movies. \u2047 openings and won't be fully open until late May and that less than 20% of Canadian theaters are open. \u2047 With increasing vaccinations, the approach of summer and easing restrictions, the primary challenge for exhibitors now is a lack of film supply. \u2047 The remaining film slate of high-quality, tent-pole films lines up nicely to drive increasing consumer demand through 2021, beginning at Memorial Day with A Quiet Place Part II and following with Venom: Let There Be Carnage, Dune, Cruella, Fast and Furious 9, Black Widow, Suicide Squad, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Eternals, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Top Gun: Maverick, Spider-Man: No Way Home, the Kingsman and Matrix 4. \u2047 Studios, content providers and the consumer all value the big-screen experience. \u2047 April's performance bears that out. \u2047 I want to briefly address lessons learned over the past year. \u2047 The studio's decision to delay the release of the vast majority of their tent-pole titles until theaters reopened in 2021 and 2022 is the best evidence of their commitment to the exhibition economic model and the importance of the theatrical window as a critical revenue driver for the studios and content providers. \u2047 COVID-19 forced studios and exhibitors to experiment. \u2047 Studios understandably evaluated alternative content delivery options, including premium video on demand, PVOD; subscription video on demand, SVOD; hybrid models of theatrical release mixed with PVOD or SVOD; and selling movies to streaming services. \u2047 We believe the best indicator of the results of this experimentation is that the overwhelming majority of tent-pole films scheduled for theatrical release pre-COVID-19 will be released theatrically 2021 or 2022. \u2047 It made economic sense for the studios to wait until theaters were permitted's to reopen throughout the U.S., and they did. \u2047 Studios and content providers do not consider PVOD, SVOD and other forms of at-home viewing as replacements for theatrical exhibition. \u2047 Consumer subscribed to streaming services for all-you-can-eat buffet content and generally aren't interested in paying an upcharge for an individual release. \u2047 The relative lack of PVOD content during COVID-19 at a time when much of the country was looking for any entertainment option in their home demonstrates that studios don't see a big market for PVOD. \u2047 Strong box-office numbers for Warner Bros. \u2047 Films released day and date to theaters and HBO Max without upcharge also bear this out. \u2047 While streaming services need content, it's hard to make the math work for PVOD or direct to SVOD without a theatrical release for major motion pictures. \u2047 Additionally, major exhibitors continue their negotiations with the studios on the length of the exclusive theatrical window. \u2047 It appears to be coalescing around 45 days, down from the prior 90 days. \u2047 From our perspective, there are positives. \u2047 Historically, over 90% of ticket sales occurred in the first 45 days. \u2047 So economically, the shift in the window is not that material. \u2047 With the reduced window and the need for studios, content providers and exhibitors to continue experimentation, we could see content from Netflix, Amazon and Apple shown theatrically before being moved to streaming services. \u2047 Just this week, Cinemark and Marcus both announced announcement -- both announced agreements with Netflix to show Army of the Dead in theaters for one week, starting on May 14 before it's available on Netflix on May 21. \u2047 This follows Cinemark and Netflix's partnering to show Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, the Midnight Sky and the Christmas Chronicles 2 theatrically. \u2047 The consumers' desire to return to see movies on the big screen is reflected in the surprisingly strong performance of King Kong versus Godzilla, Mortal Combat and Demon Slayer. \u2047 When theaters were allowed to reopen, box-office records were set in China, Japan and Australia. \u2047 Our tenants are coming up with new and better ways to enhance the customer experience from touchless ticketing and concession ordering to private screenings. \u2047 Going to the movie still remains a remarkable value for an out-of-home consumer experience. \u2047 Turning now to our other major customer groups. \u2047 Approximately 96% of our non theater operators are open. \u2047 Our seasonal businesses are closed in the normal course. \u2047 With increases in vaccinations and the fast approach of summer, we see continued strong performance in our drive-to value-oriented destinations. \u2047 We are pleased with the results from the ski season. \u2047 People demonstrated they still want to ski, particularly in drive-to destinations. \u2047 Across the portfolio, attendance was in line with three-year averages, and revenues were down only slightly, reflecting restrictions on food and beverage in many locations. \u2047 We continue to see strong performance across Eat & Play. \u2047 All of our TopGolf locations, including our recently acquired San Jose location, are open. \u2047 All four of our Andretti Karting locations are open, and we're delighted that our fifth in view for Georgia will open in May. \u2047 All of our gyms are open and attendance continues to increase. \u2047 We are seeing very strong pent-up demand across our attractions and cultural holdings. \u2047 We expect this trend to continue throughout the summer as vaccinations increase and restrictions are lifted. \u2047 The City Museum, Santa Monica Pier and our Titanic Museums are open. \u2047 We expect all of our amusement parks and water parks to open in 2021. \u2047 Seven are currently open. \u2047 Five have confirmed May opening dates, and we're awaiting dates for the final two, subject to state restrictions in California and Washington. \u2047 We are likewise seeing strong demand in our experiential lodging portfolio and expect the trend will continue throughout the summer as well. \u2047 Pete Beach, all of our experiential lodging assets are open. \u2047 Kartriteremains subject to New York State phased reopening plans for water parks, and we are working toward an opening in the summer of 2021. \u2047 We are completing a substantial renovation of the Bellwether, and it will fully reopen by mid-June. \u2047 Resorts World Catskills is open. \u2047 All of our early childhood education centers are open, and we are seeing a steady increase in demand monthly as COVID restrictions ease and parents return to work. \u2047 All of our private schools are open, utilizing a combination of in-person, online and hybrid instruction models. \u2047 Our primary capital recycling activity has been in the theater category. \u2047 In Q1, we sold one theater property and a vacant non-theater building for net proceeds of $13.7 million. \u2047 We're very pleased with our progress in disposing vacant theaters. \u2047 Since Q1 -- Q3 2020, we have sold three theaters. \u2047 And as I mentioned earlier, we have executed contracts for another six. \u2047 In Q4, we terminated all seven of our AMC transition leases and took back the properties. \u2047 In Q4, we sold one for an industrial use. \u2047 We have executed contracts for the remaining five. \u2047 We also have a former CMX theater, which was rejected in bankruptcy under contract. \u2047 These six projected sales are for industrial, multifamily, office, and theater reuse, and we anticipate closing on all six sales throughout 2021 and into 2022. \u2047 Finally, I want to update you on the status of our cash collections and deferral agreements. \u2047 Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our No. \u2047 1 priority was to work proactively and diligently with our customers to structure appropriate deferral and repayment agreements. \u2047 We tailored each deal to give them the right amount of breathing room to reopen efficiently and help ensure their long-term health, all while protecting and improving our position in rights as landlord. \u2047 We wanted to and have helped them through a period where they had significantly reduced or no cash flow, allowing them to ramp back to a stabilized cash flow. \u2047 Our agreements are generally structured with rent and mortgage payments, including deferred amounts, commencing and ramping up through 2021, and in some cases, after 2021. \u2047 Cash collections continue to improve in conjunction with reopenings. \u2047 Tenants and borrowers paid 72% of contractual cash revenue for the first quarter and 77% in April. \u2047 We're seeing results from these efforts, and I want to share two examples of this win-win approach. \u2047 First, as noted earlier in my remarks, we are delighted to have acquired the brand-new TopGolf San Jose, which opened on April 16, using a portion of their deferred rent as currency. \u2047 San Jose is TopGolf's second location in California. \u2047 It's an outstanding location in a compelling DMA. \u2047 The transaction reflects our long and valued partnership with TopGolf and our creative approach throughout the pandemic to work with our tenants to address difficult issues. \u2047 Second, as noted, the ski season was strong. \u2047 Early in the pandemic, before anyone knew what the ski season would look like, we worked with CamelBak to ensure they had sufficient cash to weather what we all feared could be a rough winter. \u2047 Because Ski season was strong, in April, CamelBak repaid its entire deferred balance six months early. \u2047 Again, this demonstrates our commitment to taking the long view of our customers' ability to perform informed by the underlying strength of our underwriting and real estate. \u2047 Finally, customers representing substantially all of our contractual cash revenue, which includes each of our top 20 customers, are either paying their contract rent or interest or have a deferral agreement in place. \u2047 In those deferral agreements, we have granted approximately 5% of permanent rent and interest payment reductions. \u2047 Mark will provide additional color on the revenue recognition and cash collection implications for the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Today, I will discuss our financial performance for the quarter, provide an update on our balance sheet and strong liquidity position and close with some estimated forward information. \u2047 I am pleased that I'll be briefer than I have been in the past"], "gold_summary": ["qtrly ffoaa per share $0.48.  \u2047  qtrly affo per share $0.52."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q1 earnings per share of $0.16.  \u2047  q1 earnings per share
