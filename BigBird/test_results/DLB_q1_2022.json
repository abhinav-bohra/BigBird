{"article": ["During today's call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. \u2047 As for the content of today's call, Kevin will start with a discussion of the business, and Robert will follow with a recap of Dolby's financial results and provide our second quarter and fiscal 2022 outlook. \u2047 It continues to be a dynamic environment. \u2047 While revenue and earnings per share finished within our range of guidance, both were impacted by a $6 million negative true-up for lower-than-estimated unit shipments in our foundational audio technologies. \u2047 As we discussed last quarter, we are seeing year-over-year declines for foundational audio coming off of tough comps, and now issues with the supply chain. \u2047 But over the long term, we expect foundational audio to track roughly in line with market demand for the consumer devices we serve. \u2047 At the same time, we see strength across Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and our imaging patents portfolio, and we remain confident in our ability to grow these revenues at a rate of over 35% this year. \u2047 We also see positive signs of momentum with Dolby.io. \u2047 All of this gives us confidence in the opportunity ahead. \u2047 Robert will take you through the details of the financials in just a moment. \u2047 I will start by covering our progress in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. \u2047 At CES last month, we saw our partnership with Samsung grow stronger as they announced the adoption of Dolby Atmos into their TVs for the first time. \u2047 Samsung has been showcasing Dolby Atmos across their soundbar, PC, and mobile products for some time, and we are excited that they have decided to offer their TV customers the most immersive audio experience with Dolby Atmos. \u2047 During LG's CES keynote, they highlighted their latest OLED TVs, the first to support Dolby Vision gaming at 4K -- in 4K at 120 hertz. \u2047 And Hisense debuted their first short-throw consumer laser projectors to include the combined Dolby experience. \u2047 We saw new soundbar products from Samsung and Hisense supporting Dolby Atmos and the latest TVs from Sony, Panasonic, and TCL, all featuring the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience. \u2047 Also during the quarter, Walmart's On and Best Buy's Pioneer TVs began supporting Dolby Vision, an important step toward addressing the mass market retailer brands and making Dolby experiences more widely available at all price points. \u2047 Beyond the living room, we also made progress this quarter in PC, mobile, and gaming. \u2047 In November, ASUS adopted Dolby Vision with the launch of their new two-in-one PC, marking their first device to include the combined experience. \u2047 And more recently, they announced that their latest gaming laptops will also feature Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. \u2047 Dell announced at CES that they will now support the combined Dolby experience across their latest Alienware gaming PC lineup, and they launched a new Alienware gaming headset with Dolby Atmos. \u2047 Lenovo previewed their newly designed ThinkPad laptops, which feature Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Voice, expanding the number of models that include our communications technology. \u2047 This quarter also brought new tablets from Lenovo and ASUS and smartphones from Xiaomi and Motorola, highlighting Dolby Technologies. \u2047 We are also making strides in sports content. \u2047 Just this week, Comcast announced that they will be broadcasting the 2022 Winter Olympics in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. \u2047 This major event adds to the growing list of sports coverage made available in Dolby. \u2047 And in the world of e-sports, the Honor of Kings Challenger Cup finals was available in Dolby Atmos on Tencent Video and Bilibili. \u2047 As we enable more Dolby experiences across music, gaming, and sports, we add to our value proposition for new and deeper adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across devices and end markets. \u2047 While CES was far from normal this year, what remain the same was the strong engagement from our partners and particularly in automotive. \u2047 This quarter, Neo highlighted that they will be adding Dolby Atmos into their ET5 model, expanding beyond the ET7 model they announced previously. \u2047 Consumers and artists alike continue to sing the praises of Dolby Atmos Music, with AMA's New Artist of the Year, Olivia Rodrigo, describing the experience as magical. \u2047 Two-thirds of the Top 100 billboard artists now have one or more tracks available in Dolby Atmos. \u2047 As we gain more prominence in the music space, we have more reasons for adoption across mobile, PC, and automotive. \u2047 Let me shift to cinema. \u2047 There are currently about 98% of Dolby Cinemas opened globally with six new sites launched during our fiscal Q1. \u2047 Even with the uncertainty of the pandemic, we saw ongoing recovery in the box office with titles like \"No Time to Die\" and \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\". \u2047 As moviegoers return to the cinema, we continue to see a preference toward premium experiences, and Dolby Cinema is the ultimate way to experience movies in the theater. \u2047 Let's talk about our developer platform, Dolby.io, where we are focused on enabling developers to create the most compelling experiences in target markets where we can offer the most differentiation, virtual live performances, online and hybrid events, social audio, premium education, gaming, and content production, which we estimate to represent a market opportunity of about $5 billion and growing. \u2047 We are excited about the experiences developers are building and the pace of new developer accounts accelerated this quarter. \u2047 This increased momentum is due in part to the interest we are seeing for our release of programmable spatial audio. \u2047 While we have been providing an automated spatial mix for some time, this highly requested feature allows developers to choose where to render real-time voices around the listener. \u2047 For example, we see developers building virtual concert experiences, virtual reality collaboration platforms, and virtual worlds in which listeners hear people from the location of the speaker or their avatar. \u2047 There has been so much demand customers were going into production on the beta ahead of our general availability release this week. \u2047 We also completed an acquisition this quarter. \u2047 With Millicast, developers can take the highly interactive experiences they build with Dolby.io and stream them to audiences of more than 60,000 people with ultra-low delay, a capability that is in demand in our focused verticals. \u2047 Millicast has a notable presence in content production with companies such as NBC, the NFL, and Disney and their expertise in the field makes them a great fit with Dolby.io. \u2047 With our unique experience in media and communications, coupled with the ease of self-service on our platform, we are able to expand our capabilities for developers to offer high-quality audio and visual interactions to much larger audiences. \u2047 To wrap up, while we are still operating in an uncertain economic environment, we continue to have success in growing the number of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision experiences to new devices and services. \u2047 There is much opportunity ahead of us as we enable new experiences through music, gaming, and live content. \u2047 And we are excited about bringing the Dolby magic to a broader range of experiences and interactions with the power of Dolby.io. \u2047 All of this gives us confidence in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth into the future. \u2047 And with that, I'd like to hand it over to Robert to take us through the financials. \u2047 Let's jump into the results for Q1. \u2047 Total revenue in the first quarter of $352 million was in the range we provided and included a negative true-up of about $6 million for Q4 2021 shipments reported that were below the original estimate. \u2047 The negative true-up was primarily in foundational revenue in our gaming and consumer electronics markets. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, first quarter revenue was about $38 million below last year's Q1 as we benefited from a $21 million true-up in Q1 2021, which is a $6 million negative true-up in Q1 2022, and the prior year also benefited from timing of revenues under contract. \u2047 These factors were partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and imaging patents within our fiscal Q1 of 2022. \u2047 Q1 revenue was comprised of $332.3 million in licensing and $19.3 million in products and services. \u2047 Let's get into the year-over-year trends in licensing revenue by end market. \u2047 Broadcast represented 37% of total licensing in fiscal Q1. \u2047 Broadcast revenues declined by about $18 million or 13% from the prior-year Q1 due to timing of revenue and a larger true-up in the prior year and lower recoveries. \u2047 These factors were partially offset by higher adoption of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision in TVs and new licenses in our imaging patent programs. \u2047 Mobile represented 23% of total licensing in fiscal Q1. \u2047 Mobile decreased by $31 million or 29% compared to Q1 of last year as our foundational audio revenues last year benefited from both high recoveries and timing of revenues under contract, partially offset by new imaging patent licenses. \u2047 We do see mobile growing for the full year, which I'll cover later. \u2047 Consumer electronics represented about 17% of total licensing in fiscal Q1. \u2047 On a year-over-year basis, Q1 CE licensing increased by approximately $6 million or 11%, driven by higher foundational audio revenues for DMAs and soundbars, as well as higher recoveries. \u2047 We also saw growth from higher adoption of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision across CE devices. \u2047 These favorable factors were partially offset by the large true-up in the prior year. \u2047 PC represented about 10% of total licensing in fiscal Q1. \u2047 Our Q1 PC revenues increased by 6% or $2 million compared to the prior-year Q1. \u2047 This increase was driven by new imaging patent licensees, along with higher Dolby Vision adoption. \u2047 Other markets represented about 13% of total licensing in fiscal Q1. \u2047 They were essentially flat year over year as lower revenues from gaming and lower foundational audio patent revenue were essentially offset by higher revenues from Dolby Cinema. \u2047 Beyond licensing, our products and services revenue in Q1 was $19 million, compared to $70 million in last year's Q1. \u2047 The year-over-year increase reflects ongoing improvements in the cinema industry globally. \u2047 Total gross margin in the first quarter was 90.7% on a GAAP basis and 91.3% on a non-GAAP basis. \u2047 Operating expenses in the first quarter on a GAAP basis were $228.3 million, compared to $189.8 million in Q1 of the prior year. \u2047 This increase was primarily caused by a gain of the sale of an asset in the prior year, higher marketing activations tied to Atmos Music and Dolby Live at Park MGM and the extra week of payroll in Q1 2022. \u2047 Operating expenses in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $195.1 million, compared to $167.1 million in the prior year. \u2047 Operating expenses were in line with our guidance for Q1. \u2047 Operating income in the first quarter was $90.6 million on a GAAP basis or 25.8% of revenue, compared to $164.7 million or 42.3% of revenue in Q1 of last year. \u2047 Operating income in the first quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $126 million or 35.8% of revenue, compared to $189.7 million or 48% of revenue in Q1 last year. \u2047 The income tax rate in Q1 was 13% on a GAAP basis and 18% on a non-GAAP basis. \u2047 Our GAAP rate benefited primarily from a discrete adjustment related to stock-based compensation. \u2047 Net income on a GAAP basis in the first quarter was $80 million or $0.77 per share per diluted share compared to $135.2 million or $1.30 per diluted share in last year's Q1. \u2047 Net income on a non-GAAP basis in the first quarter was $104.5 million or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $153.3 million, or $1.48 per diluted share in Q1 of last year. \u2047 During the first quarter, we generated $32 million in cash from operations, compared to $82 million generated in last year's fiscal Q1. \u2047 We ended the first quarter with about $1.26 billion in cash and investments. \u2047 During the first quarter, we bought back about 400,000 shares of our common stock at the end of the quarter with $256 million of stock repurchase authorization available. \u2047 As is typically the case, our window for repurchases in fiscal Q1 were shorter due to the timing of release of our year-end results. \u2047 In February, our board authorized an additional $250 million of stock buyback, bringing our total authorization to approximately $506 million to enable expansion of our share buyback program. \u2047 We also announced today a cash dividend of $0.25 per share. \u2047 The dividend will be payable on February 23, 2022, to shareholders of record on February 16, 2022. \u2047 Shifting to the remainder of the fiscal year. \u2047 There continues to be uncertainty given the ongoing implications of the pandemic, particularly as it relates to trends in unit shipments that are impacted by supply chain issues and inflation and consumer spending behavior. \u2047 All of these variables make it more difficult to gather consistent and reliable data. \u2047 We are also keeping an eye on transaction cycle times, particularly in our recovery efforts, given the -- given the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the pandemic. \u2047 With that, let me take you through the outlook for Q2 and the full year. \u2047 For Q2, we see total revenues ranging from $315 million to $345 million. \u2047 Within that, licensing revenues could range from $300 million to $325 million. \u2047 The revenue increase from last year's Q2 is anticipated to be driven by -- primarily by higher broadcast and PC revenues from Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. \u2047 The other markets category is also expected to be up year over year, assuming continued improved attendance at our Dolby Cinemas. \u2047 Mobile is anticipated to be relatively flat to prior year as higher revenue from Atmos and Vision is essentially offset by lower foundational audio revenue. \u2047 Q2 products and services revenue could range from $15 million to $20 million. \u2047 Let me move on to the rest of the P&L outlook for Q2. \u2047 Q2 gross margin on a GAAP basis is expected to be 89%, plus or minus, and the non-GAAP gross margin is estimated to be about 90%, plus or minus. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q1 non-gaap earnings per share of $1.01.  \u2047  q1 non-gaap earnings per
