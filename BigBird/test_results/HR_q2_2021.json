{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Todd Meredith, Bethany Mancini, Rob Hull and Kris Douglas. \u2047 These risks are more specifically discussed in a Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2020. \u2047 Today, I'll discuss current healthcare utilization trends, our second-quarter results and our external growth momentum. \u2047 And I'll describe how our strategy delivers steady growth quarter after quarter. \u2047 And I'll close by touching on a few of our internal initiatives. \u2047 First, we're pleased to see that most providers are back to normal in terms of utilization. \u2047 Healthcare providers have proven their ability to operate throughout the pandemic. \u2047 Patients have returned to their doctors and we're hearing from our tenants that outpatient procedures are back to or above pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 Even more encouraging, physicians and health systems are telling us their businesses are growing and they need more space to meet demand. \u2047 This underscores our view that healthcare utilization is poised to continue growing on a consistent annual basis propelled by aging demographics. \u2047 Turning to our results; we reported same-store NOI growth of 2.9% for the second-quarter, which puts us back in line with our historical average of about 3%. \u2047 Looking ahead, we're well-positioned to sustain these steady levels of internal growth. \u2047 We continue to see the benefits of operating in dense markets with high barriers to entry. \u2047 This insulates us from new supply and facilitates steady rent growth. \u2047 As rents rise, we're well-positioned to benefit from shorter lease terms which gives us the ability to increase rents more often. \u2047 With respect to external growth, we're truly firing on all cylinders. \u2047 Year-to-date, we've acquired 21 properties for over $400 million. \u2047 We're well on our way to meet or exceed our 2020 acquisition volume, which was our best year ever. \u2047 And we're confident in our ability to continue this momentum. \u2047 Today we're seeing aggregators sell portfolios comprised of lower quality, often isolated assets at premium cap rates. \u2047 This is driving relative cap rate compression, especially on portfolios. \u2047 What makes us different is that we're sourcing individual quality assets at attractive prices in better markets and building on our strategic clusters. \u2047 Our ability to smoothly integrate properties into our existing operations reflects the value of our platform. \u2047 Another source of value creation is our development pipeline, which includes over $1 billion of embedded growth opportunities. \u2047 As an example, here in Nashville, we're starting an on-campus redevelopment project involving a property we've owned for over 15 years. \u2047 Sites of the existing building, we're constructing a larger lead-certified medical office building at the center of the Ascension St. Thomas Midtown campus. \u2047 This strengthens our relationship with St. Thomas and builds on our cluster of nearly 1 million square feet in Nashville. \u2047 Our strategy is straightforward; we focus on markets with strong demographic trends and partner with leading health systems. \u2047 In today's competitive environment, our local market knowledge and industry relationships help us source new investments and attract new tenants. \u2047 Our cluster strategy amplifies these benefits, and we gained scale and efficiency as we lease and manage more and more properties in close proximity. \u2047 In terms of location, we target properties on and adjacent to campus complemented with nearby off-campus facilities where we can drive incremental returns. \u2047 We're able to further enhance our yields by engaging in targeted development projects in utilizing our joint venture partnership which widens our opportunity set. \u2047 The strategy has paid off in contrast to many other REITs whose results were hard hit during the volatility of the last 18 months, we've delivered growth in FFO per share each quarter. \u2047 Over the long term, our strategy creates value for shareholders through the steady compounding of cash flows. \u2047 Before I hand the call over to Bethany, let me take a few moments to highlight some recent initiatives. \u2047 We believe the depth and breadth of our team as well as the long tenure of our leadership is the driver of our success. \u2047 I'm pleased to announce that we recently promoted Julie Wilson to Executive Vice President of Operations. \u2047 Julie has been with us for over 20 years and this promotion highlights her leadership and the growth of our platform in that time period. \u2047 Julie now has oversight of our portfolio operations, as well as marketing, technology and ESG groups. \u2047 And with respect to ESG, we continue to dedicate resources to this important effort. \u2047 Our ESG program will now be led full-time by Carla Baca. \u2047 This year, we completed our second gross survey[Phonetic] and later this year, we'll release our third Corporate Responsibility Report. \u2047 Health systems are reporting strong momentum in elective care and patient utilization across the Board. \u2047 Performance was better than expected in the second quarter for the public hospital companies. \u2047 One of the main drivers for their recovery and growth outlook is outpatient volume. \u2047 Physicians have been able to ramp up patient visits in surgeries more quickly than hospitals in most markets. \u2047 MG&A reported positive average growth in physician compensation for 2020, a sign of strength amid the shutdown of routine care and elective surgeries. \u2047 Ambulatory outpatient settings have also experienced strong employment growth throughout the recovery. \u2047 In 2021 physician offices continue to be a bright spot for job gains in the healthcare sector, which bodes well for medical office space demand. \u2047 Physicians are expanding into larger practice groups to lower administrative costs, increase market share and utilize external capital to fund growth. \u2047 Healthcare providers are also benefiting from a public health policy environment that continues to support positive reimbursements and expanded health insurance coverage. \u2047 More than 2 million people gain insurance through ACA exchange marketplaces during a special enrollment period after Congress increased the availability of subsidies last year. \u2047 Congress is focused now on extending the two-year expansion of ACA subsidies and exchange eligibility in the upcoming budget and infrastructure bill. \u2047 The legislative agenda should provide a stable backdrop for providers as they meet greater patient demand and pursue growth initiatives. \u2047 On the regulatory side, CMS is pursuing several avenues to lower healthcare costs. \u2047 President Biden issued an executive order in July mandating the FTC to increase scrutiny of hospital consolidation and anti-competitive practices among providers. \u2047 CMS also continues to implement regulations on price transparency, requiring a list of hospitals' prices to be published of their most common services. \u2047 It remains to be seen if consumer-friendly disclosures will change patient behavior when choosing their care. \u2047 But these efforts to lower cost growth and ensure competition should accelerate incentives for healthcare delivery in outpatient settings. \u2047 The correlation of health policy, hospital regulation and outpatient trends is continuing to advance the nation's demand for medical office facilities. \u2047 The opportunities that lie ahead position HR's portfolio and external growth prospects well within the rising tide of healthcare services. \u2047 Investor demand for MOBs has accelerated, highlighted by the resilience of the asset class over the last 18 months. \u2047 As a result, cap rates have continued to trend lower. \u2047 We have also seen an uptick in the number of portfolios in the market as MOB aggregators seek to capitalize on this demand in attractive pricing. \u2047 In our view, most of these portfolios of disparate assets are richly priced at 50 to 100 basis points over similar quality individual properties. \u2047 In contrast, our strategy is to curate a high-quality portfolio clustered in dense, growing markets by targeting the properties we won. \u2047 We have been busy on the acquisition front. \u2047 We closed on 14 buildings for $336 million since the end of March. \u2047 These acquisitions had a blended initial cap rate of 5.2% with another 30 basis points of embedded upside through lease-up. \u2047 Three-quarters of these acquisitions are located directly on campus and all are located in existing markets. \u2047 The average 10-mile population density around these assets is over 900,000 and the projected growth of 5.4% is nearly double the US average. \u2047 These assets also illustrate our cluster strategy and the depth of our existing health system relationships. \u2047 As an example, we acquired five buildings associated with Centura Health, a leading system in Colorado, that we have worked with for over a decade. \u2047 We now have over 1 million square feet with Centura and expect to add more over time. \u2047 Year-to-date; we have completed $412 million of acquisitions, adding 1.1 million square feet to our portfolio. \u2047 Given the strength of our activity year-to-date and a robust pipeline, we are raising our acquisitions guidance. \u2047 The increased range is now $500 million to $600 million. \u2047 In this competitive environment, we are also taking advantage of the strong pricing to recycle capital into investments with better long-term growth prospects. \u2047 We have closed on approximately $115 million of sales year-to-date. \u2047 We are raising our disposition guidance to $115 million to $175 million for the year. \u2047 In our development pipeline, we see increased momentum as hospitals expand their outpatient programs. \u2047 In Nashville, we kicked off a development that is highly integrated with Ascension St. Thomas Midtown Hospital. \u2047 We're building a 106,000 square foot LEED-certified MOB with a subterranean parking garage. \u2047 And it will also include a new shared front entrance with a women's services tower of this leading hospital. \u2047 Our budget is $44 million and construction will take approximately two years. \u2047 At completion, we will have almost 450,000 square feet on this campus and nearly 1 million in the dense healthcare corridor of Nashville. \u2047 What's important is developments like these strengthen our provider relationships and our attractive avenue to create value. \u2047 We target development yields of 100 to 200 basis points above comparable stabilized assets. \u2047 In closing, our focus on relationships in clusters means that the investments we are making today will lead to more investments tomorrow. \u2047 With our increased acquisitions guidance, we are on pace to deliver robust accretive net investment activity for the year. \u2047 Our second quarter results reflect the steady growth of our MOB-focused business. \u2047 Normalized FFO per share was $0.43, up $0.01 from a year ago. \u2047 This is driven from the contribution of the $500 billion[Phonetic] and net acquisitions completed over the past 12 months along with meaningful same-store growth. \u2047 Second quarter same-store NOI increased 2.9%, which is in line with our long-term outlook. \u2047 Trailing 12 months same-store NOI growth was 2.3%, up from 2% in the first quarter. \u2047 The year-over-year second quarter NOI growth benefited from a few key items. \u2047 First, the 4.9% increase in expenses appears to be above normal. \u2047 However, keep in mind, we're coming off of quarantine-impacted lows from last year. \u2047 On a compound annual growth rate basis from second quarter 2019, expenses grew just under 1%. \u2047 This is below our long-term expectation of 2% to 2.5%. \u2047 Second, parking income is essentially back to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 The rebound generated year-over-year growth of 45% in parking income for the quarter. \u2047 Finally, the $700,000 reserve for COVID rent deferrals booked in second quarter last year is boosting year-over-year -- the year-over-year comparison. \u2047 As a reminder, we reversed the majority of the reserves in the third and fourth quarter of 2020, as the deferrals were repaid. \u2047 When you're updating your models, please keep in mind that this reversal together with normalizing expenses will dampen year-over-year growth in the next two quarters. \u2047 But the real takeaway is the consistent embedded growth in our portfolio. \u2047 The portfolio average in-place contractual rent increase is approaching 2.9%. \u2047 For our second quarter lease renewals, the average cash leasing spread was 2.8%. \u2047 Year-to-date, cash leasing spreads have averaged 3.8%, which is at the high end of our 3% to 4% target range. \u2047 Releases commencing in the second quarter, our average future contractual increase is 3.1%, 20 basis points higher than our in-place average. \u2047 This reflects our pricing power derived from our quality portfolio and attractive markets. \u2047 With respect to occupancy, we are still catching up from last summer. \u2047 And like most in the real estate sector, we are working through the impact of delays and permitting and construction. \u2047 On average, we have seen build-out timelines increased by approximately 30%. \u2047 In some high-growth markets like Dallas, permitting timelines have more than doubled. \u2047 As a result, our same-store average occupancy was down 50 basis points year-over-year. \u2047 While these delays may persist in the short run, we are optimistic about our ability to drive improvements in occupancy moving into next year. \u2047 Tours and interests are strong across our portfolio as physicians seek space for their expansions. \u2047 And over the long term, the projected growth in outpatient care will drive the need for more medical office real estate. \u2047 Regarding our balance sheet and liquidity, net debt to EBITDA was 5.1 times, down from 5.3 times in the first quarter. \u2047 During the second quarter, we funded $223 million of investments with $66 million of dispositions, $38 million from our joint venture partner as well as the settlement of $160 million of forward equity contracts. \u2047 As we look ahead, we have ample liquidity to fund our growing pipeline of acquisitions. \u2047 We have $150 million of forward equity contracts remaining to be settled in addition to cash and other liquidity sources. \u2047 The year-to-date FAD payout ratio is 85% with moderate maintenance capex in the first half of the year. \u2047 We expect maintenance capex to increase as we move to the back half, but the payout ratio to remain below 90% for the year. \u2047 The events of the past 18 months more than proved the resilience of our portfolio. \u2047 We believe the strong underlying demand drivers for outpatient care will help drive internal and external growth. \u2047 These tailwinds when combined with low leverage and access to multiple sources of capital will continue to drive compounding per share growth. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["q2 adjusted ffo per share $0.43.  \u2047  qtrly normalized ffo per share totaled $0.43."], "pred_summary": ["compname posts
