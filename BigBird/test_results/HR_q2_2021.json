{"article": ["This is Debbie Young, director of investor relations for SCI. \u2047 With that out of the way, let me pass it on now to our chairman and CEO, Tom Ryan. \u2047 We hope you and your families are staying safe and healthy. \u2047 Then I'll offer some commentary on our 2021 outlook, with the understanding that there remains substantial uncertainty surrounding these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could change guidance significantly. \u2047 However, before I begin, I would like to say a few words about this past year. \u2047 2020 has certainly been one of the most uncertain and challenging periods that any of us can remember. \u2047 As I reflect back on the last 10 months, I can say with certainty that our results are a testament to our team's incredible hard work and to the resilience of our underlying business. \u2047 I'm extremely proud of our entire SCI team for going above and beyond the call of duty in 2020. \u2047 In this difficult period, we stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best, helping our client families gain closure and healing through the process of grieving, remembrance and celebration. \u2047 The health, safety, and well-being of our SCI family was a top priority. \u2047 And not only were we able to avoid any layoffs, mandatory furloughs or reductions in pay as a result of the impact of COVID-19, we were able to recognize the incredible efforts of our frontline associates with hero bonuses and provide special bonuses for every associate that does not participate in our annual incentive plan. \u2047 In 2020, our services were needed more than ever, and I am proud that we were able to perform significantly increased number of services without any disruptions to our business, which highlights the power of our scale. \u2047 One thing that became clear throughout 2020 is that our fundamental business has not changed. \u2047 We did not see a wholesale shift in the consumer preferences, and our cremation remains stable. \u2047 Although we were greatly restricted in our ability to have large gatherings in 2020, we heard loud and clear from our consumers that they still have a desire to memorialize and to celebrate the lives of their loved ones. \u2047 Virtual arrangements, live streaming of services, outdoor services, drive-through visitations, radio transmitted graveside services, and many more unique memorialization and celebration of life ideas are now a normal part of what we do. \u2047 The success and acceleration of these enhanced service offerings have highlighted the importance of innovation in our industry. \u2047 We will continue to invest in technologies that enhance how we interact with consumers digitally, providing a better customer experience -- contact to the arrangement conference and beyond while also enhancing efficiencies in our operations. \u2047 As the year unfolded, actions we took in response to in-person meetings limitations yielded noncustomer-facing efficiencies. \u2047 We more effectively utilize our labor force using the virtual training, our customer relationship management system and other technology tools instead of incurring travel-related costs. \u2047 We also drove down our lead cost per sale by accelerating the growth of digital leads and making significant improvements to our direct mill program to drive record growth. \u2047 All of the many learnings from this year will make us a better company going forward. \u2047 As a result, we're positioned to enter the post pandemic world as a more agile and efficient company. \u2047 Now let's shift and provide you with some color about the core. \u2047 experienced in late November and December. \u2047 Just to give you a little color on the cadence of the quarter, our same-store funeral volumes were up 7% in October, then grew to 13% in November and an unprecedented 31% in December, which is the highest monthly growth rate we experienced all year. \u2047 And as a result of this surge late in the quarter, we finished the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.13 compared to $0.60 in the prior year, well above the range we provided to you in October. \u2047 Both funeral and cemetery segments had margin improvement of over 600 basis points, driven by double-digit top line percentage growth applied against a more efficient cost structure. \u2047 We also benefited from a lower share count and a lower tax rate. \u2047 Let's now take a look at funeral operations in the quarter. \u2047 Total comparable funeral revenues grew approximately $49 million or 10% during the quarter. \u2047 Both core and nonfuneral home channels performed very well and were slightly offset by lower general agency revenues caused by a decline in insurance funded preneed funeral sales production. \u2047 Core revenues grew $53 million, driven by a 17% increase in the number of cases, partially offset by a 3.4% decline in the funeral sales average. \u2047 The predominant reason for the increase in services performed was due to the direct impact of COVID-19, and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in non-COVID related deaths such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, drug overdose and suicide, perhaps a consequence of a lack of access to healthcare during 2020. \u2047 Words cannot convey the level of our appreciation and respect I have for our frontline team. \u2047 The tremendous care you provided record numbers of our client families during such a stressful time can only be described as heroic. \u2047 The decline in the funeral sales average of 3.4% was due to the local jurisdictions reimposing restrictions on gatherings, given the surge in deaths of November and December. \u2047 This resulted in a decline in a number of cases with the service. \u2047 The cremation mix shift was a moderate 120 basis points and had a minimal impact on the quarter-over-quarter funeral average decline. \u2047 Preneed funeral sales production for the quarter was down 1.6% versus the prior year, which is just a significant improvement of our results posted in earlier quarters this year. \u2047 While we saw record growth in production from our digital and direct mail leads, we continued to be hampered by a decline in preplanning seminars due to local restrictions and consumer reluctance on in-person gatherings in restaurants. \u2047 From a profit perspective, funeral gross profit increase of $45 million, and the gross profit percentage increased 640 basis points to 27.5%, realizing a 92% incremental margin on our revenue growth. \u2047 Growth in our high incremental margin core business more than offset slight declines in our lower-margin revenue streams. \u2047 We also continue to benefit by the efficient management of labor hours with fewer and smaller services as well as the reductions in noncustomer-facing costs and certain marketing and promotional expenses. \u2047 Now shifting to cemetery. \u2047 Comparable cemetery revenue increased $64 million or 18% in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Atneed cemetery revenue accounted for $25 million of the growth, driven by more burials performed due to some effects of COVID-19. \u2047 Recognized preneed revenues accounted for $35 million of growth, mainly due to higher preneed cemetery sales production during the quarter. \u2047 Preneed cemetery sales production grew $40 million or 16% in the fourth quarter, driven by increased lead sources associated with the higher atneed services and burials performed. \u2047 The preponderance of the growth, $25 million or about 60%, was from a 12% increase in velocity with a number of contracts sold. \u2047 The remaining growth of about $15 million was primarily due to large sales activity. \u2047 We continue to see this more productive and efficient sales force with better utilization of our customer relationship management system and improved conversion rates from our direct mail and digital lead campaigns. \u2047 Consumer reception to having a preplanning discussion remains very high. \u2047 I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous efforts of our sales team. \u2047 For the full year 2020, they wrote more than $1 billion in cemetery preneed sales production. \u2047 This is our new company record, so hats off to the entire sales organization. \u2047 Cemetery gross profits in the quarter grew by approximately $49 million, and the gross profit percentage increased 680 basis points to 39%. \u2047 Growth in revenues and strategic cost reductions combined to drive margins beyond normalized incremental levels. \u2047 For the full year 2020, we reported an adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, a 53% increase over 2019 in a one-of-a-kind year. \u2047 Obviously, the speed and efficacy of the vaccine rollout could have a significant impact on the spread of the virus, hospitalizations and, ultimately, on the number of deaths. \u2047 This, combined with the willingness of the consumer to transact on a preneed basis may have a material effect on our 2021 results. \u2047 There is no doubt that in 2020, we serviced deaths that were pulled forward from a future year. \u2047 While we know that the timing of the pull forward is impossible to accurately predict, we have developed models are based on data from the IHME and the CBC, which incorporate historical trends and current COVID-related deaths by age group as well as by comorbidity factors in determining what future years are impacted by accelerated deaths and by how much. \u2047 Based on all these assumptions, we also believe adjusted earnings per share in 2021 will likely range between $2.50 and $2.90 per share. \u2047 We have provided a wider than normal range based on the uncertainties surrounding the impact of COVID-19. \u2047 Let's take a deeper dive into our assumptions for the 2021 earnings per share guidance. \u2047 We are modeling funeral volume to be down versus 2020, but mid single-digit percentage is higher than the 2019 levels due to the expected impact on funeral volumes in the first few months of 2021 associated with COVID-19. \u2047 We anticipate double-digit year-over-year percentage increases through March. \u2047 Then while we expect the continued impact from COVID-19 deaths, we predict comparable volumes to trend lower for the rest of the year as compared to the very active final nine months of 2020. \u2047 We expect the funeral average to be down low single-digit percentages in January and February and begin to see favorable trends as we compare back to the early months of the COVID outbreak in 2020. \u2047 While we anticipate growth year over year, we still believe we will struggle to get back to 2019 levels as we now believe that many people will continue to be reluctant to gather in large groups. \u2047 We expect preneed funeral sales production to begin to rebound in the back half of the year and for the full year to grow in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range. \u2047 Cemetery atneed revenues should see significant year-over-year growth in the first quarter, followed by a comparable decline in the last three quarters as we face a significant hurdle from the 2020 results. \u2047 For this year, we expect cemetery atneed revenue to be down versus 2020 but still show significant growth over 2019 pre-COVID levels. \u2047 Cemetery preneed sales production grew an unprecedented rate in the back half of 2020, and we believe that momentum will carry over into the first half of 2021. \u2047 We expect double-digit percentage growth for the first four months of the year before confronting challenging year-over-year comparisons beginning in May. \u2047 For the full year, we anticipate preneed cemetery sales production are to be down in the mid single-digit percentage range versus 2020 but still be delivering solid growth as compared to our 2019 levels. \u2047 So in closing, in spite of experiencing the most challenging environment, our team continued to deliver. \u2047 We rose to meet challenges never faced by our company before, and you have been an extraordinary example of commitment, professionalism and agility. \u2047 It's an honor to work with such great people. \u2047 As we look ahead, I'm extremely optimistic about our future. \u2047 While we do not anticipate the impact from COVID to completely go away, it is our belief that we should see a more muted effect on our results for 2022. \u2047 Therefore, we expect a decline in case volume and atneed cemetery revenues and, therefore, on the associated earnings and cash flow from the pull-forward effects of 2020 and 2021. \u2047 However, this knowledge that we gained from this awful COVID experience is anticipated to produce a more competitive and profitable operating platform in the years to come. \u2047 Therefore, we predict an impressive earnings-per-share growth for 2023 approaching $3 per share, resulting from a combination of enhanced market share and a leaner infrastructure, leveraging technology and a more efficient sales structure. \u2047 As the pull forward impact wanes and the baby boomers begin to enter their late 70s, we expect a further acceleration of earnings growth. \u2047 With our eyes on the longer term, we are now also continuing to invest in technology and new service offerings that allow us to remain relevant with our consumers, enhance digital clients experience and more efficiently and effectively serve our customers. \u2047 And like I've done many times over the past few quarters, I'm going to start by providing you with an update on the strength of our financial position that has supported us through these very volatile times. \u2047 I will then move on to address our cash flow results during the fourth quarter as well as the full year of 2020, followed by capital deployment activities for the year. \u2047 And then I'll end by providing some details of our outlook for 2021. \u2047 But I think more importantly than any of that, before we begin, when we are reporting our 2019 earnings almost exactly a year ago today, I don't think any of us could have anticipated what we would be facing in 2020. \u2047 During the year, our frontline associates helped our communities deal with this rapidly moving virus with unparalleled poise and dignity, particularly earlier on in the year when there was more speculation than there were facts available about coronavirus. \u2047 But even to this day, teams across our network are coming together and sacrificing their personal time, being away from home, all to support their colleagues and their broader communities as well who are managing in current COVID hotspots. \u2047 Now I'll shift to the financial update. \u2047 So while we entered the pandemic, anchored by a strong financial position and a favorable debt profile, we continue to be very well positioned with a significant amount of liquidity of roughly $670 million at the end of the year, consisting approximately $230 million of cash on hand plus $440 million available on our long-term bank credit facility. \u2047 On the higher EBITDA resulting from the strong Q4 results we're talking about today, our leverage remains low at 3.19x at the end of the year. \u2047 And as we look beyond the impacts of this pandemic, we still intend to manage leverage in a range of 3.5 to four times net debt to EBITDA. \u2047 So let's move to cash flow, which has been resilient for us throughout 2020. \u2047 Cash flow in the fourth quarter marked a much stronger-than-expected finish to the year, supported by the earnings outperformance that Tom just mentioned, associated with the surge of COVID-related deaths particularly in late November and in December. \u2047 We generated operating cash flow of $245 million during the quarter, representing an increase of $88 million or 56% over the prior year. \u2047 This increase is primarily related to the growth in cash earnings in the quarter as well as the decrease in cash interest"], "gold_summary": ["service corporation international q4 adj shr $1.13.  \u2047  q4 adjusted
