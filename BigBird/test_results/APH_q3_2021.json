{"article": ["This is Craig Lampo Amphenol's CFO, and I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO. \u2047 I will provide some financial commentary. \u2047 And then, Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends, and then we will take questions. \u2047 The company closed the third quarter with record sales of $2,818,000,000 and GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.67 and $0.65 respectively. \u2047 Sales were up 21% in U.S. dollars, 20% in local currencies and 13% organically compared to the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Sequentially, sales were up 6% in U.S. dollars, in local currencies and organically. \u2047 Orders for the quarter were $3,016,000,000, which was up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2020 and down 3% sequentially, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of 1.07 to 1. \u2047 Breaking down sales into our two segments, the Interconnect segment which comprised 96% of sales was up 21% in U.S. dollars, and 20% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Our Cable segment which comprised 4% of our sales was up 18% in U.S. dollars and 17% in local currencies compared to the third quarter of last year. \u2047 Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes. \u2047 Operating income was $571 million in the third quarter. \u2047 Operating margin was 20.3%, which decreased by 20 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2020, but increased by 30 basis points sequentially when compared to the second quarter 2021 adjusted operating margin. \u2047 The year-over-year decline in operating margin was primarily driven by the impact of the more challenging commodity and supply chain environment in 2021, together with the slight margin dilution of recent acquisitions, including MTS which are currently operating at a lower operating margin than the company average. \u2047 The sequential increase in operating margin compared to the second quarter -- adjusted operating margin was driven by normal conversion on the increased sales levels. \u2047 From a segment standpoint, in the Interconnect segment margins were 22.4% in the third quarter of 2021 which was equal to the third quarter of 2020, an increase from 22% in the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 In the Cable segment margins were 3.8%, which decreased from 10.7% of third quarter of 2021, and 6.1% in the second quarter of 2021. \u2047 Our margins in the cable segment continue to be particularly impacted by the ongoing and sudden increase in commodity and logistics costs, which have not yet been offset by pricing actions. \u2047 Given the dynamic economic environment, we are very proud of the company's performance. \u2047 Our team's ability to effectively manage many challenges is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the company's entrepreneurial management team, which continues to foster a high performance action oriented culture. \u2047 The company's GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of -- was 22.2%, which compared to 22.1% in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 24.5% in the third quarter of both 2021 and 2020. \u2047 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.67, an increase of 20% compared to $0.56 in the prior year period. \u2047 And adjusted diluted earnings per share was a record $0.65, an increase of 18% compared to $0.55 in the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $328 million or 81% of adjusted net income. \u2047 Net of capital spending, our free cash flow was $238 million or 59% of adjusted net income. \u2047 Cash flow in the quarter was a bit lower than we would typically expect primarily due to the higher-than-typical increase in inventory levels driven by the continued -- challenging supply chain environment. \u2047 From a working capital standpoint, inventory days, days sales outstanding and payable days were 91, 70 and 61 days, respectively. \u2047 While days sales and payable days were both within our normal range inventory days at the quarter end were elevated for the reasons just mentioned, as well as the impact of recent acquisitions which have inventory days that are currently significantly above the company average. \u2047 During the quarter, the Company repurchased 2.3 million shares of companies -- of common stock for approximately $171 million at an average price of approximately $73. \u2047 And at the end of the quarter, total debt was $5.2 billion and net debt was $3.9 billion. \u2047 Total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, which included cash and short-term investments on hand of $1.3 billion plus availability under our existing credit facilities. \u2047 Third quarter 2021 GAAP EBITDA was $686 million and our net leverage ratio was 1.6 times. \u2047 As previously discussed, due to the pending sale of the MTS Test & Simulation business, that business is being reported as a discontinued operation and therefore it's expected results are excluded from our Q4 guidance. \u2047 In addition, the company will incur certain additional cash, tax and other acquisition-related cost upon the divestiture of the Test & Simulation business, which is not included in income from continuing operations. \u2047 As Craig mentioned, I'm going to highlight some of our achievements here in the third quarter. \u2047 I will discuss the trends and our progress across our served markets. \u2047 As Craig went over, our results in the third quarter were substantially better than we had expected coming into the quarter. \u2047 We exceeded the high end of our guidance in sales as well as an adjusted diluted earnings per share. \u2047 Our sales grew a very strong 21% in U.S. dollars in 20% in local currencies, reaching a new record $2,818,000,000. \u2047 On an organic basis, our sales increased by 13% with broad-based growth across most of our served markets as well as contributions from the company's acquisition program. \u2047 Orders in the quarter were robust again, more than $3 billion, $3,016,000,000, and this represented another strong book-to-bill of 1.07 to 1. \u2047 Now despite the many operational challenges that we have continued to face throughout the quarter, including continued cost increases related to commodities, supply chain and other logistics pressures, we were very pleased to deliver robust operating margins of 20.3% in the quarter and as Craig detailed, that was a 30 basis point sequential improvement. \u2047 Our EPS, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew strongly from prior year, increasing by 18% to a new record $0.65, and that's just an excellent reflection, once again, of our organization's continued strong execution. \u2047 The company generated operating and free cash flow of $328 million and $238 million in the third quarter and we're very pleased that the Board of Directors just approved yesterday, an increase in our dividend of 38% effective in January of next year. \u2047 Coming out of this quarter, I'm just extremely proud of our team around the world. \u2047 These results once again reflect the discipline as well as the agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well amid the very dynamic and challenging environment. \u2047 Now turning to our trends and progress across our served markets, we're very pleased that the company's broad and balanced end-market diversification continues to create value for Amphenol. \u2047 Very importantly our diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end-markets while also at the same time exposing us to leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry. \u2047 And these are both important benefits, especially amid such a dynamic market environment. \u2047 Turning first to the Military market, this market represented 10% of our sales in the third quarter. \u2047 Sales grew by 7% from prior year and declined by 4% organically, which was a little bit lower than our expectations heading into the quarter. \u2047 On an organic basis growth in ordinance, airframe and space-related products was more than offset by moderations of our sales of products that are used in vehicle, naval and communications applications. \u2047 Sequentially sales declined by about 3%. \u2047 Looking into the fourth quarter, we now expect to see sequential sales increase. \u2047 And for the full year 2021, this would imply a mid-teens increase in sales from last year's levels. \u2047 We continue to be excited by the strength of Amphenol's position in the military market as defense customers around the world continue to adopt next generation technologies at an increasing pace. \u2047 Our industry-leading breadth of high technology Interconnect and Sensor products positions the company strongly across essentially all major defense programs, and this gives us confidence for our long-term performance. \u2047 The commercial aerospace market represented 2% of our sales in the quarter. \u2047 Sales were flat compared to prior year, and declined by about 19% organically as the benefit of our recent acquisitions was offset by continued declines in demand from aircraft manufacturers. \u2047 As we expected coming into the quarter, our sales declined by about 3% sequentially. \u2047 Looking into the fourth quarter, we are happy that -- to now expect a mid-teens increase in sales compared to these levels, and for the full year 2021, this would imply roughly 10% sales decline compared to last year, a clear reflection of the pandemic related headwinds that have impacted the travel industry and thus the commercial aircraft market during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2047 Regardless of this challenging environment so far, our team working in the commercial aerospace market remains committed to leveraging the company's strong Interconnect and Sensor technology position across a wide array of airplane, platforms and next generation systems, integrated into those aircraft. \u2047 As personal and business travel continues to recover from the pandemic impacted lows, we do look forward to benefiting as jet manufacturers expand their production and in turn expand their procurement of our components. \u2047 The industrial market represented 26% of our sales in the quarter. \u2047 Sales increased by a very strong 44% in U.S. dollars and 24% organically. \u2047 This excellent growth was broad based across most segments of the worldwide industrial market, including in particular the battery and heavy electric vehicle, factory automation, oil and gas, rail mass transit, heavy equipment, alternative energy and instrumentation segments, together with the contributions from our recent acquisitions. \u2047 On a sequential basis, sales increased by 4% from the second quarter, which was much better than our expectations coming into the quarter. \u2047 Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect sales to moderate from these levels, but for the full year 2021, we expect sales to increase more than 40% from prior year, a very strong performance. \u2047 I remain extremely proud of our global team working in the industrial market. \u2047 Our long-term strategy to expand our high technology Interconnect, Antenna and Sensor, offering both organically and through complementary acquisitions has positioned the company to capitalize on the many revolutions that are occurring across the industrial electronics market. \u2047 We look forward to realizing the benefits of the strategy for many years to come. \u2047 The automotive market represented 19% of our sales in the quarter and despite the widely reported challenges across the automotive market, our sales actually came in higher than expectations in the quarter growing a strong 31% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. \u2047 This strong performance reflected our automotive team's excellent execution in the face of numerous supply chain challenges, as well as robust growth of our products used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. \u2047 This is another clear confirmation of our global team's long term efforts at designing in high voltage and other Interconnect and Sensor products into these next-generation platforms. \u2047 On a sequential basis, sales were flat compared to the second quarter. \u2047 The widely reported supply chain challenges in the auto industry continued to impact demand from vehicle manufacturers around the world. \u2047 Accordingly, we do expect in the fourth quarter, a high-single digit sequential moderation in sales. \u2047 For the full year 2021, this implies sales will increase by more than 40% compared to last year, driven by our expanded position in next generation electronics integrated into cars, including in particular, those electric and hybrid drivetrains. \u2047 I remain extremely proud of our team working in the automotive market, who has continued to demonstrate a high degree of agility and resiliency in both driving a significant recovery from last year as reduced sales levels, while also expertly navigating the myriad of supply chain challenges that the entire automotive industry is facing. \u2047 We look forward to benefiting from their efforts long into the future. \u2047 The mobile devices market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter and our sales in this market declined from prior year by 5% as modest growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and laptops was more than offset by declines in wearables and tablets. \u2047 Sequentially sales increased by a stronger than expected 36% driven by higher sales across virtually all product categories that we serve. \u2047 Looking into the fourth quarter, we expect a continued mid to high single-digit increase in sales from these third quarter levels, and for the full year, we anticipate sales to grow modestly from 2020, which is in fact an impressive achievement given last year's robust demand. \u2047 I remain very proud of our team working in the mobile devices market. \u2047 Their unique agility continues to enable the company to react quickly to changing demand in this most volatile of markets. \u2047 With our leading array of Antennas, Interconnect products and mechanisms enabling a broad range of next generation mobile devices, we're positioned well for the long term. \u2047 Turning to the mobile networks market, this market represented 5% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased by 11% from prior year and 7% organically. \u2047 And this sales growth was really driven by our sales to mobile service providers, which was offset by a small moderation of sales to OEMs. On a sequential basis, our sales increased just slightly, which was largely in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. \u2047 For the fourth quarter, we expect another slight sequential increase in sales as mobile networks customers continue to ramp up their investments in 5G and other next generation networks. \u2047 And for 2021, this would imply that our sales would grow by approximately 10%. \u2047 Our team continues to work aggressively in the mobile networks market to realize the benefits of our efforts to expand our position in next generation 5G equipment and networks around the world. \u2047 As our customers ramp up their investments into these advanced systems we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers. \u2047 The information technology and datacom market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. \u2047 Sales in this market rose from prior year by a very strong 28% in U.S. dollars and 26% organically. \u2047 This was driven by increased demand from OEMs, and in particular, increased demand from web service providers. \u2047 Sequentially our"],
