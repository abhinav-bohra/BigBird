{"article": ["Joining me on the call today are Arsen Kitch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Murphy, Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Please note slide two of our supplemental information covering forward looking statements. \u2047 On a consolidated basis, the company reported net sales for the first quarter of $426 million and adjusted EBITDA of $54 million. \u2047 If you highlights to mention our paperboard business continue to experience strong demand, particularly in our folding carton segment. \u2047 Based on that strong demand, we announced and began to implement price increases across our SBS product portfolio. \u2047 Our operations were affected by the February cold weather events in the south natural gas curtailments impacted production and increased energy prices. \u2047 Collectively, this negatively impacted our adjusted Eva da by approximately $6.5 million are tissue business are lower orders and shipments reflecting overall market trends. \u2047 IRI market data showed a nearly 20% decline in overall tissue dollar sales in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 As compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. \u2047 Consumers were destocking their pantries and retailers were working through elevated inventory levels. \u2047 With a decrease in demand, our production outpaced sales, resulting in above target inventory levels. \u2047 We're taking downtime on our assets to reduce and manage inventories, particularly with today's elevated pull prices. \u2047 With regards to our balance sheet, we use the free cash flows generated during the first quarter to reduce our net debt by $21 million. \u2047 We're experiencing significant cost inflation at a temporary decrease in tissue demand. \u2047 As noted over the previous quarters, we remain focused on our top priorities during COVID the health and safety of our people and safely operating our assets to serve as customers. \u2047 Our people's focus has been key to our success, and we will continue to be so in partnership with local health agencies we have offered on site COVID vaccinations across several of our facilities, and we're continuing to offer a $200 incentive to each employee to become vaccinated. \u2047 Let's discuss some additional details about both of our businesses. \u2047 As you recall, we estimate that approximately two thirds of paperboard demand is derived from products that are more recession resilient, and 1/3 is driven by more economically sensitive or discretionary products. \u2047 We continue to observe strengthened demand from our folding carton customers and are starting to see a recovering food service segments. \u2047 demand for food packaging products and retail paper plates has remained healthy throughout the pandemic. \u2047 We're also pleased with the market reception of our sustainability focus brands of New World Cup and reimagine folding carbon. \u2047 Both are playing a role in our favorable market position. \u2047 Our strong order book which predates Industry supply disruptions continues to be robust. \u2047 We are diligently working to implement the previously announced price increases. \u2047 fastmarkets Risi, a third party industry publication has recognized a $50 per ton increase in folding carton and a $20 per ton increase in food service grades and it's March and April publications. \u2047 During our fourth quarter earnings call, we noticed that the cold weather event in the style impacted operations at our side percent Arkansas. \u2047 This resulted in the $6.5 million direct impact to our adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 While there was while the weather event primarily impacted the first quarter, other potentially longer lasting impacts on input costs are included separately in our revised inflation expectations. \u2047 As you're aware, we scheduled our largest plant maintenance outage for 2021. \u2047 During the second quarter at our Lewiston, Idaho, we recently completed that work and are back up and running. \u2047 The overall economic impact on this outage store adjusted Eva dust in the second quarter is projected to be between 21 and $24 million as originally expected. \u2047 Our industry view remains largely the same, but I wanted to discuss the inventory overhang from 2020 and the expected temporary impact on volume in 2021. \u2047 The market for tissue in the US is traditionally two thirds at home and 1/3 away from home with around 10 million tons per year total demand. \u2047 As consumers spent more time at home in 2020, there was a shift toward at home consumption. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, we witnessed consumer pantry loading and retailers responding by placing higher orders with existing suppliers and seeking out tertiary suppliers, both both domestic and international to meet demand. \u2047 It is difficult to estimate the level of inventory overhang with consumers and customers as there is no third party data available for this metric. \u2047 Based on receipt, tissue ship and data for 2020 and some assumptions on consumption trends. \u2047 We estimate that the industry is currently faced with more than a month of excess inventory between consumers and retailers. \u2047 While it is difficult to predict the timing for the resolution of the inventory overhang, it is likely that both consumers and retailers are working through much of the excess inventory during the first and second quarters of this year. \u2047 We have entered a new phase of the pandemic with consumers starting to return to more normal lifestyles. \u2047 This may involve increased the weight from home consumption of tissue, and destocking and consumer pantries. \u2047 Based on IRI market data, consumer purchases of tissues slowed considerably in the first quarter, but have now started to recover to pre pandemic levels. \u2047 retailers have responded to these trends by managing down their higher inventory levels, reducing their orders to suppliers like us. \u2047 This is likely a temporary adjustment after a very robust 12 months of pandemic driven demand. \u2047 While the inventory adjustment is temporary, it may result in at home industry tissue shipments dropping to below 2019 levels in 2021. \u2047 With that said, we expect long term consumption growth to continue between one to 2% per year. \u2047 with private brands continuing to gain share. \u2047 Our tissue volume trends in the first quarter and heading into the second quarter appear to reflect these industry dynamics. \u2047 We sold 11 point 7 million cases in the first quarter, which was down around 23% and 16% compared to the first and fourth quarters of 2020 and down 5% relative to the first quarter of 2019 sales at 12 point 3 million cases. \u2047 We're continuing to closely monitor channel and customer trends to ensure that we're aligned with areas in the market with the highest growth prospects. \u2047 Let's turn to our production and inventory levels. \u2047 While we did take some acid downtime in the first quarter, our production exceeded sales and inventory levels increased. \u2047 We're taking more substantial substantial downtime in the second quarter to reduce inventory levels to get closer to our targets. \u2047 While this will have a negative impact on our fixed costs absorption will help us avoid producing excess inventory at today's elevated market poll prices as well as income Supply Chain costs. \u2047 As Mike and I discuss our outlook for the second quarter, we will go into some additional detail on actions that we're taking, as we face the normalization, tissue demand and significant cost inflation. \u2047 A consolidated company summary income statement shows first quarter as well as the first quarter of 2020. \u2047 In the first quarter, our net income was $12 million. \u2047 diluted net income per share was 71 cents per share, and adjusted income of 69 cents per share. \u2047 The corresponding segment results are on slide seven are pulp and paper board business was impacted by the weather event. \u2047 While consumer products are lower demand partly offset by the benefits from the Shelby expansion. \u2047 Before we speak in more detail about our divisional performance, I wanted to remind you of some of the changes that we started making last quarter and how we portray our financial purchase. \u2047 Previously, we had shown the impact of production volume changes and associated fixed costs leveraging impact in our cost category. \u2047 We have modified that approach and are including production volume changes in our volume category. \u2047 We believe that this change will enable investors to better understand sales changes as we expect to produce similar quantities of product that we sell, which will all be in the volume category. \u2047 In tissue production exceeded sales in the first quarter of 2021. \u2047 And the reverse was true in the first quarter of 2020, which complicates comparisons to prior periods. \u2047 The cost category will better reflect the changes in raw material input pricing and inflation. \u2047 This contract sheeting business as a service and distorts our sales price of our base paperboard products. \u2047 Additionally, as a reminder, we have moved our bale pulp sales to external customers back to the producing segment. \u2047 from Consumer Products Division to the pulp and paper work division. \u2047 We've also started transferring build post from our pulp and paper board division things will better reflect the economics associate accounting changes that taking effect with our first quarter 2021 report we found that retest numbers as part of our 8k associate with our fourth quarter earnings announcement, where we read past the prior three years as well as the past eight quarters. \u2047 Slide eight is a year over year adjusted even comparison for pulp and paper board business. \u2047 We are implementing the previously announced the price increases in our SPS business and are starting to see some of the benefits relative to a year ago and have a positive shift in our net. \u2047 Our sales and production volumes were slightly off due to the impact of the weather event in the south in February. \u2047 Our costs were elevated in part due to the weather events slightly offset by lower year over year input costs. \u2047 You can review a comparison of our first quarter of 2021 performance relative to fourth quarter 2020 performance on slide 14 in the appendix. \u2047 We continue to see the benefits of a positive mix shift due to our shelbie expansion and related commercial news. \u2047 Our sales have converted chronics in the first quarter or 11 point 7 million cases representing a unit decline of 23% versus prior year. \u2047 Our production of converted product in the quarter was 13 point 5 million cases or down 3% versus the prior year. \u2047 This mismatch in sales and production has led to increases in our inventory. \u2047 We've had several year over year cost as we've benefited from ramp and our shelving mill and realized benefits from the rationalization and from some lower input and freight costs. \u2047 You can review a comparison of our first quarter of 2021 performance relative to the fourth quarter of 2020 on slide 15 in the appendix. \u2047 We have also added finished good production and other financial data on a quarterly basis to slide 6510 outlines our capital structure. \u2047 we generated approximately 20,000,020 $1 million in free cash flow to reduce our net debt and our liquidity was 282 point 7 million at the end of the first quarter. \u2047 We continue to make strides in reducing our net debt and increasing our financial flexibility. \u2047 Over the past couple of years, we've worked on our financial flexibility so that we could be well positioned during times of uncertainty in our business. \u2047 We prioritize capital allocation, repaying debt and bolstering our liquidity and turning down our debt maturities to Since access to our abl facilities based loosely on accounts receivable, inventory levels and advanced rates, and our term loans covenant life, maintenance financial covenants do not present a material constraint on our financial flexibility. \u2047 The net result is that we believe that we have a stable financial structure with ample liquidity and a few years before we have any required principal payments. \u2047 Slide 11 provides a perspective on our second quarter outlook and some other key drivers for the full year 2021. \u2047 Our expectations assume that we continue to operate our assets without significant COVID related disruptions. \u2047 As previously discussed, demand visibility and tissue as well as inflation expectations have and will continue to be challenging and unpredictable for a while. \u2047 As we mentioned previously, our pulp and paper for business has been diligently working to implement the previously announced price increases. \u2047 We expect that the benefit of this will continue to be reflected in the next couple of quarters. \u2047 The planned major maintenance outage at Lewiston in April, which is included in our paperboard business is complete, and it's expected to impact earnings by 21 to $24 million. \u2047 Consistent with our initial expectations. \u2047 Tissue demand is expected to weaken further from the first quarter shipments of 11 point 7 million cases, as our shipments in April are at 3.1 million cases compared to a monthly average in the first quarter of 2021 a 3.9 million cases to address our elevated inventory levels, and expected lower demand from our customers in the short term. \u2047 We are materially reducing production flow anticipated shipments in the second quarter. \u2047 To put this into context. \u2047 The amount of quote unquote lack of ordered downtime in the second quarter of 2021 is expected to exceed 1/3 of our peak demonstrated production of 15 point 9 million cases in the second quarter of 2020. \u2047 The lack of fixed cost absorption and related expenses are expected to be meaningful period cost in the second quarter due to the magnitude of the downtime. \u2047 We started observing raw material price inflation in the first quarter and expected to expecting that to accelerate into the second quarter. \u2047 We estimate that the impact would be approximately 9 million to $30 million in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. \u2047 Due to tissue sales and production declines. \u2047 Second quarter out of its costs and higher inflation. \u2047 Our second quarter adjusted EBIT dot could be close to breakeven. \u2047 While we're not providing specific annual guidance for 2021 there are several drivers assumptions and variables that we'd like to update from our commentary during our fourth quarter call. \u2047 We're expecting continued positive impact from the previously announced SBS price increases. \u2047 And our paperport business plan major maintenance outage is expected reduce earnings for 2021 compared to 2020 by 25 to $30 million. \u2047 Similar to our previous guidance to the impact of the weather events in the south, we've decided to move the Cypress an outage from the fourth quarter into the third quarter. \u2047 We've updated this guidance on slide 20, where we broke out the timing by quarter which reflects our current plan and made a negative impact from the weather events in the first quarter of 2021 a 6.5 million. \u2047 Previously we spoke to our anticipated tissue buying declines of high single to low double digit percentages year over year. \u2047 Considering demand today, we're revising this assumption to mid double digit decline year over year for 2021 as the consumer and retailer pullback has been more significant than anticipated. \u2047 While demand forecasting continues to be challenging as the market works through the inventory overhang. \u2047 We believe these issues to be temporary nature. \u2047 By we're encouraged by our sales pipeline given the pull back and demand across channels than demand ramp from these wins will be delayed. \u2047 As customers are working through existing inventory in their supply chains with wider consumer demand. \u2047 We're expecting even higher input costs including pulp, packaging, energy and freight versus our previous expectations of 40 to 50 million or revised estimate based on our current assessment of the market to 65 to 75 million of inflation in 2021 versus 2020. \u2047 Polk continues to be the main driver. \u2047 We're taking various proactive measures to reduce costs, improve sales and manage inventories, which are some will address in his closing remarks. \u2047 For the full year 2021. \u2047 We're also anticipating the following expect interest expense. \u2047 As between 68 and 3536 and $38 million. \u2047 We continue to expect depreciation amortization to be between 106 and $"], "gold_summary": ["q1 revenue $426 million."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports first quarter 2021 net sales of $426 million.  \u2047  compname
