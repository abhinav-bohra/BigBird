{"article": ["Leading our quarterly earnings discussion today are Linn Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Kinzley, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \u2047 Although we believe that our expectations and beliefs are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ materially. \u2047 As we look back at 2020, I couldn't be prouder of what our team has accomplished. \u2047 Throughout an uncertain and disruptive year, I admired how the Black Hills Energy team rose to every challenge head-on. \u2047 I'm especially pleased how our team always kept their health and safety, and our customers' health and safety at the forefront, as we successfully executed in our customer-focused utility strategy, all while delivering strong financial performance that exceeded our guidance. \u2047 I believe, most of us will look back on 2020 as a year of seemingly endless challenge and yet as these challenges that prove the character and resilience of an organization and make us stronger. \u2047 Like those before us for the past 137 years at Black Hills, we adapted, we rallied together and we worked hard, truly exemplifying our ready-to-serve commitment and the incredible spirit within our team. \u2047 The Black Hills Energy team once again delivered a long list of accomplishments for our stakeholders throughout 2020. \u2047 Slides 4 through 6 highlight the success of consistently delivering on what we said we would do. \u2047 What I'd like to refer to as delivering a high say/do ratio. \u2047 Safety is our number one priority at Black Hills each and every day. \u2047 And is this priority and our genuine concern for our fellow coworkers, our customers and our communities that gave us a solid foundation upon which to confront the pandemic and build a stronger future. \u2047 For the seventh consecutive year, our safety culture produced an injury incident rate better than the utility average, demonstrating progress on our goal to become the safest utility in the industry. \u2047 Our team, combined with our resilient infrastructure, advanced our reputation of delivering industry-leading reliability for our customers. \u2047 As outages occurred, I was impressed throughout the year as my coworkers delivered a remarkable response, safely and efficiently restoring service with a ready-to-serve attitude and dedication. \u2047 We produced strong fourth quarter and full-year financial results as the economies in our Midwestern states continue to improve. \u2047 We are fortunate to operate and stable and growing territories where most of our communities remained open during the pandemic. \u2047 As we said we would, we have provided greater clarity into our longer-term earnings outlook. \u2047 We increased our 2021 guidance, we initiated 2022 guidance and we announced long-term earnings and dividend growth targets. \u2047 Rich will cover these targets in more detail during his comments. \u2047 I'm pleased that we successfully and safely executed on our customer-focused investment program. \u2047 Through solid planning and collaboration with contractors and suppliers, our team deployed $755 million in capital projects to further harden and modernize our energy systems. \u2047 These investments included our $79 million, 52.5-megawatt Corriedale wind project, which we constructed in our strong wind resource area near Cheyenne, Wyoming. \u2047 The project now serves customers in South Dakota and Wyoming through our innovative and voluntary customer subscription-based Renewable Ready program. \u2047 We also made terrific regulatory progress with the Nebraska and Wyoming commissions approving our consolidation applications and our rate reviews on constructive terms. \u2047 Both commissions approved our applications to consolidate multiple rate structures into a single statewide rate structure. \u2047 These approvals will help streamline our regulatory strategies in both states and provide efficiencies as we continuously improve how we serve and how we interact with our customers in those states. \u2047 In addition to receiving constructive revenue increases in both states, both states also approved riders to support our programmatic investment for safety and reliability. \u2047 Throughout the pandemic, we maintained our strong financial position and investment-grade credit ratings, executing upon our debt and equity financing needs on favorable terms during the year. \u2047 And our time tested staying power as a result of environmental, social and governance matters always being a core focus. \u2047 In 2020, we provide a greater transparency into our ESG profile and journey. \u2047 We published new qualitative and quantitative reports. \u2047 We issued an updated corporate sustainability report and we announced our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity. \u2047 For our electric operations, we are on track to achieve a 40% reduction by 2030 and a 70% reduction by 2040, off a 2005 baseline. \u2047 We are currently developing our integrated resource plans for South Dakota and Wyoming, which we will complete this summer and in next year for Colorado. \u2047 These resource plans will provide detail regarding how we will achieve these goals, including options for our current resources and potential investment opportunities to meet customer demand. \u2047 For our natural gas utilities, we expect to cut greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 50% by 2035. \u2047 Again, that's off of the 2005 baseline. \u2047 We have already cut our gas utility emissions by one-third since 2005. \u2047 Slide 7 shows that we plan to invest over $600 million annually during the next five years for a total of over $3 billion. \u2047 Our base forecast of over $2.7 billion represented by the orange bars relates to projects that are fully planned and in progress. \u2047 As incremental projects are more refined for timing, cost and other factors, we will add them to our base forecast. \u2047 Incremental projects we are working on include additional electric generation and transmission projects, gas pipeline projects and additional programmatic investment. \u2047 Slides 27 through 32 in the appendix provide additional details related to our capital investment plan. \u2047 In addition, our dedicated growth team is aggressively pursuing new growth opportunities. \u2047 We are powering data centers and technology growth within our service territories and with more people moving into our service territories, we are ready-to-serve our growing customer demand. \u2047 We are adding to our reputation of delivering innovative solutions, products and technologies, including the expansion of renewables and cleaner technologies, such as electric vehicles and renewable natural gas. \u2047 Across all of our business, we continue to focus on cost discipline, along with our better every day culture to drive greater efficiency and value through continuous improvement. \u2047 Looking forward, we are confident in our future. \u2047 We are well positioned as an integrated pure-play utility serving a strong and growing region and jurisdictions with constructive regulatory environments. \u2047 I'm excited to work alongside with our highly engaged team executing our proven strategy to continue delivering strong results for all of our stakeholders. \u2047 Just like all of you, we are hopeful for a brighter year ahead, especially for our families and friends whose lives were deeply affected by the virus. \u2047 While the pandemic remains a serious issue, our business fundamentals remain strong and we are applying what we learned in 2020 to become more efficient, more responsive and more technology enabled. \u2047 I'll start on Slide 11 where you can see we delivered an 8.8% increase in earnings per share as adjusted for the fourth quarter and a 5.7% increase for the full-year compared to 2019. \u2047 2020 Adjusted earnings per share of $3.73 came in just above the top end of our guidance. \u2047 Full-year earnings were driven by strong margin growth from returns on our invested capital, new customer growth, excellent cost management and tax credits. \u2047 These positive drivers overcame net COVID impacts and higher share count. \u2047 Net full-year COVID impacts of $0.07 were consistent with our forecast. \u2047 This includes net load impacts and net expenses associated with the pandemic, which are detailed on Slide 35 in the appendix. \u2047 Net weather impacts for the fourth quarter and the full-year were fairly nominal, which we estimate as $0.01 lower than normal in Q4 and $0.05 lower than Q4 2019. \u2047 For the full-year, weather was $0.03 higher than normal, but $0.03 lower than 2019. \u2047 Slides 12 and 13 contain waterfall charts illustrating the primary drivers of our earnings results comparing Q4 2019 to Q4 2020 and full-year 2019 to 2020, all the amounts on these charts are net of income taxes. \u2047 As you can see, both the quarter and full-year show strong growth in margins that are natural gas utilities when compared to 2019. \u2047 This was driven by new rates from our constructive regulatory outcomes in Wyoming and Nebraska and by riders across our service territories. \u2047 Customer growth across our service territories also contributed nicely to margin in 2020. \u2047 Our electric utilities and non-regulated margins also increased for the full-year. \u2047 O&M increased by only 1.5%[Phonetic] for the full-year and that's including the O&M we incurred relate to COVID. \u2047 We are pleased with our team's O&M control in 2020, it really was outstanding. \u2047 DD&A increased as a result of our strong capital investment program in 2019 and 2020. \u2047 Interest expense increased due to higher debt balances resulting from new debt issued to fund our capital investment program, partially offset by lower short-term borrowing rates. \u2047 Other income expense was favorable to the prior year, reflecting expensing of project development costs in the prior year, which was partially offset by higher current year pension plan cost driven by lower interest rates. \u2047 Our effective tax rate for 2020 was 11.9%, compared to 12.2% in 2019, driven by higher tax credits. \u2047 Slide 14 shows our financial position through the lens of capital structure, credit ratings and financial flexibility. \u2047 We are in excellent shape from a debt maturity and liquidity perspective. \u2047 We continue to maintain solid investment-grade credit ratings. \u2047 Last February, we issued $100 million of equity to help support our 2020 capital investments. \u2047 You will note, in our 2021 and 2022 guidance assumptions in the appendix, we expect to issue $100 million to $120 million in 2021 and $60 million to $80 million in 2022 through our at-the-market equity offering program to support our ongoing capital investment plans. \u2047 On the debt side, in June, we issued $400 million of 2.5% 10-year notes to term out our short-term debt, further enhancing our liquidity position. \u2047 This debt issuance was a great outcome and provides our customers low-cost debt for the next decade. \u2047 At year-end, we had $234 million outstanding on our credit facility with no material debt maturities until late 2023. \u2047 As of February, we continue to maintain over $500 million of available liquidity. \u2047 While debt-to-total capitalization remained in the 58% to 59% range through 2020, we are targeting a debt-to-total cap ratio in the mid-50s. \u2047 As Linn noted, we are providing greater clarity into our long-term earnings outlook as outlined on Slide 15. \u2047 We see opportunities to continue our strong cost management into 2021 and accordingly, increased our 2021 guidance to $3.80 to $4 per share, up $0.05 on each end[Phonetic]. \u2047 While issuing a second year of guidance is not our typical practice, we also provided 2022 guidance of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, which incorporates the new Wygen I contract starting January 1, 2022. \u2047 Our newly initiated 2022 guidance targets an approximate 5% earnings per share CAGR from 2019 to 2022. \u2047 Using 2022 as our base year, we expect to grow earnings per share in 2023 through 2025 at a 5% to 7% CAGR. \u2047 We are excited about our growth opportunities as we share this long-term earnings per share growth target. \u2047 Moving to our dividend on Slide 16. \u2047 In 2020, we proudly marked 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases, one of the longest track records in our industry. \u2047 Since 2016, we have increased our dividend at an average annual rate of 6.6%. \u2047 Looking forward, we anticipate increasing our dividend by more than 5% annually through 2025, while maintaining our 50% to 60% payout target. \u2047 We are uniquely positioned as a pure-play utility in constructive jurisdictions with a complementary business mix across stable and growing territories. \u2047 These factors paired with our strong and sustainable growth outlook, provide an attractive investment opportunity. \u2047 "],
