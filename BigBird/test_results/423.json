{"article": ["We have Scott Lauber, who's now our president and chief executive; Xia Liu, our chief financial officer; and Beth Straka, senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. \u2047 This exceeded the upper end of our most recent guidance, which was $4.07 a share. \u2047 Our positive results were driven by favorable weather, solid economic recovery in our region and our continued focus on operating efficiency. \u2047 Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. \u2047 And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. \u2047 I would also note that the earnings we're reporting today are quality earnings with no adjustments. \u2047 As you know, we've been very active in shaping the future of clean energy. \u2047 Looking back on 2021, we set some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions. \u2047 Across our generating fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, all from a 2005 baseline. \u2047 In fact, by the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial and our plan calls for a complete exit from coal by the year 2035. \u2047 Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on achieving net-zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. \u2047 Now we all recognize that advances in technology will be needed to decarbonize the economy by 2050. \u2047 And hydrogen, of course, could be a key player, a key part of the solution in the decades ahead. \u2047 To that end, we announced last week one of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States. \u2047 We're joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our newer natural gas-powered units located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. \u2047 The project will be carried out this year, and the results will be shared across the industry to demonstrate how the use of hydrogen could materially reduce carbon emissions. \u2047 Switching gears now, we're driving forward on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest five-year plan in the company's history. \u2047 The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability and growth. \u2047 One of the highlights is the planned investment in nearly 2,400 megawatts of renewable capacity over the next five years. \u2047 These renewable projects will serve the customers of our regulated utilities here in Wisconsin. \u2047 Overall, we expect the ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance. \u2047 In summary, we believe we're poised to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. \u2047 And now, let's take a brief look at the regional economy. \u2047 We saw a promising recovery throughout 2021 despite the prolonged pandemic. \u2047 The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate down at 2.8%; folks, that's a record low and more than a full percentage point below the national average. \u2047 Importantly, jobs in the manufacturing sectors across Wisconsin have returned to pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 And major economic development projects are moving full steam ahead. \u2047 HARIBO, the gummy bear company is now recruiting workers at its brand new campus in Pleasant Prairie. \u2047 Komatsu has begun relocating employees to its new state-of-the-art Milwaukee campus. \u2047 Milwaukee Tool's downtown office tower is set to begin operations this month, and we see more growth ahead. \u2047 For example, ABB, a global industrial and technology company; and Saputo, a leading dairy products company have announced plans for major expansions in our region. \u2047 And finally, you've heard the phrase: a rising tide lift all boats. \u2047 Well, I'm pleased to report that one of the most celebrated luxury boat makers in the world, Grand Craft Boats, is relocating its operations from Michigan to the Milwaukee region. \u2047 You know, J. Lo, George Clooney, Robert Redford, they're among the high-profile clients of Grand Craft. \u2047 So it will be interesting to see who shows up below deck at our next analyst day. \u2047 Bottom line, we remain optimistic about the strength of the regional economy and our outlook for long-term growth. \u2047 Looking back, we made significant progress in 2021. \u2047 I'll start by covering some developments in Wisconsin. \u2047 As Gale mentioned, we're continuing to make progress on the transition of our generation fleet and our ESG progress plan. \u2047 I am pleased to report that our Badger Hollow 1 Solar project is now providing energy to our customers. \u2047 You'll recall that we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin. \u2047 We have also made progress on the construction of Badger Hollow 2. \u2047 Currently, we expect an in-service date in the first quarter of 2023. \u2047 This factors in a delay of approximately three months due to ongoing supply chain constraints. \u2047 We do not expect a material change in the construction costs. \u2047 In addition, the Public Service Commission has approved our plans to build two liquified natural gas storage facilities in the southeastern part of the state. \u2047 Construction has started and we plan to bring the facilities into service in late 2023 and mid-2024. \u2047 We expect this project to save our customers approximately $200 million over time and help ensure reliability during Wisconsin's coldest winters. \u2047 And we recently signed our first contract for renewable natural gas or RNG, for our gas distribution business. \u2047 We'll be tapping into the output of one of our large local dairy farms. \u2047 The gas supplied each year will directly replace higher emission methane from natural gas that would have then entered our pipes. \u2047 This one contract alone represents 25% of our 2030 goal for methane reduction. \u2047 The Wisconsin-based company, U.S. Gain, is planning to have RNG flowing to our distribution network by the end of this year. \u2047 The commission also approved the development of Red Barn, a wind farm in Southwestern part of the state. \u2047 We expect our Wisconsin Public Service utility to invest approximately $150 million in this project and for it to qualify for production tax credits. \u2047 When complete, it will provide WPS with 82 megawatts of renewable capacity. \u2047 And just this past Monday, we filed an application with the commission for approval to acquire a portion of the capacity from West Riverside Energy Center. \u2047 West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. \u2047 If approved, Wisconsin Public Service would acquire 100 megawatts for approximately $91 million. \u2047 That's the first of two potential option exercises. \u2047 We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023. \u2047 Looking forward, we expect to file a rate review for our Wisconsin utilities by May. \u2047 We have no other rate cases planned at this time. \u2047 Turning now to our infrastructure segment. \u2047 The 190-megawatt Jayhawk Wind Farm located in Kansas, began service in December. \u2047 We invested approximately $300 million in this project. \u2047 Overall, we have brought six projects online in our infrastructure segment, representing more than 1,000 megawatts of capacity. \u2047 And as you'll recall, we expect the Thunderhead Wind Farm to come online for the second quarter and the Sapphire Sky by the end of this year. \u2047 Including these two projects, we plan to invest a total of $1.9 billion in this segment over the next five years, and we remain ahead of plan. \u2047 And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale. \u2047 We're confident that we can deliver our earnings guidance for 2022. \u2047 We're guiding, as you know, in a range of $4.29 a share to $4.33 a share. \u2047 The midpoint $4.31 represents growth of 7.5% from the midpoint of our original guidance last year. \u2047 And you may have seen the announcement that our board of directors, at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. \u2047 We believe this increase will rank in the top decile of our industry. \u2047 This also marks the 19th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. \u2047 We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. \u2047 We're right in the middle of that range now. \u2047 So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. \u2047 Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and our first quarter guidance. \u2047 Turning now to earnings. \u2047 Our 2021 results of $4.11 per share increased $0.32 or 8.4% compared to 2020. \u2047 Our earnings package includes a comparison of 2021 results on Page 17. \u2047 I'll walk through the significant drivers. \u2047 Starting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.10 compared to 2020. \u2047 First, weather added $0.04, mostly driven by colder winter weather conditions compared to 2020. \u2047 Second, continued economic recovery drove a $0.09 increase in earnings. \u2047 This reflected stronger weather-normalized electric sales, as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges. \u2047 Let me give you some highlights on our weather-normalized retail sales. \u2047 Overall, retail delivery of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.6% compared to 2020. \u2047 We saw a continued economic rebound in 2021 in our service territories. \u2047 Small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 4.4% from 2020, and large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 5.1%. \u2047 Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were relatively flat excluding gas used for power generation. \u2047 Lastly, rate relief and additional capital investment contributed $0.14 to earnings and lower day-to-day O&M drove a $0.03 improvement. \u2047 These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.17 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a net $0.03 reduction from fuel costs and other items. \u2047 Overall, we added $0.10 year over year from utility operations. \u2047 Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company decreased $0.02 per share year over year. \u2047 The positive impact of additional capital investment was more than offset by two factors: a 2020 fourth quarter that benefited 2020 earnings and an impairment that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2021 on an investment outside of the ATC service territory. \u2047 This substantially wrote off all of the goodwill on the project. \u2047 Earnings at our energy infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in 2021. \u2047 This was mostly related to production tax credit from the Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge wind farms. \u2047 Finally, we saw an $0.18 improvement in the corporate and other segment. \u2047 Lower interest expense contributed $0.07 year over year. \u2047 Also, we recognized a $0.04 gain from our investment in the fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development. \u2047 The remaining positive variance related to improved rabbi trust performance and some favorable tax and other items. \u2047 In summary, we improved on our 2020 earnings by $0.32 per share. \u2047 Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6. \u2047 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $163 million. \u2047 The increase in cash earnings was more than offset by working capital requirements, mostly related to higher natural gas prices. \u2047 As we resume normal collection practices in the spring, we expect working capital to improve throughout the year. \u2047 Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.4 billion in 2021. \u2047 This represents a $471 million decrease compared to 2020, due primarily to the timing of the in-service date of Thunderhead Wind Farm. \u2047 Turning now to financing activities. \u2047 We opportunistically refinanced over $450 million of holding company debt during the fourth quarter. \u2047 This reduced the average interest rate of these notes from 4.5% to 2.2%. \u2047 We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality. \u2047 Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contribution and the year-over-year increase in working capital, our FFO to debt was 15.7% in 2021. \u2047 Finally, let's look at our guidance for sales and earnings. \u2047 For weather-normalized sales in Wisconsin, we're expecting 0.5% growth this year in both our electric and natural gas businesses, continued growth after a very strong year. \u2047 In terms of 2022 earnings guidance, last year, we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter. \u2047 We project first quarter 2022 earnings to be in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.70 per share. \u2047 This forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. \u2047 And as Gale stated, for the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.29 to $4.33 per share. \u2047 Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. \u2047 Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call. \u2047 "], "gold_summary": ["wec energy group
