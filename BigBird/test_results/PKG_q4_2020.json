{"article": ["This is Mike Andrews, Associate General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of The Boston Beer Company. \u2047 I'm pleased to kick the 2021 third quarter earnings call for The Boston Beer Company. \u2047 Joining the call from Boston Beer are Jim Koch, Founder and Chairman; Dave Burwick, our CEO; and Frank Smalla, our CFO. \u2047 Before we discuss our business, I'll start with our disclaimer. \u2047 I will now pass it over to Jim for some introductory comments. \u2047 Our intent today is to provide some additional context around our third quarter earnings, discuss our views on trends, we see driving results at Boston Beer and in our industry and talk about how we see performance going forward. \u2047 After I discuss a few highlights from the third quarter, I'll hand it over to Dave who will provide an overview of our business. \u2047 Frank will then provide details of the third quarter financial results and how these results have been impacted by slower than anticipated hard seltzer growth, as well as our outlook for the remainder of 2021 and 2022. \u2047 Then I will share with you our longer term view of the business. \u2047 I'll begin with some context. \u2047 In measured off-premise channels year-to-date through October 10, where our brand portfolio represents only 4.4 of the total industry volume, we've delivered more than 41% of the total industry volume growth, the highest by far of all brewers. \u2047 Four of our five major brands are growing depletions and gaining share in off-premise measured channels over the last 13 weeks. \u2047 We have a broad portfolio of healthy brands which we will further build in 2022 to continue driving our growth. \u2047 Our success had been recognized by our most important customers, our distributors, who recently voted us the top beer supplier in 2021 in the latest Tamarron survey. \u2047 This is the 10th time in the last 12 years that our most important customers have recognized us as the top supplier in our industry. \u2047 But despite these ongoing strengths, we experienced very large unanticipated costs as the result anticipated costs as the result of the sudden unexpected slowing of growth in hard seltzer. \u2047 Based on our growth projections, we moved aggressively to build inventory to try to avoid the out of stocks that we experienced in 2019 and in 2020 and to secure capacity both short term and long term to be ready for growth through 2023. \u2047 Dave will share our perspective on the decisions that led to these unanticipated costs, and Frank will share a fuller accounting of them. \u2047 I'll now pass it over to Dave for a more detailed overview of our business. \u2047 Let me start by addressing where we are strategically, how we're viewing the future of the hard seltzer category, and how we plan to grow our portfolio going forward, even without high-double-digit hard seltzer category growth. \u2047 There's no question that hard seltzers have generated tremendous growth for the beer category over the last five years and will remain a very important beer industry segment in the future. \u2047 Hard seltzers are 11% of total beer dollars year-to-date, up from 9% during the same period in 2020. \u2047 Consumer metrics remain favorable. \u2047 Social media sentiment continues to trend positively. \u2047 And household penetration, frequency, and buy rate, all are increasing over the past 13 weeks. \u2047 Volume growth has slowed this year, but we continue to believe that hard seltzers can reach 15% to 20% of total beer dollars in the next five years. \u2047 We believe the ability to create alcoholic beverages from a beer base with the range and variety of flavors previously only available to mixed drinks, coupled with the convenience and portability of beer and beers tax and distribution levels will be a platform for long term growth for Boston Beer. \u2047 We've been playing to win and we've reaped many benefits. \u2047 So far this year, Truly has achieved the second highest household penetration in all of beer, behind only Bud Light beer and ahead of all its other hard seltzer and beer industry competitors. \u2047 Truly has generated 54% of all hard seltzer category growth so far in 2021, 2.3 times the next highest brand. \u2047 We've gained 23 share points against the Category Leader since January 2020. \u2047 We've led the category in innovation and brand building and outgrow beer category for 13 straight months. \u2047 We also believe the Truly is blazing its own path and not following the category of like so many other entries. \u2047 Thus, we believe we are well-positioned to succeed in the future when it will be much harder for new entrants to gain share. \u2047 We've created $1 billion dollar brand in only five years and we're confident we'll continue to grow it going forward. \u2047 Slowing hard seltzer category growth has certainly impacted our business. \u2047 Earlier in the year, we had expected the category to grow at over 70% and Truly to gain share. \u2047 The Truly brand did gain share but the category did not grow as we had expected. \u2047 Because of our higher demand projections earlier in the year and our commitment to avoid the out of stocks that we experienced during the summers of 2019 and 2020, we added significant capacity and pre-built inventories of cans and finished goods to levels that ended up exceeding actual needs as the category slow down. \u2047 As a result, we are currently faced with significant temporary costs as we adjust to the new category trends. \u2047 These cost impacts are reflected in our third quarter financials. \u2047 Building our capacity and inventory levels was an essential part of playing to win. \u2047 In that strategic context, we believe the risk of undersupply was bigger than that of oversupply. \u2047 So we resourced against a high growth scenario, securing supply constrained materials and capacity to gain market share in a highly competitive and fast-growing category. \u2047 Having said this, we've updated and evolved our own category growth model and believe the category could be flat to plus 10% growth in our most likely 2022 scenarios. \u2047 Clarity will probably not increase until we start to lap June and July 2021 when the category started to decelerate rapidly especially in the two year volumes stack which we look at closely. \u2047 Regardless of which scenarios proved most accurate, we fully intend to extend our streak of outgrowing the category throughout the year driven by innovation, continued brand building and superior retail execution and distributor support. \u2047 As Jim mentioned, we have a balanced portfolio of healthy, well-positioned brands. \u2047 As we look toward 2022 and beyond, our aim is to continue double digit depletions growth on the foundation of this portfolio, especially as consumers drink more Beyond Beer products. \u2047 We are the number two player in Beyond Beer with a 26% share driven by the number one FMB and Twisted Tea, the strong number two hard seltzer in Truly and the number one hard cider in Angry Orchard. \u2047 Twisted Tea has overcome this past summer supply chain issues and out of stocks. \u2047 It has grown 22% in the last 13 weeks and measured our premise channels. \u2047 Twisted Tea is the second fastest growing brand year to date among the top 25 in beer, while Truly remains number one in percentage and absolute volume growth. \u2047 We will have industry leading innovation again with Truly starting with a holiday party pack next month and followed by the January 2022 launch of Truly Margarita Style, which has received a terrific response and initial discussions with our distributor partners and retailers. \u2047 As Twisted Tea expands its consumer base, we're launching a new Twisted Tea Light with only 109 calories. \u2047 With our innovations go beyond Truly and Twisted Tea for 2022, we're introducing new brands the Bevy Long Drink, Salsa Agave Cocktails and Hard Mountain Dew. \u2047 We're also expanding our lineup of award winning Dogfish Head canned cocktails with new vodka and gin crush styles and we're launching a new tropical fruit extension for Angry Orchard in addition to adding an Angry Orchard Hard Core, an 8% ABV product. \u2047 Meanwhile, our Sam Adams, Your Cousin from Boston Campaign is paying dividends. \u2047 As Sam Adams grew double digits in the third quarter fueled by both on premise and off premise gains while also gaining share of craft in the off premise. \u2047 Now, I'll hand it over to Frank to discuss our third quarter financials as well as our outlook for 2021 and our initial thoughts on 2022. \u2047 Before I get into the financial review of our third quarter results and financial outlook, I'd like to provide more detail on the third quarter charges and other costs related to the hard seltzer slowdown. \u2047 As Dave explained, we strategically resource against the high side of our internal category growth and market share projections to ensure we would not be constrained in our efforts to build our share position in the hyper-growth hard seltzer category. \u2047 Resourcing against our high-side scenario included adding internal and external capacity, pre-building distributor and internal inventory ahead of the peak summer season, and securing tight supply materials such as cans and flavors. \u2047 This strategy enabled us to gain share in 2020 and 2021 in a supply constrained environment. \u2047 Following the rapid slowdown this summer, extra hard seltzer category growth fell below our internal low-side projections and resulted in excess capacity and higher-than-planned inventory levels of input materials and finished goods. \u2047 As a result, we have taken $102.4 million third quarter charge related to direct costs of the hard seltzer slowdown consisting of inventory obsolescence and destruction -- and related destruction costs of $54.3 million; contract termination costs, primarily for excess third-party contract production of $35.4 million; and equipment impairments of $12.7 million. \u2047 In addition, the third quarter results include indirect costs resulting from the slowing hard seltzer category growth of $30.6 million. \u2047 These costs include negative absorption impacts at company-owned breweries and downtime charges at third-party breweries of $11.4 million; increased raw material sourcing and warehousing costs of $11.8 million; and distributor return provisions for out of code or damaged products of $5.4 million; and other costs of $2 million. \u2047 The negative absorption impacts are the result of shipments lagging depletions to reduce distributor inventories to target levels and production lagging shipments to reduce internal inventory levels. \u2047 With this background and in the third quarter financial impact of the slowdown in hard seltzer, I will now turn to our overall third quarter results and our current outlook for full year 2021 and 2022. \u2047 For the third quarter, we reported a net loss of $58.4 million, a decrease of $139.2 million from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 Loss per diluted share was $4.76, a decrease of $11.27 per diluted share from the third quarter of 2020. \u2047 This decrease was due to the combined direct and indirect costs related to slowing hard seltzer category growth of $133 million or $7.73 per diluted share, net of the related tax benefit and high operating expenses, partially offset by increased net revenue. \u2047 Depletions for the quarter increased 11% from the prior year, reflecting increases in our Twisted Tea, Truly hard seltzer, Samuel Adams and Dogfish Head brands, partially offset by decreases in our Angry Orchard brand. \u2047 Shipment volume for the quarter was approximately 2.3 million barrels an 11.2% increase from the prior year, reflecting increase in our Twisted Tea, Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, partially offset by decreases in our Truly hard seltzer and Dogfish Head brand. \u2047 We believe distributor inventory as of September 25, 2021 average approximately six weeks on the hand and was at an appropriate level for each of our brands, except for Truly which had significantly higher than planned distributor inventory levels for certain styles and packages. \u2047 To address the slowing demand and continued volatility of future volume projections for Truly, we're working closely with our distributors to reduce Truly distributor inventory levels. \u2047 We adjust the production and shipments during the third quarter and expect to continue to do so during the remainder of the year. \u2047 Our third quarter gross margin of 30.7% decreased from 48.8% margin realized in the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to the $84.9 million direct and indirect volume adjustment costs as a result of slowing hard seltzer growth described and higher materials costs partially offset by price increases. \u2047 Advertising, promotional and selling expenses increased by $58.8 million or 54.4% from the third quarter of 2020, primarily due to increased brand investments of $37.6 million, mainly driven by a media production and local marketing costs, and increased freight to distributors of $21.2 million that was primarily due to higher rates and volumes. \u2047 Based on information of which we are currently aware, we're not targeting full-year 2021 earnings per diluted share of between $2 and $6. \u2047 However, actual results could vary significantly from this target. \u2047 This projection excludes the impact of ASU 2016-09 and is highly sensitive to changes in volume projections, particularly related to the hard seltzer category. \u2047 Full-year 2021 depletions growth is now estimated to be between 18% and 22%. \u2047 We project increases in revenue per barrel of between 2% and 3%. \u2047 Full-year 2021 gross margins are expected to be between 40% and 42%. \u2047 The gross margin impact related to the combined full-year direct and indirect costs of the hard seltzer slowdown is estimated at $132.6 million of which $95.8 million have been incurred in the first nine months and the remainder of $36.8 million estimated to be incurred in the fourth quarter. \u2047 Our full-year 2021 investments in advertising, promotional, and selling expenses are expected to increase between $80 million and $100 million. \u2047 This does not include any increases in freight costs for the shipment of products or distributors. \u2047 I will now turn to 2022. \u2047 We're in the process of completing our 2022 plan and will provide further guidance and present our full year 2021 results. \u2047 Based on information of which we are currently aware, we are using the following preliminary assumptions and targets for 2022 fiscal year which are highly sensitive to changes in volume projections, particularly related to the hard seltzer category. \u2047 We're targeting depletions and shipments percentage increases of between mid-single digits and low double digits. \u2047 We project increases in revenue per barrel of between 3% and 6%. \u2047 Full year 2022 to gross margins are expected to be between 45% and 48%. \u2047 We plan increased investment in advertising, promotion and selling expenses of between $10 million and $30 million for the full year 2022, not including any changes in freight costs for the shipment of products to our distributors. \u2047 We expected our cash balance of $86.5 million as of September 25, 2021 along with our future operating cash flow and unused line of credit of $150 million will be sufficient to fund future cash requirements. \u2047 Now, I'll hand it back to Jim for some closing remarks. \u2047 Remind us all, we have a tremendous track"], "gold_summary": ["compname reports q3 loss per share of $4.76.  \u2047  q3 loss per share $4.76."], "pred_summary": ["compname reports q3 earnings per share $4.76.  \u2047  q3 earnings per
