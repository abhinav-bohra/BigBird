{"article": ["By now, you have seen our announcement, and I think you would agree we had a great quarter. \u2047 Broad-based momentum drove significant improvement in key financial and performance metrics in this quarter. \u2047 Revenue grew more than 20% with double-digit gains in each business segment. \u2047 Lottery same-store sales rose 9% and were up 19% from the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating an improved underlying business growth profile. \u2047 Global Gaming revenues increased over 30% and the segment profit margin reached the highest level in seven quarters. \u2047 This was helped by our OPtiMa cost-saving program, which I'm pleased to report we completed during the quarter ahead of schedule. \u2047 We are now breaking out our digital and betting business, that will provide you with a more comprehensive view of those activities, which delivered the strongest growth in the quarter. \u2047 We recently announced some high-profile new hires underscoring our increased focus on the segment and willingness to invest in this fast emerging business. \u2047 We delivered a significant profit in the period. \u2047 Operating income was more than double than prior year's level. \u2047 Adjusted EBITDA of $407 million yielded a margin of 41%, which is among the strongest we have achieved. \u2047 Leverage improved to 3.8 times, the lowest level in the IGT PLC history and below the 4x threshold we have been targeting for some time. \u2047 On the heels of excellent year-to-date results and our solid financial condition, the board reinstated a quarterly cash dividend, signaling their confidence in the company's prospects. \u2047 It is an important milestone. \u2047 We are happy to be in the position of returning capital to shareholders. \u2047 Diving a bit deeper into Lottery. \u2047 Same-store sales were strongest in our main U.S. and Italy markets, both up double digits in the period. \u2047 Our lottery momentum remains strong with the same-store sales up over 50% compared to last year and more than three times Q3 '19 levels. \u2047 We recently won several new contracts, including a 10-year facilities management contract with the Connecticut Lottery, where IGT is displacing an incumbent. \u2047 We are excited to become their trusted growth partner with our suite of world-class lottery solutions. \u2047 We entered a seven-year agreement to upgrade FDJ's current lottery central system to IGT's advanced Aurora platform, featuring enhanced omnichannel capabilities. \u2047 This builds on our over 20 years partnership with the operator of the French National Lottery, the fourth largest in the world. \u2047 We also secured a new instant ticket service contract with WestLotto. \u2047 Germany is the largest lottery extending our 13-year partnership. \u2047 Our cloud-based eInstants platform, the first of its kind went live in Georgia during the quarter. \u2047 Building on that successful deployment, we intend to roll it out to our other high lottery customers over the next several months. \u2047 Our investments in digital are being recognized. \u2047 IGT's Mobile Lottery Solutions want Lottery Product of the Year at the 2021 International Gaming Awards. \u2047 It is a nice endorsement of our increased focus in this arena. \u2047 The year-over-year gains for our global gaming segment are impressive. \u2047 We also continue to see sequential improvement in many KPIs. \u2047 The global installed base were up, led by North American new and expansion activity and good progress with multilevel progressives. \u2047 Yields are also stronger. \u2047 On the product sales front, ASP were up nicely, helped by growing demand for our peak series of cabinets. \u2047 The improving KPIs are consistent with the overall recovery we are seeing in the market. \u2047 This, along with OPtiMa savings has driven substantial improvement in gaming profit margins. \u2047 Everyone was excited to be back at G2E this year. \u2047 While attendance wasn't that of previous[Inaudible] this year's attendees were serious in their intent and customer sentiment was quite good. \u2047 It was a productive show for us. \u2047 Among the key IGT highlights was the most robust offer of multilevel progressive we have ever showcased. \u2047 We had 18 in total at the show, a mix of both leased and for-sale games. \u2047 Haywire and Wolf Run Eclipse were among the most popular MLP titles at the show. \u2047 There was a lot of excitement around our new hardware. \u2047 We are expanding the high-performing peak family with a supersized Peak65 cabinet, launched in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the Wheel of Fortune's launch. \u2047 The new DiamondRS mechanical reel cabinet was another standout, and we expect will extend our leadership in the Stepper category. \u2047 And there was tremendous interest in cashless. \u2047 Our resort wallet and IGT cashless and payment solutions received a lot of positive feedback from potential customers. \u2047 IGT is unique and well positioned in this area. \u2047 We are the only company offering a fully integrated turnkey cashless solution. \u2047 It marries convenience and ease of use, one wallet, one account, one step. \u2047 The strength of our offer received important industry recognition, recently being named Product Innovation of the Year at the Global Gaming Awards in Las Vegas, and Technology Provider of the Year at the International Gaming Awards. \u2047 The creation of a stand-alone digital and betting segment will help you all appreciate the scale, growth profile, and attractive margin structure of the business. \u2047 We are already a leader in the B2B ecosystem, and that is reflected in the results with revenue up over 50% year to date and reaching a 32% adjusted EBITDA margin. \u2047 Margins should strengthen as the business gains scale even as we increase investments to support growth. \u2047 Success in iGaming comes down to content. \u2047 Our ability to leverage proven land-based titles in the digital space provides a competitive advantage. \u2047 We are seeing success -- we are seeing success with long-standing franchises such as Wheel of Fortune, along with the newer titles like Fortune Coin and, we are increasingly focused on developing digital native content to differentiate and enhance our leadership position. \u2047 We are also bolstering our offer with third-party content and recently signed a multiyear content distribution agreement with Yggdrasil, a leading creator of digital games. \u2047 Earlier this week, we announced Gil Rotem joining the company as president of iGaming. \u2047 In the nearly two decades of industry experience with 888.com and bet365, will help drive the strong growth we expect over the next several years. \u2047 We have an equally impressive new hire in sports betting, where we recently appointed Joe Asher, a long-standing industry veteran, as president of the business. \u2047 His knowledge of the market will be a great asset as we focus on rolling out our third key retail in digital solutions across the U.S. Outdoor is an important part of the turnkey retail offer and interest in our CrystalFlex sports betting terminal and PeakBarTop is strong. \u2047 Players can watch their favorite sports while easily placing sports wagers, enjoying the slots, playing video poker and Keno all on the same machine. \u2047 It provides a very rich player experience. \u2047 The CrystalFlex won top prize in the Best Consumer-Service Technology category at the GGB Gaming & Technology Awards. \u2047 With the strength of our year-to-date results, we are raising our product outlook. \u2047 Revenue, profit margins, cash flows and leverage are all expected to be better than pre-pandemic levels. \u2047 And with a compelling growth outlook across business segments, we are all-well positioned to create significant value for all stakeholders. \u2047 Our results would not be possible without the tremendous dedication of the IGT team and their superb focus on our core values. \u2047 We asked a lot of our people during the pandemic. \u2047 Now it is the time for us to recognize them. \u2047 We intend to provide a special bonus to employees not covered by existing incentive compensation plans who were impacted by furloughs and salary reductions last year. \u2047 This will amount to about 5% of the annual base salary for our -- sorry, workforce. \u2047 Sustainability, good corporate citizenship and ESG matters and have always been important to AGT. \u2047 And our efforts were recently recognized with a reduced interest rate on our term loan facilities. \u2047 And with today's news of restating a quarterly cash dividend, we are also giving back to shareholders. \u2047 This is an important signal of management and the Board's confidence in our financial condition and business outlook. \u2047 We look forward to expanding on our long-term outlook and providing additional insight into our capital allocation plans at the next week's investor day. \u2047 We delivered another strong quarter of financial results in Q3 as demand for our products and services drove revenue higher across all segments. \u2047 Operating income increased more than 140% year-on-year on high profit flow-through of global Lottery same-store sales growth, including a positive mix impact from Italy lottery sales and strong operating leverage across business segments, primarily associated with savings from the OPtiMa program. \u2047 A high-level summary of our key financial results as shown here on Slide 11. \u2047 The year-over-year comparisons on a quarterly and year-to-date basis highlight the outstanding resilience of our business. \u2047 Year-to-date, cash from operations increased 78% to more than $600 million and free cash flow more than tripled to $445 million. \u2047 Our quarter and year-to-date results have been impressive across several key financial metrics, driven by solid revenue growth as well as disciplined cost management including the achievement ahead of schedule of over $200 million in OPtiMa structural cost savings. \u2047 During the quarter, IGT delivered nearly $1 billion in revenue, over $200 million in operating income and more than $400 million in adjusted EBITDA. \u2047 On a year-to-date basis, revenue and profit grew significantly over prior year levels and exceeded pre-pandemic 2019 levels. \u2047 We achieved operating income and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24% and 43%, respectively, bolstered by higher operating leverage. \u2047 Now let's review the results of our business segments in detail. \u2047 Sustained strength in player demand drove global Lottery revenue up 14% to $652 million. \u2047 Global same-store sales increased 9% year-on-year and 19% compared to Q3 2019, with growth across many geographies and games. \u2047 Italy lotteries continue to benefit from strong demand, generating 16% same-store sales growth even after other gaming alternatives gradually return with the reopening of gaming halls at the end of the second quarter. \u2047 This was primarily fueled by increased instant ticket sales. \u2047 We also saw nice growth in iLottery revenue as a result of an expanding customer base. \u2047 Same-store sales grew a solid 8% in North America and the rest of the world, driven by continued momentum and the benefit of higher jackpot activity. \u2047 Instant ticket product sales revenue was also up nicely. \u2047 Strong same-store sales as well as the higher mix of Italy business will generate more revenue per wager led to margins well above the normal range. \u2047 Operating income increased 19% to $234 million, and adjusted EBITDA was 12% and to almost $350 million with a strong 53% adjusted EBITDA margin. \u2047 The progressive recovery continued during the quarter with Global Gaming delivering the highest quarterly revenue and profit levels since 2019. \u2047 Revenue rose 34% to $289 million, driven by solid increases in active units, yield, number of machine units sold and ASPs. \u2047 Terminal service revenue increased 44% on a higher number of active machines and growth in total yield. \u2047 The installed base in North America increased over 500 units sequentially, driven by North America new and expansion activity and additional placements of multiyear progressive units. \u2047 In the rest of world, the installed base was up over 400 units year-on-year and stable sequentially. \u2047 Currently, over 95% of our U.S. and Canada casino installed base is active with closures still impacting some cruise ships and capacity restrictions still limiting the number of active machines in Canada. \u2047 We sold around 5,700 units globally in the quarter compared to about 3,700 units in the prior year. \u2047 Unit shipments were driven primarily by strong replacement demand from casino and VLT customers. \u2047 Profitability measures were significantly higher in the quarter as revenue growth and savings realized from the OPtiMa structural cost savings program propelled higher operating leverage. \u2047 Today, we are reporting the results of Digital & Betting as a dedicated segment for the first time. \u2047 We decided to create a stand-alone segment, given the leadership positions we hold as a B2B provider in the market, and in an effort to provide greater visibility to this high-growth business. \u2047 Digital & Betting results were previously included as part of Global Gaming. \u2047 We recently filed recast historical financial information related to this resegmentation with the SEC, which you can find on the Investor Relations section of our website. \u2047 In the third quarter, revenue increased 37% year-on-year to $43 million, driven by double-digit increases across both iGaming and sports betting. \u2047 Growth in iGaming was primarily driven by expansion to new markets, including Michigan, Alberta, Finland, and Sweden, but also saw a nice contribution from existing customers in jurisdictions like New Jersey and Pennsylvania. \u2047 While sports betting was mainly bolstered by existing customers in the quarter, we are rapidly expanding our footprint with many new customers recently announced. \u2047 High flow through of revenue growth drove profitability significantly higher, with operating income doubling over the prior year to $12 million and adjusted EBITDA increasing 66% to $15 million. \u2047 The Digital & Betting segment delivered 36% EBITDA margins in the quarter bolstered by lower jackpot funding and the timing of marketing spend. \u2047 This is an impressive achievement from an emerging business. \u2047 We delivered $113 million in cash from operations and $66 million in free cash flow during the third quarter. \u2047 Cash flow in the quarter were impacted by the timing of collection cycles in Italy and higher cash outlays as working capital items returned to more normal levels. \u2047 Very strong year-to-date free cash flow of almost $450 million, coupled with approximately $900 million in net proceeds from the sale of our Italy gaming business has allowed us to reduce our net debt by over $1.2 billion this year. \u2047 We received EUR 100 million payment on the Italy asset sale during the quarter, ahead of the December 2021 to date. \u2047 As a reminder, the final payment of EUR 125 million is due in September 2022. \u2047 The leverage has improved to 3.8 times, well below pre-pandemic levels and exceeding our target of four times. \u2047 And as Marco mentioned, IGT board of directors has reinstated a $0.20 per share quarterly cash dividend to be paid in early December. \u2047 Our credit profile has greatly improved over the last year due to a significant reduction in net debt increased liquidity and extended debt maturities. \u2047 During the quarter, we successfully"], "gold_summary": ["raising 2021 operating income outlook on strong business trends.  \u2047  reinstatement of $0.20 per common share quarterly cash dividend.  \u2047  sees fy21 revenue from continuing operations of $4.1 billion.  \u2047  sees fy21 capital
